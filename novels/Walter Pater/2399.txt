imaginary portraits by walter pater th edition contents chapter i a prince of court painters chapter ii denys lauxerrois chapter iii sebastian van storck chapter iv duke carl of rosenmold chapter i a prince of court painters extracts from an old french journal valenciennes september they have been renovating my fathers large workroom that delightful tumbledown old place has lost its mossgrown tiles and the green weatherstains we have known all our lives on the high whitewashed wall opposite which we sit in the little sculptors yard for the coolness in summertime among old watteaus workpeople came his son the genius my fathers godson and namesake a darkhaired youth whose large unquiet eyes seemed perpetually wandering to the various drawings which lie exposed here my father will have it that he is a genius indeed and a painter born we have had our september fair in the grande place a wonderful stir of sound and colour in the wide open space beneath our windows and just where the crowd was busiest young antony was found hoisted into one of those empty niches of the old hotel de ville sketching the scene to the life but with a kind of gracea marvellous tact of omission as my father pointed out to us in dealing with the vulgar reality seen from ones own windowwhich has made trite old harlequin clown and columbine seem like people in some fairyland or like infinitely clever tragic actors who for the humour of the thing have put on motley for once and are able to throw a world of serious innuendo into their burlesque looks with a sort of comedy which shall be but tragedy seen from the other side he brought his sketch to our house today and i was present when my father questioned him and commended his work but the lad seemed not greatly pleased and left untasted the glass of old malaga which was offered to him his father will hear nothing of educating him as a painter yet he is not illtodo and has lately built himself a new stone house big and grey and cold their old plastered house with the black timbers in the rue des cardinaux was prettier dating from the time of the spaniards and one of the oldest in valenciennes october chiefly through the solicitations of my father old watteau has consented to place antony with a teacher of painting here i meet him betimes on the way to his lessons as i return from mass for he still works with the masons but making the most of late and early hours of every moment of liberty and then he has the feastdays of which there are so many in this oldfashioned place ah such gifts as his surely may once in a way make much industry seem worth while he makes a wonderful progress and yet far from being setup and too easily pleased with what after all comes to him so easily he has my father thinks too little selfapproval for ultimate success he is apt in truth to fall out too hastily with himself and what he produces yet here also there is the golden mean yes i could fancy myself offended by a sort of irony which sometimes crosses the halfmelancholy sweetness of manner habitual with him only that as i can see he treats himself to the same quality october antony watteau comes here often now it is the instinct of a natural fineness in him to escape when he can from that blank stone house with so little to interest and that homely old man and woman the rudeness of his home has turned his feeling for even the simpler graces of life into a physical want like hunger or thirst which might come to greed and methinks he perhaps overvalues these things still made as he is his hard fate in that rude place must needs touch one and then he profits by the experience of my father who has much knowledge in matters of art beyond his own art of sculpture and antony is not unwelcome to him in these last rainy weeks especially when he cant sketch out of doors when the wind only half dries the pavement before another torrent comes and people stay at home and the only sound from without is the creaking of a restless shutter on its hinges or the march across the place of those weary soldiers coming and going so interminably one hardly knows whether to or from battle with the english and the austrians from victory or defeatwell he has become like one of our family he will go far my father declares he would go far in the literal sense if he mightto paris to rome it must be admitted that our valenciennes is a quiet nay a sleepy place sleepier than ever since it became french and ceased to be so near the frontier the grass is growing deep on our old ramparts and it is pleasant to walk thereto walk there and muse pleasant for a tame unambitious soul such as mine december antony watteau left us for paris this morning it came upon us quite suddenly they amuse themselves in paris a scenepainter we have here well known in flanders has been engaged to work in one of the parisian playhouses and young watteau of whom he had some slight knowledge has departed in his company he doesnt know it was i who persuaded the scenepainter to take him that he would find the lad useful we offered him our little presentsfine threadlace of our own making for his ruffles and the like for one must make a figure in paris and he is slim and wellformed for myself i presented him with a silken purse i had long ago embroidered for another well we shall follow his fortunes of which i for one feel quite sure at a distance old watteau didnt know of his departure and has been here in great anger december twelve months today since antony went to paris the first struggle must be a sharp one for an unknown lad in that vast overcrowded place even if he be as clever as young antony watteau we may think however that he is on the way to his chosen end for he returns not home though in truth he tells those poor old people very little of himself the apprentices of the m metayer for whom he works labour all day long each at a single part onlycoiffure or robe or handof the cheap pictures of religion or fantasy he exposes for sale at a low price along the footways of the pont notredame antony is already the most skilful of them and seems to have been promoted of late to work on church pictures i like the thought of that he receives three livres a week for his pains and his soup daily may antony watteau has parted from the dealer in pictures a bon marche and works now with a painter of furniture pieces those headpieces for doors and the like now in fashion who is also concierge of the palace of the luxembourg antony is actually lodged somewhere in that grand place which contains the kings collection of the italian pictures he would so willingly copy its gardens also are magnificent with something as we understand from him altogether of a novel kind in their disposition and embellishment ah how i delight myself in fancy at least in those beautiful gardens freer and trimmed less stiffly than those of other royal houses methinks i see him there when his long summerdays work is over enjoying the cool shade of the stately broadfoliaged trees each of which is a great courtier though it has its way almost as if it belonged to that open and unbuilt country beyond over which the sun is sinking his thoughts however in the midst of all this are not wholly away from home if i may judge by the subject of a picture he hopes to sell for as much as sixty livresun depart de troupes soldiers departingone of those scenes of military life one can study so well here at valenciennes june young watteau has returned homeproof with a character so independent as his that things have gone well with him and it is agreed stays with us instead of in the stonemasons house the old people suppose he comes to us for the sake of my fathers instruction french people as we are become we are still old flemish if not at heart yet on the surface even in french flanders at douai and saint omer as i understand in the churches and in peoples houses as may be seen from the very streets there is noticeable a minute and scrupulous air of caretaking and neatness antony watteau remarks this more than ever on returning to valenciennes and savours greatly after his lodging in paris our flemish cleanliness lover as he is of distinction and elegance those worldly graces he seemed when a young lad to hunger and thirst for as though truly the mere adornments of life were its necessaries he already takes as if he had been always used to them and there is something nobleshall i sayin his halfdisdainful way of serving himself with what he still as i think secretly values overmuch there is an air of seemly thoughtle bel serieuxabout him which makes me think of one of those grave old dutch statesmen in their youth such as that famous william the silent and yet the effect of this first success of his of more importance than its mere money value as insuring for the future the full play of his natural powers i can trace like the bloom of a flower upon him and he has now and then the gaieties which from time to time surely must refresh all true artists however hardworking and painful july the charm of all thishis physiognomy and manner of beinghas touched even my young brother jeanbaptiste he is greatly taken with antony clings to him almost too attentively and will be nothing but a painter though my father would have trained him to follow his own profession it may do the child good he needs the expansion of some generous sympathy or sentiment in that close little soul of his as i have thought watching sometimes how his small face and hands are moved in sleep a child of ten who cares only to save and possess to hoard his tiny savings yet he is not otherwise selfish and loves us all with a warm heart just now it is the moments of antonys company he counts like a little miser well that may save him perhaps from developing a certain meanness of character i have sometimes feared for him august we returned home late this summer eveningantony watteau my father and sisters young jeanbaptiste and myselffrom an excursion to saintamand in celebration of antonys last day with us after visiting the great abbeychurch and its range of chapels with their costly encumbrance of carved shrines and golden reliquaries and funeral scutcheons in the coloured glass half seen through a rich enclosure of marble and brasswork we supped at the little inn in the forest antony looking well in his newfashioned longskirted coat and taller than he really is made us bring our cream and wild strawberries out of doors ranging ourselves according to his judgment for a hasty sketch in that big pocketbook he carries on the soft slope of one of those fresh spaces in the wood where the trees unclose a little while jeanbaptiste and my youngest sister danced a minuet on the grass to the notes of some strolling lutanist who had found us out he is visibly cheerful at the thought of his return to paris and became for a moment freer and more animated than i have ever yet seen him as he discoursed to us about the paintings of peter paul rubens in the church here his words as he spoke of them seemed full of a kind of rich sunset with some moving glory within it yet i like far better than any of these pictures of rubens a work of that old dutch master peter porbus which hangs though almost out of sight indeed in our church at home the patron saints simple and standing firmly on either side present two homely old people to our lady enthroned in the midst with the look and attitude of one for whom amid her glories depicted in dim little circular pictures set in the openings of a chaplet of pale flowers around her all feelings are over except a great pitifulness her robe of shadowy blue suits my eyes better far than the hot fleshtints of the medicean ladies of the great peter paul in spite of that amplitude and royal ease of action under their stiff court costumes at which antony watteau declares himself in dismay august i am just returned from early mass i lingered long after the office was ended watching pondering how in the world one could help a small bird which had flown into the church but could find no way out again i suspect it will remain there fluttering round and round distractedly far up under the arched roof till it dies exhausted i seem to have heard of a writer who likened mans life to a bird passing just once only on some winter night from window to window across a cheerfullylighted hall the bird taken captive by the illluck of a moment retracing its issueless circle till it expires within the close vaulting of that great stone churchhuman life may be like that bird too antony watteau returned to paris yesterday yescertainly great heights of achievement would seem to lie before him access to regions whither one may find it increasingly hard to follow him even in imagination and figure to ones self after what manner his life moves therein january antony watteau has competed for what is called the prix de rome desiring greatly to profit by the grand establishment founded at rome by lewis the fourteenth for the encouragement of french artists he obtained only the second place but does not renounce his desire to make the journey to italy could i save enough by careful economies for that purpose it might be conveyed to him in some indirect way that would not offend february we read with much pleasure for all of us in the gazette today among other events of the world that antony watteau had been elected to the academy of painting under the new title of peintre des fetes galantes and had been named also peintre du roi my brother jeanbaptiste ran to tell the news to old jeanphilippe and michelle watteau a new manner of painting the old furniture of peoples rooms must needs be changed throughout it would seem to accord with this painting or rather the painting is designed exclusively to suit one particular kind of apartment a manner of painting greatly prized as we understand by those parisian judges who have had the best opportunity of acquainting themselves with whatever is most enjoyable in the artssuch is the achievement of the young watteau he looks to receive more orders for his work than he will be able to execute he will certainly relishhe so elegant so hungry for the colours of lifea free intercourse with those wealthy lovers of the arts m de crozat m de julienne the abbe de la roque the count de caylus and m gersaint the famous dealer in pictures who are so anxious to lodge him in their fine hotels and to have him of their company at their country houses paris we hear has never been wealthier and more luxurious than now and the great ladies outbid each other to carry his work upon their very fans those vast fortunes however seem to change hands very rapidly and antonys new manner i am unable even to divine itto conceive the trick and effect of itat all only something of lightness and coquetry i discern there at variance methinks with his own singular gravity and even sadness of mien and mind more answerable to the stately apparelling of the age of henry the fourth or of lewis the thirteenth in these old sombre spanish houses of ours march we have all been very happyjeanbaptiste as if in a delightful dream antony watteau being consulted with regard to the lads training as a painter has most generously offered to receive him for his own pupil my father for some reason unknown to me seemed to hesitate the first but jeanbaptiste whose enthusiasm for antony visibly refines and beautifies his whole nature has won the necessary permission and this dear young brother will leave us tomorrow our regrets and his at his parting from us for the first time overtook our joy at his good fortune by surprise at the last moment as we were about to bid each other goodnight for a while there had seemed to be an uneasiness under our cheerful talk as if each one present were concealing something with an effort and it was jeanbaptiste himself who gave way at last and then we sat down again still together and allowed free play to what was in our hearts almost till morning my sisters weeping much i know better how to control myself in a few days that delightful new life will have begun for him and i have made him promise to write often to us with how small a part of my whole life shall i be really living at valenciennes january jeanphilippe watteau has received a letter from his son today old michelle watteau whose sight is failing though she still works half by touch indeed at her pillowlace was glad to hear me read the letter aloud more than once it recountshow modestly and almost as a matter of coursehis late successes and yetdoes he in writing to these old people purposely underrate his great good fortune and seeming happiness not to shock them too much by the contrast between the delicate enjoyments of the life he now leads among the wealthy and refined and that bald existence of theirs in his old home a life agitated exigent unsatisfying that is what this letter really discloses below so attractive a surface as his gift expands so does that incurable restlessness one supposed but the humour natural to a promising youth who had still everything to do and now the only realised enjoyment he has of all this might seem to be the thought of the independence it has purchased him so that he can escape from one lodgingplace to another just as it may please him he has already deserted somewhat incontinently more than one of those fine houses the liberal air of which he used so greatly to affect and which have so readily received him has he failed truly to grasp the fact of his great success and the rewards that lie before him at all events he seems after all not greatly to value that dainty world he is now privileged to enter and has certainly but little relish for his own worksthose works which i for one so thirst to see march we were alljeanphilippe michelle watteau and ourselveshalf in expectation of a visit from antony and today quite suddenly he is with us i was lingering after early mass this morning in the church of saint vaast it is good for me to be there our people lie under one of the great marble slabs before the jube some of the memorial brass balusters of which are engraved with their names and the dates of their decease the settle of carved oak which runs all round the wide nave is my fathers own work the quiet spaciousness of the place is itself like a meditation an act of recollection and clears away the confusions of the heart i suppose the heavy droning of the carillon had smothered the sound of his footsteps for on my turning round when i supposed myself alone antony watteau was standing near me constant observer as he is of the lights and shadows of things he visits places of this kind at odd times he has left jeanbaptiste at work in paris and will stay this time with the old people not at our house though he has spent the better part of today in my fathers workroom he hasnt yet put off in spite of all his late intercourse with the great world his distant and preoccupied mannera manner it is true the same to every one it is certainly not through pride in his success as some might fancy for he was thus always it is rather as if with all that success life and its daily social routine were somewhat of a burden to him april at last we shall understand something of that new style of histhe watteau styleso much relished by the fine people at paris he has taken it into his kind head to paint and decorate our chief salonthe room with the three long windows which occupies the first floor of the house the room was a landmark as we used to think an inviolable milestone and landmark of old valenciennes fashionthat sombre style indulging much in contrasts of black or deep brown with white which the spaniards left behind them here doubtless their eyes had found its shadows cool and pleasant when they shut themselves in from the cutting sunshine of their own country but in our country where we must needs economise not the shade but the sun its grandiosity weighs a little on ones spirits well the rough plaster we used to cover as well as might be with morsels of old figured arraswork is replaced by dainty panelling of wood with mimic columns and a quite aerial scrollwork around sunken spaces of a palerose stuff and certain oval openingstwo over the doors opening on each side of the great couch which faces the windows one over the chimneypiece and one above the buffet which forms its visavisfour spaces in all to be filled by and by with fantasies of the four seasons painted by his own hand he will send us from paris armchairs of a new pattern he has devised suitably covered and a clavecin our old silver candlesticks look well on the chimneypiece odd faintcoloured flowers fill coquettishly the little empty spaces here and there like ghosts of nosegays left by visitors long ago which paled thus sympathetically at the decease of their old owners for in spite of its newfashionedness all this array is really less like a new thing than the last surviving result of all the more lightsome adornments of past times only the very walls seem to cry outno to make delicate insinuation for a music a conversation nimbler than any we have known or are likely to find here for himself he converses well but very sparingly he assures us indeed that the new style is in truth a thing of old days of his own old days here in valenciennes when working long hours as a masons boy he in fancy reclothed the walls of this or that house he was employed in with this fairy arrangementitself like a piece of chambermusic methinks part answering to part while no too trenchant note is allowed to break through the delicate harmony of white and pale red and little golden touches yet it is all very comfortable also it must be confessed with an elegant open place for the fire instead of the big old stove of brown tiles the ancient heavy furniture of our grandparents goes up with difficulty into the garrets much against my fathers inclination to reconcile him to the change antony is painting his portrait in a vast perruque and with more vigorous massing of light and shadow than he is wont to permit himself june he has completed the ovalsthe four seasons oh the summerlike grace the freedom and softness of the summera hayfield such as we visited today but boundless and with touches of level italian architecture in the hot white elusive distance and wreaths of flowers fairy hayrakes and the like suspended from tree to tree with that wonderful lightness which is one of the charms of his work i can understand through this at last what it is he enjoys what he selects by preference from all that various world we pass our lives in i am struck by the purity of the room he has refashioned for usa sort of moral purity yet in the forms and colours of things is the actual life of paris to which he will soon return equally pure that it relishes this kind of thing so strongly only methinks tis a pity to incorporate so much of his work of himself with objects of use which must perish by use or disappear like our own old furniture with mere change of fashion july on the last day of antony watteaus visit we made a party to cambrai we entered the cathedral church it was the hour of vespers and it happened that monseigneur le prince de cambrai the author of telemaque was in his place in the choir he appears to be of great age assists but rarely at the offices of religion and is never to be seen in paris and antony had much desired to behold him certainly it was worth while to have come so far only to see him and hear him give his pontifical blessing in a voice feeble but of infinite sweetness and with an inexpressibly graceful movement of the hands a veritable grand seigneur his refined old age the impress of genius and honours even his disappointments concur with natural graces to make him seem too distinguished a fitter word fails me for this world omnia vanitas he seems to say yet with a profound resignation which makes the things we are most of us so fondly occupied with look petty enough omnia vanitas is that indeed the proper comment on our lives coming as it does in this case from one who might have made his own all that life has to bestow yet he was never to be seen at court and has lived here almost as an exile was our great king lewis jealous of a true grand seigneur or grand monarque by natural gift and the favour of heaven that he could not endure his presence july my own portrait remains unfinished at his sudden departure i sat for it in a walkingdress made under his directiona gown of a peculiar silken stuff falling into an abundance of small folds giving me a certain air of piquancy which pleases him but is far enough from my true self my old flemish faille which i shall always wear suits me better i notice that our goodhearted but sometimes difficult friend said little of our brother jeanbaptiste though he knows us so anxious on his accountspoke only of his constant industry cautiously and not altogether with satisfaction as if the sight of it wearied him september will antony ever accomplish that longpondered journey to italy for his own sake i should be glad he might yet it seems desolately far across those great hills and plains i remember how i formed a plan for providing him with a sum sufficient for the purpose but that he no longer needs with myself how to get through time becomes sometimes the questionunavoidably though it strikes me as a thing unspeakably sad in a life so short as ours the sullenness of a long wet day is yielding just now to an outburst of watery sunset which strikes from the far horizon of this quiet world of ours over fields and willowwoods upon the shifty weathervanes and longpointed windows of the tower on the squarefrom which the angelus is soundingwith a momentary promise of a fine night i prefer the salut at saint vaast the walk thither is a longer one and i have a fancy always that i may meet antony watteau there again any time just as when a child having found one day a tiny box in the shape of a silver coin for long afterwards i used to try every piece of money that came into my hands expecting it to open september we were sitting in the watteau chamber for the coolness this sultry evening a sudden gust of wind ruffled the lights in the sconces on the walls the distant rumblings which had continued all the afternoon broke out at last and through the driving rain a coach rattling across the place stops at our door in a moment jeanbaptiste is with us once again but with bitter tears in his eyesdismissed october jeanbaptiste he too rejected by antony it makes our friendship and fraternal sympathy closer and still as he labours not less sedulously than of old and still so full of loyalty to his old master in that watteau chamber i seem to see antony himself of whom jeanbaptiste dares not yet speakto come very near his work and understand his great parts so jeanbaptistes work in its nearness to his may stand for the future as the central interest of my life i bury myself in that february if i understand anything of these matters antony watteau paints that delicate life of paris so excellently with so much spirit partly because after all he looks down upon it or despises it to persuade myself of that is my womanly satisfaction for his preferencehis apparent preferencefor a world so different from mine those coquetries those vain and perishable graces can be rendered so perfectly only through an intimate understanding of them for him to understand must be to despise them while i think i know why he nevertheless undergoes their fascination hence that discontent with himself which keeps pace with his fame it would have been better for himhe would have enjoyed a purer and more real happinesshad he remained here obscure as it might have been better for me it is altogether different with jeanbaptiste he approaches that life and all its pretty nothingness from a level no higher than its own and beginning just where antony watteau leaves off in disdain produces a solid and veritable likeness of it and of its ways march there are points in his painting i apprehend this through his own persistently modest observations at which he works out his purpose more excellently than watteau of whom he has trusted himself to speak at last with a wonderful selfeffacement pointing out in each of his pictures for the rest so just and true how antony would have managed this or that and with what an easy superiority have done the thing betterdone the impossible february there are good things attractive things in life meant for one and not for anothernot meant perhaps for me as there are pretty clothes which are not suitable for every one i find a certain immobility of disposition in me to quicken or interfere with which is like physical pain he so brilliant petulant mobile i am better far beside jeanbaptistein contact with his quiet even labour and manner of being at first he did the work to which he had set himself sullenly but the mechanical labour of it has cleared his mind and temper at last as a sullen day turns quite clear and fine by imperceptible change with the earliest dawn he enters his workroom the watteau chamber where he remains at work all day the dark evenings he spends in industrious preparation with the crayon for the pictures he is to finish during the hours of daylight his toil is also his amusement he goes but rarely into the society whose manners he has to reproduce the animals in his pictures pet animals are mere toys he knows it but he finishes a large number of works doorheads clavecin cases and the like his happiest his most genial moments he puts like savings of fine gold into one particular picture true opus magnum as he hopes the swing he has the secret of surprising effects with a certain pearlgrey silken stuff of his predilection and it must be confessed that he paints handswhich a draughtsman of course should understand at least twice as well other peoplewith surpassing expression march is it the depressing result of this labour of a too exacting labour i know not but at times it is his one melancholy he expresses a strange apprehension of poverty of penury and mean surroundings in old age reminding me of that childish disposition to hoard which i noticed in him of old and theninglorious watteau as he isat times that steadiness in which he is so great a contrast to antony as it were accumulates changes into a ray of genius a grace an inexplicable touch of truth in which all his heaviness leaves him for a while and he actually goes beyond the master as himself protests to me yet modestly and still it is precisely at those moments that he feels most the difference between himself and antony watteau in that country all the pebbles are golden nuggets he says with perfect goodhumour june tis truly in a delightful abode that antony watteau is just now lodgedthe hotel or townhouse of m de crozat which is not only a comfortable dwellingplace but also a precious museum lucky people go far to see jeanbaptiste too has seen the place and describes it the antiquities beautiful curiosities of all sortsabove all the original drawings of those old masters antony so greatly admiresare arranged all around one there that the influence the genius of those things may imperceptibly play upon and enter into one and form what one does the house is situated near the rue richelieu but has a large garden bout it m de crozat gives his musical parties there and antony watteau has painted the walls of one of the apartments with the four seasons after the manner of ours but doubtless improved by second thoughts this beautiful place is now antonys home for a while the house has but one story with attics in the mansard roofs like those of a farmhouse in the country i fancy antony fled thither for a few moments from the visitors who weary him breathing the freshness of that dewy garden in the very midst of paris as for me i suffocate this summer afternoon in this pretty watteau chamber of ours where jeanbaptiste is at work so contentedly may in spite of all that happened jeanbaptiste has been looking forward to a visit to valenciennes which antony watteau had proposed to make he hopes alwayshas a patient hopethat antonys former patronage of him may be revived and now he is among us actually at his workrestless and disquieting meagre like a woman with some nervous malady is it pity then pity only one must feel for the brilliant one he has been criticising the work of jeanbaptiste who takes his judgments generously gratefully can it be that after all he despises and is no true lover of his own art and is but chilled by an enthusiasm for it in another such as that of jeanbaptiste as if jeanbaptiste overvalued it or as if some ignobleness or blunder some sign that he has really missed his aim started into sight from his work at the sound of praiseas if such praise could hardly be altogether sincere june and at last one has actual sight of his workwhat it is he has brought with him certain longcherished designs to finish here in quiet as he protests he has never finished before that charming noblessecan it be really so distinguished to the minutest point so naturally aristocratic half in masquerade playing the drawingroom or garden comedy of life these persons have upon them not less than the landscape he composes and among the accidents of which they group themselves with such a perfect fittingness a certain light we should seek for in vain upon anything real for their framework they have around them a veritable architecturea treearchitectureto which those mossgrown balusters termes statues fountains are really but accessories only as i gaze upon those windless afternoons i find myself always saying to myself involuntarily the evening will be a wet one the storm is always brooding through the massy splendour of the trees above those sundried glades or lawns where delicate children may be trusted thinly clad and the secular trees themselves will hardly outlast another generation july there has been an exhibition of his pictures in the hall of the academy of saint luke and all the world has been to see yes besides that unreal imaginary light upon these scenes these persons which is pure gift of his there was a light a poetry in those persons and things themselves close at hand we had not seen he has enabled us to see it we are so much the betteroff thereby and i for one the better the world he sets before us so engagingly has its care for purity its cleanly preferences in what one is to seein the outsides of thingsand there is something a sign a memento at the least of what makes life really valuable even in that there is my simple notion wholly womanly perhaps but which i may hold by of the purpose of the arts august and yet to read my mind my experience in somewhat different terms methinks antony watteau reproduces that gallant world those patched and powdered ladies and fine cavaliers so much to its own satisfaction partly because he despises it if this be a possible condition of excellent artistic production people talk of a new era now dawning upon the world of fraternity liberty humanity of a novel sort of social freedom in which mens natural goodness of heart will blossom at a thousand points hitherto repressed of wars disappearing from the world in an infinite benevolent ease of lifeyes perhaps of infinite littleness also and it is the outward manner of that which partly by anticipation and through pure intellectual power antony watteau has caught together with a flattering something of his own added thereto himself really of the old timethat serious old time which is passing away the impress of which he carries on his physiognomyhe dignifies by what in him is neither more nor less than a profound melancholy the essential insignificance of what he wills to touch in all that transforming its mere pettiness into grace it looks certainly very graceful fresh animated piquant as they love to sayyes and withal i repeat perfectly pure and may well congratulate itself on the loan of a fallacious grace not its own for in truth antony watteau is still the masons boy and deals with that world under a fascination of the nature of which he is halfconscious methinks puzzled at the queer trick he possesses to use his own phrase you see him growing ever more and more meagre as he goes through the world and its applause yet he reaches with wonderful sagacity the secret of an adjustment of colours a coiffure a toilette setting i know not what air of real superiority on such things he will never overcome his early training and these light things will possess for him always a kind of representative or borrowed worth as characterising that impossible or forbidden world which the masons boy saw through the closed gateways of the enchanted garden those trifling and petty graces the insignia to him of that nobler world of aspiration and idea even now that he is aware as i conceive of their true littleness bring back to him by the power of association all the old magical exhilaration of his dreamhis dream of a better world than the real one there is the formula as i apprehend of his successof his extraordinary hold on things so alien from himself and i think there is more real hilarity in my brothers fetes champetresmore truth to life and therefore less distinction yes the world profits by such reflection of its poor coarse self in one who renders all its caprices from the height of a corneille that is my way of making up to myself for the fact that i think his days too would have been really happier had he remained obscure at valenciennes september my own poor likeness begun so long ago still remains unfinished on the easel at his departure from valenciennesperhaps for ever since the old people departed this life in the hard winter of last year at no distant time from each other it is pleasanter to him to sketch and plan than to paint and finish and he is often out of humour with himself because he cannot project into a picture the life and spirit of his first thought with the crayon he would fain begin where that famous master gerard dow left off and snatch as it were with a single stroke what in him was the result of infinite patience it is the sign of this sort of promptitude that he values solely in the work of another to my thinking there is a kind of greed or grasping in that humour as if things were not to last very long and one must snatch opportunity and often he succeeds the old dutch painter cherished with a kind of piety his colours and pencils antony watteau on the contrary will hardly make any preparations for his work at all or even clean his palette in the deadset he makes at improvisation tis the contrast perhaps between the staid dutch genius and the petulant sparkling french temper of this new era into which he has thrown himself alas it is already apparent that the result also loses something of longevity of durabilitythe colours fading or changing from the first somewhat rapidly as jeanbaptiste notes tis true a mere trifle alters or produces the expression but then on the other hand in pictures the whole effect of which lies in a kind of harmony the treachery of a single colour must needs involve the failure of the whole to outlast the fleeting grace of those social conjunctions it is meant to perpetuate this is what has happened in part to that portrait on the easel meantime he has commanded jeanbaptiste to finish it and so it must be october antony watteau is an excellent judge of literature and i have been reading with infinite surprise in my afternoon walks in the little wood here a new book he left behind hima great favourite of his as it has been a favourite with large numbers in paris those pathetic shocks of fortune those sudden alternations of pleasure and remorse which must always lie among the very conditions of an irregular and guilty love as in sinful games of chancethey have begun to talk of these things in paris to amuse themselves with the spectacle of them set forth here in the story of poor manon lescautfor whom fidelity is impossible vulgarly eager for the money which can buy pleasures such as herswith an art like watteaus own for lightness and grace incapacity of truth yet with such tenderness such a gift of tears on the one side on the other a faith so absolute as to give to an illicit love almost the regularity of marriage and this is the book those fine ladies in watteaus conversations who look so exquisitely pure lay down on the cushion when the children run up to have their laces righted yet the pity of it what floods of weeping there is a tone about which strikes me as going well with the grace of these leafless birchtrees against the sky the pale silver of their bark and a certain delicate odour of decay which rises from the soil it is all one halflight and the heroine nay the hero himself also that dainty chevalier des grieux with all his fervour have i think but a halflife in them truly from the first and i could fancy myself almost of their condition sitting here alone this evening in which a premature touch of winter makes the world look but an inhospitable place of entertainment for ones spirit with so little genial warmth to hold it there one feels that the merest accident might detach that flighty guest altogether so chilled at heart things seem to me as i gaze on that glacial point in the motionless sky like some mortal spot whence death begins to creep over the body possibly written at this date but almost certainly not printed till many years laternote in second edition and yet in the midst of this by mere force of contrast comes back to me very vividly the true colour ruddy with blossom and fruit of the past summer among the streets and gardens of some of our old towns we visited when the thought of cold was a luxury and the earth dry enough to sleep on the summer was indeed a fine one and the whole country seemed bewitched a kind of infectious sentiment passed upon us like an efflux from its flowers and flowerlike architectureflowerlike to me at least but of which i never felt the beauty before and as i think of that certainly i have to confess that there is a wonderful reality about this lovers story an accordance between themselves and the conditions of things around them so deep as to make it seem that the course of their lives could hardly have been other than it was that impression comes perhaps wholly of the writers skill but at all events i must read the book no more june and he has allowed that mademoiselle rosalbace bel espritwho can discourse upon the arts like a master to paint his portrait has painted hers in return she holds a lapful of white roses with her two hands rosa albahimself has inscribed it it will be engraved to circulate and perpetuate it the better ones journal here in ones solitude is of service at least in this that it affords an escape for vain regrets angers impatience one puts this and that angry spasm into it and is delivered from it so and then it was at the desire of m de crozat that the thing was done one must oblige ones patrons the lady also they tell me is consumptive like antony himself and like to die and he who has always lacked either the money or the spirits to make that longpondered muchdesired journey to italy has found in her work the veritable accent and colour of those old venetian masters he would so willingly have studied under the sunshine of their own land alas how little peace have his great successes given him how little of that quietude of mind without which methinks one fails in true dignity of character november his thirst for change of place has actually driven him to england that veritable home of the consumptive ah me i feel it may be the finishing stroke to have run into the native country of consumption strange caprice of that desire to travel which he has really indulged so little in his lifeof the restlessness which they tell me is itself a symptom of this terrible disease january as once before after long silence a token has reached us a slight token that he remembersan etched plate one of very few he has executed with that old subject soldiers on the march and the weary soldier himself is returning once more to valenciennes on his way from england to paris february those sharplyarched brows those restless eyes which seem larger than eversomething that seizes on one and is almost terrible in his expressionspeak clearly and irresistibly set one on the thought of a summingup of his life i am reminded of the day when already with that air of seemly thought le bel serieux he was found sketching with so much truth to the inmost mind in them those picturesque mountebanks at the fair in the grande place and i find throughout his course of life something of the essential melancholy of the comedian he so fastidious and cold and who has never ventured the representation of passion does but amuse the gay world and is aware of that though certainly unamused himself all the while just now however he is finishing a very different picturethat too full of humouran english familygroup with a little girl riding a wooden horse the father and the mother holding his tobaccopipe stand in the centre march tomorrow he will depart finally and this evening the syndics of the academy of saint luke came with their scarves and banners to conduct their illustrious fellowcitizen by torchlight to supper in their guildhall where all their beautiful old corporation plate will be displayed the watteau salon was lighted up to receive them there is something in the payment of great honours to the living which fills one with apprehension especially when the recipient of them looks so like a dying man god have mercy on him april we were on the point of retiring to rest last evening when a messenger arrived posthaste with a letter on behalf of antony watteau desiring jeanbaptistes presence at paris we did not go to bed that night and my brother was on his way before daylight his heart full of a strange conflict of joy and apprehension may a letter at last from jeanbaptiste occupied with cares of all sorts at the bedside of the sufferer antony fancying that the air of the country might do him good the abbe haranger one of the canons of the church of saint germain lauxerrois where he was in the habit of hearing mass has lent him a house at nogentsurmarne there he receives a few visitors but in truth the places he once liked best the people nay the very friends have become to him nothing less than insupportable though he still dreams of change and would fain try his native air once more he is at work constantly upon his art but solely by way of a teacher instructing with a kind of remorseful diligence it would seem jeanbaptiste who will be heir to his unfinished work and take up many of his pictures where he has left them he seems now anxious for one thing only to give his old dismissed disciple what remains of himself and the last secrets of his genius his property livres onlygoes to his relations jeanbaptiste has found these last weeks immeasurably useful for the rest bodily exhaustion perhaps and this new interest in an old friend have brought him tranquillity at last a tranquillity in which he is much occupied with matters of religion ah it was ever so with me and one lives also most reasonably sowith women at least it is thus quite certainly yet i know not what there is of a pity which strikes deep at the thought of a man a while since so strong turning his face to the wall from the things which most occupy mens lives tis that homely but honest cure of nogent he has caricatured so often who attends him july our incomparable watteau is no more jeanbaptiste returned unexpectedly i heard his hasty footsteps on the stairs we turned together into that room and he told his story there antony watteau departed suddenly in the arms of m gersaint on one of the late hot days of july at the last moment he had been at work upon a crucifix for the good cure of nogent liking little the very rude one he possessed he died with all the sentiments of religion he has been a sick man all his life he was always a seeker after something in the world that is there in no satisfying measure or not at all chapter ii denys lauxerrois almost every people as we know has had its legend of a golden age and of its returnlegends which will hardly be forgotten however prosaic the world may become while man himself remains the aspiring never quite contented being he is and yet in truth since we are no longer children we might well question the advantage of the return to us of a condition of life in which by the nature of the case the values of things would so to speak lie wholly on their surfaces unless we could regain also the childish consciousness or rather unconsciousness in ourselves to take all that adroitly and with the appropriate lightness of heart the dream however has been left for the most part in the usual vagueness of dreams in their waking hours people have been too busy to furnish it forth with details what follows is a quaint legend with detail enough of such a return of a golden or poeticallygilded age a denizen of old greece itself actually finding his way back again among men as it happened in an ancient town of medieval france of the french town properly so called in which the products of successive ages not without lively touches of the present are blended together harmoniously with a beauty specifica beauty cisalpine and northern yet at the same time quite distinct from the massive german picturesque of ulm or freiburg or augsburg and of which turner has found the ideal in certain of his studies of the rivers of france a perfectly happy conjunction of river and town being of the essence of its physiognomythe town of auxerre is perhaps the most complete realisation to be found by the actual wanderer certainly for picturesque expression it is the most memorable of a distinguished group of three in these partsauxerre sens troyeseach gathered as if with deliberate aim at such effect about the central mass of a huge grey cathedral around troyes the natural picturesque is to be sought only in the rich almost coarse summer colouring of the champagne country of which the very tiles the plaster and brickwork of its tiny villages and great straggling villagelike farms have caught the warmth the cathedral visible far and wide over the fields seemingly of loose wildflowers itself a rich mixture of all the varieties of the pointed style down to the latest flamboyant may be noticed among the greater french churches for breadth of proportions internally and is famous for its almost unrivalled treasure of stained glass chiefly of a florid elaborate later type with much highly conscious artistic contrivance in design as well as in colour in one of the richest of its windows for instance certain lines of pearly white run hither and thither with delightful distant effect upon ruby and dark blue approaching nearer you find it to be a travellers window and those odd lines of white the long walkingstaves in the hands of abraham raphael the magi and the other saintly patrons of journeys the appropriate provincial character of the bourgeoisie of champagne is still to be seen it would appear among the citizens of troyes its streets for the most part in timber and pargeting present more than one unaltered specimen of the ancient hotel or townhouse with forecourt and garden in the rear and its more devout citizens would seem even in their churchbuilding to have sought chiefly to please the eyes of those occupied with mundane affairs and out of doors for they have finished with abundant outlay only the vast useless portals of their parish churches of surprising height and lightness in a kind of wildly elegant gothiconstilts giving to the streets of troyes a peculiar air of the grotesque as if in some quaint nightmare of the middle age at sens thirty miles away to the west a place of far graver aspect the name of jean cousin denotes a more chastened temper even in these sumptuous decorations here all is cool and composed with an almost english austerity the first growth of the pointed style in englandthe hard early english of canterburyis indeed the creation of william a master reared in the architectural school of sens and the severity of his taste might seem to have acted as a restraining power on all the subsequent changes of manner in this placechanges in themselves for the most part towards luxuriance in harmony with the atmosphere of its great church is the cleanly quiet of the town kept fresh by little channels of clear water circulating through its streets derivatives of the rapid vanne which falls just below into the yonne the yonne bending gracefully link after link through a neverending rustle of poplar trees beneath lowly vineclad hills with relics of delicate woodland here and there sometimes close at hand sometimes leaving an interval of broad meadow has all the lightsome characteristics of french riverside scenery on a smaller scale than usual and might pass for the childs fancy of a river like the rivers of the old miniaturepainters blue and full to a fair green margin one notices along its course a greater proportion than elsewhere of still untouched old seignorial residences larger or smaller the range of old gibbous towns along its banks expanding their gay quays upon the waterside have a common characterjoigny villeneuve juliendusaultyet tempt us to tarry at each and examine its relics old glass and the like of the renaissance or the middle age for the acquisition of real though minor lessons on the various arts which have left themselves a central monument at auxerreauxerre a slight ascent in the winding road and you have before you the prettiest town in francethe broad framework of vineyard sloping upwards gently to the horizon with distant white cottages inviting one to walk the quiet curve of river below with all the riverside details the three great purpletiled masses of saint germain saint pierre and the cathedral of saint etienne rising out of the crowded houses with more than the usual abruptness and irregularity of french building here that rare artist the susceptible painter of architecture if he understands the value alike of line and mass of broad masses and delicate lines has a subject made to his hand a veritable country of the vine it presents nevertheless an expression peaceful rather than radiant perfect type of that happy mean between northern earnestness and the luxury of the south for which we prize midland france its physiognomy is not quite happyattractive in part for its melancholy its most characteristic atmosphere is to be seen when the tide of light and distant cloud is travelling quickly over it when rain is not far off and every touch of art or of time on its old building is defined in clear grey a fine summer ripens its grapes into a valuable wine but in spite of that it seems always longing for a larger and more continuous allowance of the sunshine which is so much to its taste you might fancy something querulous or plaintive in that rustling movement of the vineleaves as bluefrocked jacques bonhomme finishes his days labour among them to beguile one such afternoon when the rain set in early and walking was impossible i found my way to the shop of an old dealer in bricabrac it was not a monotonous display after the manner of the parisian dealer of a stockintrade the like of which one has seen many times over but a discriminate collection of real curiosities one seemed to recognise a provincial school of taste in various relics of the housekeeping of the last century with many a gem of earlier times from the old churches and religious houses of the neighbourhood among them was a large and brilliant fragment of stained glass which might have come from the cathedral itself of the very finest quality in colour and design it presented a figure not exactly conformable to any recognised ecclesiastical type and it was clearly part of a series on my eager inquiry for the remainder the old man replied that no more of it was known but added that the priest of a neighbouring village was the possessor of an entire set of tapestries apparently intended for suspension in church and designed to portray the whole subject of which the figure in the stained glass was a portion next afternoon accordingly i repaired to the priests house in reality a little gothic building part perhaps of an ancient manorhouse close to the village church in the front garden flowergarden and potager in one the bees were busy among the autumn growthsmanycoloured asters bignonias scarletbeans and the oldfashioned parsonage flowers the courteous owner readily showed me his tapestries some of which hung on the walls of his parlour and staircase by way of a background for the display of the other curiosities of which he was a collector certainly those tapestries and the stained glass dealt with the same theme in both were the same musical instrumentspipes cymbals long reedlike trumpets the story indeed included the building of an organ just such an instrument only on a larger scale as was standing in the old priests library though almost soundless now whereas in certain of the woven pictures the hearers appear as if transported some of them shouting rapturously to the organ music a sort of mad vehemence prevails indeed throughout the delicate bewilderments of the whole seriesgiddy dances wild animals leaping above all perpetual wreathings of the vine connecting like some mazy arabesque the various presentations of one oftrepeated figure translated here out of the clearcoloured glass into the sadder somewhat opaque and earthen hues of the silken threads the figure was that of the organbuilder himself a flaxen and flowery creature sometimes wellnigh naked among the vineleaves sometimes muffled in skins against the cold sometimes in the dress of a monk but always with a strong impress of real character and incident from the veritable streets of auxerre what is it certainly notwithstanding its grace and wealth of graceful accessories a suffering tortured figure with all the regular beauty of a pagan god he has suffered after a manner of which we must suppose pagan gods incapable it was as if one of those fair triumphant beings had cast in his lot with the creatures of an age later than his own people of larger spiritual capacity and assuredly of a larger capacity for melancholy with this fancy in my mind by the help of certain notes which lay in the priests curious library upon the history of the works at the cathedral during the period of its finishing and in repeated examination of the old tapestried designs the story shaped itself at last towards the middle of the thirteenth century the cathedral of saint etienne was complete in its main outlines what remained was the building of the great tower and all that various labour of final decoration which it would take more than one generation to accomplish certain circumstances however not wholly explained led to a somewhat rapid finishing as it were out of hand yet with a marvellous fulness at once and grace of the result much has perished or been transferred elsewhere a portion is still visible in sumptuous relics of stained windows and above all in the reliefs which adorn the western portals very delicately carved in a fine firm stone from tonnerre of which time has only browned the surface and which for early mastery in art may be compared with the contemporary work of italy they come nearer than the art of that age was used to do to the expression of life with a feeling for reality in no ignoble form caught it might seem from the ardent and fullveined existence then current in these actual streets and houses just then auxerre had its turn in that political movement which broke out sympathetically first in one then in another of the towns of france turning their narrow feudal institutions into a free communistic lifea movement of which those great centres of popular devotion the french cathedrals are in many instances the monument closely connected always with the assertion of individual freedom alike in mind and manners at auxerre this political stir was associated also as cause or effect with the figure and character of a particular personage long remembered he was the very genius it would appear of that new free generous manner in art active and potent as a living creature as the most skilful of the band of carvers worked there one day with a labour he could never quite make equal to the vision within him a finelysculptured greek coffin of stone which had been made to serve for some later roman funeral was unearthed by the masons here it might seem the thing was indeed done and art achieved as far as regards those final graces and harmonies of execution which were precisely what lay beyond the hand of the medieval workman who for his part had largely at command a seriousness of conception lacking in the old greek within the coffin lay an object of a fresh and brilliant clearness among the ashes of the deada flask of lively green glass like a great emerald it might have been the wondrous vessel of the grail only this object seemed to bring back no ineffable purity but rather the riotous and earthy heat of old paganism itself coated within and as some were persuaded still redolent with the tawny sediment of the roman wine it had held so long ago it was set aside for use at the supper which was shortly to celebrate the completion of the masons work amid much talk of the great age of gold and some random expressions of hope that it might return again fine old wine of auxerre was sipped in small glasses from the precious flask as supper ended and whether or not the opening of the buried vessel had anything to do with it from that time a sort of golden age seemed indeed to be reigning there for a while and the triumphant completion of the great church was contemporary with a series of remarkable wine seasons the vintage of those years was long remembered fine and abundant wine was to be found stored up even in poor mens cottages while a new beauty a gaiety was abroad as all the conjoint arts branched out exuberantly in a reign of quiet delighted labour at the prompting as it seemed of the singular being who came suddenly and oddly to auxerre to be the centre of so pleasant a period though in truth he made but a sad ending a peculiar usage long perpetuated itself at auxerre on easter day the canons in the very centre of the great church played solemnly at ball vespers being sung instead of conducting the bishop to his palace they proceeded in order into the nave the people standing in two long rows to watch girding up their skirts a little way the whole body of clerics awaited their turn in silence while the captain of the singingboys cast the ball into the air as high as he might along the vaulted roof of the central aisle to be caught by any boy who could and tossed again with hand or foot till it passed on to the portly chanters the chaplains the canons themselves who finally played out the game with all the decorum of an ecclesiastical ceremony it was just then just as the canons took the ball to themselves so gravely that denysdenys lauxerrois as he was afterwards calledappeared for the first time leaping in among the timid children he made the thing really a game the boys played like boys the men almost like madmen and all with a delightful glee which became contagious first in the clerical body and then among the spectators the aged dean of the chapter protonotary of his holiness held up his purple skirt a little higher and stepping from the ranks with an amazing levity as if suddenly relieved of his burden of eighty years tossed the ball with his foot to the venerable capitular homilist equal to the occasion and then unable to stand inactive any longer the laity carried on the game among themselves with shouts of not too boisterous amusement the sport continuing till the flight of the ball could no longer be traced along the dusky aisles though the home of his childhood was but a humble oneone of those little cliffhouses cut out in the low chalky hillside such as are still to be found with inhabitants in certain districts of francethere were some who connected his birth with the story of a beautiful country girl who about eighteen years before had been taken from her own people not unwillingly for the pleasure of the count of auxerre she had wished indeed to see the great lord who had sought her privately in the glory of his own house but terrified by the strange splendours of her new abode and manner of life and the anger of the true wife she had fled suddenly from the place during the confusion of a violent storm and in her flight given birth prematurely to a child the child a singularly fair one was found alive but the mother dead by lightningstroke as it seemed not far from her lords chamberdoor under the shelter of a ruined ivyclad tower denys himself certainly was a joyous lad enough at the cliffside cottage nestling actually beneath the vineyards he came to be an unrivalled gardener and grown to manhood brought his produce to market keeping a stall in the great cathedral square for the sale of melons and pomegranates all manner of seeds and flowers omnia speciosa camporum honey also wax tapers sweetmeats hot from the fryingpan rough homemade pots and pans from the little pottery in the wood loaves baked by the aged woman in whose house he lived on that easter day he had entered the great church for the first time for the purpose of seeing the game and from the very first the women who saw him at his business or watering his plants in the cool of the evening idled for him the men who noticed the crowd of women at his stall and how even fresh young girls from the country seeing him for the first time always loitered there suspectedwho could tell what kind of powers hidden under the white veil of that youthful form and pausing to ponder the matter found themselves also fallen into the snare the sight of him made old people feel young again even the sage monk hermes devoted to study and experiment was unable to keep the fruitseller out of his mind and would fain have discovered the secret of his charm partly for the friendly purpose of explaining to the lad himself his perhaps more than natural gifts with a view to their profitable cultivation it was a period as older men took note of young men and their influence they took fire no one could quite explain how as if at his presence and asserted a wonderful amount of volition of insolence yet as if with the consent of their elders who would themselves sometimes lose their balance a little comically that revolution in the temper and manner of individuals concurred with the movement then on foot at auxerre as in other french towns for the liberation of the commune from its old feudal superiors denys they called frank among many other nicknames young lords prided themselves on saying that labour should have its ease and were almost prepared to take freedom plebeian freedom of course duly decorated at least with wildflowers for a bride for in truth denys at his stall was turning the grave slow movement of politic heads into a wild social license which for a while made life like a stageplay he first led those long processions through which by and by the little people the discontented the despairing would utter their minds one man engaged with another in talk in the marketplace a new influence came forth at the contact another and then another adhered at last a new spirit was abroad everywhere the hot nights were noisy with swarming troops of dishevelled women and youths with redstained limbs and faces carrying their lighted torches over the vineclad hills or rushing down the streets to the horror of timid watchers towards the cool spaces by the river a shrill music a laughter at all things was everywhere and the new spirit repaired even to church to take part in the novel offices of the feast of fools heads flung back in ecstasythe morning sleep among the vines when the fatigue of the night was overdewdrenched garmentsthe serf lying at his ease at last the artists then so numerous at the place caught what they could something at least of the richness the flexibility of the visible aspects of life from all this with them the life of seeming idleness to which denys was conducting the youth of auxerre so pleasantly counted but as the cultivation for their due service to man of delightful natural things and the powers of nature concurred it seemed there would be winter no more the planet mars drew nearer to the earth than usual hanging in the low sky like a fiery red lamp a massive but wellnigh lifeless vine on the wall of the cloister allowed to remain there only as a curiosity on account of its immense age in that great season as it was long after called clothed itself with fruit once more the culture of the grape greatly increased the sunlight fell for the first time on many a spot of deep woodland cleared for vinegrowing though denys a lover of trees was careful to leave a stately specimen of forest growth here and there when his troubles came one characteristic that had seemed most amiable in his prosperity was turned against hima fondness for oddly grown or even misshapen yet potentially happy children for odd animals also he sympathised with them all was skilful in healing their maladies saved the hare in the chase and sold his mantle to redeem a lamb from the butcher he taught the people not to be afraid of the strange ugly creatures which the light of the moving torches drew from their hidingplaces nor think it a bad omen that approached he tamed a veritable wolf to keep him company like a dog it was the first of many ambiguous circumstances about him from which in the minds of an increasing number of people a deep suspicion and hatred began to define itself the rich bestiary then compiling in the library of the great church became through his assistance nothing less than a garden of edenthe garden of eden grown wild the owl alone he abhorred a little later almost as if in revenge alone of all animals it clung to him haunting him persistently among the dusky stone towers when grown gentler than ever he dared not kill it he moved unhurt in the famous menagerie of the castle of which the common people were so much afraid and let out the lions themselves timid prisoners enough through the streets during the fair the incident suggested to the somewhat barren penmen of the day a morality adapted from the old pagan booksa stageplay in which the god of wine should return in triumph from the east in the cathedral square the pageant was presented amid an intolerable noise of every kind of pipemusic with denys in the chief part upon a gailypainted chariot in soft silken raiment and for headdress a strange elephantscalp with gilded tusks and that unrivalled fairness and freshness of aspecthow did he alone preserve it untouched through the wind and heat in truth it was not by magic as some said but by a natural simplicity in his living when that dark season of his troubles arrived he was heard begging querulously one wintry night give me wine meat dark wine and brown meatcome back to the rude door of his old home in the cliffside till that time the great vinedresser himself drank only water he had lived on springwater and fruit a lover of fertility in all its forms in what did but suggest it he was curious and penetrative concerning the habits of water and had the secret of the diviningrod long before it came he could detect the scent of rain from afar and would climb with delight to the great scaffolding on the unfinished tower to watch its coming over the thirsty vineland till it rattled on the great tiled roof of the church below and then throwing off his mantle allow it to bathe his limbs freely clinging firmly against the tempestuous wind among the carved imageries of dark stone it was on his sudden return after a long journey one of many inexplicable disappearances coming back changed somewhat that he ate flesh for the first time tearing the hot red morsels with his delicate fingers in a kind of wild greed he had fled to the south from the first forbidding days of a hard winter which came at last at the great seaport of marseilles he had trafficked with sailors from all parts of the world from arabia and india and bought their wares exposed now for sale to the wonder of all at the easter fairricher wines and incense than had been known in auxerre seeds of marvellous new flowers creatures wild and tame new pottery painted in raw gaudy tints the skins of animals meats fried with unheardof condiments his stall formed a strange unwonted patch of colour found suddenly displayed in the hot morning the artists were more delighted than ever and frequented his company in the little manorial habitation deserted long since by its owners and haunted so that the eyes of many looked evil upon it where he had taken up his abode attracted in the first instance by its rich though neglected garden a tangle of every kind of creeping vinelike plant here surrounded in abundance by the pleasant materials of his trade the vinedresser as it were turned pedant and kept school for the various artists who learned here an art supplementary to their ownthat gay magic namely art or trick of his existence till they found themselves grown into a kind of aristocracy like veritable gens fleurdelises as they worked together for the decoration of the great church and a hundred other places beside and yet a darkness had grown upon him the kind creature had lost something of his gentleness strange motiveless misdeeds had happened and at a loss for other causes not the envious only would fain have traced the blame to denys he was making the younger world mad would he make himself count of auxerre the lady ariane deserted by her former lover had looked kindly upon him was ready to make him soninlaw to the old count her father old and not long for this world the wise monk hermes bethought him of certain old readings in which the winegod whose part denys had played so well had his contrast his dark or antipathetic side was like a double creature of two natures difficult or impossible to harmonise and in truth the muchprized wine of auxerre has itself but a fugitive charm being apt to sicken and turn gross long before the bottle is empty however carefully sealed as it goes indeed at its best by hard names among those who grow it such as chainette and migraine a kind of degeneration of coarsenessthe coarseness of satiety and shapeless batteredout appetitewith an almost savage taste for carnivorous diet had come over the company a rumour went abroad of certain women who had drowned in mere wantonness their newborn babes a girl with child was found hanged by her own act in a dark cellar ah if denys also had not felt himself mad but when the guilt of a murder committed with a great vineaxe far out among the vineyards was attributed vaguely to him he could but wonder whether it had been indeed thus and the shadow of a fancied crime abode with him people turned against their favourite whose former charms must now be counted only as the fascinations of witchcraft it was as if the wine poured out for them had soured in the cup the golden age had indeed come back for a whilegolden was it or gilded only after all and they were too sick or at least too serious to carry through their parts in it the monk hermes was whimsically reminded of that afterthought in pagan poetry of a winegod who had been in hell denys certainly with all his flaxen fairness about him was manifestly a sufferer at first he thought of departing secretly to some other place alas his wits were too far gone for certainty of success in the attempt he feared to be brought back a prisoner those fat years were over it was a time of scarcity the working people might not eat and drink of the good things they had helped to store away tears rose in the eyes of needy children of old or weak people like children as they woke up again and again to sunless frostbound ruinous mornings and the little hungry creatures went prowling after scattered hedgenuts or dried vinetendrils mysterious dark rains prevailed throughout the summer the great offices of saint john were fumbled through in a sudden darkness of unseasonable storm which greatly damaged the carved ornaments of the church the bishop reading his midday mass by the light of the little candle at his book and then one night the night which seemed literally to have swallowed up the shortest day in the year a plot was contrived by certain persons to take denys as he went and kill him privately for a sorcerer he could hardly tell how he escaped and found himself safe in his earliest home the cottage in the cliffside with such a big fire as he delighted in burning upon the hearth they made a little feast as well as they could for the beautiful hunted creature with abundance of waxlights and at last the clergy bethought themselves of a remedy for this evil time the body of one of the patron saints had lain neglected somewhere under the flagstones of the sanctuary this must be piously exhumed and provided with a shrine worthy of it the goldsmiths the jewellers and lapidaries set diligently to work and no long time after the shrine like a little cathedral with portals and tower complete stood ready its chiselled gold framing panels of rock crystal on the great altar many bishops arrived with king lewis the saint himself accompanied by his mother to assist at the search for and disinterment of the sacred relics in their presence the bishop of auxerre with vestments of deep red in honour of the relics blessed the new shrine according to the office de benedictione capsarum pro reliquiis the pavement of the choir removed amid a surging sea of lugubrious chants all persons fasting discovered as if it had been a battlefield of mouldering human remains their odour rose plainly above the plentiful clouds of incense such as was used in the kings private chapel the search for the saint himself continued in vain all day and far into the night at last from a little narrow chest into which the remains had been almost crushed together the bishops redgloved hands drew the dwindled body shrunken inconceivably but still with every feature of the face traceable in a sudden oblique ray of ghastly dawn that shocking sight after a sharp fit as though a demon were going out of him as he rolled on the turf of the cloister to which he had fled alone from the suffocating church where the crowd still awaited the procession of the relics and the mass de reliquiis quae continentur in ecclesiis seemed indeed to have cured the madness of denys but certainly did not restore his gaiety he was left a subdued silent melancholy creature turning now with an odd revulsion of feeling to gloomy objects he picked out a ghastly shred from the common bones on the pavement to wear about his neck and in a little while found his way to the monks of saint germain who gladly received him into their workshop though secretly in fear of his foes the busy tribe of variously gifted artists labouring rapidly at the many works on hand for the final embellishment of the cathedral of st etienne made those conventual buildings just then cheerful enough to lighten a melancholy heavy even as that of our friend denys he took his place among the workmen a conventual novice a novice also as to whatever concerns any actual handicraft he could but compound sweet incense for the sanctuary and yet again by merely visible presence he made himself felt in all the varied exercise around him of those arts which address themselves first of all to sight unconsciously he defined a peculiar manner alike of feeling and expression to those skilful hands at work day by day with the chisel the pencil or the needle in many an enduring form of exquisite fancy in three successive phases or fashions might be traced especially in the carved work the humours he had determined there was first wild gaiety exuberant in a wreathing of lifelike imageries from which nothing really present in nature was excluded that as the soul of denys darkened had passed into obscure regions of the satiric the grotesque and coarse but from this time there was manifest with no loss of power or effect a wellassured seriousness somewhat jealous and exclusive not so much in the selection of the material on which the arts were to work as in the precise sort of expression that should be induced upon it it was as if the gay old pagan world had been blessed in some way with effects to be seen most clearly in the rich miniature work of the manuscripts of the capitular librarya marvellous ovid especially upon the pages of which those old loves and sorrows seemed to come to life again in medieval costume as denys in cowl now and with tonsured head leaned over the painter and led his work by a kind of visible sympathy often unspoken rather than by any formal comment above all there was a desire abroad to attain the instruments of a freer and more various sacred music than had been in use hithertoa music that might express the whole compass of souls now grown to manhood auxerre then as afterwards was famous for its liturgical music it was denys at last to whom the thought occurred of combining in a fuller tide of music all the instruments then in use like the winegod of old he had been a lover and patron especially of the music of the pipe in all its varieties here too there had been evident those three fashions or modesfirst the simple and pastoral the homely note of the pipe like the piping of the wind itself from off the distant fields then the wild savage din that had cost so much to quiet people and driven excitable people mad now he would compose all this to sweeter purposes and the building of the first organ became like the book of his life it expanded to the full compass of his nature in its sorrow and delight in long enjoyable days of wind and sun by the riverside the seemingly halfwitted brother sought and found the needful varieties of reed the carpenters under his instruction set up the great wooden passages for the thunder while the little pipes of pasteboard simulated the sound of the human voice singing to the victorious notes of the long metal trumpets at times this also as people heard night after night those wandering sounds seemed like the work of a madman though they awoke sometimes in wonder at snatches of a new an unmistakable new music it was the triumph of all the various modes of the power of the pipe tamed ruled united only on the painted shutters of the organcase apollo with his lyre in his hand as lord of the strings seemed to look askance on the music of the reed in all the jealousy with which he put marsyas to death so cruelly meantime the people even his enemies seemed to have forgotten him enemies in truth they still were ready to take his life should the opportunity come as he perceived when at last he ventured forth on a day of public ceremony the bishop was to pronounce a blessing upon the foundations of a new bridge designed to take the place of the ancient roman bridge which repaired in a thousand places had hitherto served for the chief passage of the yonne it was as if the disturbing of that timeworn masonry let out the dark spectres of departed times deep down at the core of the central pile a painful object was exposedthe skeleton of a child placed there alive it was rightly surmised in the superstitious belief that by way of vicarious substitution its death would secure the safety of all who should pass over there were some who found themselves with a little surprise looking round as if for a similar pledge of security in their new undertaking it was just then that denys was seen plainly standing in all essential features precisely as of old upon one of the great stones prepared for the foundation of the new building for a moment he felt the eyes of the people upon him full of that strange humour and with characteristic alertness after a rapid gaze over the grey city in its broad green framework of vineyards best seen from this spot flung himself down into the water and disappeared from view where the stream flowed most swiftly below a row of flourmills some indeed fancied they had seen him emerge again safely on the deck of one of the great boats loaded with grapes and wreathed triumphantly with flowers like a floating garden which were then bringing down the vintage from the country but generally the people believed their strange enemy now at last departed for ever denys in truth was at work again in peace at the cloister upon his house of reeds and pipes at times his fits came upon him again and when they came for his cure he would dig eagerly turned sexton now digging by choice graves for the dead in the various churchyards of the town there were those who had seen him thus employed that form seeming still to carry something of real sungold upon it peering into the darkness while his tears fell sometimes among the grim relics his mattock had disturbed in fact from the day of the exhumation of the body of the saint in the great church he had had a wonderful curiosity for such objects and one wintry day bethought him of removing the body of his mother from the unconsecrated ground in which it lay that he might bury it in the cloister near the spot where he was now used to work at twilight he came over the frozen snow as he passed through the stony barriers of the place the world around seemed curdled to the centreall but himself fighting his way across it turning now and then rightabout from the persistent wind which dealt so roughly with his blond hair and the purple mantle whirled about him the bones hastily gathered he placed awefully but without ceremony in a hollow space prepared secretly within the grave of another meantime the winds of his organ were ready to blow and with difficulty he obtained grace from the chapter for a trial of its powers on a notable public occasion as follows a singular guest was expected at auxerre in recompense for some service rendered to the chapter in times gone by the sire de chastellux had the hereditary dignity of a canon of the church on the day of his reception he presented himself at the entrance of the choir in surplice and amice worn over the military habit the old count of chastellux was lately dead and the heir had announced his coming according to custom to claim his ecclesiastical privilege there had been long feud between the houses of chastellux and auxerre but on this happy occasion an offer of peace came with a proposal for the hand of the lady ariane the goodly young man arrived and duly arrayed was received into his stall at vespers the bishop assisting it was then that the people heard the music of the organ rolling over them for the first time with various feelings of delight but the performer on and author of the instrument was forgotten in his work and there was no reinstatement of the former favourite the religious ceremony was followed by a civic festival in which auxerre welcomed its future lord the festival was to end at nightfall with a somewhat rude popular pageant in which the person of winter would be hunted blindfold through the streets it was the sequel to that earlier stageplay of the return from the east in which denys had been the central figure the old forgotten player saw his part before him and as if mechanically fell again into the chief place monks dress and all it might restore his popularity who could tell hastily he donned the ashengrey mantle the rough haircloth about the throat and went through the preliminary matter and it happened that a point of the haircloth scratched his lip deeply with a long trickling of blood upon the chin it was as if the sight of blood transported the spectators with a kind of mad rage and suddenly revealed to them the truth the pretended hunting of the unholy creature became a real one which brought out in rapid increase mens evil passions the soul of denys was already at rest as his body now borne along in front of the crowd was tossed hither and thither torn at last limb from limb the men stuck little shreds of his flesh or failing that of his torn raiment into their caps the women lending their long hairpins for the purpose the monk hermes sought in vain next day for any remains of the body of his friend only at nightfall the heart of denys was brought to him by a stranger still entire it must long since have mouldered into dust under the stone marked with a cross where he buried it in a dark corner of the cathedral aisle so the figure in the stained glass explained itself to me denys seemed to have been a real resident at auxerre on days of a certain atmosphere when the trace of the middle age comes out like old marks in the stones in rainy weather i seemed actually to have seen the tortured figure thereto have met denys lauxerrois in the streets chapter iii sebastian van storck it was a winterscene by adrian van de velde or by isaac van ostade all the delicate poetry together with all the delicate comfort of the frosty season was in the leafless branches turned to silver the furred dresses of the skaters the warmth of the redbrick house fronts under the gauze of white fog the gleams of pale sunlight on the cuirasses of the mounted soldiers as they receded into the distance sebastian van storck confessedly the most graceful performer in all that skating multitude moving in endless maze over the vast surface of the frozen watermeadow liked best this season of the year for its expression of a perfect impassivity or at least of a perfect repose the earth was or seemed to be at rest with a breathlessness of slumber which suited the young mans peculiar temper the heavy summer as it dried up the meadows now lying dead below the ice set free a crowded and competing world of life which while it gleamed very pleasantly russet and yellow for the painter albert cuyp seemed wellnigh to suffocate sebastian van storck yet with all his appreciation of the national winter sebastian was not altogether a hollander his mother of spanish descent and catholic had given a richness of tone and form to the healthy freshness of the dutch physiognomy apt to preserve its youthfulness of aspect far beyond the period of life usual with other peoples this mixed expression charmed the eye of isaac van ostade who had painted his portrait from a sketch taken at one of those skating parties with his plume of squirrels tail and fur muff in all the modest pleasantness of boyhood when he returned home lately from his studies at a place far inland at the proposal of his tutor to recover as the tutor suggested a certain loss of robustness something more than that cheerful indifference of early youth had passed away the learned man who held as was alleged the doctrines of a surprising new philosophy reluctant to disturb too early the fine intelligence of the pupil entrusted to him had found it perhaps a matter of honesty to send back to his parents one likely enough to catch from others any sort of theoretic light for the letter he wrote dwelt much on the lads intellectual fearlessness at present he had written he is influenced more by curiosity than by a care for truth according to the character of the young certainly he differs strikingly from his equals in age by his passion for a vigorous intellectual gymnastic such as the supine character of their minds renders distasteful to most young men but in which he shows a fearlessness that at times makes me fancy that his ultimate destination may be the military life for indeed the rigidly logical tendency of his mind always leads him out upon the practical dont misunderstand me at present he is strenuous only intellectually and has given no definite sign of preference as regards a vocation in life but he seems to me to be one practical in this sense that his theorems will shape life for him directly that he will always seek as a matter of course the effective equivalent tothe line of being which shall be the proper continuation ofhis line of thinking this intellectual rectitude or candour which to my mind has a kind of beauty in it has reacted upon myself i confess with a searching quality that searching quality indeed many others also people far from being intellectual had experiencedan agitation of mind in his neighbourhood oddly at variance with the composure of the young mans manner and surrounding so jealously preserved in the crowd of spectators at the skating whose eyes followed so wellsatisfied the movements of sebastian van storck were the mothers of marriageable daughters who presently became the suitors of this rich and distinguished youth introduced to them as now grown to mans estate by his delighted parents dutch aristocracy had put forth all its graces to become the winter morn and it was characteristic of the period that the artist tribe was there on a grand footingin waiting for the lights and shadows they liked best the artists were in truth an important body just then as a natural consequence of the nations hardwon prosperity helping it to a full consciousness of the genial yet delicate homeliness it loved for which it had fought so bravely and was ready at any moment to fight anew against man or the sea thomas de keyser who understood better than any one else the kind of quaint new atticism which had found its way into the world over those waste salt marshes wondering whether quite its finest type as he understood it could ever actually be seen there saw it at last in lively motion in the person of sebastian van storck and desired to paint his portrait a little to his surprise the young man declined the offer not graciously as was thought holland just then was reposing on its laurels after its long contest with spain in a short period of complete wellbeing before troubles of another kind should set in that a darker time might return again was clearly enough felt by sebastian the eldera time like that of william the silent with its insane civil animosities which would demand similarly energetic personalities and offer them similar opportunities and then it was part of his honest geniality of character to admire those who get on in the world himself had been almost from boyhood in contact with great affairs a member of the statesgeneral which had taken so hardly the kingly airs of frederick henry he had assisted at the congress of munster and figures conspicuously in terburghs picture of that assembly which had finally established holland as a firstrate power the heroism by which the national wellbeing had been achieved was still of recent memorythe air full of its reverberation and great movement there was a tradition to be maintained the sword by no means resting in its sheath the age was still fitted to evoke a generous ambition and this son from whose natural gifts there was so much to hope for might play his part at least as a diplomatist if the present quiet continued had not the learned man said that his natural disposition would lead him out always upon practice and in truth the memory of that silent hero had its fascination for the youth when about this time peter de keyser thomass brother unveiled at last his tomb of wrought bronze and marble in the nieuwe kerk at delft the young sebastian was one of a small company present and relished much the cold and abstract simplicity of the monument so conformable to the great abstract and unuttered force of the hero who slept beneath in complete contrast to all that is abstract or cold in art the home of sebastian the family mansion of the storcksa house the front of which still survives in one of those patient architectural pieces by jan van der heydewas in its minute and busy wellbeing like an epitome of holland itself with all the goodfortune of its thriving genius reflected quite spontaneously in the national taste the nation had learned to content itself with a religion which told little or not at all on the outsides of things but we may fancy that something of the religious spirit had gone according to the law of the transmutation of forces into the scrupulous care for cleanliness into the grave oldworld conservative beauty of dutch houses which meant that the life people maintained in them was normally affectionate and pure the most curious florists of holland were ambitious to supply the burgomaster van storck with the choicest products of their skill for the garden spread below the windows on either side of the portico and along the central avenue of hoary beeches which led to it naturally this house within a mile of the city of haarlem became a resort of the artists then mixing freely in great society giving and receiving hints as to the domestic picturesque creatures of leisureof leisure on both sidesthey were the appropriate complement of dutch prosperity as it was understood just then sebastian the elder could almost have wished his son to be one of them it was the next best thing to the being an influential publicist or statesman the dutch had just begun to see what a picture their country wasits canals and boompjis and endless broadlylighted meadows and thousands of miles of quaint waterside and their painters the first true masters of landscape for its own sake were further informing them in the matter they were bringing proof for all who cared to see of the wealth of colour there was all around them in this supposably sad land above all they developed the old lowcountry taste for interiors those innumerable genre piecesconversation music playwere in truth the equivalent of novelreading for that day its own actual life in its own proper circumstances reflected in various degrees of idealisation with no diminution of the sense of reality that is to say but with more and more purged and perfected delightfulness of interest themselves illustrating as every student of their history knows the goodfellowship of family life it was the ideal of that life which these artists depicted the ideal of home in a country where the preponderant interest of life after all could not well be out of doors of the earth earthygenuine red earth of the old adamit was an ideal very different from that which the sacred italian painters had evoked from the life of italy yet in its best types was not without a kind of natural religiousness and in the achievement of a type of beauty so national and vernacular the votaries of purely dutch art might well feel that the italianisers like berghem boll and jan weenix went so far afield in vain the fine organisation and acute intelligence of sebastian would have made him an effective connoisseur of the arts as he showed by the justice of his remarks in those assemblies of the artists which his father so much loved but in truth the arts were a matter he could but just tolerate why add by a forced and artificial production to the monotonous tide of competing fleeting existence only finding so much fine art actually about him he was compelled so to speak to adjust himself to it to ascertain and accept that in it which should least collide with or might even carry forward a little his own characteristic tendencies obviously somewhat jealous of his intellectual interests he loved inanimate nature it might have been thought better than man he cared nothing indeed for the warm sandbanks of wynants nor for those eerie relics of the ancient dutch woodland which survive in hobbema and ruysdael still less for the highlycoloured sceneries of the academic band at rome in spite of the escape they provide one into clear breadth of atmosphere for though sebastian van storck refused to travel he loved the distantenjoyed the sense of things seen from a distance carrying us as on wide wings of space itself far out of ones actual surrounding his preference in the matter of art was therefore for those prospects a vol doiseauof the caged bird on the wing at lastof which rubens had the secret and still more philip de koninck four of whose choicest works occupied the four walls of his chamber visionary escapes north south east and west into a wideopen though it must be confessed a somewhat sullen land for the fourth of them he had exchanged with his mother a marvellously vivid metsu lately bequeathed to him in which she herself was presented they were the sole ornaments he permitted himself from the midst of the busy and busylooking house crowded with the furniture and the pretty little toys of many generations a long passage led the rare visitor up a winding staircase and again at the end of a long passage he found himself as if shut off from the whole talkative dutch world and in the embrace of that wonderful quiet which is also possible in holland at its height all around him it was here that sebastian could yield himself with the only sort of love he had ever felt to the supremacy of his difficult thoughtsa kind of empty place here you felt all had been mentally put to rights by the workingout of a long equation which had zero is equal to zero for its result here one did and perhaps felt nothing one only thought of living creatures only birds came there freely the seabirds especially to attract and detain which there were all sorts of ingenious contrivances about the windows such as one may see in the cottage sceneries of jan steen and others there was something doubtless of his passion for distance in this welcoming of the creatures of the air an extreme simplicity in their manner of life was indeed characteristic of many a distinguished hollanderwilliam the silent baruch de spinosa the brothers de witt but the simplicity of sebastian van storck was something different from that and certainly nothing democratic his mother thought him like one disembarrassing himself carefully and little by little of all impediments habituating himself gradually to make shift with as little as possible in preparation for a long journey the burgomaster van storck entertained a party of friends consisting chiefly of his favourite artists one summer evening the guests were seen arriving on foot in the fine weather some of them accompanied by their wives and daughters against the light of the low sun falling red on the old trees of the avenue and the faces of those who advanced along itwillem van aelst expecting to find hints for a flowerportrait in the exotics which would decorate the banquetingroom gerard dow to feed his eye amid all that glittering luxury on the combat between candlelight and the last rays of the departing sun thomas de keyser to catch by stealth the likeness of sebastian the younger albert cuyp was there who developing the latent gold in rembrandt had brought into his native dordrecht a heavy wealth of sunshine as exotic as those flowers or the eastern carpets on the burgomasters tables with hooch the indoor cuyp and willem van de velde who painted those shorepieces with gay ships of war such as he loved for his patrons cabinet thomas de keyser came in company with his brother peter his niece and young mr nicholas stone from england pupil of that brother peter who afterwards married the niece for the life of dutch artists too was exemplary in matters of domestic relationship its history telling many a cheering story of mutual faith in misfortune hardly less exemplary was the comradeship which they displayed among themselves obscuring their own best gifts sometimes one in the mere accessories of another mans work so that they came together tonight with no fear of falling out and spoiling the musical interludes of madame van storck in the large back parlour a little way behind the other guests three of them together son grandson and the grandfather moving slowly came the hondecoetersgiles gybrecht and melchior they led the party before the house was entered by fading light to see the curious poultry of the burgomaster go to roost and it was almost night when the supperroom was reached at last the occasion was an important one to sebastian and to others through him for was it the music of the duets he asked himself next morning with a certain distaste as he remembered it all or the heady spanish wines poured out so freely in those narrow but deep venetian glasses on this evening he approached more nearly than he had ever yet done to mademoiselle van westrheene as she sat there beside the clavecin looking very ruddy and fresh in her white satin trimmed with glossy crimson swansdown so genially attempered so warm was life become in the land of which pliny had spoken as scarcely dry land at all and in truth the sea which sebastian so much loved and with so great a satisfaction and sense of wellbeing in every hint of its nearness is never far distant in holland invading all places stealing under ones feet insinuating itself everywhere along an endless network of canals by no means such formal channels as we understand by the name but picturesque rivers with sedgy banks and haunted by innumerable birds its incidents present themselves oddly even in ones park or woodland walks the ship in full sail appearing suddenly among the great trees or above the garden wall where we had no suspicion of the presence of water in the very conditions of life in such a country there was a standing force of pathos the country itself shared the uncertainty of the individual human life and there was pathos also in the constantly renewed heavilytaxed labour necessary to keep the native soil fought for so unselfishly there at all with a warfare that must still be maintained when that other struggle with the spaniard was over but though sebastian liked to breathe so nearly the sea and its influences those were considerations he scarcely entertained in his passion for schwindsuchtwe havent the wordhe found it pleasant to think of the resistless element which left one hardly a footspace amidst the yielding sand of the old beds of lost rivers surviving now only as deeper channels in the sea of the remains of a certain ancient town which within mens memory had lost its few remaining inhabitants and with its already empty tombs dissolved and disappeared in the flood it happened on occasion of an exceptionally low tide that some remarkable relics were exposed to view on the coast of the island of vleeland a countrymans waggon overtaken by the tide as he returned with merchandise from the shore you might have supposed but for a touch of grace in the construction of the thinglightly wrought timberwork united and adorned by a multitude of brass fastenings like the work of children for their simplicity while the rude stiff chair or throne set upon it seemed to distinguish it as a chariot of state to some antiquarians it told the story of the overwhelming of one of the chiefs of the old primeval people of holland amid all his gala array in a great storm but it was another view which sebastian preferred that this object was sepulchral namely in its motivethe one surviving relic of a grand burial in the ancient manner of a king or hero whose very tomb was wasted awaysunt metis metae there came with it the odd fancy that he himself would like to have been dead and gone as long ago with a kind of envy of those whose deceasing was so long since over on more peaceful days he would ponder plinys account of those primeval forefathers but without plinys contempt for them a cloyed roman might despise their humble existence fixed by necessity from age to age and with no desire of change as the ocean poured in its flood twice a day making it uncertain whether the country was a part of the continent or of the sea but for his part sebastian found something of poetry in all that as he conceived what thoughts the old hollander might have had at his fishing with nets themselves woven of seaweed waiting carefully for his drink on the heavy rains and taking refuge as the flood rose on the sandhills in a little hut constructed but airily on tall stakes conformable to the elevation of the highest tides like a navigator thought the learned writer when the sea was risen like a shipwrecked mariner when it was retired for the fancy of sebastian he lived with great breadths of calm light above and around him influenced by and in a sense living upon them and surely might well complain though to plinys so infinite surprise on being made a roman citizen and certainly sebastian van storck did not felicitate his people on the luck which in the words of another old writer hath disposed them to so thriving a genius their restless ingenuity in making and maintaining dry land where nature had willed the sea was even more like the industry of animals than had been that life of their forefathers away with that tetchy feverish unworthy agitation with this and that all too importunate motive of interest and then my son said his father be stimulated to action he too thinking of that heroic industry which had triumphed over nature precisely where the contest had been most difficult yet in truth sebastian was forcibly taken by the simplicity of a great affection as set forth in an incident of real life of which he heard just then the eminent grotius being condemned to perpetual imprisonment his wife determined to share his fate alleviated only by the reading of books sent by friends the books finished were returned in a great chest in this chest the wife enclosed the husband and was able to reply to the objections of the soldiers who carried it complaining of its weight with a selfcontrol which she maintained till the captive was in safety herself remaining to face the consequences and there was a kind of absoluteness of affection in that which attracted sebastian for a while to ponder on the practical forces which shape mens lives had he turned indeed to a practical career it would have been less in the direction of the military or political life than of another form of enterprise popular with his countrymen in the eager gallant life of that age if the sword fell for a moment into its sheath they were for starting off on perilous voyages to the regions of frost and snow in search after that northwestern passage for the discovery of which the statesgeneral had offered large rewards sebastian in effect found a charm in the thought of that still drowsy spellbound world of perpetual ice as in art and life he could always tolerate the sea admiralgeneral of holland as painted by van der helst with a marine background by backhuizenat moments his father could fancy him so there was still another very different sort of character to which sebastian would let his thoughts stray without check for a time his mother whom he much resembled outwardly a catholic from brabant had had saints in her family and from time to time the mind of sebastian had been occupied on the subject of monastic life its quiet its negation the portrait of a certain carthusian prior which like the famous statue of saint bruno the first carthusian in the church of santa maria degli angeli at rome could it have spoken would have said silence kept strange company with the painted visages of men of affairs a great theological strife was then raging in holland grave ministers of religion assembled sometimes as in the painted scene by rembrandt in the burgomasters house and once not however in their company came a renowned young jewish divine baruch de spinosa with whom most unexpectedly sebastian found himself in sympathy meeting the young jews farreaching thoughts halfway to the confirmation of his own and he did not know that his visitor very ready with the pencil had taken his likeness as they talked on the flyleaf of his notebook alive to that theological disturbance in the air all around him he refused to be moved by it as essentially a strife on small matters anticipating a vagrant regret which may have visited many other minds since the regret namely that the old pensive useandwont catholicism which had accompanied the nations earlier struggle for existence and consoled it therein had been taken from it and for himself indeed what impressed him in that old catholicism was a kind of lull in ita lulling powerlike that of the monotonous organmusic which holland catholic or not still so greatly loves but what he could not away with in the catholic religion was its unfailing drift towards the concretethe positive imageries of a faith so richly beset with persons things historical incidents rigidly logical in the method of his inferences he attained the poetic quality only by the audacity with which he conceived the whole sublime extension of his premises the contrast was a strange one between the careful the almost petty fineness of his personal surroundingall the elegant conventionalities of life in that rising dutch familyand the mortal coldness of a temperament the intellectual tendencies of which seemed to necessitate straightforward flight from all that was positive he seemed if one may say so in love with death preferring winter to summer finding only a tranquillising influence in the thought of the earth beneath our feet cooling down for ever from its old cosmic heat watching pleasurably how their colours fled out of things and the long sandbank in the sea which had been the rampart of a town was washed down in its turn one of his acquaintance a penurious young poet who having nothing in his pockets but the imaginative or otherwise barely potential gold of manuscript verses would have grasped so eagerly had they lain within his reach at the elegant outsides of life thought the fortunate sebastian possessed of every possible opportunity of that kind yet bent only on dispensing with it certainly a most puzzling and comfortless creature a few only half discerning what was in his mind would fain have shared his intellectual clearness and found a kind of beauty in this youthful enthusiasm for an abstract theorem extremes meeting his cold and dispassionate detachment from all that is most attractive to ordinary minds came to have the impressiveness of a great passion and for the most part people had loved him feeling instinctively that somewhere there must be the justification of his difference from themselves it was like being in love or it was an intellectual malady such as pleaded for forbearance like bodily sickness and gave at times a resigned and touching sweetness to what he did and said only once at a moment of the wild popular excitement which at that period was easy to provoke in holland there was a certain group of persons who would have shut him up as no wellwisher to and perhaps a plotter against the commonweal a single traitor might cut the dykes in an hour in the interest of the english or the french or had he already committed some treasonable act who was so anxious to expose no writing of his that he left his very letters unsigned and there were little stratagems to get specimens of his fair manuscript for with all his breadth of mystic intention he was persistent as the hours crept on to leave all the inevitable details of life at least in order in equation and all his singularities appeared to be summed up in his refusal to take his place in the lifesized family group tres distingue et tres soigne remarks a modern critic of the work painted about this time his mother expostulated with him on the mattershe must needs feel a little icily the emptiness of hope and something more than the due measure of cold in things for a woman of her age in the presence of a son who desired but to fade out of the world like a breathand she suggested filial duty good mother he answered there are duties towards the intellect also which women can but rarely understand the artists and their wives were come to supper again with the burgomaster van storck mademoiselle van westrheene was also come with her sister and mother the girl was by this time fallen in love with sebastian and she was one of the few who in spite of his terrible coldness really loved him for himself but though of good birth she was poor while sebastian could not but perceive that he had many suitors of his wealth in truth madame van westrheene her mother did wish to marry this daughter into the great world and plied many arts to that end such as daughterful mothers use her healthy freshness of mien and mind her ruddy beauty some showy presents that had passed were of a piece with the ruddy colouring of the very house these people lived in and for a moment the cheerful warmth that may be felt in life seemed to come very close to himto come forth and enfold him meantime the girl herself taking note of this that on a former occasion of their meeting he had seemed likely to respond to her inclination and that his father would readily consent to such a marriage surprised him on the sudden with those coquetries and importunities all those little arts of love which often succeed with men only to sebastian they seemed opposed to that absolute nature we suppose in love and while in the eyes of all around him tonight this courtship seemed to promise him thus early in life a kind of quiet happiness he was coming to an estimate of the situation with strict regard to that ideal of a calm intellectual indifference of which he was the sworn chevalier set in the cold hard light of that ideal this girl with the pronounced personal views of her mother and in the very effectiveness of arts prompted by a real affection bringing the warm life they prefigured so close to him seemed vulgar and still he felt himself bound in honour or judged from their manner that she and those about them thought him thus bound he did not reflect on the inconsistency of the feeling of honour living as it does essentially upon the concrete and minute detail of social relationship for one who on principle set so slight a value on anything whatever that is merely relative in its character the guests lively and late were almost pledging the betrothed in the rich wine only sebastians mother knew and at that advanced hour while the company were thus intently occupied drew away the burgomaster to confide to him the misgiving she felt grown to a great height just then the young man had slipped from the assembly but certainly not with mademoiselle van westrheene who was suddenly withdrawn also and she never appeared again in the world already next day with the rumour that sebastian had left his home it was known that the expected marriage would not take place the girl indeed alleged something in the way of a cause on her part but seemed to fade away continually afterwards and in the eyes of all who saw her was like one perishing of wounded pride but to make a clean breast of her poor girlish worldliness before she became a beguine she confessed to her mother the receipt of the letterthe cruel letter that had killed her and in effect the first copy of this letter written with a very deliberate fineness rejecting heraccusing her so natural and simply loyal of a vulgar coarseness of characterwas found oddly tacked on as their last word to the studious record of the abstract thoughts which had been the real business of sebastians life in the room whither his mother went to seek him next day littered with the fragments of the one portrait of him in existence the neat and elaborate manuscript volume of which this letter formed the final page odd transition by which a train of thought so abstract drew its conclusion in the sphere of action afforded at length to the few who were interested in him a muchcoveted insight into the curiosity of his existence and i pause just here to indicate in outline the kind of reasoning through which making the infinite his beginning and his end sebastian had come to think all definite forms of being the warm pressure of life the cry of nature itself no more than a troublesome irritation of the surface of the one absolute mind a passing vexatious thought or uneasy dream there at its height of petulant importunity in the eager human creature the volume was indeed a kind of treatise to bea hard systematic wellconcatenated train of thought still implicated in the circumstances of a journal freed from the accidents of that particular literary form with its unavoidable details of place and occasion the theoretic strain would have been found mathematically continuous the already so weary sebastian might perhaps never have taken in hand or succeeded in this detachment of his thoughts every one of which beginning with himself as the peculiar and intimate apprehension of this or that particular day and hour seemed still to protest against such disturbance as if reluctant to part from those accidental associations of the personal history which had prompted it and so become a purely intellectual abstraction the series began with sebastians boyish enthusiasm for a strange fine saying of doctor baruch de spinosa concerning the divine lovethat whoso loveth god truly must not expect to be loved by him in return in mere reaction against an actual surrounding of which every circumstance tended to make him a finished egotist that bold assertion defined for him the ideal of an intellectual disinterestedness of a domain of unimpassioned mind with the desire to put ones subjective side out of the way and let pure reason speak and what pure reason affirmed in the first place as the beginning of wisdom was that the world is but a thought or a series of thoughts that it exists therefore solely in mind it showed him as he fixed the mental eye with more and more of selfabsorption on the phenomena of his intellectual existence a picture or vision of the universe as actually the product so far as he really knew it of his own lonely thinking powerof himself there thinking as being zero without him and as possessing a perfectly homogeneous unity in that fact things that have nothing in common with each other said the axiomatic reason cannot be understood or explained by means of each other but to pure reason things discovered themselves as being in their essence thoughtsall things even the most opposite things mere transmutations of a single power the power of thought all was but conscious mind therefore all the more exclusively he must minister to mind to the intellectual power submitting himself to the sole direction of that whithersoever it might lead him everything must be referred to and as it were changed into the terms of that if its essential value was to be ascertained joy he said anticipating spinosathat for the attainment of which men are ready to surrender all besideis but the name of a passion in which the mind passes to a greater perfection or power of thinking as grief is the name of the passion in which it passes to a less looking backward for the generative source of that creative power of thought in him from his own mysterious intellectual being to its first cause he still reflected as one can but do the enlarged pattern of himself into the vague region of hypothesis in this way some at all events would have explained his mental process to him that process was nothing less than the apprehension the revelation of the greatest and most real of ideasthe true substance of all things he too with his vividlycoloured existence with this picturesque and sensuous world of dutch art and dutch reality all around that would fain have made him the prisoner of its colours its genial warmth its struggle for life its selfish and crafty love was but a transient perturbation of the one absolute mind of which indeed all finite things whatever time itself the most durable achievements of nature and man and all that seems most like independent energy are no more than petty accidents or affections theorem and corollary thus they stood there can be only one substance corollary it is the greatest of errors to think that the nonexistent the world of finite things seen and felt really is theorem for whatever is is but in that practical corollary ones wisdom therefore consists in hastening so far as may be the action of those forces which tend to the restoration of equilibrium the calm surface of the absolute untroubled mind to tabula rasa by the extinction in ones self of all that is but correlative to the finite illusionby the suppression of ourselves in the loneliness which was gathering round him and oddly enough as a somewhat surprising thing he wondered whether there were or had been others possessed of like thoughts ready to welcome any such as his veritable compatriots and in fact he became aware just then in readings difficult indeed but which from their allabsorbing interest seemed almost like an illicit pleasure a sense of kinship with certain older minds the study of many an earlier adventurous theorist satisfied his curiosity as the record of daring physical adventure for instance might satisfy the curiosity of the healthy it was a traditiona constant traditionthat daring thought of his an echo or haunting recurrent voice of the human soul itself and as such sealed with natural truth which certain minds would not fail to heed discerning also if they were really loyal to themselves its practical conclusionthe one alone is and all things beside are but its passing affections which have no necessary or proper right to be as but such accidents or affections indeed there might have been found within the circumference of that one infinite creative thinker some scope for the joy and love of the creature there have been dispositions in which that abstract theorem has only induced a renewed value for the finite interests around and within us centre of heat and light truly nothing has seemed to lie beyond the touch of its perpetual summer it has allied itself to the poetical or artistic sympathy which feels challenged to acquaint itself with and explore the various forms of finite existence all the more intimately just because of that sense of one lively spirit circulating through all thingsa tiny particle of the one soul in the sunbeam or the leaf sebastian van storck on the contrary was determined perhaps by some inherited satiety or fatigue in his nature to the opposite issue of the practical dilemma for him that one abstract being was as the pallid arctic sun disclosing itself over the dead level of a glacial a barren and absolutely lonely sea the lively purpose of life had been frozen out of it what he must admire and love if he could was equilibrium the void the tabula rasa into which through all those apparent energies of man and nature that in truth are but forces of disintegration the world was really settling and himself a mere circumstance in a fatalistic series to which the clay of the potter was no sufficient parallel he could not expect to be loved in return at first indeed he had a kind of delight in his thoughtsin the eager pressure forward to whatsoever conclusion of a rigid intellectual gymnastic which was like the making of euclid only little by little under the freezing influence of such propositions the theoretic energy itself and with it his old eagerness for truth the care to track it from proposition to proposition was chilled out of him in fact the conclusion was there already and might have been foreseen in the premises by a singular perversity it seemed to him that every one of those passing affectionshe too alas at timeswas for ever trying to be to assert itself to maintain its isolated and petty self by a kind of practical lie in things although through every incident of its hypothetic existence it had protested that its proper function was to die surely those transient affections marred the freedom the truth the beatific calm of the absolute selfishness which could not if it would pass beyond the circumference of itself to which at times with a fantastic sense of wellbeing he was capable of a sort of fanatical devotion and those as he conceived were his moments of genuine theoretic insight in which under the abstract perpetual light he died to self while the intellect after all had attained a freedom of its own through the vigorous act which assured him that as nature was but a thought of his so himself also was but the passing thought of god no rather a puzzle only an anomaly upon that one white unruffled consciousness his first principle once recognised all the rest the whole array of propositions down to the heartless practical conclusion must follow of themselves detachment to hasten hence to fold up ones whole self as a vesture put aside to anticipate by such individual force as he could find in him the slow disintegration by which nature herself is levelling the eternal hillshere would be the secret of peace of such dignity and truth as there could be in a world which after all was essentially an illusion for sebastian at least the world and the individual alike had been divested of all effective purpose the most vivid of finite objects the dramatic episodes of dutch history the brilliant personalities which had found their parts to play in them that golden art surrounding us with an ideal world beyond which the real world is discernible indeed but etherealised by the medium through which it comes to one all this for most men so powerful a link to existence only set him on the thought of escapemeans of escapeinto a formless and nameless infinite world quite evenly grey the very emphasis of those objects their importunity to the eye the ear the finite intelligence was but the measure of their distance from what really is ones personal presence the presence such as it is of the most incisive things and persons around us could only lessen by so much that which really is to restore tabula rasa then by a continual effort at selfeffacement actually proud at times of his curious wellreasoned nihilism he could but regard what is called the business of life as no better than a trifling and wearisome delay bent on making sacrifice of the rich existence possible for him as he would readily have sacrificed that of other people to the bare and formal logic of the answer to a query never proposed at all to entirely healthy minds regarding the remote conditions and tendencies of that existence he did not reflect that if others had inquired as curiously as himself the world could never have come so far at allthat the fact of its having come so far was itself a weighty exception to his hypothesis his odd devotion soaring or sinking into fanaticism into a kind of religious mania with what was really a vehement assertion of his individual will he had formulated duty as the principle to hinder as little as possible what he called the restoration of equilibrium the restoration of the primary consciousness to itselfits relief from that uneasy tetchy unworthy dream of a world made so ill or dreamt so weaklyto forget to be forgotten and at length this dark fanaticism losing the support of his pride in the mere novelty of a reasoning so hard and dry turned round upon him as our fanaticism will in black melancholy the theoretic or imaginative desire to urge times creeping footsteps was felt now as the physical fatigue which leaves the book or the letter unfinished or finishes eagerly out of hand for mere finishings sake unimportant business strange that the presence to the mind of a metaphysical abstraction should have had this power over one so fortunately endowed for the reception of the sensible world it could hardly have been so with him but for the concurrence of physical causes with the influences proper to a mere thought the moralist indeed might have noted that a meaner kind of pride the morbid fear of vulgarity lent secret strength to the intellectual prejudice which realised duty as the renunciation of all finite objects the fastidious refusal to be or do any limited thing but besides this it was legible in his own admissions from time to time that the body following as it does with powerful temperaments the lead of mind and the will the intellectual consumption so to term it had been concurrent with had strengthened and been strengthened by a vein of physical phthisisby a merely physical accident after all of his bodily constitution such as might have taken a different turn had another accident fixed his home among the hills instead of on the shore is it only the result of disease he would ask himself sometimes with a sudden suspicion of his intellectual cogencythis persuasion that myself and all that surrounds me are but a diminution of that which really isthis unkindly melancholy the journal with that cruel letter to mademoiselle van westrheene coming as the last step in the rigid process of theoretic deduction circulated among the curious and people made their judgments upon it there were some who held that such opinions should be suppressed by law that they were or might become dangerous to society perhaps it was the confessor of his mother who thought of the matter most justly the aged man smiled observing how even for minds by no means superficial the mere dress it wears alters the look of a familiar thought with a happy sort of smile as he added reflecting that such truth as there was in sebastians theory was duly covered by the propositions of his own creed and quoting sebastians favourite pagan wisdom from the lips of saint paul in him we live and move and have our being next day as sebastian escaped to the sea under the long monotonous line of windmills in comparative calm of mindreaction of that pleasant morning from the madness of the night beforehe was making light or trying to make light with some success of his late distress he would fain have thought it a small matter to be adequately set at rest for him by certain welltested influences of external nature in a long visit to the place he liked best a desolate house amid the sands of the helder one of the old lodgings of his family property now rather of the seabirds and almost surrounded by the encroaching tide though there were still relics enough of hardy sweet things about it to form what was to sebastian the most perfect garden in holland here he could make equation between himself and what was not himself and set things in order in preparation towards such deliberate and final change in his manner of living as circumstances so clearly necessitated as he stayed in this place with one or two silent serving people a sudden rising of the wind altered as it might seem in a few dark tempestuous hours the entire world around him the strong wind changed not again for fourteen days and its effect was a permanent one so that people might have fancied that an enemy had indeed cut the dykes somewherea pinhole enough to wreck the ship of holland or at least this portion of it which underwent an inundation of the sea the like of which had not occurred in that province for half a century only when the body of sebastian was found apparently not long after death a child lay asleep swaddled warmly in his heavy furs in an upper room of the old tower to which the tide was almost risen though the building still stood firmly and still with the means of life in plenty and it was in the saving of this child with a great effort as certain circumstances seemed to indicate that sebastian had lost his life his parents were come to seek him believing him bent on selfdestruction and were almost glad to find him thus a learned physician moreover endeavoured to comfort his mother by remarking that in any case he must certainly have died ere many years were

overdelicate in their nature by the effects of modern luxury chapter iv duke carl of rosenmold one stormy season about the beginning of the present century a great tree came down among certain mosscovered ridges of old masonry which break the surface of the rosenmold heath exposing together with its roots the remains of two persons whether the bodies male and female said german bonescience had been purposely buried there was questionable they seemed rather to have been hidden away by the accident whatever it was which had caused deathcrushed perhaps under what had been the low wall of a gardenbeing much distorted and lying though neatly enough discovered by the upheaval of the soil in great confusion peoples attention was the more attracted to the incident because popular fancy had long run upon a tradition of buried treasures golden treasures in or about the antiquated ruin which the garden boundary enclosed the roofless shell of a small but solidlybuilt stone house burnt or overthrown perhaps in the time of the wars at the beginning of the eighteenth century many persons went to visit the remains lying out on the dark wild plateau which stretches away above the tallest roofs of the old grandducal town very distinctly outlined on that day in deep fluid grey against a sky still heavy with coming rain no treasure indeed was forthcoming among the masses of fallen stone but the tradition was so far verified that the bones had rich golden ornaments about them and for the minds of some longremembering people their discovery set at rest an old query it had never been precisely known what was become of the young duke carl who disappeared from the world just a century before about the time when a great army passed over those parts at a political crisis one result of which was the final absorption of his small territory in a neighbouring dominion restless romantic eccentric had he passed on with the victorious host and taken the chances of an obscure soldiers life certain old letters hinted at a different endingloveletters which provided for a secret meeting preliminary perhaps to the final departure of the young duke who by the usage of his realm could only with extreme difficulty go whither or marry whom he pleased to whatever worlds he had chosen not of his own people the minds of those still interested in the matter were now at last made up the disposition of the remains suggesting to them the lively picture of a sullen night the unexpected passing of the great army and the two lovers rushing forth wildly at the sudden tumult outside their cheerful shelter caught in the dark and trampled out so surprised and unseen among the horses and heavy guns time at the court of the grandduke of rosenmold at the beginning of the eighteenth century might seem to have been standing still almost since the middle agesince the days of the emperor charles the fifth at which period by the marriage of the hereditary grandduke with a princess of the imperial house a sudden tide of wealth flowing through the grandducal exchequer had left a kind of golden architectural splendour on the place always too ample for its population the sloping gothic roofs for carrying off the heavy snows still indented the skya world of tiles with space uncurtailed for the awkward gambols of that very german goblin hans klapper on the long slumberous northern nights whole quarryfuls of wrought stone had been piled along the streets and around the squares and were now grown in truth like natures self again in their rough timeworn massiveness with weeds and wild flowers where their decay accumulated blossoming always the same beyond peoples memories every summer as the storks came back to their platforms on the remote chimneytops without all was as it had been on the eve of the thirty years war the venerable darkgreen mouldiness priceless pearl of architectural effect was unbroken by a single new gable and within human lifeits thoughts its habits above all its etiquettehad keen put out by no matter of excitement political or intellectual ever at all one might say at any time the rambling grandducal palace was full to overflowing with furniture which useful or useless was all ornamental and none of it new suppose the various objects especially the contents of the haunted old lumberrooms duly arranged and ticketed and their highnesses would

quasi decorative orderthe treblesinger to the towncouncil the court organist the court poet and the likeeach with his deputies and assistants maintaining all unbroken a sleepy ceremonial to make the hours just noticeable as they slipped away at court with a continuous round of ceremonies which though early in the day must always take place under a jealous exclusion of the sun one seemed to live in perpetual candlelight it was in a delightful rummaging of one of those lumberrooms escaped from that candlelight into the broad day of the uppermost windows that the young duke carl laid his hand on an old volume of the year printed in heavy type with frontispiece perhaps by albert duererars versificandi the art of versification by conrad celtes crowned poet of the emperor frederick the third he had the right to speak on that subject for while he vindicated as best he might old german literature against the charge of barbarism he did also a mans part towards reviving in the fatherland the knowledge of the poetry of greece and rome and for carl the pearl the golden nugget of the volume was the sapphic ode with which it closedto apollo praying that he would come to us from italy bringing his lyre with him ad apollinem ut ab italis cum lyra ad germanos veniat the god of light coming to germany from some more favoured world beyond it over leagues of rainy hill and mountain making soft day there that had ever been the dream of the ghostridden yet deepfeeling and certainly meek german soul of the great duerer for instance who had been the friend of this conrad celtes and himself all german as he was like a gleam of real day amid that hyperborean german darknessa darkness which clave to him too at that dim time when there were violent robbers nay real live devils in every german wood and it was precisely the aspiration of carl himself those verses coming to the boys hand at the right moment brought a beam of effectual daylight to a whole magazine of observation fancy desire stored up from the first impressions of childhood to bring apollo with his lyre to germany it was precisely that he carl desired to dowas as he might flatter himself actually doing the daylight the apolline aurora which the young duke carl claimed to be bringing to his candlelit people came in the somewhat questionable form of the contemporary french ideal in matters of art and literaturefrench plays french architecture french lookingglassesapollo in the dandified costume of lewis the fourteenth only confronting the essentially aged and decrepit graces of his model with his own essentially youthful temper he invigorated what he borrowed and with him an aspiration towards the classical ideal so often hollow and insincere lost all its affectation his doating grandfather the reigning grandduke afforded readily enough from the great store of inherited wealth which would one day be the lads the funds necessary for the completion of the vast unfinished residence with pavilions after the manner of the famous mansard uniting its scattered parts while a wonderful flowerage of architectural fancy with broken attic roofs passed over and beyond the earlier fabric the later and lighter forms being in part carved adroitly out of the heavy masses of the old honest stump gothic tracery one fault only carl found in his french models and was resolute to correct he would have at least within real marble in place of stucco and if he might perhaps solid gold for gilding there was something in the sanguine floridly handsome youth with his alertness of mind turned wholly amid the vexing preoccupations of an age of war upon embellishment and the softer things of life which soothed the testy humours of the old duke like the quiet physical warmth of a fire or the sun he was ready to preside with all ceremony at a presentation of marivauxs death of hannibal played in the original with such imperfect mastery of the french accent as the lovers of new light in rosenmold had at command in a theatre copied from that at versailles lined with pale yellow satin and with a picture amid the stucco braveries of the ceiling of the septentrional apollo himself in somewhat watery red and blue innumerable wax lights in cutglass lustres were a thing of course duke carl himself attired after the newest french fashion played the part of hannibal the old duke indeed at a councilboard devoted hitherto to matters of state would nod very early in certain long discussions on matters of artmagnificent schemes from this or that eminent contractor for spending his money tastefully distinguishings of the rococo and the baroque on the other hand having been all his life in close intercourse with select humanity selfconscious and arrayed for presentation he was a helpful judge of portraits and the various degrees of the attainment of truth thereina phase of fine art which the grandson could not value too much the sergeantpainter and the deputy sergeantpainter were indeed conventional performers enough as mechanical in their dispensation of wigs fingerrings ruffles and simpers as the figure of the armed knight who struck the bell in the residence tower but scattered through its halfdeserted rooms state bedchambers and the like hung the works of more genuine masters still as unadulterate as the hock known to be two generations old in the grandducal cellar the youth had even his scheme of inviting the illustrious antony coppel to the court to live there if he would with the honours and emoluments of a prince of the blood the illustrious mansard had actually promised to come had not his sudden death taken him away from earthly glory and at least if one must forgo the masters masterpieces might be had for their price for ten thousand marksday ever to be remembereda genuine work of the urbinate from the cabinet of a certain commerciallyminded italian grandduke was on its way to rosenmold anxiously awaited as it came over rainy mountainpasses and along the rough german roads through doubtful weather the tribune the throne itself were made ready in the presencechamber with hangings in the grandducal colours laced with gold together with a speech and an ode late at night at last the waggon was heard rumbling into the courtyard with the guest arrived in safety but if one must confess ones self perhaps forbidding at first sight from a comfortless portico with all the grotesqueness of the middle age supported by brown aged bishops whose meditations no incident could distract our lady looked out no better than an unpretending nun with nothing to say the like of which one was used to hear certainly one was not stimulated by enwrapped absorbed in the great masters doings only with much private disappointment put on ones mettle to defend him against critics notoriously wanting in sensibility and against ones self in truth the painter whom carl most unaffectedly enjoyed the real vigour of his youthful and somewhat animal taste finding here its proper sustenance was rubensrubens reached as he is reached at his best in wellpreserved family portraits fresh gay ingenious as of privileged young people who could never grow old had not he too brought something of the splendour of a better land into those northern regions if not the glowing gold of titians italian sun yet the carnation and yellow of roses or tulips such as might really grow there with cultivation even under rainy skies and then about this time something was heard at the grandducal court of certain mysterious experiments in the making of porcelain veritable alchemy for the turning of clay into gold the reign of dresden china was at hand with ones own world of little men and women more delightfully diminutive still amid imitations of artificial flowers the young duke braced himself for a plot to steal the gifted herr boettcher from his enforced residence as if in prison at the fortress of meissen why not bring pots and wheels to rosenmold and prosecute his discoveries there the grandduke indeed preferred his old service of gold plate and would have had the lad a virtuoso in nothing less costly than goldgold snuffboxes for in truth regarding what belongs to art or culture as elsewhere we may have a large appetite and little to feed on only in the things of the mind the appetite itself counts for so much at least in hopeful unobstructed youth with the world before it you are the apollo you tell us of the northern apollo people were beginning to say to him surprised from time to time by a mental purpose beyond their guessesexpressions liftings softly gleaming or vehement lights in the handsome countenance of the youth and his effective speech as he roamed inviting all about him to share the honey from music to painting from painting to the drama all alike florid in style yes and perhaps thirdrate and so far consistently throughout he had held that the centre of ones intellectual system must be understood to be in france he had thoughts of proceeding to that country secretly in person there to attain the very impress of its genius meantime its more portable flowers came to order in abundance that the roses so to put it were but excellent artificial flowers redolent only of musk neither disproved for carl the validity of his ideal nor for our minds the vocation of carl himself in these matters in art as in all other things of the mind again much depends on the receiver and the higher informing capacity if it exist within will mould an unpromising matter to itself will realise itself by selection and the preference of the better in what is bad or indifferent asserting its prerogative under the most unlikely conditions people had in carl could they have understood it the spectacle under those superficial braveries of a really heroic effort of mind at a disadvantage that rococo seventeenthcentury french imitation of the true renaissance called out in carl a boundless enthusiasm as the italian original had done two centuries before he put into his reception of the aesthetic achievements of lewis the fourteenth what young france had felt when francis the first brought home the great da vinci and his works it was but himself truly after all that he had found so fresh and real among those artificial roses he was thrown the more upon such outward and sensuous products of mindarchitecture pottery presently on musicbecause for him with so large intellectual capacity there was to speak properly no literature in his mothertongue books there were german books but of a dulness a distance from the actual interests of the warm various coloured life around and within him to us hardly conceivable there was more entertainment in the natural train of his own solitary thoughts humoured and rightly attuned by pleasant visible objects than in all the books he had hunted through so carefully for that allsearching intellectual light of which a passing gleam of interest gave fallacious promise here or there and still generously he held to the belief urging him to fresh endeavour that the literature which might set heart and mind free must exist somewhere though court librarians could not say where in search for it he spent many days in those old bookclosets where he had lighted on the latin ode of conrad celtes was german literature always to remain no more than a kind of penal apparatus for the teasing of the brain oh for a literature set free conterminous with the interests of life itself in music it might be thought germany had already vindicated its spiritual liberty one and another of those northgerman towns were already aware of the youthful sebastian bach the first notes had been heard of a music not borrowed from france but flowing as naturally as springs from their sources out of the ever musical soul of germany itself and the duke carl was a sincere lover of music himself playing melodiously on the violin to a delighted court that new germany of the spirit would be builded perhaps to the sound of music in those other artistic enthusiasms as the prophet of the french drama or the architectural taste of lewis the fourteenth he had contributed himself generously helping out with his own goodfaith the inadequacy of their appeal music alone hitherto had really helped him and taken him out of himself to music instinctively more and more he was dedicate and in his desire to refine and organise the court music from which by leave of absence to official performers enjoying their salaries at a distance many parts had literally fallen away like the favourite notes of a wornout spinet he was ably seconded by a devoted youth the deputy organist of the grandducal chapel a member of the roman church amid a people chiefly of the reformed religion duke carl would creep sometimes into the curtained court pew of the lutheran church to which he had presented its massive golden crucifix to listen to the chorales the execution of which he had managed to time to his liking relishing he could hardly explain why those passages of a pleasantly monotonous and as it might seem unending melodywhich certainly never came to what could rightly be called an ending here on earth and having also a sympathy with the cheerful genius of dr martin luther with his good tunes and that ringing laughter which sent dull goblins flitting at this time then his mind ran eagerly for awhile on the project of some musical and dramatic development of a fancy suggested by that old latin poem of conrad celtesthe hyperborean apollo sojourning in the revolutions of time in the sluggish north for a season yet apollo still prompting art music poetry and the philosophy which interprets mans life making a sort of intercalary day amid the natural darkness not meridian day of course but a soft derivative daylight good enough for us it would be necessarily a mystic piece abounding in fine touches suggestions innuendoes his vague proposal was met halfway by the very practical executant power of his friend or servant the deputy organist already pondering with just a satiric flavour suppressible in actual performance if the time for that should ever come a musical work on duke carl himself balder an interlude he was contented to recast and enlarge the part of the northern god of light with a now wholly serious intention but still the near the real and familiar gave precision to or actually superseded the distant and the ideal the soul of the music was but a transfusion from the fantastic but so interesting creature close at hand and carl was certainly true to his proposed part in that he gladdened others by an intellectual radiance which had ceased to mean warmth or animation for himself for him the light was still to seek in france in italy above all in old greece amid the precious things which might yet be lurking there unknown in art in poetry perhaps in very life till prince fortunate should come yes it was thither to greece that his thoughts were turned during those romantic classical musings while the opera was made ready that in due time was presented with sufficient success meantime his purpose was grown definite to visit that original country of the muses from which the pleasant things of italy had been but derivative to brave the difficulties in the way of leaving home at all the difficulties also of access to greece in the present condition of the country at times the fancy came that he must really belong by descent to a southern race that a physical cause might lie beneath this strange restlessness like the imperfect reminiscence of something that had passed in earlier life the aged ministers of heraldry were set to work actually prolonging their days by an unexpected revival of interest in their too wellworn function at the search for some obscure rivulet of greek descentlater byzantine greek perhapsin the rosenmold genealogy no with a hundred quarterings they were as indigenous incorruptible heraldry reasserted as the old yewtrees asquat on the heath and meantime those dreams of remote and probably adventurous travel lent the youth still so healthy of body a wing for more distant expeditions than he had ever yet inclined to among his own wholesome german woodlands in long rambles afoot or on horseback by day and night he flung himself for the resettling of his sanity on the cheerful influences of their simple imagery the hawks as if asleep on the air below him the bleached crags evoked by late sunset among the dark oaks the waterwheels with their pleasant murmur in the foldings of the hillside clouds came across his heaven little sudden clouds like those which in this northern latitude where summer is at best but a flighty visitor chill out the heart though but for a few minutes at a time of the warmest afternoon he had fits of the gloom of other peopletheir dull passage through and exit from the world the threadbare incidents of their lives their dismal funeralswhich unless he drove them away immediately by strenuous exercise settled into a gloom more properly his own yet at such times outward things also would seem to concur unkindly in deepening the mental shadow about him almost as if there were indeed animation in the natural world elfin spirits in those inaccessible hillsides and dark ravines as old german poetry pretended cheerfully assistant sometimes but for the most part troublesome to their human kindred of late these fits had come somewhat more frequently and had continued often it was a weary deflowered face that his favourite mirrors reflected yes people were prosaic and their lives threadbareall but himself and organist max perhaps and fritz the treblesinger in return the people in actual contact with him thought him a little mad though still ready to flatter his madness as he could detect alone with the doating old grandfather in their stiff distant alien world of etiquette he felt surrounded by flatterers and would fain have tested the sincerity even of max and fritz who said echoing the words of the other yourself sire are the apollo of germany it was his desire to test the sincerity of the people about him and unveil flatterers which in the first instance suggested a trick he played upon the court upon all europe in that complex but wholly teutonic genealogy lately under research lay a muchprized thread of descent from the fifth emperor charles and carl under direction read with much readiness to be impressed all that was attainable concerning the great ancestor finding there in truth little enough to reward his pains one hint he took however he determined to assist at his own obsequies that he might in this way facilitate that muchdesired journey occurred to him almost at once as an accessory motive and in a little while definite motives were engrossed in the dramatic interest the pleasing gloom the curiosity of the thing itself certainly amid the living world in germany especially in old sleepy rosenmold death made great parade of itself youth even in its sentimental mood was ready to indulge in the luxury of decay and amuse itself with fancies of the tomb as in periods of decadence or suspended progress when the world seems to nap for a time artifices for the arrest or disguise of old age are adopted as a fashion and become the fopperies of the young the whole body of carls relations saving the drowsy old grandfather already lay buried beneath their expansive heraldries at times the whole world almost seemed buried thusmade and remade of the deadits entire fabric of politics of art of custom being essentially heraldic achievements dead mens mementoes such as those you see he was a sceptical young man and his kinsmen dead and gone had passed certainly in his imaginations of them into no other world save perhaps into some stiffer slower sleepier and more pompous phase of ceremonythe last degree of court etiquetteas they lay there in the great lowpitched grandducal vault in their coffins dusted once a year for all souls day when the court officials descended thither and mass for the dead was sung amid an array of dropping crape and cobwebs the lad with his full red lips and open blue eyes coming as with a great cup in his hands to lifes feast revolted from the like of that as from suffocation and still the suggestion of it was everywhere in the garish afternoon up to the wholesome heights of the heiligenberg suddenly from one of the villages of the plain came the grinding deathknell it seemed to come out of the ugly grave itself and enjoyment was dead on his way homeward sadly an hour later he enters by chance the open door of a village church half buried in the tangle of its churchyard the rude coffin is lying there of a labourer who had but a hovel to live in the enemy dogged ones footsteps the young carl seemed to be flying not from death simply but from assassination and as these thoughts sent him back in the rebounding power of youth with renewed appetite to life and sense so grown at last familiar they gave additional purpose to his fantastic experiment had it not been said by a wise man that after all the offence of death was in its trappings well he would as far as might be try the thing while presumably a large reversionary interest in life was still his he would purchase his freedom at least of those gloomy trappings and listen while he was spoken of as dead the mere preparations gave pleasant proof of the devotion to him of a certain number who entered without question into his plans it is not difficult to mislead the world concerning what happens to those who live at the artificial distance from it of a court with its high wall of etiquette however the matter was managed no one doubted when with a blazon of ceremonious words the court news went forth that after a brief illness according to the way of his race the hereditary grandduke was deceased in momentary regret bethinking them of the lads taste for splendour those to whom the arrangement of such matters belonged the grandfather now sinking deeper into bare quiescence backed by the popular wish determined to give him a funeral with even more than grandducal measure of lugubrious magnificence the place of his repose was marked out for him as officiously as if it had been the delimitation of a kingdom in the ducal burial vault through the cobwebbed windows of which from the garden where he played as a child the young duke had often peered at the faded glories of the immense coroneted coffins the oldest shedding their velvet tatters around them surrounded by the whole official world of rosenmold arrayed for the occasion in almost forgotten dresses of ceremony as if for a masquerade the new coffin glided from the fragrant chapel where the requiem was sung down the broad staircase lined with peachcolour and yellow marble into the shadows below carl himself disguised as a strolling musician had followed it across the square through a drenching rain on which circumstance he overheard the old people congratulate the blessed dead within had listened to a dirge of his own composing brought out on the great organ with much bravura by his friend the new court organist who was in the secret and that night turned the key of the garden entrance to the vault and peeped in upon the sleepy painted and bewigged young pages whose duty it would be for a certain number of days to come to watch beside their late masters couch and a certain number of weeks afterwards it was known that the mad duke had reappeared to the dismay of court marshals things might have gone hard with the youth had the strange news at first as fantastic rumour then as matter of solemn enquiry lastly as ascertained fact pleasing or otherwise been less welcome than it was to the grandfather too old indeed to sorrow deeply but grown so decrepit as to propose that ministers should possess themselves of the person of the young duke proclaim him of age and regent from those dim travels presenting themselves to the old man who had never been fifty miles away from home as almost lunar in their audacity he would come backcome back in time he murmured faintly eager to feel that youthful animating life on the stir about him once more carl himself now the thing was over greatly relishing its satiric elements must be forgiven the trick of the burial and his still greater enormity in coming to life again and then duke or no duke it was understood that he willed that things should in no case be precisely as they had been he would never again be quite so near peoples lives as in the pasta fitful intermittent visitoralmost as if he had been properly dead the empty coffin remaining as a kind of symbolical coronation incident setting forth his future relations to his subjects of all those who believed him dead one human creature only save the grandfather had sincerely sorrowed for him a woman in tears as the funeral train passed by with whom he had sympathetically discussed his own merits till then he had forgotten the incident which had exhibited him to her as the very genius of goodness and strength how one day driving with her country produce into the market and embarrassed by the crowd she had broken one of a hundred little police rules whereupon the officers were about to carry her away to be fined or worse amid the jeers of the bystanders always ready to deal hardly with the gipsy at which precise moment the tall duke carl like the flash of a trusty sword had leapt from the palace stair and caused her to pass on in peace she had half detected him through his disguise in due time news of his reappearance had been ceremoniously carried to her in her little cottage and the remembrance of her hung about him not ungratefully as he went with delight upon his way the first long stage of his journey over in headlong flight night and day he found himself one summer morning under the heat of what seemed a southern sun at last really at large on the bergstrasse with the rich plain of the palatinate on his left hand on the right hand vineyards seen now for the first time sloping up into the crisp beeches of the odenwald by weinheim only an empty tower remained of the castle of windeck he lay for the night in the great whitewashed guestchamber of the capuchin convent the national rivers like the national woods have a family likeness the main the lahn the moselle the neckar the rhine by help of such accommodation as chance afforded partly on the stream itself partly along the banks he pursued the leisurely winding course of one of the prettiest of these tarrying for awhile in the towns grey white or red which came in his way tasting their delightful native little wines peeping into their old overloaded churches inspecting the church furniture or trying the organs for three nights he slept warm and dry on the hay stored in a deserted cloister and attracted into the neighbouring minster for a snatch of church music narrowly escaped detection by miraculous chance the grimmest lord of rosenmold was there within recognised the youth and his companionsvisitors naturally conspicuous amid the crowd of peasants around themand for some hours was upon their traces after unclean town streets the country air was a perfume by contrast or actually scented with pinewoods one seemed to breathe with it fancies of the woods the hills and waterof a sort of souls in the landscape but cheerful and genial now happy souls a distant group of pines on the verge of a great upland awoke a violent desire to be thereseemed to challenge one to proceed thither was their infinite view thence it was like an outpost of some faroff fancy land a pledge of the reality of such above cassel the airy hills curved in one black outline against a glowing sky pregnant one could fancy with weird forms which might be at their old diableries again on those remote places ere night was quite come there at last in the streets the hundred churches of cologne he feels something of a gothic enthusiasm and all a germans enthusiasm for the rhine through the length and breadth of the rhine country the vintage was begun the red ruins on the heights the whitewalled villages white saint nepomuc upon the bridges were but isolated high notes of contrast in a landscape sleepy and indistinct under the flood of sunshine with a headiness in it like that of must of the new wine the noise of the vineyards came through the lovely haze still at times with the sharp sound of a belldeathbell perhaps or only a crazy summons to the vintagers and amid those broad willowy reaches of the rhine at length from bingen to mannheim where the brown hills wander into airy blue distance like a little picture of paradise he felt that france was at hand before him lay the road thither easy and straightthat well of light so close but unexpectedly the capricious incidence of his own humour with the opportunity did not suggest as he would have wagered it must go drink at once was it that france had come to be of no account at all in comparison of italy of greece or that as he passed over the german land the conviction had come for you france italy hellas is herethat some recognition of the untried spiritual possibilities of meek germany had for carl transferred the ideal land out of space beyond the alps or the rhine into future time whither he must be the leader a little chilly of humour in spite of his manly strength he was journeying partly in search of physical heat today certainly in this great vineyard physical heat was about him in measure sufficient at least for a german constitution might it be not otherwise with the imaginative the intellectual heat and light the real need being that of an interpreterapollo illuminant rather as the revealer than as the bringer of light with large belief that the eclaircissement the aufklaerung he had already found the name for the thing would indeed come he had been in much bewilderment whence and how here he began to see that it could be in no other way than by action of informing thought upon the vast accumulated material of which germany was in possession art poetry fiction an entire imaginative world following reasonably upon a deeper understanding of the past of nature of ones selfan understanding of all beside through the knowledge of ones self to understand would be the indispensable first step towards the enlargement of the great past of ones little present by criticism by imagination then the imprisoned souls of nature would speak as of old the middle age in germany where the past has had such generous reprisals never far from us would reassert its mystic spell for the better understanding of our raffaelle the spirits of distant hellas would reawake in the men and women of little german towns distant times the most alien thoughts would come near together as elements in a great historic symphony a kind of ardent new patriotism awoke in him sensitive for the first time at the words national poesy national art and literature german philosophy to the resources of the past of himself of what was possible for german mind more and more his mind opens as he goes on his way a free open space had been determined which something now to be created created by him must occupy only he thought if i had coadjutors if these thoughts would awake in but one other mind at strasbourg with its mountainous goblin houses nine stories high grouped snugly in the midst of that inclement plain like a great storks nest around the romantic red steeple of its cathedral duke carl became fairly captive to the middle age tarrying there week after week he worked hard but without a ray of light from others in one long mistake at the chronology and history of the coloured windows antiquitys very self seemed expressed there on the visionary images of king or patriarch in the deeply incised marks of character the hoary hair the massive proportions telling of a length of years beyond what is lived now surely past ages could one get at the historic soul of them were not dead but living rich in company for the entertainment the expansion of the present and duke carl was still without suspicion of the cynic afterthought that such historic soul was but an arbitrary substitution a generous loan of ones self the mystic soul of nature laid hold on him next saying come understand interpret me he was awakened one morning by the jingle of sledgebells along the street beneath his windows winter had descended betimes from the mountains the pale rhine below the bridge of boats on the long way to kehl was swollen with ice and for the first time he realised that switzerland was at hand on a sudden he was captive to the enthusiasm of the mountains and hastened along the valley of the rhine by alt breisach and basle unrepelled by a thousand difficulties to swiss farmhouses and lonely villages solemn still and untouched by strangers at grindelwald sleeping at last in the close neighbourhood of the greater alps he had the sense of an overbrooding presence of some strange new companions around him here one might yield ones self to the unalterable imaginative appeal of the elements in their highest force and simplicitylight air water earth on very early spring days a mantle was suddenly lifted the alps were an apex of natural glory towards which in broadening spaces of light the whole of europe sloped upwards through them on the right hand as he journeyed on were the doorways to italy to como or venice from yonder peak italys self was visibleas on the left hand in the southgerman towns in a hightoned artistic fineness in the dainty flowered ironwork for instance the overflow of italian genius was traceable these things presented themselves at last only to remind him that in a new intellectual hope he was already on his way home straight through life straight through nature and man with ones own selfknowledge as a light thereon not by way of the geographical italy or greece lay the road to the new hellas to be realised now as the outcome of homeborn german genius at times in that early fine weather looking now not southwards but towards germany he seemed to trace the outspread of a faint not wholly natural aurora over the dark northern country and it was in an actual sunrise that the news came which finally put him on the directest road homewards one hardly dared breathe in the rapid uprise of allembracing light which seemed like the intellectual rising of the fatherland when up the straggling path to his high beechgrown summit was one safe nowhere protesting over the roughness of the way came the too familiar voices ennui itself made audible of certain high functionaries of rosenmold come to claim their new sovereign close upon the runaway bringing news of the old dukes decease with a real grief at his heart he hastened now over the ground which lay between him and the bed of death still trying at quieter intervals to snatch profit by the way peeping at the most unlikely hours on the objects of his curiosity waiting for a glimpse of dawn through glowing church windows penetrating into old church treasuries by candlelight taxing the old courtiers to pant up for the view to this or that conspicuous point in the world of hilly woodland from one such at last in spite of everything with pleasure to carl old rosenmold was visiblethe attic windows of the residence the storks on the chimneys the green copper roofs baking in the long dry german summer the homeliness of true old germany he too felt it and yearned towards his home and the beggarmaid was there thoughts of her had haunted his mind all the journey through as he was aware not unpleased graciously overflowing towards any creature he found dependent upon him the mere fact that she was awaiting him at his disposition meekly and as though through his long absence she had never quitted the spot on which he had said farewell touched his fancy and on a sudden concentrated his wavering preference into a practical decision king cophetua would be hers and his goodwill sunned her wildgrown beauty into majesty into a kind of queenly richness there was natural majesty in the heavy waves of golden hair folded closely above the neck built a little massively and she looked kind beseeching also capable of sorrow she was like clear sunny weather with bluebells and the green leaves between rainy days and seemed to embody die ruh auf dem gipfelall the restful hours he had spent of late in the woodsides and on the hilltops one june day on which she seemed to have withdrawn into herself all the tokens of summer brought decision to our lover of artificial roses who had cared so little hitherto for the like of her grandduke perforce he would make her his wife and had already reassured her with lively mockery of his horrified ministers go straight to life said his new poetic code and here was the opportunityhere also the real adventure in comparison of which his previous efforts that way seemed childish theatricalities fit only to cheat a little the profound ennui of actual life in a hundred stolen interviews she taught the hitherto indifferent youth the art of love duke carl had effected arrangements for his marriage secret but complete and soon to be made public long since he had cast complacent eyes on a strange architectural relic an old grange or huntinglodge on the heath with he could hardly have defined what charm of remoteness and old romance popular belief amused itself with reports of the wizard who inhabited or haunted the place his fantastic treasures his immense age his windows might be seen glittering afar on stormy nights with a blaze of golden ornaments said the more adventurous loiterer it was not because he was suspicious still but in a kind of wantonness of affection and as if by way of giving yet greater zest to the luxury of their mutual trust that duke carl added to his announcement of the purposed place and time of the event a pretended test of the girls devotion he tells her the story of the aged wizard meagre and wan to whom she must find her way alone for the purpose of asking a question allimportant to himself the fierce old man will try to escape with terrible threats will turn or half turn into repulsive animals she must cling the faster at last the spell will be broken he will yield he will become a youth once more and give the desired answer the girl otherwise so selfdenying and still modestly anxious for a private union not to shame his high position in the world had wished for one thing at leastto be loved amid the splendours habitual to him duke carl sends to the old lodge his choicest personal possessions for many days the public is aware of something on hand a few get delightful glimpses of the treasures on their way to the place on the heath was he preparing against contingencies should the great army soon to pass through these parts not leave the country as innocently as might be desired the short grey day seemed a long one to those who for various reasons were waiting anxiously for the darkness the court people fretful and on their mettle the townsfolk suspicious duke carl full of amorous longing at her distant cottage beyond the hills gretchen kept herself ready for the trial it was expected that certain great military officers would arrive that night commanders of a victorious host making its way across northern germany with no great respect for the rights of neutral territory often dealing with life and property too rudely to find the coveted treasure it was but one episode in a cruel war duke carl did not wait for the grandly illuminated supper prepared for their reception events precipitated themselves those officers came as practically victorious occupants sheltering themselves for the night in the luxurious rooms of the great palace the army was in fact in motion close behind its leaders who gretchen warm and happy in the arms not of the aged wizard but of the youthful lover are discussing terms for the final absorption of the duchy with those traitorous old councillors at their delicate supper duke carl amuses his companion with caricature amid cries of cheerful laughter of the sleepy courtiers entertaining their martial guests in all their pedantic politeness like people in some farcical dream a priest and certain chosen friends to witness the marriage were to come ere nightfall to the grange the lovers heard as they thought the sound of distant thunder the hours passed as they waited and what came at last was not the priest with his companions could they have been detained by the storm duke carl gently reassures the girlbids her believe in him and wait but through the wind grown to tempest beyond the sound of the violent thunderlouder than any possible thundernearer and nearer comes the storm of the victorious army like some disturbance of the earth itself as they flee into the tumult out of the intolerable confinement and suspense deadset upon them the enlightening the aufklaerung according to the aspiration of duke carl was effected by other hands lessing and herder brilliant precursors of the age of genius which centered in goethe coming well within the natural limits of carls lifetime as precursors goethe gratefully recognised them and understood that there had been a thousand others looking forward to a new era in german literature with the desire which is in some sort a forecast of capacity awakening each other to the permanent reality of a poetic ideal in human life slowly forming that public consciousness to which goethe actually addressed himself it is their aspirations i have tried to embody in the portrait of carl a hard winter had covered the main with a firm footing of ice the liveliest social intercourse was quickened thereon i was unfailing from early morning onwards and being lightly clad found myself when my mother drove up later to look on fairly frozen my mother sat in the carriage quite stately in her furred cloak of red velvet fastened on the breast with thick gold cord and tassels dear mother i said on the spur of the moment give me your furs i am frozen she was equally ready in a moment i had on the cloak falling below the knee with its rich trimming of sables and enriched with gold it became me excellently so clad i made my way up and down with a cheerful heart that was goethe perhaps fifty years later his mother also related the incident to bettina brentanothere skated my son like an arrow among the groups away he went over the ice like a son of the gods anything so beautiful is not to be seen now i clapped my hands for joy never shall i forget him as he darted out from one arch of the bridge and in again under the other the wind carrying the train behind him as he flew in that amiable figure i seem to see the fulfilment of the resurgam on carls empty coffinthe aspiring soul of carl himself in freedom and effective at last
