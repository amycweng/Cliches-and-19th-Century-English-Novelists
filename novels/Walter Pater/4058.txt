empress faustina herself and all the elegant bluestockings of the day who maintained people said their private sophists to whisper philosophy into their ears winsomely as they performed the duties of the toiletwas assembled again a few months later in a different place and for a very different purpose the temple of peace a modernising foundation of hadrian enlarged by a library and lecturerooms had grown into an institution like something between a college and a literary club and here cornelius fronto was to pronounce a discourse on the nature of morals there were some indeed who had desired the emperor aurelius himself to declare his whole mind on this matter rhetoric was become almost a function of the state philosophy was upon the throne and had from time to time by request delivered an official utterance with wellnigh divine authority and it was as the delegate of this authority under the full sanction of the philosophic emperoremperor and pontiff that the aged fronto purposed today to expound some parts of the stoic doctrine with the view of recommending morals to that refined but perhaps prejudiced company as being in effect one mode of comeliness in thingsas it were music or a kind of artistic order in life and he did this earnestly with an outlay of all his science of mind and that eloquence of which he was known to be a master for stoicism was no longer a rude and unkempt thing received at court it had largely decorated itself it was grown persuasive and insinuating and sought not only to convince mens intelligence but to allure their souls associated with the beautiful old age of the great rhetorician and his winning voice it was almost epicurean and the old man was at his best on the occasion the last on which he ever appeared in this way today was his own birthday early in the morning the imperial letter of congratulation had reached him and all the pleasant animation it had caused was in his face when assisted by his daughter gratia he took his place on the ivory chair as president of the athenaeum of rome wearing with a wonderful grace the philosophic pallin reality neither more nor less than the loose woollen cloak of the common soldier but fastened on his right shoulder with a magnificent clasp the emperors birthday gift it was an age as abundant evidence shows whose delight in rhetoric was but one result of a general susceptibilityan age not merely taking pleasure in words but experiencing a great moral power in them frontos quaintly fashionable audience would have wept and also assisted with their purses had his present purpose been as sometimes happened the recommendation of an object of charity as it was arranging themselves at their ease among the images and flowers these amateurs of exquisite language with their tablets open for careful record of felicitous word or phrase were ready to give themselves wholly to the intellectual treat prepared for them applauding blowing loud kisses through the air sometimes at the speakers triumphant exit from one of his long skilfully modulated sentences while the younger of them meant to imitate everything about him down to the inflections of his voice and the very folds of his mantle certainly there was rhetoric enougha wealth of imagery illustrations from painting music mythology the experiences of love a management by which subtle unexpected meaning was brought out of familiar terms like flies from morsels of amber to use frontos own figure but with all its richness the higher claim of his style was rightly understood to lie in gravity and selfcommand and an especial care for the purities of a vocabulary which rejected every expression unsanctioned by the authority of approved ancient models and it happened with marius as it will sometimes happen that this general discourse to a general audience had the effect of an utterance adroitly designed for him his conscience still vibrating painfully under the shock of that scene in the amphitheatre and full of the ethical charm of cornelius he was questioning himself with much impatience as to the possibility of an adjustment between his own elaborately thoughtout intellectual scheme and the old morality in that intellectual scheme indeed the old morality had so far been allowed no place as seeming to demand from him the admission of certain first principles such as might misdirect or retard him in his efforts towards a complete manysided existence or distort the revelations of the experience of life or curtail his natural liberty of heart and mind but now his imagination being occupied for the moment with the noble and resolute air the gallantry so to call it which composed the outward mien and presentment of his strange friends inflexible ethics he felt already some nascent suspicion of his philosophic programme in regard precisely to the question of good taste there was the taint of a graceless antinomianism perceptible in it a dissidence a revolt against accustomed modes the actual impression of which on other men might rebound upon himself in some loss of that personal pride to which it was part of his theory of life to allow so much and it was exactly a moral situation such as this that fronto appeared to be contemplating he seemed to have before his mind the case of onecyrenaic or epicurean as the courtier tends to be by habit and instinct if not on principlewho yet experiences actually a strong tendency to moral assents and a desire with as little logical inconsistency as may be to find a place for duty and righteousness in his house of thought and the stoic professor found the key to this problem in the purely sthetic beauty of the old morality as an element in things fascinating to the imagination to good taste in its most highly developed form through associationa system or order as a matter of fact in possession not only of the larger world but of the rare minority of lite intelligences from which therefore least of all would the sort of epicurean he had in view endure to become so to speak an outlaw he supposed his hearer to be with all sincerity in search after some principle of conduct and it was here that he seemed to marius to be speaking straight to him which might give unity of motive to an actual rectitude a cleanness and probity of life determined partly by natural affection partly by enlightened selfinterest or the feeling of honour due in part even to the mere fear of penalties no element of which however was distinctively moral in the agent himself as such and providing him therefore no common ground with a really moral being like cornelius or even like the philosophic emperor performing the same offices actually satisfying even as they the external claims of others rendering to all their duesone thus circumstanced would be wanting nevertheless in the secret of inward adjustment to the moral agents around him how tenderlymore tenderly than many stricter soulshe might yield himself to kindly instinct what fineness of charity in passing judgment on others what an exquisite conscience of other mens susceptibilities he knows for how much the manner because the heart itself counts in doing a kindness he goes beyond most people in his care for all weakly creatures judging instinctively that to be but sentient is to possess rights he conceives a hundred duties though he may not call them by that name of the existence of which purely duteous souls may have no suspicion he has a kind of pride in doing more than they in a way of his own sometimes he may think that those men of line and rule do not really understand their own business how narrow inflexible unintelligent what poor guardians he may reason of the inward spirit of righteousness are some supposed careful walkers according to its letter and form and yet all the while he admits as such no moral world at all no theoretic equivalent to so large a proportion of the facts of life but over and above such practical rectitude thus determined by natural affection or selflove or fear he may notice that there is a remnant of right conduct what he does still more what he abstains from doing not so much through his own free election as from a deference an assent entire habitual unconscious to customto the actual habit or fashion of others from whom he could not endure to break away any more than he would care to be out of agreement with them on questions of mere manner or say even of dress yes there were the evils the vices which he avoided as essentially a failure in good taste an assent such as this to the preferences of others might seem to be the weakest of motives and the rectitude it could determine the least considerable element in a moral life yet here according to cornelius fronto was in truth the revealing example albeit operating upon comparative trifles of the general principle required there was one great idea associated with which that determination to conform to precedent was elevated into the clearest the fullest the weightiest principle of moral action a principle under which one might subsume mens most strenuous efforts after righteousness and he proceeded to expound the idea of humanityof a universal commonwealth of mind which becomes explicit and as if incarnate in a select communion of just men made perfect ho kosmos hsanei polis estinthe world is as it were a commonwealth a city and there are observances customs usages actually current in it things our friends and companions will expect of us as the condition of our living there with them at all as really their peers or fellowcitizens those observances were indeed the creation of a visible or invisible aristocracy in it whose actual manners whose preferences from of old become now a weighty tradition as to the way in which things should or should not be done are like a music to which the intercourse of life proceedssuch a music as no one who had once caught its harmonies would willingly jar in this way the becoming as in greekto prepon or ta th mores manners as both greeks and romans said would indeed be a comprehensive term for duty righteousness would be in the words of caesar himself of the philosophic aurelius but a following of the reasonable will of the oldest the most venerable of cities of politiesof the royal the lawgiving element thereinforasmuch as we are citizens also in that supreme city on high of which all other cities beside are but as single habitations but as the old man spoke with animation of this supreme city this invisible society whose conscience was become explicit in its inner circle of inspired souls of whose common spirit the trusted leaders of human conscience had been but the mouthpiece of whose successive personal preferences in the conduct of life the old morality was the summarius felt that his own thoughts were passing beyond the actual intention of the speaker not in the direction of any clearer theoretic or abstract definition of that ideal commonwealth but rather as if in search of its visible locality and abidingplace the walls and towers of which so to speak he might really trace and tell according to his own old natural habit of mind it would be the fabric the outward fabric of a system reaching certainly far beyond the great city around him even if conceived in all the machinery of its visible and invisible influences at their grandestas augustus or trajan might have conceived of themhowever well the visible rome might pass for a figure of that new unseen rome on high at moments marius even asked himself with surprise whether it might be some vast secret society the speaker had in viewthat august community to be an outlaw from which to be foreign to the manners of which was a loss so much greater than to be excluded into the ends of the earth from the sovereign roman commonwealth humanity a universal order the great polity its aristocracy of elect spirits the mastery of their example over their successorsthese were the ideas stimulating enough in their way by association with which the stoic professor had attempted to elevate to unite under a single principle mens moral efforts himself lifted up with so genuine an enthusiasm but where might marius search for all this as more than an intellectual abstraction where were those elect souls in whom the claim of humanity became so amiable winning persuasivewhose footsteps through the world were so beautiful in the actual order he sawwhose faces averted from him would be more than he could bear where was that comely order to which as a great fact of experience he must give its due to which as to all other beautiful phenomena in life he must for his own peace adjust himself rome did well to be serious the discourse ended somewhat abruptly as the noise of a great crowd in motion was heard below the walls whereupon the audience following the humour of the younger element in it poured into the colonnade from the steps of which the famous procession or transvectio of the military knights was to be seen passing over the forum from their trystingplace at the temple of mars to the temple of the dioscuri the ceremony took place this year not on the day accustomedanniversary of the victory of lake regillus with its pair of celestial assistantsand amid the heat and roses of a roman july but by anticipation some months earlier the almondtrees along the way being still in leafless flower through that light trelliswork marius watched the riders arrayed in all their gleaming ornaments and wearing wreaths of olive around their helmets the faces below which what with battle and the plague were almost all youthful it was a flowery scene enough but had today its fulness of warlike meaning the return of the army to the north where the enemy was again upon the move being now imminent cornelius had ridden along in his place and on the dismissal of the company passed below the steps where marius stood with that new song he had heard once before floating from his lips notes transliteration ho kosmos hsanei polis estin translation the world is like a city transliteration to prepon ta th translation that which is seemly mores chapter xvi second thoughts and marius for his part was grave enough the discourse of cornelius fronto with its wide prospect over the human the spiritual horizon had set him on a reviewon a review of the isolating narrowness in particular of his own theoretic scheme long after the very latest roses were faded when the town had departed to country villas or the baths or the war he remained behind in rome anxious to try the lastingness of his own epicurean rosegarden setting to work over again and deliberately passing from point to point of his old argument with himself down to its practical conclusions that age and our own have much in commonmany difficulties and hopes let the reader pardon me if here and there i seem to be passing from marius to his modern representativesfrom rome to paris or london what really were its claims as a theory of practice of the sympathies that determine practice it had been a theory avowedly of loss and gain so to call it of an economy if therefore it missed something in the commerce of life which some other theory of practice was able to include if it made a needless sacrifice then it must be in a manner inconsistent with itself and lack theoretic completeness did it make such a sacrifice what did it lose or cause one to lose and we may note as marius could hardly have done that cyrenaicism is ever the characteristic philosophy of youth ardent but narrow in its surveysincere but apt to become onesided or even fanatical it is one of those subjective and partial ideals based on vivid because limited apprehension of the truth of one aspect of experience in this case of the beauty of the world and the brevity of mans life there which it may be said to be the special vocation of the young to express in the school of cyrene in that comparatively fresh greek world we see this philosophy where it is least blas as we say in its most pleasant its blithest and yet perhaps its wisest form youthfully bright in the youth of european thought but it grows young again for a while in almost every youthful soul it is spoken of sometimes as the appropriate utterance of jaded men but in them it can hardly be sincere or by the nature of the case an enthusiasm walk in the ways of thine heart and in the sight of thine eyes is indeed most often according to the supposition of the book from which i quote it the counsel of the young who feel that the sunshine is pleasant along their veins and wintry weather though in a general sense foreseen a long way off the youthful enthusiasm or fanaticism the selfabandonment to one favourite mode of thought or taste which occurs quite naturally at the outset of every really vigorous intellectual career finds its special opportunity in a theory such as that so carefully put together by marius just because it seems to call on one to make the sacrifice accompanied by a vivid sensation of power and will of what others valuesacrifice of some conviction or doctrine or supposed first principlefor the sake of that cleareyed intellectual consistency which is like spotless bodily cleanliness or scrupulous personal honour and has itself for the mind of the youthful student when he first comes to appreciate it the fascination of an ideal the cyrenaic doctrine then realised as a motive of strenuousness or enthusiasm is not so properly the utterance of the jaded epicurean as of the strong young man in all the freshness of thought and feeling fascinated by the notion of raising his life to the level of a daring theory while in the first genial heat of existence the beauty of the physical world strikes potently upon his wideopen unwearied senses he discovers a great new poem every spring with a hundred delightful things he too has felt but which have never been expressed or at least never so truly before the workshops of the artists who can select and set before us what is really most distinguished in visible life are open to him he thinks that the old platonic or the new baconian philosophy has been better explained than by the authors themselves or with some striking original development this very month in the quiet heat of early summer on the dusty gold morning the music comes louder at intervals above the hum of voices from some neighbouring church among the flowering trees valued now perhaps only for the poetically rapt faces among priests or worshippers or the mere skill and eloquence it may be of its preachers of faith and righteousness in his scrupulous idealism indeed he too feels himself to be something of a priest and that devotion of his days to the contemplation of what is beautiful a sort of perpetual religious service afar off how many fair cities and delicate seacoasts await him at that age with minds of a certain constitution no very choice or exceptional circumstances are needed to provoke an enthusiasm something like this life in modern london even in the heavy glow of summer is stuff sufficient for the fresh imagination of a youth to build its palace of art of and the very sense and enjoyment of an experience in which all is new are but enhanced like that glow of summer itself by the thought of its brevity giving him something of a gamblers zest in the apprehension by dexterous act or diligently appreciative thought of the highly coloured moments which are to pass away so quickly at bottom perhaps in his elaborately developed selfconsciousness his sensibilities his almost fierce grasp upon the things he values at all he has beyond all others an inward need of something permanent in its character to hold by of which circumstance also he may be partly aware and that as with the brilliant claudio in measure for measure it is in truth but darkness he is encountering like a bride but the inevitable falling of the curtain is probably distant and in the daylight at least it is not often that he really shudders at the thought of the gravethe weight above the narrow world and its company within when the thought of it does occur to him he may say to himselfwell and the rude monk for instance who has renounced all this on the security of some dim world beyond it really acquiesces in that fifth act amid all the consoling ministries around him as little as i should at this moment though i may hope that as at the real ending of a play however well acted i may already have had quite enough of it and find a true wellbeing in eternal sleep and precisely in this circumstance that consistently with the function of youth in general cyrenaicism will always be more or less the special philosophy or prophecy of the young when the ideal of a rich experience comes to them in the ripeness of the receptive if not of the reflective powersprecisely in this circumstance if we rightly consider it lies the duly prescribed corrective of that philosophy for it is by its exclusiveness and by negation rather than positively that such theories fail to satisfy us permanently and what they really need for their correction is the complementary influence of some greater system in which they may find their due place that sturm und drang of the spirit as it has been called that ardent and special apprehension of halftruths in the enthusiastic and as it were prophetic advocacy of which devotion to truth in the case of the youngapprehending but one point at a time in the great circumferencemost usually embodies itself is levelled down safely enough afterwards as in history so in the individual by the weakness and mere weariness as well as by the maturer wisdom of our nature and though truth indeed resides as has been said in the wholein harmonisings and adjustments like thisyet those special apprehensions may still owe their full value in this sense of the whole to that earlier onesided but ardent preoccupation with them cynicism and cyrenaicismthey are the earlier greek forms of roman stoicism and epicureanism and in that world of old greek thought we may notice with some surprise that in a little while the nobler form of cyrenaicismcyrenaicism cured of its faultsmet the nobler form of cynicism halfway starting from opposed points they merged each in its most refined form in a single ideal of temperance or moderation something of the same kind may be noticed regarding some later phases of cyrenaic theory if it starts with considerations opposed to the religious temper which the religious temper holds it a duty to repress it is like it nevertheless and very unlike any lower development of temper in its stress and earnestness its serious application to the pursuit of a very unworldly type of perfection the saint and the cyrenaic lover of beauty it may be thought would at least understand each other better than either would understand the mere man of the world carry their respective positions a point further shift the terms a little and they might actually touch perhaps all theories of practice tend as they rise to their best as understood by their worthiest representatives to identification with each other for the variety of mens possible reflections on their experience as of that experience itself is not really so great as it seems and as the highest and most disinterested ethical formulae filtering down into mens everyday existence reach the same poor level of vulgar egotism so we may fairly suppose that all the highest spirits from whatever contrasted points they have started would yet be found to entertain in the moral consciousness realised by themselves much the same kind of mental company to hold far more than might be thought probable at first sight the same personal types of character and even the same artistic and literary types in esteem or aversion to convey all of them alike the same savour of unworldliness and cyrenaicism or epicureanism too new or old may be noticed in proportion to the completeness of its development to approach as to the nobler form of cynicism so also to the more nobly developed phases of the old or traditional morality in the gravity of its conception of life in its pursuit after nothing less than a perfection in its apprehension of the value of timethe passion and the seriousness which are like a consecrationla passion et le srieux qui consacrentit may be conceived as regards its main drift to be not so much opposed to the old morality as an exaggeration of one special motive in it some cramping narrowing costly preference of one part of his own nature and of the nature of things to another marius seemed to have detected in himself meantimein himself as also in those old masters of the cyrenaic philosophy if they did realise the monochronos hdon as it was calledthe pleasure of the ideal nowif certain moments of their lives were highpitched passionately coloured intent with sensation and a kind of knowledge which in its vivid clearness was like sensationif now and then they apprehended the world in its fulness and had a vision almost beatific of ideal personalities in life and art yet these moments were a very costly matter they paid a great price for them in the sacrifice of a thousand possible sympathies of things only to be enjoyed through sympathy from which they detached themselves in intellectual pride in loyalty to a mere theory that would take nothing for granted and assent to no approximate or hypothetical truths in their unfriendly repellent attitude towards the greek religion and the old greek morality surely they had been but faulty economists the greek religion was then alive then still more than in its later day of dissolution the higher view of it was possible even for the philosopher its story made little or no demand for a reasoned or formal acceptance a religion which had grown through and through mans life with so much natural strength had meant so much for so many generations which expressed so much of their hopes in forms so familiar and so winning linked by associations so manifold to man as he had been and wasa religion like this one would think might have had its uses even for a philosophic sceptic yet those beautiful gods with the whole round of their poetic worship the school of cyrene definitely renounced the old greek morality again with all its imperfections was certainly a comely thingyes a harmony a music in mens ways one might well hesitate to jar the merely sthetic sense might have had a legitimate satisfaction in the spectacle of that fair order of choice manners in those attractive conventions enveloping so gracefully the whole of life insuring some sweetness some security at least against offence in the intercourse of the world beyond an obvious utility it could claim indeed but customuseandwont as we sayfor its sanction but then one of the advantages of that liberty of spirit among the cyrenaics in which through theory they had become dead to theory so that all theory as such was really indifferent to them and indeed nothing valuable but in its tangible ministration to life was precisely this that it gave them free play in using as their ministers or servants things which to the uninitiated must be masters or nothing yet how little the followers of aristippus made of that whole comely system of manners or morals then actually in possession of life is shown by the bold practical consequence which one of them maintained with a hard selfopinionated adherence to his peculiar theory of values in the not very amiable paradox that friendship and patriotism were things one could do without while anotherdeathsadvocate as he was calledhelped so many to selfdestruction by his pessimistic eloquence on the evils of life that his lectureroom was closed that this was in the range of their consequencesthat this was a possible if remote deduction from the premisses of the discreet aristippuswas surely an inconsistency in a thinker who professed above all things an economy of the moments of life and yet those old cyrenaics felt their way as if in the dark we may be sure like other men in the ordinary transactions of life beyond the narrow limits they drew of clear and absolutely legitimate knowledge admitting what was not of immediate sensation and drawing upon that fantastic future which might never come a little more of such walking by faith a little more of such not unreasonable assent and they might have profited by a hundred services to their culture from greek religion and greek morality as they actually were the spectacle of their fierce exclusive tenacious hold on their own narrow apprehension makes one think of a picture with no relief no soft shadows nor breadth of space or of a drama without proportionate repose yet it was of perfection that marius to return to him again from his masters his intellectual heirs had been really thinking all the time a narrow perfection it might be objected the perfection of but one part of his naturehis capacities of feeling of exquisite physical impressions of an imaginative sympathybut still a true perfection of those capacities wrought out to their utmost degree admirable enough in its way he too is an economist he hopes by that insight of which the old cyrenaics made so much by skilful apprehension of the conditions of spiritual success as they really are the special circumstances of the occasion with which he has to deal the special felicities of his own nature to make the most in no mean or vulgar sense of the few years of life few indeed for the attainment of anything like general perfection with the brevity of that sum of years his mind is exceptionally impressed and this purpose makes him no frivolous dilettante but graver than other men his scheme is not that of a trifler but rather of one who gives a meaning of his own yet a very real one to those old wordslet us work while it is day he has a strong apprehension also of the beauty of the visible things around him their fading momentary graces and attractions his natural susceptibility in this direction enlarged by experience seems to demand of him an almost exclusive preoccupation with the aspects of things with their sthetic character as it is calledtheir revelations to the eye and the imagination not so much because those aspects of them yield him the largest amount of enjoyment as because to be occupied in this way with the sthetic or imaginative side of things is to be in real contact with those elements of his own nature and of theirs which for him at least are matter of the most real kind of apprehension as other men are concentrated upon truths of number for instance or on business or it may be on the pleasures of appetite so he is wholly bent on living in that full stream of refined sensation and in the prosecution of this love of beauty he claims an entire personal liberty liberty of heart and mind liberty above all from what may seem conventional answers to first questions but without him there is a venerable system of sentiment and idea widely extended in time and place in a kind of impregnable possession of human lifea system which like some other great products of the conjoint efforts of human mind through many generations is rich in the worlds experience so that in attaching oneself to it one lets in a great tide of that experience and makes as it were with a single step a great experience of ones own and with great consequent increase to ones sense of colour variety and relief in the spectacle of men and things the mere sense that one belongs to a systeman imperial system or organisationhas in itself the expanding power of a great experience as some have felt who have been admitted from narrower sects into the communion of the catholic church or as the old roman citizen felt it is we might fancy what the coming into possession of a very widely spoken language might be with a great literature which is also the speech of the people we have to live among a wonderful order actually in possession of human lifegrown inextricably through and through it penetrating into its laws its very language its mere habits of decorum in a thousand halfconscious ways yet still felt to be in part an unfulfilled ideal and as such awakening hope and an aim identical with the one only consistent aspiration of mankind in the apprehension of that just then marius seemed to have joined company once more with his own old self to have overtaken on the road the pilgrim who had come to rome with absolute sincerity on the search for perfection it defined not so much a change of practice as of sympathya new departure an expansion of sympathy it involved certainly some curtailment of his liberty in concession to the actual manner the distinctions the enactments of that great crowd of admirable spirits who have elected so and not otherwise in their conduct of life and are not here to give one so to term it an indulgence but then under the supposition of their disapproval no roses would ever seem worth plucking again the authority they exercised was like that of classic tastean influence so subtle yet so real as defining the loyalty of the scholar or of some beautiful and venerable ritual in which every observance is become spontaneous and almost mechanical yet is found the more carefully one considers it to have a reasonable significance and a natural history and marius saw that he would be but an inconsistent cyrenaic mistaken in his estimate of values of loss and gain and untrue to the wellconsidered economy of life which he had brought with him to romethat some drops of the great cup would fall to the groundif he did not make that concession if he did but remain just there notes transliteration monochronos hdon paters definition the pleasure of the

demanded of the senate a public funeral with a decree for the apothesis or canonisation of the dead for three days the body lay in state in the forum enclosed in an open coffin of cedarwood on a bed of ivory and gold in the centre of a sort of temporary chapel representing the temple of his patroness venus genetrix armed soldiers kept watch around it while choirs of select voices relieved one another in the chanting of hymns or monologues from the great tragedians at the head of the couch were displayed the various personal decorations which had belonged to verus in life like all the rest of rome marius went to gaze on the face he had seen last scarcely disguised under the hood of a travellingdress as the wearer hurried at nightfall along one of the streets below the palace to some amorous appointment unfamiliar as he still was with dead faces he was taken by surprise and touched far beyond what he had reckoned on by the piteous change there even the skill of galen having been not wholly successful in the process of embalming it was as if a brother of his own were lying low before him with that meek and helpless expression it would have been a sacrilege to treat rudely meantime in the centre of the campus martius within the grove of poplars which enclosed the space where the body of augustus had been burnt the great funeral pyre stuffed with shavings of various aromatic woods was built up in many stages separated from each other by a light entablature of woodwork and adorned abundantly with carved and tapestried images upon this pyramidal or flameshaped structure lay the corpse hidden now under a mountain of flowers and incense brought by the women who from the first had had their fondness for the wanton graces of the deceased the dead body was surmounted by a waxen effigy of great size arrayed in the triumphal ornaments at last the centurions to whom that office belonged drew near torch in hand to ignite the pile at its four corners while the soldiers in wild excitement flung themselves around it casting into the flames the decorations they had received for acts of valour under the dead emperors command it had been a really heroic order spoiled a little at the last moment through the somewhat tawdry artifice by which an eaglenot a very noble or youthful specimen of its kindwas caused to take flight amid the real or affected awe of the spectators above the perishing remains a court chamberlain according to ancient etiquette subsequently making official declaration before the senate that the imperial genius had been seen in this way escaping from the fire and marius was present when the fathers duly certified of the fact by acclamation muttering their judgment all together in a kind of low rhythmical chant decreed

conveyance of them to the little cell already populous in the central mass of the sepulchre of hadrian still in all the splendour of its statued colonnades were a matter of private or domestic duty after the due accomplishment of which aurelius was at liberty to retire for a time into the privacy of his beloved apartments of the palatine and hither not long afterwards marius was summoned a second time to receive from the imperial hands the great pile of manuscripts it would be his business to revise and arrange one year had passed since his first visit to the palace and as he climbed the stairs today the great cypresses rocked against the sunless sky like living creatures in pain he had to traverse a long subterranean gallery once a secret entrance to the imperial apartments and in our own day amid the ruin of all around it as smooth and fresh as if the carpets were but just removed from its floor after the return of the emperor from the shows it was here on such an occasion that the emperor caligula at the age of twentynine had come by his end the assassins gliding along it as he lingered a few moments longer to watch the movements of a party of noble youths at their exercise in the courtyard below as marius waited a second time in that little red room in the house of the chief chamberlain curious to look once more upon its painted wallsthe very place whither the assassins were said to have turned for refuge after the murderhe could all but see the figure which in its surrounding light and darkness seemed to him the most melancholy in the entire history of

reasonthe seemingly irredeemable memory and still above all the beautiful head in which the noble lines of the race of augustus were united to he knew not what expression of sensibility and fineness not theirs and for the like of which one must pass onward to the antonines popular hatred had been careful to destroy its semblance wherever it was to be found but one bust in dark bronzelike basalt of a wonderful perfection of finish preserved in the museum of the capitol may have seemed to some visitors there perhaps the finest extant relic of roman art had the very seal of empire upon those sombre brows reflected from his mirror suggested his insane attempt upon the liberties the dignity of meno humanity he seems to ask what hast thou done to me that i should so despise theeand might not this be indeed the true meaning of kingship if the world would have one man to reign over it the like of this or some incredible surely never to be realised height of disinterestedness in a king who should be the servant of all quite at the other extreme of the practical dilemma involved in such a position not till some while after his death had the body been decently interred by the piety of the sisters he had driven into exile fraternity of feeling had been no invariable feature in the incidents of roman story one long vicus sceleratus from its first dim foundation in fraternal quarrel on the morrow of a common deliverance so touchinghad not almost every step in it some gloomy memory of unnatural violence romans did well to fancy the traitress tarpeia still green in earth crowned enthroned at the roots of the capitoline rock if in truth the religion of rome was everywhere in it like that perfume of the funeral incense still upon the air so also was the memory of crime prompted by a hypocritical cruelty down to the erring or not erring vesta calmly buried alive there only eighty years ago under domitian it was with a sense of relief that marius found himself in the presence of aurelius whose gesture of friendly intelligence as he entered raised a smile at the gloomy train of his own thoughts just then although since his first visit to the palace a great change had passed over it the clear daylight found its way now into empty rooms to raise funds for the war aurelius his luxurious brother being no more had determined to sell by auction the accumulated treasures of the imperial household the works of art the dainty furniture had been removed and were now on view in the forum to be the delight or dismay for many weeks to come of the large public of those who were curious in these things in such wise had aurelius come to the condition of philosophic detachment he had affected as a boy hardly persuaded to wear warm clothing or to sleep in more luxurious manner than on the bare floor but in his empty house the man of mind who had always made so much of the pleasures of philosophic contemplation felt freer in thought than ever he had been reading with less selfreproach than usual in the republic of plato those passages which describe the life of the philosopherkingslike that of hired servants in their own housewho possessed of the gold undefiled of intellectual vision forgo so cheerfully all other riches it was one of his happy days one of those rare days when almost with none of the effort otherwise so constant with him his thoughts came rich and full and converged in a mental view as exhilarating to him as the prospect of some wide expanse of landscape to another mans bodily eye he seemed to lie readier than was his wont to the imaginative influence of the philosophic reasonto its suggestions of a possible open country commencing just where all actual experience leaves off but which experience ones own and not anothers may one day occupy in fact he was seeking strength for himself in his own way before he started for that ambiguous earthly warfare which was to occupy the remainder of his life ever remember this he writes that a happy life depends not on many thingsen oligistois keitai and today committing himself with a steady effort of volition to the mere silence of the great empty apartments he might be said to have escaped according to platos promise to those who live closely with philosophy from the evils of the world in his conversations with himself marcus aurelius speaks often of that city on high of which all other cities are but single habitations from him in fact cornelius fronto in his late discourse had borrowed the expression and he certainly meant by it more than the whole commonwealth of rome in any idealisation of it however sublime incorporate somehow with the actual city whose goodly stones were lying beneath his gaze it was also implicate in that reasonable constitution of nature by devout contemplation of which it is possible for man to associate himself to the consciousness of god in that new rome he had taken up his rest for awhile on this day deliberately feeding his thoughts on the better air of it as another might have gone for mental renewal to a favourite villa men seek retirement in countryhouses he writes on the seacoast on the mountains and you have yourself as much fondness for such places as another but there is little proof of culture therein since the privilege is yours of retiring into yourself whensoever you pleaseinto that little farm of ones own mind where a silence so profound may be enjoyed that it could make these retreats was a plain consequence of the kingly prerogative of the mind its dominion over circumstance its inherent libertyit is in thy power to think as thou wilt the essence of things is in thy thoughts about them all is opinion conception no man can be hindered by another what is outside thy circle of thought is nothing at all to it hold to this and you are safe one thing is needfulto live close to the divine genius within thee and minister thereto worthily and the first point in this true ministry this culture was to maintain ones soul in a condition of indifference and calm how continually had public claims the claims of other persons with their rough angularities of character broken in upon him the shepherd of the flock but after all he had at least this privilege he could not part with of thinking as he would and it was well now and then by a conscious effort of will to indulge it for a while under systematic direction the duty of thus making discreet systematic use of the power of imaginative vision for purposes of spiritual culture since the soul takes colour from its fantasies is a point he has frequently insisted on the influence of these seasonable meditationsa symbol or sacrament because an intensified condition of the souls own ordinary and natural lifewould remain upon it perhaps for many days there were experiences he could not forget intuitions beyond price he had come by in this way which were almost like the breaking of a physical light upon his mind as the great augustus was said to have seen a mysterious physical splendour yonder upon the summit of the capitol where the altar of the sibyl now stood with a prayer therefore for inward quiet for conformity to the divine reason he read some select passages of plato which bear upon the harmony of the reason in all its forms with itselfcould there be cosmos that wonderful reasonable order in him and nothing but disorder in the world without it was from this question he had passed on to the vision of a reasonable a divine order not in nature but in the condition of human affairsthat unseen celestial city uranopolis callipolis urbs beatain which a consciousness of the divine will being everywhere realised there would be among other felicitous differences from this lower visible world no more quite hopeless death of men or children or of their affections he had tried today as never before to make the most of this vision of a new rome to realise it as distinctly as he couldand as it were find his way along its streets ere he went down into a world so irksomely different to make his practical effort towards it with a soul full of compassion for men as they were however distinct the mental image might have been to him with the descent of but one flight of steps into the marketplace below it must have retreated again as if at touch of some malign magic wand beyond the utmost verge of the horizon but it had been actually in his clearest vision of it a confused place with but a recognisable entry a tower or fountain here or there and haunted by strange faces whose novel expression he the great physiognomist could by no means read plato indeed had been able to articulate to see at least in thought his ideal city but just because aurelius had passed beyond plato in the scope of the gracious charities he presupposed there he had been unable really to track his way about it ah after all according to plato himself all vision was but reminiscence and this his hearts desire no place his soul could ever have visited in any region of the old worlds achievements he had but divined by a kind of generosity of spirit the void place which another experience than his must fill yet marius noted the wonderful expression of peace of quiet pleasure on the countenance of aurelius as he received from him the rolls of fine clear manuscript fancying the thoughts of the emperor occupied at the moment with the famous prospect towards the alban hills from those lofty windows notes transliteration en oligistois keitai definition it lies in the fewest things chapter xviii the ceremony of the dart the ideas of stoicism so precious to marcus aurelius ideas of large generalisation have sometimes induced in those over whose intellects they have had real power a coldness of heart it was the distinction of aurelius that he was able to harmonise them with the kindness one might almost say the amenities of a humourist as also with the popular religion and its many gods those vasty conceptions of the later greek philosophy had in them in truth the germ of a sort of austerely opinionative natural theology and how often has that led to religious drynessa hard contempt of everything in religion which touches the senses or charms the fancy or really concerns the affections aurelius had made his own the secret of passing naturally and with no violence to his thought to and fro between the richly coloured and romantic religion of those old gods who had still been human beings and a very abstract speculation upon the impassive universal soulthat circle whose centre is everywhere the circumference nowhereof which a series of purely logical necessities had evolved the formula as in many another instance those traditional pieties of the place and the hour had been derived by him from his motherpara ts mtros to theosebes purified as all such religion of concrete time and place needs to be by frequent confronting with the ideal of godhead as revealed to that innate religious sense in the possession of which aurelius differed from the people around him it was the ground of many a sociability with their simpler souls and for himself certainly a consolation whenever the wings of his own soul flagged in the trying atmosphere of purely intellectual vision a host of companions guides helpers about him from of old time the very court and company of heaven objects for him of personal reverence and affectionthe supposed presence of the ancient popular gods determined the character of much of his daily life and might prove the last stay of human nature at its weakest in every time and place he had said it rests with thyself to use the event of the hour religiously at all seasons worship the gods and when he said worship the gods he did it as strenuously as everything else yet here again how often must he have experienced disillusion or even some revolt of feeling at that contact with coarser natures to which his religious conclusions exposed him at the beginning of the year one hundred and seventythree public anxiety was as great as ever and as before it brought peoples superstition into unreserved play for seven days the images of the old gods and some of the graver new ones lay solemnly exposed in the open air arrayed in all their ornaments each in his separate restingplace amid lights and burning incense while the crowd following the imperial example daily visited them with offerings of flowers to this or that particular divinity according to the devotion of each but supplementing these older official observances the very wildest gods had their share of worshipstrange creatures with strange secrets startled abroad into open daylight the delirious sort of religion of which marius was a spectator in the streets of rome during the seven days of the lectisternium reminded him now and again of an observation of apuleius it was as if the presence of the gods did not do men good but disordered or weakened them some jaded women of fashion especially found in certain oriental devotions at once relief for their religiously tearful souls and an opportunity for personal display preferring this or that mystery chiefly because the attire required in it was suitable to their peculiar manner of beauty and one morning marius encountered an extraordinary crimson object borne in a litter through an excited crowdthe famous courtesan benedicta still fresh from the bath of blood to which she had submitted herself sitting below the scaffold where the victims provided for that purpose were slaughtered by the priests even on the last day of the solemnity when the emperor himself performed one of the oldest ceremonies of the roman religion this fantastic piety had asserted itself there were victims enough certainly brought from the choice pastures of the sabine mountains and conducted around the city they were to die for in almost continuous procession covered with flowers and wellnigh worried to death before the time by the crowds of people superstitiously pressing to touch them but certain oldfashioned romans in these exceptional circumstances demanded something more than this in the way of a human sacrifice after the ancient pattern as when not so long since some greeks or gauls had been buried alive in the forum at least human blood should be shed and it was through a wild multitude of fanatics cutting their flesh with knives and whips and licking up ardently the crimson stream that the emperor repaired to the temple of bellona and in solemn symbolic act cast the bloodstained spear or dart carefully preserved there towards the enemys country towards that unknown world of german homes still warm as some believed under the faint northern twilight with those innocent affections of which romans had lost the sense and this at least was clear amid all doubts of abstract right or wrong on either side that the ruin of those homes was involved in what aurelius was then preparing for withyes the gods be thanked for that achievement of an invigorating philosophyalmost with a light heart for in truth that departure really so difficult to him for which marcus aurelius had needed to brace himself so strenuously came to test the power of a longstudied theory of practice and it was the development of this theorya theria literallya view an intuition of the most important facts and still more important possibilities concerning man in the world that marius now discovered almost as if by accident below the dry surface of the manuscripts entrusted to him the great purple rolls contained first of all statistics a general historical account of the writers own time and an exact diary all alike though in three different degrees of nearness to the writers own personal experience laborious formal selfsuppressing this was for the instruction of the public and part of it has perhaps found its way into the augustan histories but it was for the especial guidance of his son commodus that he had permitted himself to break out here and there into reflections upon what was passing into conversations with the reader and then as though he were put off his guard in this way there had escaped into the heavy matteroffact of which the main portion was composed morsels of his conversation with himself it was the romance of a soul to be traced only in hints wayside notes quotations from older masters as it were in lifelong and often baffled search after some vanished or elusive golden fleece or hesperidean fruittrees or some mysterious light of doctrine ever retreating before him a man he had seemed to marius from the first of two lives as we say of what nature he had sometimes wondered on the day for instance when he had interrupted the emperors musings in the empty palace might be that placid inward guest or inhabitant who from amid the preoccupations of the man of practical affairs looked out as if surprised at the things and faces around here then under the tame surface of what was meant for a life of business marius discovered welcoming a brother the spontaneous selfrevelation of a soul as delicate as his owna soul for which conversation with itself was a necessity of existence marius indeed had always suspected that the sense of such necessity was a peculiarity of his but here certainly was another in this respect like himself and again he seemed to detect the advent of some new or changed spirit into the world mystic inward hardly to be satisfied with that wholly external and objective habit of life which had been sufficient for the old classic soul his purely literary curiosity was greatly stimulated by this example of a book of selfportraiture it was in fact the position of the modern essayistcreature of efforts rather than of achievements in the matter of apprehending truth but at least conscious of lights by the way which he must needs record acknowledge what seemed to underlie that position was the desire to make the most of every experience that might come outwardly or from within to perpetuate to display what was so fleeting in a kind of instinctive pathetic protest against the imperial writers own theorythat theory of the perpetual flux of all thingsto marius himself so plausible from of old there was besides a special moral or doctrinal significance in the making of such conversation with ones self at all the logos the reasonable spark in man is common to him with the godskoinos aut pros tous theouscum diis communis that might seem but the truism of a certain school of philosophy but in aurelius was clearly an original and lively apprehension there could be no inward conversation with ones self such as this unless there were indeed some one else aware of our actual thoughts and feelings pleased or displeased at ones disposition of ones self cornelius fronto too could enounce that theory of the reasonable community between men and god in many different ways but then he was a cheerful man and aurelius a singularly sad one and what to fronto was but a doctrine or a motive of mere rhetoric was to the other a consolation he walks and talks for a spiritual refreshment lacking which he would faint by the way with what to the learned professor is but matter of philosophic eloquence in performing his public religious functions marcus aurelius had ever seemed like one who took part in some great process a great thing really done with more than the actually visible assistants about him here in these manuscripts in a hundred marginal flowers of thought or language in happy new phrases of his own like the impromptus of an actual conversation in quotations from other older masters of the inward life taking new significance from the chances of such intercourse was the record of his communion with that eternal reason which was also his own proper self with the divine companion whose tabernacle was in the intelligence of menthe journal of his daily commerce with that chance or providence chance or wisdom one with nature and man reaching from end to end through all time and all existence orderly disposing all things according to fixed periods as he describes it in terms very like certain wellknown words of the book of wisdomthose are the fenced opposites of the speculative dilemma the tragic embarras of which aurelius cannot too often remind himself as the summary of mans situation in the world if there be however a provident soul like this behind the veil truly even to him even in the most intimate of those conversations it has never yet spoken with any quite irresistible assertion of its presence yet ones choice in that speculative dilemma as he has found it is on the whole a matter of willtis in thy power here too again to think as thou wilt for his part he has asserted his will and has the courage of his opinion to the better of two things if thou findest that turn with thy whole heart eat and drink ever of the best before thee wisdom says that other disciple of the sapiential philosophy hath mingled her wine she hath also prepared herself a table tou aristou apolaue partake ever of her best and what marius peeping now very closely upon the intimacies of that singular mind found a thing actually pathetic and affecting was the manner of the writers bearing as in the presence of this supposed guest so elusive so jealous of any palpable manifestation of himself so taxing to ones faith never allowing one to lean frankly upon him and feel wholly at rest only he would do his part at least in maintaining the constant fitness the sweetness and quiet of the guestchamber seeming to vary with the intellectual fortune of the hour from the plainest account of experience to a sheer fantasy only believed because it was impossible that one hope was at all events sufficient to make mens common pleasures and their common ambition above all their commonest vices seem very petty indeed too petty to know of it bred in him a kind of magnificence of character in the old greek sense of the term a temper incompatible with any merely plausible advocacy of his convictions or merely superficial thoughts about anything whatever or talk about other people or speculation as to what was passing in their so visibly little souls or much talking of any kind however clever or graceful a soul thus disposed had already entered into the better lifewas indeed in some sort a priest a minister of the gods hence his constant recollection a close watching of his soul of a kind almost unique in the ancient worldbefore all things examine into thyself strive to be at home with thyselfmarius a sympathetic witness of all this might almost seem to have had a foresight of monasticism itself in the prophetic future with this mystic companion he had gone a step onward out of the merely objective pagan existence here was already a master in that craft of selfdirection which was about to play so large a part in the forming of human mind under the sanction of the christian church yet it was in truth a somewhat melancholy service a service on which one must needs move about solemn serious depressed with the hushed footsteps of those who move about the house where a dead body is lying such was the impression which occurred to marius again and again as he read with a growing sense of some profound dissidence from his author by certain quite traceable links of association he was reminded in spite of the moral beauty of the philosophic emperors ideas how he had sat essentially unconcerned at the public shows for actually his contemplations had made him of a sad heart inducing in him that melancholytristitiawhich even the monastic moralists have held to be of the nature of deadly sin akin to the sin of desidia or inactivity resignation a sombre resignation a sad heart patient bearing of the burden of a sad heartyes this belonged doubtless to the situation of an honest thinker upon the world only in this case there seemed to be too much of a complacent acquiescence in the world as it is and there could be no true thodic in that no real accommodation of the world as it is to the divine pattern of the logos the eternal reason over against it it amounted to a tolerance of evil the soul of good though it moveth upon a way thou canst but little understand yet prospereth on the journey if thou sufferest nothing contrary to nature there can be nought of evil with thee therein if thou hast done aught in harmony with that reason in which men are communicant with the gods there also can be nothing of evil with theenothing to be afraid of whatever is is right as from the hand of one dispensing to every man according to his desert if reason fulfil its part in things what more dost thou require dost thou take it ill that thy stature is but of four cubits that which happeneth to each of us is for the profit of the whole the profit of the wholethat was sufficient links in a train of thought really generous of which nevertheless the forced and yet facile optimism refusing to see evil anywhere might lack after all the secret of genuine cheerfulness it left in truth a weight upon the spirits and with that weight unlifted there could be no real justification of the ways of heaven to man let thine air be cheerful he had said and with an effort did himself at times attain to that serenity of aspect which surely ought to accompany as their outward flower and favour hopeful assumptions like those still what in aurelius was but a passing expression was with cornelius marius could but note the contrast nature and a veritable physiognomy with cornelius in fact it was nothing less than the joy which dante apprehended in the blessed spirits of the perfect the outward semblance of which like a reflex of physical light upon human faces from the land which is very far off we may trace from giotto onward to its consummation in the work of raphaelthe serenity the durable cheerfulness of those who have been indeed delivered from death and of which the utmost degree of that famed blitheness of the greeks had been but a transitory gleam as in careless and wholly superficial youth and yet in cornelius it was certainly united with the bold recognition of evil as a fact in the world real as an aching in the head or heart which one instinctively desires to have cured an enemy with whom no terms could be made visible hatefully visible in a thousand formsthe apparent waste of mens gifts in an early or even in a late grave the death as such of men and even of animals the disease and pain of the body and there was another point of dissidence between aurelius and his readerthe philosophic emperor was a despiser of the body since it is the peculiar privilege of reason to move within herself and to be proof against corporeal impressions suffering neither sensation nor passion to break in upon her it follows that the true interest of the spirit must ever be to treat the bodywell as a corpse attached thereto rather than as a living companionnay actually to promote its dissolution in counterpoise to the inhumanity of this presenting itself to the young reader as nothing less than a sin against nature the very person of cornelius was nothing less than a sanction of that reverent delight marius had always had in the visible body of man such delight indeed had been but a natural consequence of the sensuous or materialistic character of the philosophy of his choice now to cornelius the body of man was unmistakeably as a later seer terms it the one true temple in the world or rather itself the proper object of worship of a sacred service in which the very finest gold might have its seemliness and due symbolic useah and of what awestricken pity also in its dejection in the perishing gray bones of a poor mans grave some flaw of vision thought marius must be involved in the philosophers contempt for itsome diseased point of thought or moral dulness leading logically to what seemed to him the strangest of all the emperors inhumanities the temper of the suicide for which there was just then indeed a sort of mania in the world tis part of the business of life he read to lose it handsomely on due occasion one might give life the slip the moral or mental powers might fail one and then it were a fair question precisely whether the time for taking leave was not comethou canst leave this prison when thou wilt go forth boldly just there in the bare capacity to entertain such question at all there was what marius with a soul which must always leap up in loyal gratitude for mere physical sunshine touching him as it touched the flies in the air could not away with there surely was a sign of some crookedness in the natural power of apprehension it was the attitude the melancholy intellectual attitude of one who might be greatly mistaken in thingswho might make the greatest of mistakes a heart that could forget itself in the misfortune or even in the weakness of othersof this marius had certainly found the trace as a confidant of the emperors conversations with himself in spite of those jarring inhumanities of that pretension to a stoical indifference and the many difficulties of his manner of writing he found it again not long afterwards in still stronger evidence in this way as he read one morning early there slipped from the rolls of manuscript a sealed letter with the emperors superscription which might well be of importance and he felt bound to deliver it at once in person aurelius being then absent from rome in one of his favourite retreats at praeneste taking a few days of quiet with his young children before his departure for the war a whole day passed as marius crossed the campagna on horseback pleased by the random autumn lights bringing out in the distance the sheep at pasture the shepherds in their picturesque dress the golden elms tower and villa and it was after dark that he mounted the steep street of the little hilltown to the imperial residence he was struck by an odd mixture of stillness and excitement about the place lights burned at the windows it seemed that numerous visitors were within for the courtyard was crowded with litters and horses in waiting for the moment indeed all larger cares even the cares of war of late so heavy a pressure had been forgotten in what was passing with the little annius verus who for his part had forgotten his toys lying all day across the knees of his mother as a mere childs earache grew rapidly to alarming sickness with great and manifest agony only suspended a little from time to time when from very weariness he passed into a few moments of unconsciousness the country surgeon called in had removed the imposthume with the knife there had been a great effort to bear this operation for the terrified child hardly persuaded to submit himself when his pain was at its worst and even more for the parents at length amid a company of pupils pressing in with him as the custom was to watch the proceedings in the sickroom the eminent galen had arrived only to pronounce the thing done visibly useless the patient falling now into longer intervals of delirium and thus thrust on one side by the crowd of departing visitors marius was forced into the privacy of a grief the desolate face of which went deep into his memory as he saw the emperor carry the child awayquite conscious at last but with a touching expression upon it of weakness and defeatpressed close to his bosom as if he yearned just then for one thing only to be united to be absolutely one with it in its obscure distress notes transliteration para ts mtros to theosebes translation rites deriving from his mother transliteration koinos aut pros tous theous translation common to him together with the gods transliteration tou aristou apolaue translation always take the best not indented in the original chapter xix the will as vision paratum cor meum deus paratum cor meum the emperor demanded a senatorial decree for the erection of images in memory of the dead prince that a golden one should be carried together with the other images in the great procession of the circus and the addition of the childs name to the hymn of the salian priests and so stifling private grief without further delay set forth for the war true kingship as plato the old master of aurelius had understood it was essentially of the nature of a service if so be you can discover a mode of life more desirable than the being a king for those who shall be kings then the true ideal of the state will become a possibility but not otherwise and if the life of beatific vision be indeed possible if philosophy really concludes in an ecstasy affording full fruition to the entire nature of man then for certain elect souls at least a mode of life will have been discovered more desirable than to be a king by love or fear you might induce such persons to forgo their privilege to take upon them the distasteful task of governing other men or even of leading them to victory in battle but by the very conditions of its tenure their dominion would be wholly a ministry to others they would have taken upon them the form of a servant they would be reigning for the wellbeing of others rather than their own the true king the righteous king would be

about the transitory appearances of things in a lower degree lower in proportion as the highest platonic dream is lower than any christian vision the true king would be marcus aurelius drawn from the meditation of books to be the ruler of the roman people in peace and still more in war to aurelius certainly the philosophic mood the visions however dim which this mood brought with it were sufficiently pleasant to him together with the endearments of his home to make public rule nothing less than a sacrifice of himself according to platos requirement now consummated in his setting forth for the campaign on the danube that it was such a sacrifice was to marius visible fact as he saw him ceremoniously lifted into the saddle amid all the pageantry of an imperial departure yet with the air less of a sanguine and selfreliant leader than of one in some way or other already defeated through the fortune of the subsequent years passing and repassing so inexplicably from side to side the rumour of which reached him amid his own quiet studies marius seemed always to see that central figure with its habitually dejected hue grown now to an expression of positive suffering all the stranger from its contrast with the magnificent armour worn by the emperor on this occasion as it had been worn by his predecessor hadrian totus et argento contextus et auro clothed in its gold and silver dainty as that old divinely constructed armour of which homer tells but without its miraculous lightsomenesshe looked out baffled labouring moribund a mere comfortless shadow taking part in some shadowy reproduction of the labours of hercules through those northern mistladen confines of the civilised world it was as if the familiar soul which had been so friendly disposed towards him were actually departed to hades and when he read the conversations afterwards though his judgment of them underwent no material change it was nevertheless with the allowance we make for the dead the memory of that suffering image while it certainly strengthened his adhesion to what he could accept at all in the philosophy of aurelius added a strange pathos to what must seem the writers mistakes what after all had been the meaning of that incident observed as so fortunate an omen long since when the prince then a little child much younger than was usual had stood in ceremony among the priests of mars and flung his crown of flowers with the rest at the sacred image reclining on the pulvinar the other crowns lodged themselves here or there when lo the crown thrown by aurelius the youngest of them all alighted upon the very brows of the god as if placed there by a careful hand he was still young also when on the day of his adoption by antoninus pius he saw himself in a dream with as it were shoulders of ivory like the images of the gods and found them more capable than shoulders of flesh yet he was now wellnigh fifty years of age setting out with twothirds of life behind him upon a labour which would fill the remainder of it with anxious caresa labour for which he had perhaps no capacity and certainly no taste that ancient suit of armour was almost the only object aurelius now possessed from all those much cherished articles of vertu collected by the caesars making the imperial residence like a magnificent museum not men alone were needed for the war so that it became necessary to the great disgust alike of timid persons and of the lovers of sport to arm the gladiators but money also was lacking accordingly at the sole motion of aurelius himself unwilling that the public burden should be further increased especially on the part of the poor the whole of the imperial ornaments and furniture a sumptuous collection of gems formed by hadrian with many works of the most famous painters and sculptors even the precious ornaments of the emperors chapel or lararium and the wardrobe of the empress faustina who seems to have borne the loss without a murmur were exposed for public auction these treasures said aurelius like all else that i possess belong by right to the senate and people was it not a characteristic of the true kings in plato that they had in their houses nothing they could call their own connoisseurs had a keen delight in the mere reading of the praetors list of the property for sale for two months the learned in these matters were daily occupied in the appraising of the embroidered hangings the choice articles of personal use selected for preservation by each succeeding age the great outlandish pearls from hadrians favourite cabinet the marvellous plate lying safe behind the pretty iron wickerwork of the shops in the goldsmiths quarter meantime ordinary persons might have an interest in the inspection of objects which had been as daily companions to people so far above and remote from themthings so fine also in workmanship and material as to seem with their antique and delicate air a worthy survival of the grand bygone eras like select thoughts or utterances embodying the very spirit of the vanished past the town became more pensive than ever over old fashions the welcome amusement of this last act of preparation for the great war being now over all rome seemed to settle down into a singular quiet likely to last long as though bent only on watching from afar the languid somewhat uneventful course of the contest itself marius took advantage of it as an opportunity for still closer study than of old only now and then going out to one of his favourite spots on the sabine or alban hills for a quiet even greater than that of rome in the country air on one of these occasions as if by favour of an invisible power withdrawing some unknown cause of dejection from around him he enjoyed a quite unusual sense of selfpossessionthe possession of his own best and happiest self after some gloomy thoughts overnight he awoke under the full tide of the rising sun himself full in his entire refreshment of that almost religious appreciation of sleep the graciousness of its influence on mens spirits which had made the old greeks conceive of it as a god it was like one of those old joyful wakings of childhood now becoming rarer and rarer with him and looked back upon with much regret as a measure of advancing age in fact the last bequest of this serene sleep had been a dream in which as once before he overheard those he loved best pronouncing his name very pleasantly as they passed through the rich light and shadow of a summer morning along the pavement of a cityah fairer far than rome in a moment as he arose a certain oppression of late setting very heavily upon him was lifted away as though by some physical motion in the air that flawless serenity better than the most pleasurable excitement yet so easily ruffled by chance collision even with the things and persons he had come to value as the greatest treasure in life was to be wholly his today he thought as he rode towards tibur under the early sunshine the marble of its villas glistening all the way before him on the hillside and why could he not hold such serenity of spirit ever at command he asked expert as he was at last become in the art of setting the house of his thoughts in order tis in thy power to think as thou wilt he repeated to himself it was the most serviceable of all the lessons enforced on him by those imperial conversationstis in thy power to think as thou wilt and were the cheerful sociable restorative beliefs of which he had there read so much that bold adhesion for instance to the hypothesis of an eternal friend to man just hidden behind the veil of a mechanical and material order but only just behind it ready perhaps even now to break throughwere they after all really a matter of choice dependent on some deliberate act of volition on his part were they doctrines one might take for granted generously take for granted and led on by them at first as but welldefined objects of hope come at last into the region of a corresponding certitude of the intellect it is the truth i seek he had read the truth by which no one gray and depressing though it might seem was ever really injured and yet on the other hand the imperial wayfarer he had been able to go along with so far on his intellectual pilgrimage let fall many things concerning the practicability of a methodical and selfforced assent to certain principles or presuppositions one could not do without were there as the expression one could not do without seemed to hint beliefs without which life itself must be almost impossible principles which had their sufficient ground of evidence in that very fact experience certainly taught that as regarding the sensible world he could attend or not almost at will to this or that colour this or that train of sounds in the whole tumultuous concourse of colour and sound so it was also for the welltrained intelligence in regard to that hum of voices which besiege the inward no less than the outward ear might it be not otherwise with those various and competing hypotheses the permissible hypotheses which in that open field for hypothesisones own actual ignorance of the origin and tendency of our beingpresent themselves so importunately some of them with so emphatic a reiteration through all the mental changes of successive ages might the will itself be an organ of knowledge of vision on this day truly no mysterious light no irresistibly leading hand from afar reached him only the peculiarly tranquil influence of its first hour increased steadily upon him in a manner with which as he conceived the aspects of the place he was then visiting had something to do the air there air supposed to possess the singular property of restoring the whiteness of ivory was pure and thin an even veil of lawnlike white cloud had now drawn over the sky and under its broad shadowless light every hue and tone of time came out upon the yellow old temples the elegant pillared circle of the shrine of the patronal sibyl the houses seemingly of a piece with the ancient fundamental rock some halfconscious motive of poetic grace would appear to have determined their grouping in part resisting partly going along with the natural wildness and harshness of the place its floods and precipices an air of immense age possessed above all the vegetation arounda world of evergreen treesthe olives especially older than how many generations of mens lives fretted and twisted by the combining forces of life and death into every conceivable caprice of form in the windless weather all seemed to be listening to the roar of the immemorial waterfall plunging down so unassociably among these human habitations and with a motion so unchanging from age to age as to count even in this timeworn place as an image of unalterable rest yet the clear sky all but broke to let through the ray which was silently quickening everything in the late february afternoon and the unseen violet refined itself through the air it was as if the spirit of life in nature were but withholding any too precipitate revelation of itself in its slow wise maturing work through some accident to the trappings of his horse at the inn where he rested marius had an unexpected delay he sat down in an olivegarden and all around him and within still turning to reverie the course of his own life hitherto seemed to withdraw itself into some other world disparted from this spectacular point where he was now placed to survey it like that distant road below along which he had travelled this morning across the campagna through a dreamy land he could see himself moving as if in another life and like another person through all his fortunes and misfortunes passing from point to point weeping delighted escaping from various dangers that prospect brought him first of all an impulse of lively gratitude it was as if he must look round for some one else to share his joy with for some one to whom he might tell the thing for his own relief companionship indeed familiarity with others gifted in this way or that or at least pleasant to him had been through one or another long span of it the chief delight of the journey and was it only the resultant general sense of such familiarity diffused through his memory that in a while suggested the question whether there had not beenbesides flavian besides cornelius even and amid the solitude he had which in spite of ardent friendship perhaps loved best of all thingssome other companion an unfailing companion ever at his side throughout doubling his pleasure in the roses by the way patient of his peevishness or depression sympathetic above all with his grateful recognition onward from his earliest days of the fact that he was there at all must not the whole world around have faded away for him altogether had he been left for one moment really alone in it in his deepest apparent solitude there had been rich entertainment it was as if there were not one only but two wayfarers side by side visible there across the plain as he indulged his fancy a bird came and sang among the wattled hedgeroses an animal feeding crept nearer the child who kept it was gazing quietly and the scene and the hours still conspiring he passed from that mere fantasy of a self not himself beside him in his coming and going to those divinations of a living and companionable spirit at work in all things of which he had become aware from time to time in his old philosophic readingsin plato and others last but not least in aurelius through one reflection upon another he passed from such instinctive divinations to the thoughts which give them logical consistency formulating at last as the necessary exponent of our own and the worlds life that reasonable ideal to which the old testament gives the name of creator which for the philosophers of greece is the eternal reason and in the new testament the father of meneven as one builds up from act and word and expression of the friend actually visible at ones side an ideal of the spirit within him in this peculiar and privileged hour his bodily frame as he could recognise although just then in the whole sum of its capacities so entirely possessed by himnay actually his very selfwas yet determined by a farreaching system of material forces external to it a thousand combining currents from earth and sky its seemingly active powers of apprehension were in fact but susceptibilities to influence the perfection of its capacity might be said to depend on its passive surrender as of a leaf on the wind to the motions of the great stream of physical energy without it and might not the intellectual frame also still more intimately himself as in truth it was after the analogy of the bodily life be a moment only an impulse or series of impulses a single process in an intellectual or spiritual system external to it diffused through all time and placethat great stream of spiritual energy of which his own imperfect thoughts yesterday or today would be but the remote and therefore imperfect pulsations it was the hypothesis boldest though in reality the most conceivable of all hypotheses which had dawned on the contemplations of the two opposed great masters of the old greek thought alikethe world of ideas existent only because and in so far as they are known as plato conceived the creative incorruptible informing mind supposed by aristotle so soberminded yet as regards this matter left something of a mystic after all might not this entire material world the very scene around him the immemorial rocks the firm marble the olivegardens the falling water be themselves but reflections in or a creation of that one indefectible mind wherein he too became conscious for an hour a day for so many years upon what other hypothesis could he so well understand the persistency of all these things for his own intermittent consciousness of them for the intermittent consciousness of so many generations fleeting away one after another it was easier to conceive of the material fabric of things as but an element in a world of thoughtas a thought in a mind than of mind as an element or accident or passing condition in a world of matter because mind was really nearer to himself it was an explanation of what was less known by what was known better the purely material world that close impassable prisonwall seemed just then the unreal thing to be actually dissolving away all around him and he felt a quiet hope a quiet joy dawning faintly in the dawning of this doctrine upon him as a really credible opinion it was like the break of day over some vast prospect with the new city as it were some celestial new rome in the midst of it that divine companion figured no longer as but an occasional wayfarer beside him but rather as the unfailing assistant without whose inspiration and concurrence he could not breathe or see instrumenting his bodily senses rounding supporting his imperfect thoughts how often had the thought of their brevity spoiled for him the most natural pleasures of life confusing even his present sense of them by the suggestion of disease of death of a coming end in everything how had he longed sometimes that there were indeed one to whose boundless power of memory he could commit his own most fortunate moments his admiration his love ay the very sorrows of which he could not bear quite to lose the senseone strong to retain them even though he forgot in whose more vigorous consciousness they might subsist for ever beyond that mere quickening of capacity which was all that remained of them in himself oh that they might live before theetoday at least in the peculiar clearness of one privileged hour he seemed to have apprehended that in which the experiences he valued most might find one by one an abidingplace and again the resultant sense of companionship of a person beside him evoked the faculty of conscienceof conscience as of old and when he had been at his best in the form not of fear nor of selfreproach even but of a certain lively gratitude himselfhis sensations and ideasnever fell again precisely into focus as on that day yet he was the richer by its experience but for once only to have come under the power of that peculiar mood to have felt the train of reflections which belong to it really forcible and conclusive to have been led by them to a conclusion to have apprehended the great ideal so palpably that it defined personal gratitude and the sense of a friendly hand laid upon him amid the shadows of the world left this one particular hour a marked point in life never to be forgotten it gave him a definitely ascertained measure of his moral or intellectual need of the demand his soul must make upon the powers whatsoever they might be which had brought him as he was into the world at all and again would he be faithful to himself to his own habits of mind his leading suppositions if he did but remain just there must not all that remained of life be but a search for the equivalent of that ideal among socalled actual thingsa gathering together of every trace or token of it which his actual experience might present part the fourth chapter xx two curious houses i guests your old men shall dream dreams a nature like that of marius composed in about equal parts of instincts almost physical and of slowly accumulated intellectual judgments was perhaps even less susceptible than other mens characters of essential change and yet the experience of that fortunate hour seeming to gather into one central act of vision all the deeper impressions his mind had ever received did not leave him quite as he had been for his mental view at least it changed measurably the world about him of which he was still indeed a curious spectator but which looked further off was weaker in its hold and in a sense less real to him than ever it was as if he viewed it through a diminishing glass and the permanency of this change he could note some years later when it happened that he was a guest at a feast in which the various exciting elements of roman life its physical and intellectual accomplishments its frivolity and farfetched elegances its strange mystic essays after the unseen were elaborately combined the great apuleius the literary ideal of his boyhood had arrived in romewas now visiting tusculum at the house of their common friend a certain aristocratic poet who loved every sort of superiorities and marius was favoured with an invitation to a supper given in his honour it was with a feeling of halfhumorous concession to his own early boyish heroworship yet with some sense of superiority in himself seeing his old curiosity grown now almost to indifference when on the point of satisfaction at last and upon a juster estimate of its object that he mounted to the little town on the hillside the footways of which were so many flights of easygoing steps gathered round a single great house under shadow of the haunted ruins of ciceros villa on the wooded heights he found a touch of weirdness in the circumstance that in so romantic a place he had been bidden to meet the writer who was come to seem almost like one of the personages in his own fiction as he turned now and then to gaze at the evening scene through the tall narrow openings of the street up which the cattle were going home slowly from the pastures below the alban mountains stretched between the great walls of the ancient houses seemed close at handa screen of vaporous dun purple against the setting sunwith those waves of surpassing softness in the boundary lines which indicate volcanic formation the coolness of the little brown marketplace for profit of which even the workingpeople in long file through the olivegardens were leaving the plain for the night was grateful after the heats of rome those wild country figures clad in every kind of fantastic patchwork stained by wind and weather fortunately enough for the eye under that significant light inclined him to poetry and it was a very delicate poetry of its kind that seemed to enfold him as passing into the poets house he paused for a moment to glance back towards the heights above whereupon the numerous cascades of the precipitous garden of the villa framed in the doorway of the hall fell into a harmless picture in its place among the pictures within and scarcely more real than theya landscapepiece in which the power of water plunging into what unseen depths done to the life was pleasant and without its natural terrors at the further end of this bland apartment fragrant with the rare woods of the old inlaid panelling the falling of aromatic oil from the readylighted lamps the irisroot clinging to the dresses of the guests as with odours from the altars of the gods the suppertable was spread in all the daintiness characteristic of the agreeable petitmatre who entertained he was already most carefully dressed but like martials stella perhaps consciously meant to change his attire once and again during the banquet in the last instance for an ancient vesture object of much rivalry among the young men of fashion at that great sale of the imperial wardrobes a toga of altogether lost hue and texture he wore it with a grace which became the leader of a thrilling movement then on foot for the restoration of that disused garment in which laying aside the customary evening dress all the visitors were requested to appear setting off the delicate sinuosities and welldisposed golden ways of its folds with harmoniously tinted flowers the opulent sunset blending pleasantly with artificial light fell across the quiet ancestral effigies of old consular dignitaries along the wide floor strewn with sawdust of sandalwood and lost itself in the heap of cool coronals lying ready for the foreheads of the guests on a sideboard of old citron the crystal vessels darkened with old wine the hues of the early autumn fruitmulberries pomegranates and grapes that had long been hanging under careful protection upon the vines were almost as much a feast for the eye as the dusky fires of the rare twelvepetalled roses a favourite animal white as snow brought by one of the visitors purred its way gracefully among the winecups coaxed onward from place to place by those at table as they reclined easily on their cushions of german eiderdown spread over the longlegged carved couches a highly refined modification of the acroamaa musical performance during supper for the diversion of the guestswas presently heard hovering round the place soothingly and so unobtrusively that the company could not guess and did not like to ask whether or not it had been designed by their entertainer they inclined on the whole to think it some wonderful peasantmusic peculiar to that wild neighbourhood turning as it did now and then to a solitary reednote like a birds while it wandered into the distance it wandered quite away at last as darkness with a bolder lamplight came on and made way for another sort of entertainment an odd rapid phantasmal glitter advancing from the garden by torchlight defined itself as it came nearer into a dance of young men in armour arrived at length in a portico open to the supperchamber they contrived that their mechanical marchmovement should fall out into a kind of highly expressive dramatic action and with the utmost possible emphasis of dumb motion their long swords weaving a silvery network in the air they danced the death of paris the young commodus already an adept in these matters who had condescended to welcome the eminent apuleius at the banquet had mysteriously dropped from his place to take his share in the performance and at its conclusion reappeared still wearing the dainty accoutrements of paris including a breastplate composed entirely of overlapping tigers claws skilfully gilt the youthful prince had lately assumed the dress of manhood on the return of the emperor for a brief visit from the north putting up his hair in imitation of nero in a golden box dedicated to capitoline jupiter his likeness to aurelius his father was become in consequence more striking than ever and he had one source of genuine interest in the great literary guest of the occasion in that the latter was the fortunate possessor of a monopoly for the exhibition of wild beasts and gladiatorial shows in the province of carthage where he resided still after all complaisance to the perhaps somewhat crude tastes of the emperors son it was felt that with a guest like apuleius whom they had come prepared to entertain as veritable connoisseurs the conversation should be learned and superior and the host at last deftly led his company round to literature by the way of bindings elegant rolls of manuscript from his fine library of ancient greek books passed from hand to hand about the table it was a sign for the visitors themselves to draw their own choicest literary curiosities from their bags as their contribution to the banquet and one of them a famous reader choosing his lucky moment delivered in tenor voice the piece which follows with a preliminary query as to whether it could indeed be the composition of lucian of samosata understood to be the great mocker of that day what sound was that socrates asked chaerephon it came from the beach under the cliff yonder and seemed a long way offand how melodious it was was it a bird i wonder i thought all seabirds were songless aye a seabird answered socrates a bird called the halcyon and has a note full of plaining and tears there is an old story people tell of it it was a mortal woman once daughter of aeolus god of the winds ceyx the son of the morningstar wedded her in her early maidenhood the son was not less fair than the father and when it came to pass that he died the crying of the girl as she lamented his sweet usage was just that and some while after as heaven willed she was changed into a bird floating now on birds wings over the sea she seeks her lost ceyx there since she was not able to find him after long wandering over the land that then is the halcyonthe kingfisher said chaerephon i never heard a bird like it before it has truly a plaintive note what kind of a bird is it socrates not a large bird though she has received large honour from the gods on account of her singular conjugal affection for whensoever she makes her nest a law of nature brings round what is called halcyons weatherdays distinguishable among all others for their serenity though they come sometimes amid the storms of winterdays like today see how transparent is the sky above us and how motionless the sealike a smooth mirror true a halcyon day indeed and yesterday was the same but tell me socrates what is one to think of those stories which have been told from the beginning of birds changed into mortals and mortals into birds to me nothing seems more incredible dear chaerephon said socrates methinks we are but halfblind judges of the impossible and the possible we try the question by the standard of our human faculty which avails neither for true knowledge nor for faith nor vision therefore many things seem to us impossible which are really easy many things unattainable which are within our reach partly through inexperience partly through the childishness of our minds for in truth every man even the oldest of us is like a little child so brief and babyish are the years of our life in comparison of eternity then how can we who comprehend not the faculties of gods and of the heavenly host tell whether aught of that kind be possible or nowhat a tempest you saw three days ago one trembles but to think of the lightning the thunderclaps the violence of the wind you might have thought the whole world was going to ruin and then after a little came this wonderful serenity of weather which has continued till today which do you think the greater and more difficult thing to do to exchange the disorder of that irresistible whirlwind to a clarity like this and becalm the whole world again or to refashion the form of a woman into that of a bird we can teach even little children to do something of that sortto take wax or clay and mould out of the same material many kinds of form one after another without difficulty and it may be that to the deity whose power is too vast for comparison with ours all processes of that kind are manageable and easy how much wider is the whole circle of heaven than thyselfwider than thou canst express among ourselves also how vast the difference we may observe in mens degrees of power to you and me and many another like us many things are impossible which are quite easy to others for those who are unmusical to play on the flute to read or write for those who have not yet learned is no easier than to make birds of women or women of birds from the dumb and lifeless egg nature moulds her swarms of winged creatures aided as some will have it by a divine and secret art in the wide air around us she takes from the honeycomb a little memberless live thing she brings it wings and feet brightens and beautifies it with quaint variety of colourand lo the bee in her wisdom making honey worthy of the gods it follows that we mortals being altogether of little account able wholly to discern no great matter sometimes not even a little one for the most part at a loss regarding what happens even with ourselves may hardly speak with security as to what

seemed to stimulate almost uncontrollably the eloquent stirrings of the eminent man of letters then present the impulse to speak masterfully was visible before the recital was well over in the moving lines about his mouth by no means designed as detractors were wont to say simply to display the beauty of his teeth one of the company expert in his humours made ready to transcribe what he would say the sort of things of which a collection was then forming the florida or flowers so to call them he was apt to let fall by the wayno impromptu ventures at random but rather elaborate carved ivories of speech drawn at length out of the rich treasurehouse of a memory stored with such and as with a fine savour of old musk about them certainly in this case as marius thought it was worth while to hear a charming writer speak discussing quite in our modern way the peculiarities of those suburban views especially the seaviews of which he was a professed lover he was also every inch a priest of aesculapius patronal god of carthage there was a piquancy in his rococo very african and as it were perfumed personality though he was now wellnigh sixty years old a mixture there of that sort of platonic spiritualism which can speak of the soul of man as but a sojourner in the prison of the bodya blending of that with such a relish for merely bodily graces as availed to set the fashion in matters of dress deportment accent and the like nay with something also which reminded marius of the vein of coarseness he had found in the golden book all this made the total impression he conveyed a very uncommon one marius did not wonder as he watched him speaking that people freely attributed to him many of the marvellous adventures he had recounted in that famous romance over and above the wildest version of his own actual storyhis extraordinary marriage his religious initiations his acts of mad generosity his trial as a sorcerer but a sign came from the imperial prince that it was time for the company to separate he was entertaining his immediate neighbours at the table with a trick from the streets tossing his olives in rapid succession into the air and catching them as they fell between his lips his dexterity in this performance made the mirth around him noisy disturbing the sleep of the furry visitor the learned party broke up and marius withdrew glad to escape into the open air the courtesans in their large wigs of false blond hair were lurking for the guests with groups of curious idlers a great conflagration was visible in the distance was it in rome or in one of the villages of the country pausing for a few minutes on the terrace to watch it marius was for the first time able to converse intimately with apuleius and in this moment of confidence the illuminist himself with locks so carefully arranged and seemingly so full of affectations almost like one of those light women there dropped a veil as it were and appeared though still permitting the play of a certain element of theatrical interest in his bizarre tenets to be ready to explain and defend his position reasonably for a moment his fantastic foppishness and his pretensions to ideal vision seemed to fall into some intelligible congruity with each other in truth it was the platonic idealism as he conceived it which for him literally animated and gave him so lively an interest in this world of the purely outward aspects of men and thingsdid material things such things as they had had around them all that evening really need apology for being there to interest one at all were not all visible objectsthe whole material world indeed according to the consistent testimony of philosophy in many formsfull of souls embarrassed perhaps partly imprisoned but still eloquent souls certainly the contemplative philosophy of plato with its figurative imagery and apologue its manifold sthetic colouring its measured eloquence its music for the outward ear had been like platos old master himself a twosided or twocoloured thing apuleius was a platonist only for him the ideas of plato were no creatures of logical abstraction but in very truth informing souls in every type and variety of sensible things those noises in the house all suppertime sounding through the tables and along the wallswere they only startings in the old rafters at the impact of the music and laughter or rather importunities of the secondary selves the true unseen selves of the persons nay of the very things around essaying to break through their frivolous merely transitory surfaces to remind one of abiding essentials beyond them which might have their say their judgment to give by and by when the shifting of the meats and drinks at lifes table would be over and was not this the true significance of the platonic doctrinea hierarchy of divine beings associating themselves with particular things and places for the purpose of mediating between god and manman who does but need due attention on his part to become aware of his celestial company filling the air about him thick as motes in the sunbeam for the glance of sympathetic intelligence he casts through it two kinds there are of animated beings he exclaimed gods entirely differing from men in the infinite distance of their abode since one part of them only is seen by our blunted visionthose mysterious starsin the eternity of their existence in the perfection of their nature infected by no contact with ourselves and men dwelling on the earth with frivolous and anxious minds with infirm and mortal members with variable fortunes labouring in vain taken altogether and in their whole species perhaps eternal but severally quitting the scene in irresistible succession what then has nature connected itself together by no bond allowed itself to be thus crippled and split into the divine and human elements and you will say to me if so it be that man is thus entirely exiled from the immortal gods that all communication is denied him that not one of them occasionally visits us as a shepherd his sheepto whom shall i address my prayers whom shall i invoke as the helper of the unfortunate the protector of the good well there are certain divine powers of a middle nature through whom our aspirations are conveyed to the gods and theirs to us passing between the inhabitants of earth and heaven they carry from one to the other prayers and bounties supplication and assistance being a kind of interpreters this interval of the air is full of them through them all revelations miracles magic processes are effected for specially appointed members of this order have their special provinces with a ministry according to the disposition of each they go to and fro without fixed habitation or dwell in mens houses just then a companions hand laid in the darkness on the shoulder of the speaker carried him away and the discourse broke off suddenly its singular intimations however were sufficient to throw back on this strange evening in all its detailthe dance the readings the distant firea kind of allegoric expression gave it the character of one of those famous platonic figures or apologues which had then been in fact under discussion when marius recalled its circumstances he seemed to hear once more that voice of genuine conviction pleading from amidst a scene at best of elegant frivolity for so boldly mystical a view of man and his position in the world for a moment but only for a moment as he listened the trees had seemed as of old to be growing close against the sky yes the reception of theory of hypothesis of beliefs did depend a great deal on temperament they were so to speak mere equivalents of temperament a celestial ladder a ladder from heaven to earth that was the assumption which the experience of apuleius had suggested to him it was what in different forms certain persons in every age had instinctively supposed they would be glad to find their supposition accredited by the authority of a grave philosophy marius however yearning not less than they in that hard world of rome and below its unpeopled sky for the trace of some celestial wing across it must still object that they assumed the thing with too much facility too much of selfcomplacency and his second thought was that to indulge but for an hour fantasies fantastic visions of that sort only left the actual world more lonely than ever for him certainly and for his solace the little godship for whom the rude countryman an unconscious platonist trimmed his twinkling lamp would never slip from the bark of these immemorial olivetreesno not even in the wildest moonlight for himself it was clear he must still hold by what his eyes really saw only he had to concede also that the very boldness of such theory bore witness at least to a variety of human disposition and a consequent variety of mental view which mightwho can tellbe correspondent to be defined by and define varieties of facts of truths just behind the veil regarding the world all alike had actually before them as their original premiss or startingpoint a world wider perhaps in its possibilities than all possible fancies concerning it notes joel halcyone chapter xxi two curious houses ii the church in cecilias house your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions cornelius had certain friends in or near rome whose household to marius as he pondered now and again what might be the determining influences of that peculiar character presented itself as possibly its main secretthe hidden source from which the beauty and strength of a nature so persistently fresh in the midst of a somewhat jaded world might be derived but marius had never yet seen these friends and it was almost by accident that the veil of reserve was at last lifted and with strange contrast to his visit to the poets villa at tusculum he entered another curious house the house in which she lives says that mystical german writer quoted once before is for the orderly soul which does not live on blindly before her but is ever out of her passing experiences building and adorning the parts of a manyroomed abode for herself only an expansion of the body as the body according to the philosophy of swedenborg is but a process an expansion of the soul for such an orderly soul as life proceeds all sorts of delicate affinities establish themselves between herself and the doors and passageways the lights and shadows of her outward dwellingplace until she may seem incorporate with ituntil at last in the entire expressiveness of what is outward there is for her to speak properly between outward and inward no longer any distinction at all and the light which creeps at a particular hour on a particular picture or space upon the wall the scent of flowers in the air at a particular window become to her not so much apprehended objects as themselves powers of apprehension and doorways to things beyondthe germ or rudiment of certain new faculties by which she dimly yet surely apprehends a matter lying beyond her actually attained capacities of spirit and sense so it must needs be in a world which is itself we may think together with that bodily tent or tabernacle only one of many vestures for the clothing of the pilgrim soul to be left by her surely as if on the wayside wornout one by one as it was from her indeed they borrowed what momentary value or significance they had the two friends were returning to rome from a visit to a countryhouse where again a mixed company of guests had been assembled marius for his part a little weary of gossip and those sparks of illtempered rivalry which would seem sometimes to be the only sort of fire the intercourse of people in general society can strike out of them a mere reaction upon this as they started in the clear morning made their companionship at least for one of them hardly less tranquillising than the solitude he so much valued something in the southwest wind combining with their own intention favoured increasingly as the hours wore on a serenity like that marius had felt once before in journeying over the great plain towards tibura serenity that was today brotherly amity also and seemed to draw into its own charmed circle whatever was then present to eye or ear while they talked or were silent together and all petty irritations and the like shrank out of existence or kept certainly beyond its limits the natural fatigue of the long journey overcame them quite suddenly at last when they were still about two miles distant from rome the seemingly endless line of tombs and cypresses had been visible for hours against the sky towards the west and it was just where a crossroad from the latin way fell into the appian that cornelius halted at a doorway in a long low wallthe outer wall of some villa courtyard it might be supposed as if at liberty to enter and rest there awhile he held the door open for his companion to enter also if he would with an expression as he lifted the latch which seemed to ask marius apparently shrinking from a possible intrusion would you like to see it was he willing to look upon that the seeing of which might defineyes define the critical turningpoint in his days the little doorway in this long low wall admitted them in fact into the court or garden of a villa disposed in one of those abrupt natural hollows which give its character to the country in this place the house itself with all its dependent buildings the spaciousness of which surprised marius as he entered being thus wholly concealed from passengers along the road all around in those wellordered precincts were the quiet signs of wealth and of a noble tastea taste indeed chiefly evidenced in the selection and juxtaposition of the material it had to deal with consisting almost exclusively of the remains of older art here arranged and harmonised with effects both as regards colour and form so delicate as to seem really derivative from some finer intelligence in these matters than lay within the resources of the ancient world it was the old way of true renaissancebeing indeed the way of nature with her roses the divine way with the body of man perhaps with his soulconceiving the new organism by no sudden and abrupt creation but rather by the action of a new principle upon elements all of which had in truth already lived and died many times the fragments of older architecture the mosaics the spiral columns the precious cornerstones of immemorial building had put on by such juxtaposition a new and singular expressiveness an air of grave thought of an intellectual purpose in itself sthetically very seductive lastly herb and tree had taken possession spreading their seedbells and light branches just astir in the trembling air above the ancient gardenwall against the wide realms of sunset and from the first they could hear singing the singing of children mainly it would seem and of a new kind so novel indeed in its effect as to bring suddenly to the recollection of marius flavians early essays towards a new world of poetic sound it was the expression not altogether of mirth yet of some wonderful sort of happinessthe blithe selfexpansion of a joyful soul in people upon whom some allsubduing experience had wrought heroically and who still remembered on this bland afternoon the hour of a great deliverance his old native susceptibility to the spirit the special sympathies of placesabove all to any hieratic or religious significance they might havewas at its liveliest as marius still encompassed by that peculiar singing and still amid the evidences of a grave discretion all around him passed into the house that intelligent seriousness about life the absence of which had ever seemed to remove those who lacked it into some strange species wholly alien from himself accumulating all the lessons of his experience since those first days at whitenights was as it were translated here as if in designed congruity with his favourite precepts of the power of physical vision into an actual picture if the true value of souls is in proportion to what they can admire marius was just then an acceptable soul as he passed through the various chambers great and small one dominant thought increased upon him the thought of chaste women and their childrenof all the various affections of family life under its most natural conditions yet developed as if in devout imitation of some sublime new type of it into large controlling passions there reigned throughout an order and purity an orderly disposition as if by way of making ready for some gracious spousals the place itself was like a bride adorned for her husband and its singular cheerfulness the abundant light everywhere the sense of peaceful industry of which he received a deep impression though without precisely reckoning wherein it resided as he moved on rapidly were in forcible contrast just at first to the place to which he was next conducted by cornelius still with a sort of eager hurried halftroubled reluctance and as if he forbore the explanation which might well be looked for by his companion an old flowergarden in the rear of the house set here and there with a venerable olivetreea picture in pensive shade and fiery blossom as transparent under that afternoon light as the old miniaturepainters work on the walls of the chambers withinwas bounded towards the west by a low grassgrown hill a narrow opening cut in its steep side like a solid blackness there admitted marius and his gleaming leader into a hollow cavern or crypt neither more nor less in fact than the family burialplace of the cecilii to whom this residence belonged brought thus after an arrangement then becoming not unusual into immediate connexion with the abode of the living in bold assertion of that instinct of family life which the sanction of the holy family was hereafter more and more to reinforce here in truth was the centre of the peculiar religious expressiveness of the sanctity of the entire scene that any person may at his own election constitute the place which belongs to him a religious place by the carrying of his dead into ithad been a maxim of old roman law which it was reserved for the early christian societies like that established here by the piety of a wealthy roman matron to realise in all its consequences yet this was certainly unlike any cemetery marius had ever before seen most obviously in this that these people had returned to the older fashion of disposing of their dead by burial instead of burning originally a family sepulchre it was growing to a vast necropolis a whole township of the deceased by means of some free expansion of the family interest beyond its amplest natural limits that air of venerable beauty which characterised the house and its precincts above was maintained also here it was certainly with a great outlay of labour that these long apparently endless yet elaborately designed galleries were increasing so rapidly with their layers of beds or berths one above another cut on either side the pathway in the porous tufa through which all the moisture filters downwards leaving the parts above dry and wholesome all alike were carefully closed and with all the delicate costliness at command some with simple tiles of baked clay many with slabs of marble enriched by fair inscriptions marble taken in some cases from older pagan tombsthe inscription sometimes a palimpsest the new epitaph being woven into the faded letters of an earlier one as in an ordinary roman

intervals an airhole or luminare let in a hard beam of clear but sunless light with the heavy sleepers row upon row within leaving a passage so narrow that only one visitor at a time could move along cheek to cheek with them the high walls seemed to shut one in into the great company of the dead only the long straight pathway lay before him opening however here and there into a small chamber around a broad tablelike coffin or altartomb adorned even more profusely than the rest as if for some anniversary observance clearly these people concurring in this with the special sympathies of marius himself had adopted the practice of burial from some peculiar feeling of hope they entertained concerning the body a feeling which in no irreverent curiosity he would fain have penetrated the complete and irreparable disappearance of the dead in the funeral fire so crushing to the spirits as he for one had found it had long since induced in him a preference for that other mode of settlement to the last sleep as having something about it more homelike and hopeful at least in outward seeming but whence the strange confidence that these handfuls of white dust would hereafter recompose themselves once more into exulting human creatures by what heavenly alchemy what reviving dew from above such as was certainly never again to reach the dead violets januarius agapetus felicitas martyrs refresh i pray you the soul of cecil of cornelius said an inscription one of many scratched like a passing sigh when it was still fresh in the mortar that had closed up the prisondoor all critical estimate of this bold hope as sincere apparently as it was audacious in its claim being set aside here at least carried further than ever before was that pious systematic commemoration of the dead which in its chivalrous refusal to forget or finally desert the helpless had ever counted with marius as the central exponent or symbol of all natural duty the stern soul of the excellent jonathan edwards applying the faulty theology of john calvin afforded him we know the vision of infants not a span long on the floor of hell every visitor to the catacombs must have observed in a very different theological connexion the numerous childrens graves therebeds of infants but a span long indeed lowly prisoners of hope on these sacred floors it was with great curiosity certainly that marius considered them decked in some instances with the favourite toys of their tiny occupantstoysoldiers little chariotwheels the entire paraphernalia of a babyhouse and when he saw afterwards the living children who sang and were busy abovesang their psalm laudate pueri dominumtheir very faces caught for him a sort of quaint unreality from the memory of those others the children of the catacombs but a little way below them here and there mingling with the record of merely natural decease and sometimes even at these childrens graves were the signs of violent death or martyrdomproofs that some had loved not their lives unto the deathin the little red phial of blood the palmbranch the red flowers for their heavenly birthday about one sepulchre in particular distinguished in this way and devoutly arrayed for what by a bold paradox was thus treated as natalitiaa birthday the peculiar arrangements of the whole place visibly centered and it was with a singular novelty of feeling like the dawning of a fresh order of experiences upon him that standing beside those mournful relics snatched in haste from the common place of execution not many years before marius became as by some gleam of foresight aware of the whole force of evidence for a certain strange new hope defining in its turn some new and weighty motive of action which lay in deaths so tragic for the christian superstition something of them he had heard indeed already they had seemed to him but one savagery the more savagery selfprovoked in a cruel and stupid world and yet these poignant memorials seemed also to draw him onwards today as if towards an image of some still more pathetic suffering in the remote background yes the interest the expression of the entire neighbourhood was instinct with it as with the savour of some priceless incense penetrating the whole atmosphere touching everything around with its peculiar sentiment it seemed to make all this visible mortality deaths very selfah lovelier than any fable of old mythology had ever thought to render it in the utmost limits of fantasy and this in simple candour of feeling about a supposed fact peace pax tecumthe word the thoughtwas put forth everywhere with images of hope snatched sometimes from that jaded pagan world which had really afforded men so little of it from first to last the various consoling images it had thrown off of succour of regeneration of escape from the gravehercules wrestling with death for possession of alcestis orpheus taming the wild beasts the shepherd with his sheep the shepherd carrying the sick lamb upon his shoulders yet these imageries after all it must be confessed formed but a slight contribution to the dominant effect of tranquil hope therea kind of heroic cheerfulness and grateful expansion of heart as with the sense again of some real deliverance which seemed to deepen the longer one lingered through these strange and awful passages a figure partly pagan in character yet most frequently repeated of all these visible parablesthe figure of one just escaped from the sea still clinging as for life to the shore in surprised joy together with the inscription beneath it seemed best to express the prevailing sentiment of the place and it was just as he had puzzled out this inscription i went down to the bottom of the mountains the earth with her bars was about me for ever yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption that with no feeling of suddenness or change marius found himself emerging again like a later mystic traveller through similar dark places quieted by hope into the daylight they were still within the precincts of the house still in possession of that wonderful singing although almost in the open country with a great view of the campagna before them and the hills beyond the orchard or meadow through which their path lay was already gray with twilight though the western sky where the greater stars were visible was still afloat in crimson splendour the colour of all earthly things seemed repressed by the contrast yet with a sense of great richness lingering in their shadows at that moment the voice of the singers a voice of joy and health concentrated itself with solemn antistrophic movement into an evening or candle hymn hail heavenly light from his pure glory poured who is the almighty father heavenly blest worthiest art thou at all times to be sung with undefiled tongue it was like the evening itself made audible its hopes and fears with the stars shining in the midst of it half above half below the level white mist dividing the light from the darkness came now the mistress of this place the wealthy roman matron left early a widow a few years before by cecilius confessor and saint with a certain antique severity in the gathering of the long mantle and with coif or veil folded decorously below the chin gray within gray to the mind of marius her temperate beauty brought reminiscences of the serious and virile character of the best female statuary of greece quite foreign however to any greek statuary was the expression of pathetic care with which she carried a little child at rest in her arms another a year or two older walked beside the fingers of one hand within her girdle she paused for a moment with a greeting for cornelius that visionary scene was the close the fitting close of the afternoons strange experiences a few minutes later passing forward on his way along the public road he could have fancied it a dream the house of cecilia grouped itself beside that other curious house he had lately visited at tusculum and what a contrast was presented by the former in its suggestions of hopeful industry of immaculate cleanness of responsive affectionall alike determined by that transporting discovery of some fact or series of facts in which the old puzzle of life had found its solution in truth one of his most characteristic and constant traits had ever been a certain longing for escapefor some sudden relieving interchange across the very spaces of life it might be along which he had lingered most pleasantlyfor a lifting from time to time of the actual horizon it was like the necessity under which the painter finds himself to set a window or open doorway in the background of his picture or like a sick mans longing for northern coolness and the whispering willowtrees amid the breathless evergreen forests of the south to some such effect had this visit occurred to him and through so slight an accident rome and roman life just then were come to seem like some stifling forest of bronzework transformed as if by malign enchantment out of the generations of living trees yet with roots in a deep downtrodden soil of poignant human susceptibilities in the midst of its suffocation that old longing for escape had been satisfied by this vision of the church in cecilias house as never before it was still indeed according to the unchangeable law of his temperament to the eye to the visual faculty of mind that those experiences appealedthe peaceful light and shade the boys whose very faces seemed to sing the virginal beauty of the mother and her children but in his case what was thus visible constituted a moral or spiritual influence of a somewhat exigent and controlling character added anew to life a new element therein with which consistently with his own chosen maxim he must make terms the thirst for every kind of experience encouraged by a philosophy which taught that nothing was intrinsically great or small good or evil had ever been at strife in him with a hieratic refinement in which the boypriest survived prompting always the selection of what was perfect of its kind with subsequent loyal adherence of his soul thereto this had carried him along in a continuous communion with ideals certainly realised in part either in the conditions of his own being or in the actual company about him above all in cornelius surely in this strange new society he had touched upon for the first time todayin this strange family like a garden enclosedwas the fulfilment of all the preferences the judgments of that halfunderstood friend which of late years had been his protection so often amid the perplexities of life here it might be was if not the cure yet the solace or anodyne of his great sorrowsof that constitutional sorrowfulness not peculiar to himself perhaps but which had made his life certainly like one long disease of the spirit merciful intention made itself known remedially here in the mere contact of the air like a soft touch upon aching flesh on the other hand he was aware that new responsibilities also might be awakenednew and untried responsibilitiesa demand for something from him in return might this new vision like the malignant beauty of pagan medusa be exclusive of any admiring gaze upon anything but itself at least he suspected that after the beholding of it he could never again be altogether as he had been before notes emanuel swedenborg swedish mystic writer return chapter xxii the minor peace of the church faithful to the spirit of his early epicurean philosophy and the impulse to surrender himself in perfectly liberal inquiry about it to anything that as a matter of fact attracted or impressed him strongly marius informed himself with much pains concerning the church in cecilias house inclining at first to explain the peculiarities of that place by the establishment there of the schola or common hall of one of those burialguilds which then covered so much of the unofficial and as it might be called subterranean enterprise of roman society and what he found thus looking literally for the dead among the living was the vision of a natural a scrupulously natural love transforming by some new gift of insight into the truth of human relationships and under the urgency of some new motive by him so far unfathomable all the conditions of life he saw in all its primitive freshness and amid the lively facts of its actual coming into the world as a reality of experience that regenerate type of humanity which centuries later giotto and his successors down to the best and purest days of the young raphael working under conditions very friendly to the imagination were to conceive as an artistic ideal he felt there felt amid the stirring of some wonderful new hope within himself the genius the unique power of christianity in exercise then as it has been exercised ever since in spite of many hindrances and under the most inopportune circumstances chastityas he seemed to understandthe chastity of men and women amid all the conditions and with the results proper to such chastity is the most beautiful thing in the world and the truest conservation of that creative energy by which men and women were first brought into it the nature of the family for which the better genius of old rome itself had sincerely cared of the family and its appropriate affectionsall that love of ones kindred by which obviously one does triumph in some degree over deathhad never been so felt before here surely in its genial warmth its jealous exclusion of all that was opposed to it to its own immaculate naturalness in the hedge set around the sacred thing on every side this development of the family did but carry forward and give effect to the purposes the kindness of nature itself friendly to man as if by way of a due recognition of some immeasurable divine condescension manifest in a certain historic fact its influence was felt more especially at those points which demanded some sacrifice of ones self for the weak for the aged for little children and even for the dead and then for its constant outward token its significant manner or index it issued in a certain debonair grace and a certain mystic attractiveness a courtesy which made marius doubt whether that famed greek blitheness or gaiety or grace in the handling of life had been after all an unrivalled success contrasting with the incurable insipidity even of what was most exquisite in the higher roman life of what was still truest to the primitive soul of goodness amid its evil the new creation he now looked onas it were a picture beyond the craft of any master of old pagan beautyhad indeed all the appropriate freshness of a bride adorned for her husband things new and old seemed to be coming as if out of some goodly treasurehouse the brain full of science the heart rich with various sentiment possessing withal this surprising healthfulness this reality of heart you

at night fancying i see you beside me that is why my feet take me unconsciously to your sittingroom at those hours when i was wont to visit you there that is why i turn from the door of the empty chamber sad and illatease like an excluded lover there is a real idyll from that family life the protection of which had been the motive of so large a part of the religion of the romans still surviving among them as it survived also in aurelius his disposition and aims and spite of slanderous tongues in the attained sweetness of his interior life what marius had been permitted to see was a realisation of such life higher still and withyes with a more effective sanction and motive than it had ever possessed before in that fact or series of facts to be ascertained by those who would the central glory of the reign of the antonines was that society had attained in it though very imperfectly and for the most part by cumbrous effort of law many of those ends to which christianity went straight with the sufficiency the success of a direct and appropriate instinct pagan rome too had its touching charitysermons on occasions of great public distress its charitychildren in long file in memory of the elder empress faustina its prototype under patronage of aesculapius of the modern hospital for the sick on the island of saint bartholomew but what pagan charity was doing tardily and as if with the painful calculation of old age the church was doing almost without thinking about it with all the liberal enterprise of youth because it was her very being thus to do you fail to realise your own good intentions she seems to say to pagan virtue pagan kindness she identified herself with those intentions and advanced them with an unparalleled freedom and largeness the gentle seneca would have reverent burial provided even for the dead body of a criminal yet when a certain woman collected for interment the insulted remains of nero the pagan world surmised that she must be a christian only a christian would have been likely to conceive so chivalrous a devotion towards mere wretchedness we refuse to be witnesses even of a homicide commanded by the law boasts the dainty conscience of a christian apologist we take no part in your cruel sports nor in the spectacles of the amphitheatre and we hold that to witness a murder is the same thing as to commit one and there was another duty almost forgotten the sense of which rousseau brought back to the degenerate society of a later age in an impassioned discourse the sophist favorinus counsels mothers to suckle their own infants and there are roman epitaphs erected to mothers which gratefully record this proof of natural affection as a thing then unusual in this matter too what a sanction what a provocative to natural duty lay in that image discovered to augustus by the tiburtine sibyl amid the aurora of a new age the image of the divine mother and the child just then rising upon the world like the dawn christian belief again had presented itself as a great inspirer of chastity chastity in turn realised in the whole scope of its conditions fortified that rehabilitation of peaceful labour after the mind the pattern of the workman of galilee which was another of the natural instincts of the catholic church as being indeed the longdesired initiator of a religion of cheerfulness as a true lover of the industryso to term itthe labour the creation of god and this severe yet genial assertion of the ideal of woman of the family of industry of mans work in life so close to the truth of nature was also in that charmed hour of the minor peace of the church realised as an influence tending to beauty to the adornment of life and the world the sword in the world the right eye plucked out the right hand cut off the spirit of reproach which those images express and of which monasticism is the fulfilment reflect one side only of the nature of the divine missionary of the new testament opposed to yet blent with this ascetic or militant character is the function of the good shepherd serene blithe and debonair beyond the gentlest shepherd of greek mythology of a king under whom the beatific vision is realised of a reign of peacepeace of heartamong men such aspect of the divine character of christ rightly understood is indeed the final consummation of that bold and brilliant hopefulness in mans nature which had sustained him so far through his immense labours his immense sorrows and of which pagan gaiety in the handling of life is but a minor achievement sometimes one sometimes the other of those two contrasted aspects of its founder have in different ages and under the urgency of different human needs been at work also in the christian church certainly in that brief peace of the church under the antonines the spirit of a pastoral security and happiness seems to have been largely expanded there in the early church of rome was to be seen and on sufficiently reasonable grounds that satisfaction and serenity on a dispassionate survey of the facts of life which all hearts had desired though for the most part in vain contrasting itself for marius in particular very forcibly with the imperial philosophers so heavy burden of unrelieved melancholy it was christianity in its humanity or even its humanism in its generous hopes for man its common sense and alacrity of cheerful service its sympathy with all creatures its appreciation of beauty and daylight the angel of righteousness says the shepherd of hermas the most characteristic religious book of that age its pilgrims progressthe angel of righteousness is modest and delicate and meek and quiet take from thyself grief for as hamlet will one day discover tis the sister of doubt and illtemper grief is more evil than any other spirit of evil and is most dreadful to the servants of god and beyond all spirits destroyeth man for as when good news is come to one in grief straightway he forgetteth his former grief and no longer attendeth to anything except the good news which he hath heard so do ye also having received a renewal of your soul through the beholding of these good things put on therefore gladness that hath always favour before god and is acceptable unto him and delight thyself in it for every man that is glad doeth the things that are good and thinketh good thoughts despising griefsuch were the commonplaces of this new people among whom so much of what marius had valued most in the old world seemed to be under renewal and further promotion some transforming spirit was at work to harmonise contrasts to deepen expressiona spirit which in its dealing with the elements of ancient life was guided by a wonderful tact of selection exclusion juxtaposition begetting thereby a unique effect of freshness a grave yet wholesome beauty because the world of sense the whole outward world was understood to set forth the veritable unction and royalty of a certain priesthood and kingship of the soul within among the prerogatives of which was a delightful sense of freedom the reader may think perhaps that marius who epicurean as he was had his visionary aptitudes by an inversion of one of platos peculiarities with which he was of course familiar must have descended by foresight upon a later age than his own and anticipated christian poetry and art as they came to be under the influence of saint francis of assisi but if he dreamed on one of those nights of the beautiful house of cecilia its lights and flowers of cecilia herself moving among the lilies with an enhanced grace as happens sometimes in healthy dreams it was indeed hardly an anticipation he had lighted by one of the peculiar intellectual goodfortunes of his life upon a period when even more than in the days of austere ascsis which had preceded and were to follow it the church was true for a moment truer perhaps than she would ever be again to that element of profound serenity in the soul of her founder which reflected the eternal goodwill of god to man in whom according to the oldest version of the angelic message he is wellpleased for what christianity did many centuries afterwards in the way of informing an art a poetry of graver and higher beauty we may think than that of greek art and poetry at their best was in truth conformable to the original tendency of its genius the genuine capacity of the catholic church in this direction discoverable from the first in the new testament was also really at work in that earlier peace under the antoninesthe minor peace of the church as we might call it in distinction from the final peace of the church commonly so called under constantine saint francis with his following in the sphere of poetry and of the artsthe voice of dante the hand of giottogiving visible feature and colour and a palpable place among men to the regenerate race did but reestablish a continuity only suspended in part by those troublous intervening centuriesthe dark ages properly thus namedwith the gracious spirit of the primitive church as manifested in that first early springtide of her success the greater peace of constantine on the other hand in many ways does but establish the exclusiveness the puritanism the ascetic gloom which in the period between aurelius and the first christian emperor characterised a church under misunderstanding or oppression driven back in a world of tasteless controversy inwards upon herself already in the reign of antoninus pius the time was gone by when men became christians under some sudden and overpowering impression and with all the disturbing results of such a crisis at this period the larger number perhaps had been born christians had been ever with peaceful hearts in their fathers house that earlier belief in the speedy coming of judgment and of the end of the world with the consequences it so naturally involved in the temper of mens minds was dying out every day the contrast between the church and the world was becoming less pronounced and now also as the church rested awhile from opposition that rapid selfdevelopment outward from within proper to times of peace was in progress antoninus pius it might seem more truly even than marcus aurelius himself was of that group of pagan saints for whom dante like augustine has provided in his scheme of the house with many mansions a sincere old roman piety had urged his fortunately constituted nature to no mistakes no offences against humanity and of his entire freedom from guile one reward had been this singular happiness that under his rule there was no shedding of christian blood to him belonged that halfhumorous placidity of soul of a kind illustrated later very effectively by montaigne which starting with an instinct of mere fairness towards human nature and the world seems at last actually to qualify its possessor to be almost the friend of the people of christ amiable in its own nature and full of a reasonable gaiety christianity has often had its advantage of characters such as that the geniality of antoninus pius like the geniality of the earth itself had permitted the church as being in truth no alien from that old mother earth to expand and thrive for a season as by natural process and that charmed period under the antonines extending to the later years of the reign of aurelius beautiful brief chapter of ecclesiastical history contains as one of its motives of interest the earliest development of christian ritual under the presidence of the church of rome again as in one of those mystical quaint visions of the shepherd of hermas the aged woman was become by degrees more and more youthful and in the third vision she was quite young and radiant with beauty only her hair was that of an aged woman and at the last she was joyous and seated upon a throneseated upon a throne because her position is a strong one the subterranean worship of the church belonged properly to those years of her early history in which it was illegal for her to worship at all but hiding herself for awhile as conflict grew violent she resumed when there was felt to be no more than ordinary risk her natural freedom and the kind of outward prosperity she was enjoying in those moments of her first peace her modes of worship now blossoming freely aboveground was reinforced by the decision at this point of a crisis in her internal history in the history of the church as throughout the moral history of mankind there are two distinct ideals either of which it is possible to maintaintwo conceptions under one or the other of which we may represent to ourselves mens efforts towards a better lifecorresponding to those two contrasted aspects noted above as discernible in the picture afforded by the new testament itself of the character of christ the ideal of asceticism represents moral effort as essentially a sacrifice the sacrifice of one part of human nature to another that it may live the more completely in what survives of it while the ideal of culture represents it as a harmonious development of all the parts of human nature in just proportion to each other it was to the latter order of ideas that the church and especially the church of rome in the age of the antonines freely lent herself in that earlier peace she had set up for herself the ideal of spiritual development under the guidance of an instinct by which in those serene moments she was absolutely true to the peaceful soul of her founder goodwill to men she said in whom god himself is wellpleased for a little while at least there was no forced opposition between the soul and the body the world and the spirit and the grace of graciousness itself was preeminently with the people of christ tact good sense ever the note of a true orthodoxy the merciful compromises of the church indicative of her imperial vocation in regard to all the varieties of human kind with a universality of which the old roman pastorship she was superseding is but a prototype was already become conspicuous in spite of a discredited irritating vindictive society all around her against that divine urbanity and moderation the old error of montanus we read of dimly was a fanatical revoltsour falsely antimundane ever with an air of ascetic affectation and a bigoted distaste in particular for all the peculiar graces of womanhood by it the desire to please was understood to come of the author of evil in this interval of quietness it was perhaps inevitable by the law of reaction that some such extravagances of the religious temper should arise but again the church of rome now becoming every day more and more completely the capital of the christian world checked the nascent montanism or puritanism of the moment vindicating for all christian people a cheerful liberty of heart against many a narrow group of sectaries all alike in their different ways accusers of the genial creation of god with her full fresh faith in the evangelein a veritable regeneration of the earth and the body in the dignity of mans entire personal beingfor a season at least at that critical period in the development of christianity she was for reason for common sense for fairness to human nature and generally for what may be called the naturalness of christianityas also for its comely order she would be brought to her king in raiment of needlework it was by the bishops of rome diligently transforming themselves in the true catholic sense into universal pastors that the path of what we must call humanism was thus defined and then in this hour of expansion as if now at last the catholic church might venture to show her outward lineaments as they really were worshipthe beauty of holiness nay the elegance of sanctitywas developed with a bold and confident gladness the like of which has hardly been the ideal of worship in any later age the tables in fact were turned the prize of a cheerful temper on a candid survey of life was no longer with the pagan world the sthetic charm of the catholic church her evocative power over all that is eloquent and expressive in the better mind of man her outward comeliness her dignifying convictions about human natureall this as abundantly realised centuries later by dante and giotto by the great medieval churchbuilders by the great ritualists like saint gregory and the masters of sacred music in the middle agewe may see already in dim anticipation in those charmed moments towards the end of the second century dissipated or turned aside partly through the fatal mistake of marcus aurelius himself for a brief space of time we may discern that influence clearly predominant there what might seem harsh as dogma was already justifying itself as worship according to the sound rule lex orandi lex credendiour creeds are but the brief abstract of our prayer and song the wonderful liturgical spirit of the church her wholly unparalleled genius for worship being thus awake she was rapidly reorganising both pagan and jewish elements of ritual for the expanding therein of her own new heart of devotion like the institutions of monasticism like the gothic style of architecture the ritual system of the church as we see it in historic retrospect ranks as one of the great conjoint and so to term them necessary products of human mind destined for ages to come to direct with so deep a fascination mens religious instincts it was then already recognisable as a new and precious fact in the sum of things what has been on the whole the method of the church as a power of sweetness and patience in dealing with matters like pagan art pagan literature was even then manifest and has the character of the moderation the divine moderation of christ himself it was only among the ignorant indeed only in the villages that christianity even in conscious triumph over paganism was really betrayed into iconoclasm in the final peace of the church under constantine while there was plenty of destructive fanaticism in the country the revolution was accomplished in the larger towns in a manner more orderly and discreetin the roman manner the faithful were bent less on the destruction of the old pagan temples than on their conversion to a new and higher use and with much beautiful furniture ready to hand they became christian sanctuaries already in accordance with such maturer wisdom the church of the minor peace had adopted many of the graces of pagan feeling and pagan custom as being indeed a living creature taking up transforming accommodating still more closely to the human heart what of right belonged to it in this way an obscure synagogue was expanded into the catholic church gathering from a richer and more varied field of sound than had remained for him those old roman harmonies some notes of which gregory the great centuries later and after generations of interrupted development formed into the gregorian music she was already as we have heard the house of songof a wonderful new music and poesy as if in anticipation of the sixteenth century the church was becoming humanistic in an earlier and unimpeachable renaissance singing there had been in abundance from the first though often it dared only be of the heart and it burst forth when it might into the beginnings of a true ecclesiastical music the jewish psalter inherited from the synagogue turning now gradually from greek into latinbroken latin into italian as the ritual use of the rich fresh expressive vernacular superseded the earlier authorised language of the church through certain surviving remnants of greek in the later latin liturgies we may still discern a highly interesting intermediate phase of ritual development when the greek and the latin were in combination the poor surelythe poor and the children of that liberal roman churchresponding already in their own vulgar tongue to an office said in the original liturgical greek that hymn sung in the early morning of which pliny had heard was kindling into the service of the mass the mass indeed would appear to have been said continuously from the apostolic age its details as one by one they become visible in later history have already the character of what is ancient and venerable we are very old and ye are young they seem to protest to those who fail to understand them ritual in fact like all other elements of religion must grow and cannot be madegrow by the same law of development which prevails everywhere else in the moral as in the physical world as regards this special phase of the religious life however such development seems to have been unusually rapid in the subterranean age which preceded constantine and in the very first days of the final triumph of the church the mass emerges to general view already substantially complete wisdom was dealing as with the dust of creeds and philosophies so also with the dust of outworn religious usage like the very spirit of life itself organising soul and body out of the lime and clay of the earth in a generous eclecticism within the bounds of her liberty and as by some providential power within her she gathers and serviceably adopts as in other matters so in ritual one thing here another there from various sourcesgnostic jewish paganto adorn and beautify the greatest act of worship the world has seen it was thus the liturgy of the church came to befull of consolations for the human soul and destined surely one day under the sanction of so many ages of human experience to take exclusive possession of the religious consciousness tantum ergo sacramentum veneremur cernui et antiquum documentum novo cedat ritui chapter xxiii divine service wisdom hath builded herself a house she hath mingled her wine she hath also prepared for herself a table the more highly favoured ages of imaginative art present instances of the summing up of an entire world of complex associations under some single form like the zeus of olympia or the series of frescoes which commemorate the acts of saint francis at assisi or like the play of hamlet or faust it was not in an image or series of images yet still in a sort of dramatic action and with the unity of a single appeal to eye and ear that marius about this time found all his new impressions set forth regarding what he had already recognised intellectually as for him at least the most beautiful thing in the world to understand the influence upon him of what follows the reader must remember that it was an experience which came amid a deep sense of vacuity in life the fairest products of the earth seemed to be dropping to pieces as if in mens very hands around him how real was their sorrow and his his observation of life had come to be like the constant telling of a sorrowful rosary day after day till as if taking infection from the cloudy sorrow of the mind the eye also the very senses were grown faint and sick and now it happened as with the actual morning on which he found himself a spectator of this new thing the long winter had been a season of unvarying sullenness at last on this day he awoke with a sharp flash of lightning in the earliest twilight in a little while the heavy rain had filtered the air the clear light was abroad and as though the spring had set in with a sudden leap in the heart of things the whole scene around him lay like some untarnished picture beneath a sky of delicate blue under the spell of his late depression marius had suddenly determined to leave rome for a while but desiring first to advertise cornelius of his movements and failing to find him in his lodgings he had ventured still early in the day to seek him in the cecilian villa passing through its silent and empty courtyard he loitered for a moment to admire under the clear but immature light of winter morning after a storm all the details of form and colour in the old marbles were distinctly visible and with a kind of severity or sadnessso it struck himamid their beauty in them and in all other details of the scenethe cypresses the bunches of pale daffodils in the grass the curves of the purple hills of tusculum with the drifts of virgin snow still lying in their hollows the little open door through which he passed from the courtyard admitted him into what was plainly the vast lararium or domestic sanctuary of the cecilian family transformed in many particulars but still richly decorated and retaining much of its ancient furniture in metalwork and costly stone the peculiar halflight of dawn seemed to be lingering beyond its hour upon the solemn marble walls and here though at that moment in absolute silence a great company of people was assembled in that brief period of peace during which the church emerged for awhile from her jealouslyguarded subterranean life the rigour of an earlier rule of exclusion had been relaxed and so it came to pass that on this morning marius saw for the first time the wonderful spectaclewonderful especially in its evidential power over himself over his own thoughtsof those who believe there were noticeable among those present great varieties of rank of age of personal type the roman ingenuus with the white toga and gold ring stood side by side with his slave and the air of the whole company was above all a grave one an air of recollection coming thus unexpectedly upon this large assembly so entirely united in a silence so profound for purposes unknown to him marius felt for a moment as if he had stumbled by chance upon some great conspiracy yet that could scarcely be for the people here collected might have figured as the earliest handsel or pattern of a new world from the very face of which discontent had passed away corresponding to the variety of human type there present was the various expression of every form of human sorrow assuaged what desire what fulfilment of desire had wrought so pathetically on the features of these ranks of aged men and women of humble condition those young men bent down so discreetly on the details of their sacred service had faced life and were glad by some science or light of knowledge they had to which there had certainly been no parallel in the older world was some credible message from beyond the flaming rampart of the worlda message of hope regarding the place of mens souls and their interest in the sum of thingsalready moulding anew their very bodies and looks and voices now and here at least there was a cleansing and kindling flame at work in them which seemed to make everything else marius had ever known look comparatively vulgar and mean there were the children above alltroops of childrenreminding him of those pathetic childrens graves like cradles or garden beds he had noticed in his first visit to these places and they more than satisfied the odd curiosity he had then conceived about them wondering in what quaintly expressive forms they might come forth into the daylight if awakened from sleep children of the catacombs some but a span long with features not so much beautiful as heroic that world of new refining sentiment having set its seal even on childhood they retained certainly no stain or trace of anything subterranean this morning in the alacrity of their worshipas ready as if they had been at playstretching forth their hands crying chanting in a resonant voice and with boldly upturned faces christe eleison for the silencesilence amid those lights of early morning to which marius had always been constitutionally impressible as having in them a certain reproachful austeritywas broken suddenly by resounding cries of kyrie eleison christe eleison repeated alternately again and again until the bishop rising from his chair made sign that this prayer should cease but the voices burst out once more presently in richer and more varied melody though still of an antiphonal character the men the women and children the deacons the people answering one another somewhat after the manner of a greek chorus but again with what a novelty of poetic accent what a genuine expansion of heart what profound intimations for the intellect as the meaning of the words grew upon him cum grandi affectu et compunctione dicatursays an ancient eucharistic order and certainly the mystic tone of this praying and singing was one with the expression of deliverance of grateful assurance and sincerity upon the faces of those assembled as if some searching correction a regeneration of the body by the spirit had begun and was already gone a great way the countenances of men women and children alike had a brightness on them which he could fancy reflected upon himselfan amenity a mystic amiability and unction which found its way most readily of all to the hearts of children themselves the religious poetry of those hebrew psalmsbenedixisti domine terram tuam dixit dominus domino meo sede a dextris meiswas certainly in marvellous accord with the lyrical instinct of his own character those august hymns he thought must thereafter ever remain by him as among the welltested powers in things to soothe and fortify the soul one could never grow tired of them in the old pagan worship there had been little to call the understanding into play here on the other hand the utterance the eloquence the music of worship conveyed as marius readily understood a fact or series of facts for intellectual reception that became evident more especially in those lessons or sacred readings which like the singing in broken vernacular latin occurred at certain intervals amid the silence of the assembly there were readings again with bursts of chanted invocation between for fuller light on a difficult path in which many a vagrant voice of human philosophy haunting mens minds from of old recurred with clearer accent than had ever belonged to it before as if lifted above its first intention into the harmonies of some supreme system of knowledge or doctrine at length complete and last of all came a narrative which with a thousand tender memories every one appeared to know by heart displaying in all the vividness of a picture for the eye the mournful figure of him towards whom this whole act of worship still consistently turneda figure which seemed to have absorbed like some rich tincture in his garment all that was deepfelt and impassioned in the experiences of the past it was the anniversary of his birth as a little child they celebrated today astiterunt reges terrae so the gradual the song of degrees proceeded the young men on the steps of the altar responding in deep clear antiphon or chorus astiterunt reges terrae adversus sanctum puerum tuum jesum nunc domine da servis tuis loqui verbum tuum et signa fieri per nomen sancti pueri jesu and the proper action of the rite itself like a halfopened book to be read by the duly initiated mind took up those suggestions and carried them forward into the present as having reference to a power still efficacious still after some mystic sense even now in action among the people there assembled the entire office indeed with its interchange of lessons hymns prayer silence was itself like a single piece of highly composite dramatic music a song of degrees rising steadily to a climax notwithstanding the absence of any central image visible to the eye the entire ceremonial process like the place in which it was enacted was weighty with symbolic significance seemed to express a single leading motive the mystery if such in fact it was centered indeed in the actions of one visible person distinguished among the assistants who stood ranged in semicircle around him by the extreme fineness of his white vestments and the pointed cap with the golden ornaments upon his head nor had marius ever seen the pontifical character as he conceived itsicut unguentum in capite descendens in oram vestimentiso fully realised as in the expression the manner and voice of this novel pontiff as he took his seat on the white chair placed for him by the young men and received his long staff into his hand or moved his handshands which seemed endowed in very deed with some mysterious powerat the lavabo or at the various benedictions or to bless certain objects on the table before him chanting in cadence of a grave sweetness the leading parts of the rite what profound unction and mysticity the solemn character of the singing was at its height when he opened his lips like some new sort of rhapsdos it was for the moment as if he alone possessed the words of the office and they flowed anew from some permanent source of inspiration within him the table or altar at which he presided below a canopy on delicate spiral columns was in fact the tomb of a youthful witness of the family of the cecilii who had shed his blood not many years before and whose relics were still in this place it was for his sake the bishop put his lips so often to the surface before him the regretful memory of that death entwining itself though not without certain notes of triumph as a matter of special inward significance throughout a service which was before all else from first to last a commemoration of the dead a sacrifice alsoa sacrifice it might seem like the most primitive the most natural and enduringly significant of old pagan sacrifices of the simplest fruits of the earth and in connexion with this circumstance again as in the actual stones of the building so in the rite itself what marius observed was not so much new matter as a new spirit moulding informing with a new intention many observances not witnessed for the first time today men and women came to the altar successively in perfect order and deposited below the latticework of pierced white marble their baskets of wheat and grapes incense oil for the sanctuary lamps bread and wine especiallypure wheaten bread the pure white wine of the tusculan vineyards there was here a veritable consecration hopeful and animating of the earths gifts of old dead and dark matter itself now in some way redeemed at last of all that we can touch or see in the midst of a jaded world that had lost the true sense of such things and in strong contrast to the wise emperors renunciant and impassive attitude towards them certain portions of that bread and wine were taken into the bishops hands and thereafter with an increasing mysticity and effusion the rite proceeded still in a strain of inspired supplication the antiphonal singing developed from this point into a kind of dialogue between the chief minister and the whole assisting company sursum corda habemus ad dominum gratias agamus domino deo nostro it might have been thought the business the duty or service of young men more particularly as they stood there in long ranks and in severe and simple vesture of the purest whitea service in which they would seem to be flying for refuge as with their precious their treacherous and critical youth in their hands to oneyes one like themselves who yet claimed their worship a worship above all in the way of aurelius in the way of imitation adoramus te christe quia per crucem tuam redemisti mundumthey cry together so deep is the emotion that at moments it seems to marius as if some there present apprehend that prayer prevails that the very object of this pathetic crying himself draws near from the first there had been the sense an increasing assurance of one comingactually with them now according to the oftrepeated affirmation or petition dominus vobiscum some at least were quite sure of it and the confidence of this remnant fired the hearts and gave meaning to the bold ecstatic worship of all the rest about them prompted especially by the suggestions of that mysterious old jewish psalmody so new to himlesson and hymnand catching therewith a portion of the enthusiasm of those beside him marius could discern dimly behind the solemn recitation which now followed at once a narrative and a prayer the most touching image truly that had ever come within the scope of his mental or physical gaze it was the image of a young man giving up voluntarily one by one for the greatest of ends the greatest gifts actually parting with himself above all with the serenity the divine serenity of his own soul yet from the midst of his desolation crying out upon the greatness of his success as if foreseeing this very worship as centre of the supposed facts which for these people were become so constraining a motive of hopefulness of activity that image seemed to display itself with an overwhelming claim on human gratitude what saint lewis of france discerned and found so irresistibly touching across the dimness of many centuries as a painful thing done for love of him by one he had never seen was to them almost as a thing of yesterday and their hearts were whole with it it had the force among their interests of an almost recent event in the career of one whom their fathers fathers might have known from memories so sublime yet so close at hand had the narrative descended in which these acts of worship centered though again the names of some more recently dead were mingled in it and it seemed as if the very dead were aware to be stirring beneath the slabs of the sepulchres which lay so near that they might associate themselves to this enthusiasmto this exalted worship of jesus psalm xxii one by one at last the faithful approach to receive from the chief minister morsels of the great white wheaten cake he had taken into his handsperducat vos ad vitam aeternam he prays halfsilently as they depart again after discreet embraces the eucharist of those early days was even more entirely than at any later or happier time an act of thanksgiving and while the remnants of the feast are borne away for the reception of the sick the sustained gladness of the rite reaches its highest point in the singing of a hymn a hymn like the spontaneous product of two opposed militant companies contending accordantly together heightening accumulating their witness provoking one anothers worship in a kind of sacred rivalry ite missa estcried the young deacons and marius departed from that strange scene along with the rest what was itwas it this made the way of cornelius so pleasant through the world as for marius himselfthe natural soul of worship in him had at last been satisfied as never before he felt as he left that place that he must hereafter experience often a longing memory a kind of thirst for all this over again and it seemed moreover to define what he must require of the powers whatsoever they might be that had brought him into the world at all to make him not unhappy in it chapter xxiv a conversation not imaginary in cheerfulness is the success of our studies says plinystudia hilaritate proveniunt it was still the habit of marius encouraged by his experience that sleep is not only a sedative but the best of stimulants to seize the morning hours for creation making profit when he might of the wholesome serenity which followed a dreamless night the morning for creation he would say the afternoon for the perfecting labour of the file the evening for receptionthe reception of matter from without one of other mens words and thoughtsmatter for our own dreams or the merely mechanic exercise of the brain brooding thereon silently in its dark chambers to leave home early in the day was therefore a rare thing for him he was induced so to do on the occasion of a visit to rome of the famous writer lucian whom he had been bidden to meet the breakfast over he walked away with the learned guest having offered to be his guide to the lectureroom of a wellknown greek rhetorician and expositor of the stoic philosophy a teacher then much in fashion among the studious youth of rome on reaching the place however they found the doors closed with a slip of writing attached which proclaimed a holiday and the morning being a fine one they walked further along the appian way mortality with which the queen of waysin reality the favourite cemetery of romewas so closely crowded in every imaginable form of sepulchre from the tiniest babyhouse to the massive monument out of which the middle age would adapt a fortresstower might seem on a morning like this to be smiling through tears the flowerstalls just beyond the city gates

visiting the banks of the padus where he had sought in vain for the poplars sisters of phaethon erewhile whose tears became amber he had once for all arranged for himself a view of the world exclusive of all reference to what might lie beyond its flaming barriers and at the age of sixty he had no misgivings his elegant and selfcomplacent but far from unamiable scepticism long since brought to perfection never failed him it surrounded him as some are surrounded by a magic ring of fine aristocratic manners with a rampart through which he himself never broke nor permitted any thing or person to break upon him gay animated content with his old age as it was the aged student still took a lively interest in studious youthcould marius inform him of any such now known to him in rome what did the young men learn just then and how in answer marius became fluent concerning the promise of one young student the son as it presently appeared of parents of whom lucian himself knew something and soon afterwards the lad was seen coming along brisklya lad with gait and figure well enough expressive of the sane mind in the healthy body though a little slim and worn of feature and with a pair of eyes expressly designed it might seem for fine glancings at the stars at the sight of marius he paused suddenly and with a modest blush on recognising his companion who straightway took with the youth so prettily enthusiastic the freedom of an old friend in a few moments the three were seated together immediately above the fragrant borders of a rosefarm on the marble bench of one of the exhedrae for the use of footpassengers at the roadside from which they could overlook the grand earnest prospect of the campagna and enjoy the air fancying that the lads plainly written enthusiasm had induced in the elder speaker somewhat more fervour than was usual with him marius listened to the conversation which follows ah hermotimus hurrying to lecture if i may judge by your pace and that volume in your hand you were thinking hard as you came along moving your lips and waving your arms some fine speech you were pondering some knotty question some viewy doctrinenot to be idle for a moment to be making progress in philosophy even on your way to the schools today however you need go no further we read a notice at the schools that there would be no lecture stay therefore and talk awhile with us with pleasure lucianyes i was ruminating yesterdays conference one must not lose a moment life is short and art is long and it was of the art of medicine that was first saida thing so much easier than divine philosophy to which one can hardly attain in a lifetime unless one be ever wakeful ever on the watch and here the hazard is no little oneby the attainment of a true philosophy to attain happiness or having missed both to perish as one of the vulgar herd the prize is a great one hermotimus and you must needs be near it after these months of toil and with that scholarly pallor of yours unless indeed you have already laid hold upon it and kept us in the dark how could that be lucian happiness as hesiod says abides very far hence and the way to it is long and steep and rough i see myself still at the beginning of my journey still but at the mountains foot i am trying with all my might to get forward what i need is a hand stretched out to help me and is not the master sufficient for that could he not like zeus in homer let down to you from that high place a golden cord to draw you up thither to himself and to that happiness to which he ascended so long ago the very point lucian had it depended on him i should long ago have been caught up tis i am wanting well keep your eye fixed on the journeys end and that happiness there above with confidence in his goodwill ah there are many who start cheerfully on the journey and proceed a certain distance but lose heart when they light on the obstacles of the way only those who endure to the end do come to the mountains top and thereafter live in happinesslive a wonderful manner of life seeing all other people from that great height no bigger than tiny ants what little fellows you make of usless than the pygmiesdown in the dust here well we the vulgar herd as we creep along will not forget you in our prayers when you are seated up there above the clouds whither you have been so long hastening but tell me hermotimuswhen do you expect to arrive there ah that i know not in twenty years perhaps i shall be really on the summita great while you think but then again the prize i contend for is a great one perhaps but as to those twenty yearsthat you will live so long has the master assured you of that is he a prophet as well as a philosopher for i suppose you would not endure all this upon a mere chancetoiling day and night though it might happen that just ere the last step destiny seized you by the foot and plucked you thence with your hope still unfulfilled hence with these illomened words lucian were i to survive but for a day i should be happy having once attained wisdom howsatisfied with a single day after all those labours yes one blessed moment were enough but again as you have never been how know you that happiness is to be had up there at allthe happiness that is to make all this worth while i believe what the master tells me of a certainty he knows being now far above all others and what was it he told you about it is it riches or glory or some indescribable pleasure hush my friend all those are nothing in comparison of the life there what then shall those who come to the end of this disciplinewhat excellent thing shall they receive if not these wisdom the absolute goodness and the absolute beauty with the sure and certain knowledge of all thingshow they are riches and glory and pleasurewhatsoever belongs to the bodythey have cast from them stripped bare of all that they mount up even as hercules consumed in the fire became a god he too cast aside all that he had of his earthly mother and bearing with him the divine element pure and undefiled winged his way to heaven from the discerning flame even so do they detached from all that others prize by the burning fire of a true philosophy ascend to the highest degree of happiness strange and do they never come down again from the heights to help those whom they left below must they when they be once come thither there remain for ever laughing as you say at what other men prize more than that they whose initiation is entire are subject no longer to anger fear desire regret nay they scarcely feel at all well as you have leisure today why not tell an old friend in what way you first started on your philosophic journey for if i might i should like to join company with you from this very day if you be really willing lucian you will learn in no long time your advantage over all other people they will seem but as children so far above them will be your thoughts well be you my guide it is but fair but tell medo you allow learners to contradict if anything is said which they dont think right no indeed still if you wish oppose your questions in that way you will learn more easily let me know thenis there one only way which leads to a true philosophyyour own waythe way of the stoics or is it true as i have heard that there are many ways of approaching it yes many ways there are the stoics and the peripatetics and those who call themselves after plato there are the enthusiasts for diogenes and antisthenes and the followers of pythagoras besides others it was true then but again is what they say the same or different very different yet the truth i conceive would be one and the same from all of them answer me thenin what or in whom did you confide when you first betook yourself to philosophy and seeing so many doors open to you passed them all by and went in to the stoics as if there alone lay the way of truth what token had you forget please all you are todayhalfway or more on the philosophic journey answer me as you would have done then a mere outsider as i am now willingly it was there the great majority went twas by that i judged it to be the better way a majority how much greater than the epicureans the platonists the peripatetics you doubtless counted them respectively as with the votes in a scrutiny no but this was not my only motive i heard it said by every one that the epicureans were soft and voluptuous the peripatetics avaricious and quarrelsome and platos followers puffed up with pride but of the stoics not a few pronounced that they were true men that they knew everything that theirs was the royal road the one road to wealth to wisdom to all that can be desired of course those who said this were not themselves stoics you would not have believed themstill less their opponents they were the vulgar therefore true but you must know that i did not trust to others exclusively i trusted also to myselfto what i saw i saw the stoics going through the world after a seemly manner neatly clad never in excess always collected ever faithful to the mean which all pronounce golden you are trying an experiment on me you would fain see how far you can mislead me as to your real ground the kind of probation you describe is applicable indeed to works of art which are rightly judged by their appearance to the eye there is something in the comely form the graceful drapery which tells surely of the hand of pheidias or alcamenes but if philosophy is to be judged by outward appearances what would become of the blind man for instance unable to observe the attire and gait of your friends the stoics it was not of the blind i was thinking yet there must needs be some common criterion in a matter so important to all put the blind if you will beyond the privileges of philosophy though they perhaps need that inward vision more than all others but can those who are not blind be they as keensighted as you will collect a single fact of mind from a mans attire from anything outwardunderstand me you attached yourself to these mendid you notbecause of a certain love you had for the mind in them the thoughts they possessed desiring the mind in you to be improved thereby assuredly how then did you find it possible by the sort of signs you just now spoke of to distinguish the true philosopher from the false matters of that kind are not wont so to reveal themselves they are but hidden mysteries hardly to be guessed at through the words and acts which may in some sort be conformable to them you however it would seem can look straight into the heart in mens bosoms and acquaint yourself with what really passes there you are making sport of me lucian in truth it was with gods help i made my choice and i dont repent it and still you refuse to tell me to save me from perishing in that vulgar herd because nothing i can tell you would satisfy you you are mistaken my friend but since you deliberately conceal the thing grudging me as i suppose that true philosophy which would make me equal to you i will try if it may be to find out for myself the exact criterion in these mattershow to make a perfectly safe choice and do you listen i will there may be something worth knowing in what you will say wellonly dont laugh if i seem a little fumbling in my efforts the fault is yours in refusing to share your lights with me let philosophy then be like a citya city whose citizens within it are a happy people as your master would tell you having lately come thence as we suppose all the virtues are theirs and they are little less than gods those acts of violence which happen among us are not to be seen in their streets they live together in one mind very seemly the things which beyond everything else cause men to contend against each other having no place upon them gold and silver pleasure vainglory they have long since banished as being unprofitable to the commonwealth and their life is an unbroken calm in liberty equality an equal happiness and is it not reasonable that all men should desire to be of a city such as that and take no account of the length and difficulty of the way thither so only they may one day become its freemen it might well be the business of lifeleaving all else forgetting ones native country here unmoved by the tears the restraining hands of parents or children if one had themonly bidding them follow the same road and if they would not or could not shaking them off leaving ones very garment in their hands if they took hold on us to start off straightway for that happy place for there is no fear i suppose of being shut out if one came thither naked i remember indeed long ago an aged man related to me how things passed there offering himself to be my leader and enrol me on my arrival in the number of the citizens i was but fifteencertainly very foolish and it may be that i was then actually within the suburbs or at the very gates of the city well this aged man told me among other things that all the citizens were wayfarers from afar among them were barbarians and slaves poor menaye and cripplesall indeed who truly desired that citizenship for the only legal conditions of enrolment werenot wealth nor bodily beauty nor noble ancestrythings not named among thembut intelligence and the desire for moral beauty and earnest labour the last comer thus qualified was made equal to the rest master and slave patrician plebeian were words they had notin that blissful place and believe me if that blissful that beautiful place were set on a hill visible to all the world i should long ago have journeyed thither but as you say it is far off and one must needs find out for oneself the road to it and the best possible guide and i find a multitude of guides who press on me their services and protest all alike that they have themselves come thence only the roads they propose are many and towards adverse quarters and one of them is steep and stony and through the beating sun and the other is through green meadows and under grateful shade and by many a fountain of water but howsoever the road may be at each one of them stands a credible guide he puts out his hand and would have you come his way all other ways are wrong all other guides false hence my difficultythe number and variety of the ways for you know there is but one road that leads to corinth well if you go the whole round you will find no better guides than those if you wish to get to corinth you will follow the traces of zeno and chrysippus it is impossible otherwise yes the old familiar language were one of platos fellowpilgrims here or a follower of epicurusor fifty otherseach would tell me that i should never get to corinth except in his company one must therefore credit all alike which would be absurd or what is far safer distrust all alike until one has discovered the truth suppose now that being as i am ignorant which of all philosophers is really in possession of truth i choose your sect relying on yourselfmy friend indeed yet still acquainted only with the way of the stoics and that then some divine power brought plato and aristotle and pythagoras and the others back to life again well they would come round about me and put me on my trial for my presumption and sayin whom was it you confided when you preferred zeno and chrysippus to meand memasters of far more venerable age than those who are but of yesterday and though you have never held any discussion with us nor made trial of our doctrine it is not thus that the law would have judges dolisten to one party and refuse to let the other speak for himself if judges act thus there may be an appeal to another tribunal what should i answer would it be enough to sayi trusted my friend hermotimuswe know not hermotimus nor he us they would tell me adding with a smile your friend thinks he may believe all our adversaries say of us whether in ignorance or in malice yet if he were umpire in the games and if he happened to see one of our wrestlers by way of a preliminary exercise knock to pieces an antagonist of mere empty air he would not thereupon pronounce him a victor well dont let your friend hermotimus suppose in like manner that his teachers have really prevailed over us in those battles of theirs fought with our mere shadows that again were to be like children lightly overthrowing their own cardcastles or like boyarchers who cry out when they hit the target of straw the persian and scythian bowmen as they speed along can pierce a bird on the wing let us leave plato and the others at rest it is not for me to contend against them let us rather search out together if the truth of philosophy be as i say why summon the athletes and archers from persia yes let them go if you think them in the way and now do you speak you really look as if you had something wonderful to deliver well then lucian to me it seems quite possible for one who has learned the doctrines of the stoics only to attain from those a knowledge of the truth without proceeding to inquire into all the various tenets of the others look at the question in this way if one told you that twice two make four would it be necessary for you to go the whole round of the arithmeticians to see whether any one of them will say that twice two make five or seven would you not see at once that the man tells the truth at once why then do you find it impossible that one who has fallen in with the stoics only in their enunciation of what is true should adhere to them and seek after no others assured that four could never be five even if fifty platos fifty aristotles said so you are beside the point hermotimus you are likening open questions to principles universally received have you ever met any one who said that twice two make five or seven no only a madman would say that and have you ever met on the other hand a stoic and an epicurean who were agreed upon the beginning and the end the principle and the final cause of things never then your parallel is false we are inquiring to which of the sects philosophic truth belongs and you seize on it by anticipation and assign it to the stoics alleging what is by no means clear that it is they for whom twice two make four but the epicureans or the platonists might say that it is they in truth who make two and two equal four while you make them five or seven is it not so when you think virtue the only good and the epicureans pleasure when you hold all things to be material while the platonists admit something immaterial as i said you resolve offhand in favour of the stoics the very point which needs a critical decision if it is clear beforehand that the stoics alone make two and two equal four then the others must hold their peace but so long as that is the very point of debate we must listen to all sects alike or be wellassured that we shall seem but partial in our judgment i think lucian that you do not altogether understand my meaning to make it clear then let us suppose that two men had entered a temple of aesculapiussay or bacchus and that afterwards one of the sacred vessels is found to be missing and the two men must be searched to see which of them has hidden it under his garment for it is certainly in the possession of one or the other of them well if it be found on the first there will be no need to search the second if it is not found on the first then the other must have it and again there will be no need to search him yes so let it be and we too lucian if we have found the holy vessel in possession of the stoics shall no longer have need to search other philosophers having attained that we were seeking why trouble ourselves further no need if something had indeed been found and you knew it to be that lost thing if at the least you could recognise the sacred object when you saw it but truly as the matter now stands not two persons only have entered the temple one or the other of whom must needs have taken the golden cup but a whole crowd of persons and then it is not clear what the lost object really iscup or flagon or diadem for one of the priests avers this another that they are not even in agreement as to its material some will have it to be of brass others of silver or gold it thus becomes necessary to search the garments of all persons who have entered the temple if the lost vessel is to be recovered and if you find a golden cup on the first of them it will still be necessary to proceed in searching the garments of the others for it is not certain that this cup really belonged to the temple might there not be many such golden vesselsno we must go on to every one of them placing all that we find in the midst together and then make our guess which of all those things may fairly be supposed to be the property of the god for again this circumstance adds greatly to our difficulty that without exception every one searched is found to have something upon himcup or flagon or diadem of brass of silver of gold and still all the while it is not ascertained which of all these is the sacred thing and you must still hesitate to pronounce any one of them guilty of the sacrilegethose objects may be their own lawful property one cause of all this obscurity being as i think that there was no inscription on the lost cup if cup it was had the name of the god or even that of the donor been upon it at least we should have had less trouble and having detected the inscription should have ceased to trouble any one else by our search i have nothing to reply to that hardly anything plausible so that if we wish to find who it is has the sacred vessel or who will be our best guide to corinth we must needs proceed to every one and examine him with the utmost care stripping off his garment and considering him closely scarcely even so shall we come at the truth and if we are to have a credible adviser regarding this question of philosophywhich of all philosophies one ought to followhe alone who is acquainted with the dicta of every one of them can be such a guide all others must be inadequate i would give no credence to them if they lacked information as to one only if somebody introduced a fair person and told us he was the fairest of all men we should not believe that unless we knew that he had seen all the people in the world fair he might be but fairest of allnone could know unless he had seen all and we too desire not a fair one but the fairest of all unless we find him we shall think we have failed it is no casual beauty that will content us what we are seeking after is that supreme beauty which must of necessity be unique what then is one to do if the matter be really thus perhaps you know better than i all i see is that very few of us would have time to examine all the various sects of philosophy in turn even if we began in early life i know not how it is but though you seem to me to speak reasonably yet i must confess it you have distressed me not a little by this exact exposition of yours i was unlucky in coming out today and in my falling in with you who have thrown me into utter perplexity by your proof that the discovery of truth is impossible just as i seemed to be on the point of attaining my hope blame your parents my child not me or rather blame mother nature herself for giving us but seventy or eighty years instead of making us as longlived as tithonus for my part i have but led you from premise to conclusion nay you are a mocker i know not wherefore but you have a grudge against philosophy and it is your entertainment to make a jest of her lovers ah hermotimus what the truth may be you philosophers may be able to tell better than i but so much at least i know of her that she is one by no means pleasant to those who hear her speak in the matter of pleasantness she is far surpassed by falsehood and falsehood has the pleasanter countenance she nevertheless being conscious of no alloy within discourses with boldness to all men who therefore have little love for her see how angry you are now because i have stated the truth about certain things of which we are both alike enamouredthat they are hard to come by it is as if you had fallen in love with a statue and hoped to win its favour thinking it a human creature and i understanding it to be but an image of brass or stone had shown you as a friend that your love was impossible and thereupon you had conceived that i bore you some illwill but still does it not follow from what you said that we must renounce philosophy and pass our days in idleness when did you hear me say that i did but assert that if we are to seek after philosophy whereas there are many ways professing to lead thereto we must with much exactness distinguish them well lucian that we must go to all the schools in turn and test what they say if we are to choose the right one is perhaps reasonable but surely ridiculous unless we are to live as many years as the phoenix to be so lengthy in the trial of each as if it were not possible to learn the whole by the part they say that pheidias when he was shown one of the talons of a lion computed the stature and age of the animal it belonged to modelling a complete lion upon the standard of a single part of it you too would recognise a human hand were the rest of the body concealed even so with the schools of philosophythe leading doctrines of each might be learned in an afternoon that overexactness of yours which required so long a time is by no means necessary for making the better choice you are forcible hermotimus with this theory of the whole by the part yet methinks i heard you but now propound the contrary but tell me would pheidias when he saw the lions talon have known that it was a lions if he had never seen the animal surely the cause of his recognising the part was his knowledge of the whole there is a way of choosing ones philosophy even less troublesome than yours put the names of all the philosophers into an urn then call a little child and let him draw the name of the philosopher you shall follow all the rest of your days nay be serious with me tell me did you ever buy wine surely and did you first go the whole round of the winemerchants tasting and comparing their wines by no means no you were contented to order the first good wine you found at your price by tasting a little you were ascertained of the quality of the whole cask how if you had gone to each of the merchants in turn and said i wish to buy a cotyl of wine let me drink out the whole cask then i shall be able to tell which is best and where i ought to buy yet this is what you would do with the philosophies why drain the cask when you might taste and see how slippery you are how you escape from ones fingers still you have given me an advantage and are in your own trap how so thus you take a common object known to every one and make wine the figure of a thing which presents the greatest variety in itself and about which all men are at variance because it is an unseen and difficult thing i hardly know wherein philosophy and wine are alike unless it be in this that the philosophers exchange their ware for money like the winemerchants some of them with a mixture of water or worse or giving short measure however let us consider your parallel the wine in the cask you say is of one kind throughout but have the philosophershas your own master evenbut one and the same thing only to tell you every day and all days on a subject so manifold otherwise how can you know the whole by the tasting of one part the whole is not the sameah and it may be that god has hidden the good wine of philosophy at the bottom of the cask you must drain it to the end if you are to find those drops of divine sweetness you seem so much to thirst for yourself after drinking so deeply are still but at the beginning as you said but is not philosophy rather like this keep the figure of the merchant and the cask but let it be filled not with wine but with every sort of grain you come to buy the merchant hands you a little of the wheat which lies at the top could you tell by looking at that whether the chickpeas were clean the lentils tender the beans full and then whereas in selecting our wine we risk only our money in selecting our philosophy we risk ourselves as you told memight ourselves sink into the dregs of the vulgar herd moreover while you may not drain the whole cask of wine by way of tasting wisdom grows no less by the depth of your drinking nay if you take of her she is increased thereby and then i have another similitude to propose as regards this tasting of philosophy dont think i blaspheme her if i say that it may be with her as with some deadly poison hemlock or aconite these too though they cause death yet kill not if one tastes but a minute portion you would suppose that the tiniest particle must be sufficient be it as you will lucian one must live a hundred years one must sustain all this labour otherwise philosophy is unattainable not so though there were nothing strange in that if it be true as you said at first that life is short and art is long but now you take it hard that we are not to see you this very day before the sun goes down a chrysippus a pythagoras a plato you overtake me lucian and drive me into a corner in jealousy of heart i believe because i have made some progress in doctrine whereas you have neglected yourself well dont attend to me treat me as a corybant a fanatic and do you go forward on this road of yours finish the journey in accordance with the view you had of these matters at the beginning of it only be assured that my judgment on it will remain unchanged reason still says that without criticism without a clear exact unbiassed intelligence to try them all those theoriesall thingswill have been seen but in vain to that end she tells us much time is necessary many delays of judgment a cautious gait repeated inspection and we are not to regard the outward appearance or the reputation of wisdom in any of the speakers but like the judges of areopagus who try their causes in the darkness of the night look only to what they say philosophy then is impossible or possible only in another life hermotimus i grieve to tell you that all this even may be in truth insufficient after all we may deceive ourselves in the belief that we have found somethinglike the fishermen again and again they let down the net at last they feel something heavy and with vast labour draw up not a load of fish but only a pot full of sand or a great stone i dont understand what you mean by the net it is plain that you have caught me in it try to get out you can swim as well as another we may go to all philosophers in turn and make trial of them still i for my part hold it by no means certain that any one of them really possesses what we seek the truth may be a thing that not one of them has yet found you have twenty beans in your hand and you bid ten persons guess how many one says five another fifteen it is possible that one of them may tell the true number but it is not impossible that all may be wrong so it is with the philosophers all alike are in search of happinesswhat kind of thing it is one says one thing one another it is pleasure it is virtuewhat not and happiness may indeed be one of those things but it is possible also that it may be still something else different and distinct from them all what is thisthere is something i know not how very sad and disheartening in what you say we seem to have come round in a circle to the spot whence we started and to our first incertitude ah lucian what have you done to me you have proved my priceless pearl to be but ashes and all my past labour to have been in vain reflect my friend that you are not the first person who has thus failed of the good thing he hoped for all philosophers so to speak are but fighting about the asss shadow to me you seem like one who should weep and reproach fortune because he is not able to climb up into heaven or go down into the sea by sicily and come up at cyprus or sail on wings in one day from greece to india and the true cause of his trouble is that he has based his hope on what he has seen in a dream or his own fancy has put together without previous thought whether what he desires is in itself attainable and within the compass of human nature even so methinks has it happened with you as you dreamed so largely of those wonderful things came reason and woke you up from sleep a little roughly and then you are angry with reason your eyes being still but half open and find it hard to shake off sleep for the pleasure of what you saw therein only dont be angry with me because as a friend i would not suffer you to pass your life in a dream pleasant perhaps but still only a dreambecause i wake you up and demand that you should busy yourself with the proper business of life and send you to it possessed of common sense what your soul was full of just now is not very different from those gorgons and chimaeras and the like which the poets and the painters construct for us fancyfreethings which never were and never will be though many believe in them and all like to see and hear of them just because they are so strange and odd and you too methinks having heard from some such maker of marvels of a certain woman of a fairness beyond naturebeyond the graces beyond venus urania herselfasked not if he spoke truth and whether this woman be really alive in the world but straightway fell in love with her as they say that medea was enamoured of jason in a dream and what more than anything else seduced you and others like you into that passion for a vain idol of the fancy is that he who told you about that fair woman from the very moment when you first believed that what he said was true brought forward all the rest in consequent order upon her alone your eyes were fixed by her he led you along when once you had given him a hold upon youled you along the straight road as he said to the beloved one all was easy after that none of you asked again whether it was the true way following one after another like sheep led by the green bough in the hand of the shepherd he moved you hither and thither with his finger as easily as water spilt on a table my friend be not so lengthy in preparing the banquet lest you die of hunger i saw one who poured water into a mortar and ground it with all his might with a pestle of iron fancying he did a thing useful and necessary but it remained water only none the less just there the conversation broke off suddenly and the disputants parted the horses were come for lucian the boy went on his way and marius onward to visit a friend whose abode lay further as he returned to rome towards evening the melancholy aspect natural to a city of the dead had triumphed over the superficial gaudiness of the early day he could almost have fancied canidia there picking her way among the rickety lamps to rifle some neglected or ruined tomb for these tombs were not all equally well cared for post mortem nescio and it had been one of the pieties of aurelius to frame a severe law to prevent the defacing of such monuments to marius there seemed to be some new meaning in that terror of isolation of being left alone in these places of which the sepulchral inscriptions were so full a bloodred sunset was dying angrily and its wild glare upon the shadowy objects around helped to combine the associations of this famous way its deeply graven marks of immemorial travel together with the earnest questions of the morning as to the true way of that other sort of travelling around an image almost ghastly in the traces of its great sorrowsbearing along for ever on bleeding feet the instrument of its punishmentwhich was all marius could recall distinctly of a certain christian legend he had heard the legend told of an encounter at this very spot of two wayfarers on the appian way as also upon some very dimly discerned mental journey altogether different from himself and his late companionsan encounter between love literally fainting by the road and love travelling in the greatness of his strength love itself suddenly appearing to sustain that other a strange contrast to anything actually presented in that mornings conversation it seemed nevertheless to echo its very wordsdo they never come down again he heard once more the wellmodulated voice do they never come down again from the heights to help those whom they left here belowand we too desire not a fair one but the fairest of all unless we find him we shall think we have failed chapter xxv sunt lacrimae rerum it was become a habit with mariusone of his modernismsdeveloped by his assistance at the emperors conversations with himself to keep a register of the movements of his own private thoughts and humours not continuously indeed yet sometimes for lengthy intervals during which it was no idle selfindulgence but a necessity of his intellectual life to confess himself with an intimacy seemingly rare among the ancients ancient writers at all events having been jealous for the most part of affording us so much as a glimpse of that interior self which in many cases would have actually doubled the interest of their objective informations if a particular tutelary or genius writes mariusaccording to old belief walks through life beside each one of us mine is very certainly a capricious creature he fills one with wayward unaccountable yet quite irresistible humours and seems always to be in collusion with some outward circumstance often trivial enough in itselfthe condition of the weather forsooththe people one meets by chancethe things one happens to overhear them say veritable enodioi symboloi or omens by the wayside as the old greeks fanciedto push on the unreasonable prepossessions of the moment into weighty motives it was doubtless a quite explicable physical fatigue that presented me to myself on awaking this morning so lacklustre and trite but i must needs take my petulance contrasting it with my accustomed morning hopefulness as a sign of the ageing of appetite of a decay in the very capacity of enjoyment we need some imaginative stimulus some not impossible ideal such as may shape vague hope and transform it into effective desire to carry us year after year without disgust through the routinework which is so large a part of life then how if appetite be it for real or ideal should itself fail one after awhile ah yes is it of cold always that men die and on some of us it creeps very gradually in truth i can remember just such a lacklustre condition of feeling once or twice before but i note that it was accompanied then by an odd indifference as the thought of them occurred to me in regard to the sufferings of othersa kind of callousness so unusual with me as at once to mark the humour it accompanied as a palpably morbid one that could not last were those sufferings great or little i asked myself then of more real consequence to them than mine to me as i remind myself that nothing that will end is really longlong enough to be thought of importance but today my own sense of fatigue the pity i conceive for myself disposed me strongly to a tenderness for others for a moment the whole world seemed to present itself as a hospital of sick persons many of them sick in mind all of whom it would be a brutality not to humour not to indulge why when i went out to walk off my wayward fancies did i confront the very sort of incident my unfortunate genius had surely beckoned it from afar to vex me likely to irritate them further a party of men were coming down the street they were leading a fine racehorse a handsome beast but badly hurt somewhere in the circus and useless they were taking him to slaughter and i think the animal knew it he cast such looks as if of mad appeal to those who passed him as he went among the strangers to whom his former owner had committed him to die in his beauty and pride for just that one mischance or fault although the morning air was still so animating and pleasant to snuff i could have fancied a human soul in the creature swelling against its luck and i had come across the incident just when it would figure to me as the very symbol of our poor humanity in its capacities for pain its wretched accidents and those imperfect sympathies which can never quite identify us with one another the very power of utterance and appeal to others seeming to fail us in proportion as our sorrows come home to ourselves are really our own we are constructed for suffering what proofs of it does but one day afford if we care to note them as we goa whole long chaplet of sorrowful mysteries sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt mens fortunes touch us the little children of one of those institutions for the support of orphans now become fashionable among us by way of memorial of eminent persons deceased are going in long file along the street on their way to a holiday in the country they halt and count themselves with an air of triumph to show that they are all there their gay chatter has disturbed a little group of peasants a young woman and her husband who have brought the old mother now past work and witless to place her in a house provided for such afflicted people they are fairly affectionate but anxious how the thing they have to do may gohope only she may permit them to leave her there behind quietly and the poor old soul is excited by the noise made by the children and partly aware of what is going to happen with her she too begins to countone two three fiveon her trembling fingers misshapen by a life of toil yes yes and twice five make tenthey say to pacify her it is her last appeal to be taken home again her proof that all is not yet up with her that she is at all events still as capable as those joyous children at the baths a party of labourers are at work upon one of the great brick furnaces in a cloud of black dust a frail young child has brought food for one of them and sits apart waiting till his father comeswatching the labour but with a sorrowful distaste for the din and dirt he is regarding wistfully his own place in the world there before him his mind as he watches is grown up for a moment and he foresees as it were in that moment all the long tale of days of early awakings of his own coming life of drudgery at work like this a man comes along carrying a boy whose rough work has already begunthe only childwhose presence beside him sweetened the fathers toil a little the boy has been badly injured by a fall of brickwork yet with an effort he rides boldly on his fathers shoulders it will be the way of natural affection to keep him alive as long as possible though with that miserably shattered bodyah with us still and feeling our care beside himand yet surely not without a heartbreaking sigh of relief alike from him and them when the end comes on the alert for incidents like these yet of necessity passing them by on the other side i find it hard to get rid of a sense that i for one have failed in love i could yield to the humour till i seemed to have had my share in those great public cruelties the shocking legal crimes which are on record like that coldblooded slaughter according to law of the four hundred slaves in the reign of nero because one of their number was thought to have murdered his master the reproach of that together with the kind of facile apologies those who had no share in the deed may have made for it as they went about quietly on their own affairs that day seems to come very close to me as i think upon it and to how many of those now actually around me whose life is a sore one must i be indifferent if i ever become aware of their soreness at all to some perhaps the necessary conditions of my own life may cause me to be opposed in a kind of natural conflict regarding those interests which actually determine the happiness of theirs i would that a stronger love might arise in my heart yet there is plenty of charity in the world my patron the stoic emperor has made it even fashionable to celebrate one of his brief returns to rome lately from the war over and above a largess of gold pieces to all who would the public debts were forgiven he made a nice show of it for once the romans entertained themselves with a goodnatured spectacle and the whole town came to see the great bonfire in the forum into which all bonds and evidence of debt were thrown on delivery by the emperor himself many private creditors following his example that was done well enough but still the feeling returns to me that no charity of ours can get at a certain natural unkindness which i find in things themselves when i first came to rome eager to observe its religion especially its antiquities of religious usage i assisted at the most curious perhaps of them all the most distinctly marked with that immobility which is a sort of ideal in the roman religion the ceremony took place at a singular spot some miles distant from the city among the low hills on the bank of the tiber beyond the aurelian gate there in a little wood of venerable trees piously allowed their own way age after ageilex and cypress remaining where they fell at last one over the other and all caught in that early maytime under a riotous tangle of wild clematiswas to be found a magnificent sanctuary in which the members of the arval college assembled themselves on certain days the axe never touched those treesnay it was forbidden to introduce any iron thing whatsoever within the precincts not only because the deities of these quiet places hate to be disturbed by the harsh noise of metal but also in memory of that better agethe lost golden agethe homely age of the potters of which the central act of the festival was a commemoration the preliminary ceremonies were long and complicated but of a character familiar enough peculiar to the time and place was the solemn exposition after lavation of hands processions backwards and forwards and certain changes of vestments of the identical earthen vesselsveritable relics of the old religion of numathe vessels from which the holy numa himself had eaten and drunk set forth above a kind of altar amid a cloud of flowers and incense and many lights for the veneration of the credulous or the faithful they were in fact cups or vases of burnt clay rude in form and the religious veneration thus offered to them expressed mens desire to give honour to a simpler age before iron had found place in human life the persuasion that that age was worth remembering a hope that it might come again that a numa and his age of gold would return has been the hope or the dream of some in every period yet if he did come back or any equivalent of his presence he could but weaken and by no means smite through that root of evil certainly of sorrow of outraged human sense in things which one must carefully distinguish from all preventible accidents death and the little perpetual daily dyings which have something of its sting he must necessarily leave untouched and methinks that were all the rest of mans life framed entirely to his liking he would straightway begin to sadden himself over the fatesay of the flowers for there is there has come to be since numa lived perhaps a capacity for sorrow in his heart which grows with all the growth alike of the individual and of the race in intellectual delicacy and power and which will find its aliment of that sort of golden age indeed one discerns even now a trace here and there often have i maintained that in this generous southern country at least epicureanism is the special philosophy of the poor how little i myself really need when people leave me alone with the intellectual powers at work serenely the drops of falling water a few wild flowers with their priceless fragrance a few tufts even of halfdead leaves changing colour in the quiet of a room that has but light and shadow in it these for a susceptible mind might well do duty for all the glory of augustus i notice sometimes what i conceive to be the precise character of the fondness of the roughest workingpeople for their young children a fine appreciation not only of their serviceable affection but of their visible graces and indeed in this country the children are almost always worth looking at i see daily in fine weather a child like a delicate nosegay running to meet the rudest of brick makers as he comes from work she is not at all afraid to hang upon his rough hand and through her he reaches out to he makes his own something from that strange region so distant from him yet so real of the worlds refinement what is of finer soul of finer stuff in things and demands delicate touchingto him the delicacy of the little child represents that it initiates him into that there surely is a touch of the secular gold of a perpetual age of gold but then again think for a moment with what a hard humour at the nature of things his struggle for bare life will go on if the child should happen to die i observed today under one of the archways of the baths two children at play a little seriouslya fair girl and her crippled younger brother two toy chairs and a little table and sprigs of fir set upright in the sand for a garden they played at housekeeping well the girl thinks her life a perfectly good thing in the service of this crippled brother but she will have a jealous lover in time and the boy though his face is not altogether unpleasant is after all a hopeless cripple for there is a certain grief in things as they are in man as he has come to be as he certainly is over and above those griefs of circumstance which are in a measure removablesome inexplicable shortcoming or misadventure on the part of nature itselfdeath and old age as it must needs be and that watching for their approach which makes every stage of life like a dying over and over again almost all death is painful and in every thing that comes to an end a touch of death and therefore of wretched coldness struck home to one of remorse of loss and parting of outraged attachments given faultless men and women given a perfect state of society which should have no need to practise on mens susceptibilities for its own selfish ends adding one turn more to the wheel of the great rack for its own interest or amusement there would still be this evil in the world of a certain necessary sorrow and desolation felt just in proportion to the moral or nervous perfection men have attained to and what we need in the world over against that is a certain permanent and general power of compassionhumanitys standing force of selfpityas an elementary ingredient of our social atmosphere if we are to live in it at all i wonder sometimes in what way man has cajoled himself into the bearing of his burden thus far seeing how every step in the capacity of apprehension his labour has won for him from age to age must needs increase his dejection it is as if the increase of knowledge were but an increasing revelation of the radical hopelessness of his position and i would that there were one even as i behind this vain show of things at all events the actual conditions of our life being as they are and the capacity for suffering so large a principle in thingssince the only principle perhaps to which we may always safely trust is a ready sympathy with the pain one actually seesit follows that the practical and effective difference between men will lie in their power of insight into those conditions their power of sympathy the future will be with those who have most of it while for the present as i persuade myself those who have much of it have something to hold by even in the dissolution of a world or in that dissolution of self which is for every one no less than the dissolution of the world it represents for him nearly all of us i suppose have had our moments in which any effective sympathy for us on the part of others has seemed impossible in which our pain has seemed a stupid outrage upon us like some overwhelming physical violence from which we could take refuge at best only in some mere general sense of goodwillsomewhere in the world perhaps and then to ones surprise the discovery of that goodwill if it were only in a not unfriendly animal may seem to have explained to have actually justified to us the fact of our pain there have been occasions certainly when i have felt that if others cared for me as i cared for them it would be not so much a consolation as an equivalent for what one has lost or suffered a realised profit on the summing up of ones accounts a touching of that absolute ground amid all the changes of phenomena such as our philosophers have of late confessed themselves quite unable to discover in the mere clinging of human creatures to each other nay in ones own solitary selfpity amid the effects even of what might appear irredeemable loss i seem to touch the eternal something in that pitiful contact something new and true fact or apprehension of fact is educed which on a review of all the perplexities of life satisfies our moral sense and removes that appearance of unkindness in the soul of things themselves and assures us that not everything has been in vain and i know not how but in the thought thus suggested i seem to take up and reknit myself to a wellremembered hour when by some gracious accidentit was on a journeyall things about me fell into a more perfect harmony than is their wont everything seemed to be for a moment after all almost for the best through the train of my thoughts one against another it was as if i became aware of the dominant power of another person in controversy wrestling with me i seem to be come round to the point at which i left off then the antagonist has closed with me again a protest comes out of the very depths of mans radically hopeless condition in the world with the energy of one of those suffering yet prevailing deities of which old poetry tells dared one hope that there is a heart even as ours in that divine assistant of ones thoughtsa heart even as mine behind this vain show of things notes virgil aeneid book line there are the tears of things see also page of this chapter where the same text is quoted in full transliteration enodioi symboloi paters definition omens by the wayside sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt virgil aeneid

martyrs ah voil les mes quil falloit la mienne rousseau the charm of its poetry a poetry of the affections wonderfully fresh in the midst of a threadbare world would have led marius if nothing else had done so again and again to cecilias house he found a range of intellectual pleasures altogether new to him in the sympathy of that pure and elevated soul elevation of soul generosity humanitylittle by little it came to seem to him as if these existed nowhere else the sentiment of maternity above all as it might be understood thereits claims with the claims of all natural feeling everywhere down to the sheep bleating on the hills nay even to the motherwolf in her hungry caveseemed to have been vindicated to have been enforced anew by the sanction of some divine pattern thereof he saw its legitimate place in the world given at last to the bare capacity for suffering in any creature however feeble or apparently useless in this chivalry seeming to leave the worlds heroism a mere property of the stage in this so scrupulous fidelity to what could not help itself could scarcely claim not to be forgotten what a contrast to the hard contempt of ones own or others pain of death of glory even in those discourses of aurelius but if marius thought at times that some longcherished desires were now about to blossom for him in the sort of home he had sometimes pictured to himself the very charm of which would lie in its contrast to any random affections that in this woman to whom children instinctively clung he might find such a sister at least as he had always longed for there were also circumstances which reminded him that a certain rule forbidding second marriages was among these people still in force ominous incidents moreover warning a susceptible conscience not to mix together the spirit and the flesh nor make the matter of a heavenly banquet serve for earthly meat and drink one day he found cecilia occupied with the burial of one of the children of her household it was from the tiny brow of such a child as he now heard that the new light had first shone forth upon themthrough the light of mere physical life glowing there again when the child was dead or supposed to be dead the aged servant of christ had arrived in the midst of their noisy grief and mounting to the little chamber where it lay had returned not long afterwards with the child stirring in his arms as he descended the stair rapidly bursting open the closelywound folds of the shroud and scattering the funeral flowers from them as the soul kindled once more through its limbs old roman commonsense had taught people to occupy their thoughts as little as might be with children who died young here today however in this curious house all thoughts were tenderly bent on the little waxen figure yet with a kind of exultation and joy notwithstanding the loud weeping of the mother the other children its late companions broke with it suddenly into the place where the deep black bed lay open to receive it pushing away the grim fossores the gravediggers they ranged themselves around it in order and chanted that old psalm of theirslaudate pueri dominum dead children childrens gravesmarius had been always half aware of an old superstitious fancy in his mind concerning them as if in coming near them he came near the failure of some latelyborn hope or purpose of his own and now perusing intently the expression with which cecilia assisted directed returned afterwards to her house he felt that he too had had today his funeral of a little child but it had always been his policy through all his pursuit of experience to take flight in time from any too disturbing passion from any sort of affection likely to quicken his pulses beyond the point at which the quiet work of life was practicable had he after all been taken unawares so that it was no longer possible for him to fly at least during the journey he took by way of testing the existence of any chain about him he found a certain disappointment at his heart greater than he could have anticipated and as he passed over the crisp leaves nipped off in multitudes by the first sudden cold of winter he felt that the mental atmosphere within himself was perceptibly colder yet it was finally a quite successful resignation which he achieved on a review after his manner during that absence of loss or gain the image of cecilia it would seem was already become for him like some matter of poetry or of another mans story or a picture on the wall and on his return to rome there had been a rumour in that singular company of things which spoke certainly not of any merely tranquil loving hinted rather that he had come across a world the lightest contact with which might make appropriate to himself also the precept that they which have wives be as they that have none this was brought home to him when in early spring he ventured once more to listen to the sweet singing of the eucharist it breathed more than ever the spirit of a wonderful hopeof hopes more daring than poor labouring humanity had ever seriously entertained before though it was plain that a great calamity was befallen amid stifled sobbing even as the pathetic words of the psalter relieved the tension of their hearts the people around him still wore upon their faces their habitual gleam of joy of placid satisfaction they were still under the influence of an immense gratitude in thinking even amid their present distress of the hour of a great deliverance as he followed again that mystical dialogue he felt also again like a mighty spirit about him the potency the halfrealised presence of a great multitude as if thronging along those awful passages to hear the sentence of its release from prison a company which represented nothing less thanorbis terrarumthe whole company of mankind and the special note of the day expressed that reliefa sound new to him drawn deep from some old hebrew source as he conjectured alleluia repeated over and over again alleluia alleluia at every pause and movement of the long easter ceremonies and then in its place by way of sacred lection although in shocking contrast with the peaceful dignity of all around came the epistle of the churches of lyons and vienne to their sister the church of rome for the peace of the church had been brokenbroken as marius could not but acknowledge on the responsibility of the emperor aurelius himself following tamely and as a matter of course the traces of his predecessors gratuitously enlisting against the good as well as the evil of that great pagan world the strange new heroism of which this singular message was full the greatness of it certainly lifted away all merely private regret inclining one at last actually to draw sword for the oppressed as if in some new order of knighthood the pains which our brethren have endured we have no power fully to tell for the enemy came upon us with his whole strength but the grace of god fought for us set free the weak and made ready those who like pillars were able to bear the weight these coming now into close strife with the foe bore every kind of pang and shame at the time of the fair which is held here with a great crowd the governor led forth the martyrs as a show holding what was thought great but little and that the pains of today are not deserving to be measured against the glory that shall be made known these worthy wrestlers went joyfully on their way their delight and the sweet favour of god mingling in their faces so that their bonds seemed but a goodly array or like the golden bracelets of a bride filled with the fragrance of christ to some they seemed to have been touched with earthly perfumes vettius epagathus though he was very young because he would not endure to see unjust judgment given against us vented his anger and sought to be heard for the brethren for he was a youth of high place whereupon the governor asked him whether he also were a christian he confessed in a clear voice and was added to the number of the martyrs but he had the paraclete within him as in truth he showed by the fulness of his love glorying in the defence of his brethren and to give his life for theirs then was fulfilled the saying of the lord that the day should come when he that slayeth you will think that he doeth god service most madly did the mob the governor and the soldiers rage against the handmaiden blandina in whom christ showed that what seems mean among men is of price with him for whilst we all and her earthly mistress who was herself one of the contending martyrs were fearful lest through the weakness of the flesh she should be unable to profess the faith blandina was filled with such power that her tormentors following upon each other from morning until night owned that they were overcome and had no more that they could do to her admiring that she still breathed after her whole body was torn asunder but this blessed one in the very midst of her witness renewed her strength and to repeat i am christs was to her rest refreshment and relief from pain as for alexander he neither uttered a groan nor any sound at all but in his heart talked with god sanctus the deacon also having borne beyond all measure pains devised by them hoping that they would get something from him did not so much as tell his name but to all questions answered only i am christs for this he confessed instead of his name his race and everything beside whence also a strife in torturing him arose between the governor and those tormentors so that when they had nothing else they could do they set redhot plates of brass to the most tender parts of his body but he stood firm in his profession cooled and fortified by that stream of living water which flows from christ his corpse a single wound having wholly lost the form of man was the measure of his pain but christ paining in him set forth an ensample to the restthat there is nothing fearful nothing painful where the love of the father overcomes and as all those cruelties were made null through the patience of the martyrs they bethought them of other things among which was their imprisonment in a dark and most sorrowful place where many were privily strangled but destitute of mans aid they were filled with power from the lord both in body and mind and strengthened their brethren also much joy was in our virgin mother the church for by means of these such as were fallen away retraced their stepswere again conceived were filled again with lively heat and hastened to make the profession of their faith the holy bishop pothinus who was now past ninety years old and weak in body yet in his heat of soul and longing for martyrdom roused what strength he had and was also cruelly dragged to judgment and gave witness thereupon he suffered many stripes all thinking it would be a wickedness if they fell short in cruelty towards him for that thus their own gods would be avenged hardly drawing breath he was thrown into prison and after two days there died after these things their martyrdom was parted into divers manners plaiting as it were one crown of many colours and every sort of flowers they offered it to god maturus therefore sanctus and blandina were led to the wild beasts and maturus and sanctus passed through all the pains of the amphitheatre as if they had suffered nothing before or rather as having in many trials overcome and now contending for the prize itself were at last dismissed but blandina was bound and hung upon a stake and set forth as food for the assault of the wild beasts and as she thus seemed to be hung upon the cross by her fiery prayers she imparted much alacrity to those contending witnesses for as they looked upon her with the eye of flesh through her they saw him that was crucified but as none of the beasts would then touch her she was taken down from the cross and sent back to prison for another day that though weak and mean yet clothed with the mighty wrestler christ jesus she might by many conquests give heart to her brethren on the last day therefore of the shows she was brought forth again together with ponticus a lad of about fifteen years old they were brought in day by day to behold the pains of the rest and when they wavered not the mob was full of rage pitying neither the youth of the lad nor the sex of the maiden hence they drave them through the whole round of pain and ponticus taking heart from blandina having borne well the whole of those torments gave up his life last of all the blessed blandina herself as a mother that had given life to her children and sent them like conquerors to the great king hastened to them with joy at the end as to a marriagefeast the enemy himself confessing that no woman had ever borne pain so manifold and great as hers nor even so was their anger appeased some among them seeking for us pains if it might be yet greater that the saying might be fulfilled he that is unjust let him be unjust still and their rage against the martyrs took a new form insomuch that we were in great sorrow for lack of freedom to entrust their bodies to the earth neither did the nighttime nor the offer of money avail us for this matter but they set watch with much carefulness as though it were a great gain to hinder their burial therefore after the bodies had been displayed to view for many days they were at last burned to ashes and cast into the river rhone which flows by this place that not a vestige of them might be left upon the earth for they said now shall we see whether they will rise again and whether their god can save them out of our hands chapter xxvii the triumph of marcus aurelius not many months after the date of that epistle marius then expecting to leave rome for a long time and in fact about to leave it for ever stood to witness the triumphal entry of marcus aurelius almost at the exact spot from which he had watched the emperors solemn return to the capital on his own first coming thither his triumph was now a full onejustus triumphus justified by far more than the due amount of bloodshed in those northern wars at length it might seem happily at an end among the captives amid the laughter of the crowds at his blowsy upper garment his trousered legs and conical wolfskin cap walked our own ancestor representative of subject germany under a figure very familiar in later roman sculpture and though certainly with none of the grace of the dying gaul yet with plenty of uncouth pathos in his misshapen features and the pale servile yet angry eyes his children whiteskinned and goldenhaired as angels trudged beside him his brothers of the animal world the ibex the wildcat and the reindeer stalking and trumpeting grandly found their due place in the procession and among the spoil set forth on a portable frame that it might be distinctly seen no mere model but the very house he had lived in a wattled cottage in all the simplicity of its snug contrivances against the cold and wellcalculated to give a moments delight to his new sophisticated masters andrea mantegna working at the end of the fifteenth century for a society full of antiquarian fervour at the sight of the earthy relics of the old roman people day by day returning to light out of the claychildish still moreover and with no more suspicion of pasteboard than the old romans themselves in its unabashed love of openair pageantries has invested this the greatest and alas the most characteristic of the splendours of imperial rome with a reality livelier than any description the homely sentiments for which he has found place in his learned paintings are hardly more lifelike than the great public incidents of the show there depicted and then with all that vivid realism how refined how dignified how select in type is this reflection of the old roman worldnow especially in its timemellowed red and gold for the modern visitor to the old english palace it was under no such selected types that the great procession presented itself to marius though in effect he found something there prophetic so to speak and evocative of ghosts as susceptible minds will do upon a repetition after long interval of some notable incident which may yet perhaps have no direct concern for themselves in truth he had been so closely bent of late on certain very personal interests that the broad current of the worlds doings seemed to have withdrawn into the distance but now as he witnessed this procession to return once more into evidence for him the world certainly had been holding on its old way and was all its old self as it thus passed by dramatically accentuating in this favourite spectacle its mode of viewing things and even apart from the contrast of a very different scene he would have found it just now a somewhat vulgar spectacle the temples wide open with their ropes of roses flapping in the wind against the rich reflecting marble their startling draperies and heavy cloud of incense were but the centres of a great banquet spread through all the gaudily coloured streets of rome for which the carnivorous appetite of those who thronged them in the glare of the midday sun was frankly enough asserted at best they were but calling their gods to share with them the cooked sacrificial and other meats reeking to the sky the child who was concerned for the sorrows of one of those northern captives as he passed by and explained to his comradetheres feeling in that hand you know benumbed and lifeless as it looked in the chain seemed in a moment to transform the entire show into its own proper tinsel yes these romans were a coarse a vulgar people and their vulgarities of soul in full evidence here and aurelius himself seemed to have undergone the worlds coinage and fallen to the level of his reward in a mediocrity no longer golden yet if as he passed by almost filling the quaint old circular chariot with his magnificent goldenflowered attire he presented himself to marius chiefly as one who had made the great mistake to the multitude he came as a more than magnanimous conqueror that he had forgiven the innocent wife and children of the dashing and almost successful rebel avidius cassius now no more was a recent circumstance still in memory as the children went pastnot among those who ere the emperor ascended the steps of the capitol would be detached from the great progress for execution happy rather and radiant as adopted members of the imperial familythe crowd actually enjoyed an exhibition of the moral order such as might become perhaps the fashion and it was in consideration of some possible touch of a heroism herein that might really have cost him something that marius resolved to seek the emperor once more with an appeal for commonsense for reason and justice he had set out at last to revisit his old home and knowing that aurelius was then in retreat at a favourite villa which lay almost on his way thither determined there to present himself although the great plain was dying steadily a new race of wild birds establishing itself there as he knew enough of their habits to understand and the idle contadino with his neverending ditty of decay and death replacing the lusty roman labourer never had that poetic region between rome and the sea more deeply impressed him than on this sunless day of early autumn under which all that fell within the immense horizon was presented in one uniform tone of a clear penitential blue stimulating to the fancy as was that range of low hills to the northwards already troubled with the upbreaking of the apennines yet a want of quiet in their outline the record of wild fracture there of sudden upheaval and depression marked them as but the ruins of nature while at every little descent and ascent of the road might be noted traces of the abandoned work of man from time to time the way was still redolent of the floral relics of summer daphne and myrtleblossom sheltered in the little hollows and ravines at last amid rocks here and there piercing the soil as those descents became steeper and the main line of the apennines now visible gave a higher accent to the scene he espied over the plateau almost like one of those broken hills cutting the horizon towards the sea the old brown villa itself rich in memories of one after another of the family of the antonines as he approached it such reminiscences crowded upon him above all of the life there of the aged antoninus pius in its wonderful mansuetude and calm death had overtaken him here at the precise moment when the tribune of the watch had received from his lips the word aequanimitas as the watchword of the night to see their emperor living there like one of his simplest subjects his hands red at vintagetime with the juice of the grapes hunting teaching his children starting betimes with all who cared to join him for long days of antiquarian research in the country aroundthis and the like of this had seemed to mean the peace of mankind upon that had comelike a stain it seemed to marius just thenthe more intimate life of faustina the life of faustina at home surely that marvellous but malign beauty must still haunt those rooms like an unquiet dead goddess who might have perhaps after all something reassuring to tell surviving mortals about her ambiguous self when two years since the news had reached rome that those eyes always so persistently turned to vanity had suddenly closed for ever a strong desire to pray had come over marius as he followed in fancy on its wild way the soul of one he had spoken with now and again and whose presence in it for a time the world of art could so ill have spared certainly the honours freely accorded to embalm her memory were poetic enoughthe rich temple left among those wild villagers at the spot now it was hoped sacred for ever where she had breathed her last the golden image in her old place at the amphitheatre the altar at which the newly married might make their sacrifice above all the great foundation for orphan girls to be called after her name the latter precisely was the cause why marius failed in fact to see aurelius again and make the chivalrous effort at enlightenment he had proposed to himself entering the villa he learned from an usher at the door of the long gallery famous still for its grand prospect in the memory of many a visitor and then leading to the imperial apartments that the emperor was already in audience marius must wait his turnhe knew not how long it might be an odd audience it seemed for at that moment through the closed door came shouts of laughter the laughter of a great crowd of childrenthe faustinian children themselves as he afterwards learnedhappy and at their ease in the imperial presence uncertain then of the time for which so pleasant a reception might last so pleasant that he would hardly have wished to shorten it marius finally determined to proceed as it was necessary that he should accomplish the first stage of his journey on this day the thing was not to bevale anima infelicissimahe might at least carry away that sound of the laughing orphan children as a not unamiable last impression of kings and their houses the place he was now about to visit especially as the restingplace of his dead had never been forgotten only the first eager period of his life in rome had slipped on rapidly and almost on a sudden that old time had come to seem very long ago an almost burdensome solemnity had grown about his memory of the place so that to revisit it seemed a thing that needed preparation it was what he could not have done hastily he half feared to lessen or disturb its value for himself and then as he travelled leisurely towards it and so far with quite tranquil mind interested also in many another place by the way he discovered a shorter road to the end of his journey and found himself indeed approaching the spot that was to him like no other dreaming now only of the dead before him he journeyed on rapidly through the night the thought of them increasing on him in the darkness it was as if they had been waiting for him there through all those years and felt his footsteps approaching now and understood his devotion quite gratefully in that lowliness of theirs in spite of its tardy fulfilment as morning came his late tranquillity of mind had given way to a grief which surprised him by its freshness he was moved more than he could have thought possible by so distant a sorrow todaythey seemed to be saying as the hard dawn broketoday he will come at last amid all his distractions they were become the main purpose of what he was then doing the world around it when he actually reached the place later in the day was in a mood very different from hisso workaday it seemed on that fine afternoon and the villages he passed through so silent the inhabitants being for the most part at their labour in the country then at length above the tiled outbuildings were the walls of the old villa itself with the tower for the pigeons and not among cypresses but halfhidden by aged poplartrees their leaves like golden fruit the birds floating around it the conical roof of the tomb itself in the presence of an old servant who remembered him the great seals were broken the rusty key turned at last in the lock the door was forced out among the weeds grown thickly about it and marius was actually in the place which had been so often in his thoughts he was struck not however without a touch of remorse thereupon chiefly by an odd air of neglect the neglect of a place allowed to remain as when it was last used and left in a hurry till long years had covered all alike with thick dust the faded flowers the burntout lamps the tools and hardened mortar of the workmen who had had something to do there a heavy fragment of woodwork had fallen and chipped open one of the oldest of the mortuary urns many hundreds in number ranged around the walls it was not properly an urn but a minute coffin of stone and the fracture had revealed a piteous spectacle of the mouldering unburned remains within the bones of a child as he understood which might have died in ripe age three times over since it slipped away from among his greatgrandfathers so far up in the line yet the protruding baby hand seemed to stir up in him feelings vivid enough bringing him intimately within the scope of dead peoples grievances he noticed side by side with the urn of his mother that of a boy of about his own ageone of the servingboys of the householdwho had descended hither from the lightsome world of childhood almost at the same time with her it seemed as if this boy of his own age had taken filial place beside her there in his stead that hard feeling again which had always lingered in his mind with the thought of the father he had scarcely known melted wholly away as he read the precise number of his years and reflected suddenlyhe was of my own present age no hard old man but with interests as he looked round him on the world for the last time even as mine today and with that came a blinding rush of kindness as if two alienated friends had come to understand each other at last there was weakness in all this as there is in all care for dead persons to which nevertheless people will always yield in proportion as they really care for one another with a vain yearning as he stood there still to be able to do something for them he reflected that such doing must be after all in the nature of things mainly for himself his own epitaph might be that old one eskhatos tou idiou genous he was the last of his race of those who might come hither after himself probably no one would ever again come quite as he had done today and it was under the influence of this thought that he determined to bury all that deep below the surface to be remembered only by him and in a way which would claim no sentiment from the indifferent that took many dayswas like a renewal of lengthy old burial ritesas he himself watched the work early and late coming on the last day very early and anticipating by stealth the last touches while the workmen were absent one young lad only finally smoothing down the earthy bed greatly surprised at the seriousness with which marius flung in his flowers one by one to mingle with the dark mould notes transliteration eskhatos tou idiou genous translation he was the last of his race chapter xxviii anima naturaliter christiana those eight days at his old home so mournfully occupied had been for marius in some sort a forcible disruption from the world and the roots of his life in it he had been carried out of himself as never before and when the time was over it was as if the claim over him of the earth below had been vindicated over against the interests of that living world around dead yet sentient and caressing hands seemed to reach out of the ground and to be clinging about him looking back sometimes now from about the midway of lifethe age as he conceived at which one begins to redescend ones lifethough antedating it a little in his sad humour he would note almost with surprise the unbroken placidity of the contemplation in which it had been passed his own temper his early theoretic scheme of things would have pushed him on to movement and adventure actually as circumstances had determined all its movement had been inward movement of observation only or even of pure meditation in part perhaps because throughout it had been something of a meditatio mortis ever facing towards the act of final detachment death however as he reflected must be for every one nothing less than the fifth or last act of a drama and as such was likely to have something of the stirring character of a dnouement and in fact it was in form tragic enough that his end not long afterwards came to him in the midst of the extreme weariness and depression which had followed those last days cornelius then as it happened on a journey and travelling near the place finding traces of him had become his guest at whitenights it was just then that marius felt as he had never done before the value to himself the overpowering charm of his friendship more than brotherhe feltlike a son also contrasting the fatigue of soul which made himself in effect an older man with the irrepressible youth of his companion for it was still the marvellous hopefulness of cornelius his seeming prerogative over the future that determined and kept alive all other sentiment concerning him a new hope had sprung up in the world of which he cornelius was a depositary which he was to bear onward in it identifying himself with cornelius in so dear a friendship through him marius seemed to touch to ally himself to actually to become a possessor of the coming world even as happy parents reach out and take possession of it in and through the survival of their children for in these days their intimacy had grown very close as they moved hither and thither leisurely among the countryplaces thereabout cornelius being on his way back to rome till they came one evening to a little town marius remembered that he had been there on his first journey to rome which had even then its church and legendthe legend and holy relics of the martyr hyacinthus a young roman soldier whose blood had stained the soil of this place in the reign of the emperor trajan the thought of that so recent death haunted marius through the night as if with audible crying and sighs above the restless wind which came and went around their lodging but towards dawn he slept heavily and awaking in broad daylight and finding cornelius absent set forth to seek him the plague was still in the placehad indeed just broken out afresh with an outbreak also of cruel superstition among its wild and miserable inhabitants surely the old gods were wroth at the presence of this new enemy among them and it was no ordinary morning into which marius stepped forth there was a menace in the dark masses of hill and motionless wood against the gray although apparently unclouded sky under this sunless heaven the earth itself seemed to fret and fume with a heat of its own in spite of the strong nightwind and now the wind had fallen marius felt that he breathed some strange heavy fluid denser than any common air he could have fancied that the world had sunken in the night far below its proper level into some close thick abysm of its own atmosphere the christian people of the town hardly less terrified and overwrought by the haunting sickness about them than their pagan neighbours were at prayer before the tomb of the martyr and even as marius pressed among them to a place beside cornelius on a sudden the hills seemed to roll like a sea in motion around the whole compass of the horizon for a moment marius supposed himself attacked with some sudden sickness of brain till the fall of a great mass of building convinced him that not himself but the earth under his feet was giddy a few moments later the little marketplace was alive with the rush of the distracted inhabitants from their tottering houses and as they waited anxiously for the second shock of earthquake a longsmouldering suspicion leapt precipitately into welldefined purpose and the whole body of people was carried forward towards the band of worshippers below an hour later in the wild tumult which followed the earth had been stained afresh with the blood of the martyrs felix and faustinusflores apparuerunt in terra nostraand their brethren together with cornelius and marius thus as it had happened taken among them were prisoners reserved for the action of the law marius and his friend with certain others exercising the privilege of their rank made claim to be tried in rome or at least in the chief town of the district where indeed in the troublous days that had now begun a legal process had been already instituted under the care of a military guard the captives were removed on the same day one stage of their journey sleeping for security during the night side by side with their keepers in the rooms of a shepherds deserted house by the wayside it was surmised that one of the prisoners was not a christian the guards were forward to make the utmost pecuniary profit of this circumstance and in the night marius taking advantage of the loose charge kept over them and by means partly of a large bribe had contrived that cornelius as the really innocent person should be dismissed in safety on his way to procure as marius explained the proper means of defence for himself when the time of trial came and in the morning cornelius in fact set forth alone from their miserable place of detention marius believed that cornelius was to be the husband of cecilia and that perhaps strangely had but added to the desire to get him away safelywe wait for the great crisis which is to try what is in us we can hardly bear the pressure of our hearts as we think of it the lonely wrestler or victim which imagination foreshadows to us can hardly be ones self it seems an outrage of our destiny that we should be led along so gently and imperceptibly to so terrible a leapingplace in the dark for more perhaps than life or death at last the great act the critical moment itself comes easily almost unconsciously another motion of the clock and our fatal linethe great climacteric pointhas been passed which changes ourselves or our lives in one quarter of an hour under a sudden uncontrollable impulse hardly weighing what he did almost as a matter of course and as lightly as one hires a bed for ones nights rest on a journey marius had taken upon himself all the heavy risk of the position in which cornelius had then beenthe long and wearisome delays of judgment which were possible the danger and wretchedness of a long journey in this manner possibly the danger of death he had delivered his brother after the manner he had sometimes vaguely anticipated as a kind of distinction in his destiny though indeed always with wistful calculation as to what it might cost him and in the first moment after the thing was actually done he felt only satisfaction at his courage at the discovery of his possession of nerve yet he was as we know no hero no heroic martyrhad indeed no right to be and when he had seen cornelius depart on his blithe and hopeful way as he believed to become the husband of cecilia actually as it had happened without a word of farewell supposing marius was almost immediately afterwards to follow marius indeed having avoided the moment of leavetaking with its possible call for an explanation of the circumstances the reaction came he could only guess of course at what might really happen so far he had but taken upon himself in the stead of cornelius a certain amount of personal risk though he hardly supposed himself to be facing the danger of death still especially for one such as he with all the sensibilities of which his whole manner of life had been but a promotion the situation of a person under trial on a criminal charge was actually full of distress to him in truth a death such as the recent death of those saintly brothers seemed no glorious end in his case at least the martyrdom as it was calledthe overpowering act of testimony that heaven had come down among menwould be but a common execution from the drops of his blood there would spring no miraculous poetic flowers no eternal aroma would indicate the place of his burial no plenary grace overflowing for ever upon those who might stand around it had there been one to listen just then there would have come from the very depth of his desolation an eloquent utterance at last on the irony of mens fates on the singular accidents of life and death the guards now safely in possession of whatever money and other valuables the prisoners had had on them pressed them forward over the rough mountain paths altogether careless of their sufferings the great autumn rains were falling at night the soldiers lighted a fire but it was impossible to keep warm from time to time they stopped to roast portions of the meat they carried with them making their captives sit round the fire and pressing it upon them but weariness and depression of spirits had deprived marius of appetite even if the food had been more attractive and for some days he partook of nothing but bad bread and water all through the dark mornings they dragged over boggy plains up and down hills wet through sometimes with the heavy rain even in those deplorable circumstances he could but notice the wild dark beauty of those regionsthe stormy sunrise and placid spaces of evening one of the keepers a very young soldier won him at times by his simple kindness to talk a little with wonder at the lads halfconscious poetic delight in the adventures of the journey at times the whole company would lie down for rest at the roadside hardly sheltered from the storm and in the deep fatigue of his spirit his old longing for inopportune sleep overpowered himsleep anywhere and under any conditions seemed just then a thing one might well exchange the remnants of ones life for it must have been about the fifth night as he afterwards conjectured that the soldiers believing him likely to die had finally left him unable to proceed further under the care of some country people who to the extent of their power certainly treated him kindly in his sickness he awoke to consciousness after a severe attack of fever lying alone on a rough bed in a kind of hut it seemed a remote mysterious place as he looked around in the silence but so freshlying in fact in a high pastureland among the mountainsthat he felt he should recover if he might but just lie there in quiet long enough even during those nights of delirium he had felt the scent of the newmown hay pleasantly with a dim sense for a moment that he was lying safe in his old home the sunlight lay clear beyond the open door and the sounds of the cattle reached him softly from the green places around recalling confusedly the torturing hurry of his late journeys he dreaded as his consciousness of the whole situation returned the coming of the guards but the place remained in absolute stillness he was in fact at liberty but for his own disabled condition and it was certainly a genuine clinging to life that he felt just then at the very bottom of his mind so it had been obscurely even through all the wild fancies of his delirium from the moment which followed his decision against himself in favour of cornelius the occupants of the place were to be heard presently coming and going about him on their business and it was as if the approach of death brought out in all their force the merely human sentiments there is that in death which certainly makes indifferent persons anxious to forget the dead to put themthose aliensaway out of their thoughts altogether as soon as may be conversely in the deep isolation of spirit which was now creeping upon marius the faces of these people casually visible took a strange hold on his affections the link of general brotherhood the feeling of human kinship asserting itself most strongly when it was about to be severed for ever at nights he would find this face or that impressed deeply on his fancy and in a troubled sort of manner his mind would follow them onwards on the ways of their simple humdrum everyday life with a peculiar yearning to share it with them envying the calm earthy cheerfulness of all their days to be still under the sun though so indifferent of course to himas if these rude people had been suddenly lifted into some height of earthly goodfortune which must needs isolate them from himself tristem neminen fecithe repeated to himself his old prayer shaping itself now almost as his epitaph yes so much the very hardest judge must concede to him and the sense of satisfaction which that thought left with him disposed him to a conscious effort of recollection while he lay there unable now even to raise his head as he discovered on attempting to reach a pitcher of water which stood near revelation vision the discovery of a vision the seeing of a perfect humanity in a perfect worldthrough all his alternations of mind by some dominant instinct determined by the original necessities of his own nature and character he had always set that above the having or even the doing of anything for such vision if received with due attitude on his part was in reality the being something and as such was surely a pleasant offering or sacrifice to whatever gods there might be observant of him and how goodly had the vision beenone long unfolding of beauty and energy in things upon the closing of which he might gratefully utter his vixi even then just ere his eyes were to be shut for ever the things they had seen seemed a veritable possession in hand the persons the places above all the touching image of jesus apprehended dimly through the expressive faces the crying of the children in that mysterious drama with a sudden sense of peace and satisfaction now which he could not explain to himself surely he had prospered in life and again as of old the sense of gratitude seemed to bring with it the sense also of a living person at his side for still in a shadowy world his deeper wisdom had ever been with a sense of economy with a jealous estimate of gain and loss to use life not as the means to some problematic end but as far as might be from dying hour to dying hour an end in itselfa kind of music allsufficing to the duly trained ear even as it died out on the air yet now aware still in that suffering body of such vivid powers of mind and sense as he anticipated from time to time how his sickness practically without aid as he must be in this rude place was likely to end and that the moment of taking final account was drawing very near a consciousness of waste would come with halfangry tears of selfpity in his great weaknessa blind outraged angry feeling of wasted power such as he might have experienced himself standing by the deathbed of another in condition like his own and yet it was the fact again that the vision of men and things actually revealed to him on his way through the world had developed with a wonderful largeness the faculties to which it addressed itself his general capacity of vision and in that too was a success in the view of certain very definite wellconsidered undeniable possibilities throughout that elaborate and lifelong education of his receptive powers he had ever kept in view the purpose of preparing himself towards possible further revelation some daytowards some ampler vision which should take up into itself and explain this worlds delightful shows as the scattered fragments of a poetry till then but halfunderstood might be taken up into the text of a lost epic recovered at last at this moment his unclouded receptivity of soul grown so steadily through all those years from experience to experience was at its height the house ready for the possible guest the tablet of the mind white and smooth for whatsoever divine fingers might choose to write there and was not this precisely the condition the attitude of mind to which something higher than he yet akin to him would be likely to reveal itself to which that influence he had felt now and again like a friendly hand upon his shoulder amid the actual obscurities of the world would be likely to make a further explanation surely the aim of a true philosophy must lie not in futile efforts towards the complete accommodation of man to the circumstances in which he chances to find himself but in the maintenance of a kind of candid discontent in the face of the very highest achievement the unclouded and receptive soul quitting the world finally with the same fresh wonder with which it had entered the world still unimpaired and going on its blind way at last with the consciousness of some profound enigma in things as but a pledge of something further to come marius seemed to understand how one might look back upon life here and its excellent visions as but the portion of a racecourse left behind him by a runner still swift of foot for a moment he experienced a singular curiosity almost an ardent desire to enter upon a future the possibilities of which seemed so large and just then again amid the memory of certain touching actual words and images came the thought of the great hope that hope against hope which as he conceived had arisenlux sedentibus in tenebrisupon the aged world the hope cornelius had seemed to bear away upon him in his strength with a buoyancy which had caused marius to feel not so much that by a caprice of destiny he had been left to die in his place as that cornelius was gone on a mission to deliver him also from death there had been a permanent protest established in the world a plea a perpetual afterthought which humanity henceforth would ever possess in reserve against any wholly mechanical and disheartening theory of itself and its conditions that was a thought which relieved for him the iron outline of the horizon about him touching it as if with soft light from beyond filling the shadowy hollow places to which he was on his way with the warmth of definite affections confirming also certain considerations by which he seemed to link himself to the generations to come in the world he was leaving yes through the survival of their children happy parents are able to think calmly and with a very practical affection of a world in which they are to have no direct share planting with a cheerful goodhumour the acorns they carry about with them that their grandchildren may be shaded from the sun by the broad oaktrees of the future that is natures way of easing death to us it was thus too surprised delighted that marius under the power of that new hope among men could think of the generations to come after him without it dim in truth as it was he could hardly have dared to ponder the world which limited all he really knew as it would be when he should have departed from it a strange lonesomeness like physical darkness seemed to settle upon the thought of it as if its business hereafter must be as far as he was concerned carried on in some inhabited but distant and alien star contrariwise with the sense of that hope warm about him he seemed to anticipate some kindly care for himself never to fail even on earth a care for his very bodythat dear sister and companion of his soul outworn suffering and in the very article of death as it was now for the weariness came back tenfold and he had finally to abstain from thoughts like these as from what caused physical pain and then as before in the wretched sleepless nights of those forced marches he would try to fix his mind as it were impassively and like a child thinking over the toys it loves one after another that it may fall asleep thus and forget all about them the sooner on all the persons he had loved in lifeon his love for them dead or living grateful for his love or not rather than on theirs for himletting their images pass away again or rest with him as they would in the bare sense of having loved he seemed to find even amid this foundering of the ship that on which his soul might assuredly rest and depend one after another he suffered those faces and voices to come and go as in some mechanical exercise as he might have repeated all the verses he knew by heart or like the telling of beads one by one with many a sleepy nod betweenwhiles for there remained also for the old earthy creature still within him that great blessedness of physical slumber to sleep to lose ones self in sleepthat as he had always recognised was a good thing and it was after a space of deep sleep that he awoke amid the murmuring voices of the people who had kept and tended him so carefully through his sickness now kneeling around his bed and what he heard confirmed in the then perfect clearness of his soul the inevitable suggestion of his own bodily feelings he had often dreamt he was condemned to die that the hour with wild thoughts of escape was arrived and waking with the sun all around him in complete liberty of life had been full of gratitude for his place there alive still in the land of the living he read surely now in the manner the doings of these people some of whom were passing out through the doorway where the heavy sunlight in very deed lay that his last morning was come and turned to think once more of the beloved often had he fancied of old that not to die

helplessness their mystic bread had been placed had descended like a snowflake from the sky between his lips gentle fingers had applied to hands and feet to all those old passageways of the senses through which the world had come and gone for him now so dim and obstructed a medicinable oil it was the same people who in the gray austere evening of that day took up his remains and buried them secretly with their accustomed prayers but with joy also holding his death according to their generous view in this matter to have been of the nature of martyrdom and martyrdom as the church had
