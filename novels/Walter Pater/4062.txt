significantly the effectiveness of their brotherly union less by way of invasion of the rights of others than by the improvement of all gentler sentiments within from the sumptuous monuments of their last restingplace backwards to every object which had encircled them in that warmer and more lightsome home it was visible they had cared for so much even in some peculiarities of the very groundplan of the house itselfeverywhere was the token of their anxious estimate of all those incidents of mans pathway through the world which knit the wayfarers thereon most closely together why this irregularity of groundplanthe traveller would ask recognising indeed a certain distinction in its actual effect on the eye and suspecting perhaps some conscious aim at such effect on the part of the builders of the place in an age indulgent of architectural caprices and the traditional answer to the question true for once still showed the race of latour making much making the most of the sympathetic ties of human life the work in large measure of gaston de latour it was left unfinished at his death some time about the year that it was never completed could hardly be attributed to any lack of means or of interest for it is plain that to the period of the revolution after which its scanty remnants passed into humble occupation a few circular turrets a crenellated curtain wall giving a random touch of dignity to some ordinary farmbuildings the place had been scrupulously maintained it might seem to have been a kind of reverence rather that had allowed the work to remain untouched for future ages precisely at this point in its growth and the expert architectural mind peeping acutely into recondite motives and halfaccomplished purposes in such matters could detect the circumstance which had determined that so noticeable peculiarity of groundplan its kernel was not as in most similar buildings of that date a feudal fortress but an unfortified manorhousea double manoirtwo houses oddly associated at a right angle far back in the middle age said a not uncertain tradition here had been the one point of contact between two estates intricately interlocked with alien domain as in the course of generations the family of latour and another had added field to field in the single lonely manor then existing two brothers had grown up and the time came when the marriage of the younger to the heiress of those neighbouring lands would divide two perfect friends regretting overnight so dislocating a change it was the elder who as the drowsy hours flowed away in manifold recollection beside the fire now suggested to the younger himself already wistfully recalling as from the past the kindly motion and noise of the place like a sort of audible sunlight the building of a second manorhousethe chteau damour as it came to be calledthat the two families in what should be as nearly as possible one abode might take their fortunes together of somewhat finer construction than the rough walls of the older manor the chteau damour stood amid the change of years as a visible record of all the accumulated sense of human existence among its occupants the old walls the old apartments of those two associated houses still existed with some obvious additions beneath the delicate fantastic surfaces of the chteau of the sixteenth century its singularity of outline was the very symbol of the religion of the family in the race of latour still full of loyalty to the old home as its numerous outgrowths took hold here and there around a race with some prominent characteristics ineradicable in the grain they went to raise the human level about them by a transfer of blood far from involving any social decadence in themselves a peculiar local variety of character of manners in that district of la beauce surprised the more observant visitor who might find his way into farmhouse or humble presbytery of its scattered townships and as for those who kept up the central tradition of their house they were true to the soil coming back under whatever obstacles from court from cloister from distant crusade to the visible spot where the memory of their kindred was liveliest and most exacta memory touched so solemnly with a conscience of the intimacies of life its significant events its contacts and partings that to themselves it was like a second sacred history it was a great day amid all their quiet days for the people of deuxmanoirsone of the later days of august the event which would mark it always in the life of one of them called into play all that was most expressive in that welldefined family character it was at once the recognition of what they valued most in past years and an assertion of will or hope for the future accordant thereto far away in paris the young king charles the ninth in his fourteenth year had been just declared of age here in the church of saint hubert church of their parish and of their immemorial patronage though it lay at a considerable distance from their abode the chiefs of the house of latour attended by many of its dependents and less important members were standing ready around the last hope of their old agethe grandparents their aged brothers and sisters certain aged ecclesiastics of their kindred wont to be called to the family councils they had set out on foot after a votive mass said early in the old chapel of the manor to assist at the ceremony of the day distinguishable from afar by unusual height in proportion to its breadth within the church of saint hubert had an atmosphere a daylight to itself its stained glass work of the same hands that had wrought for the cathedral of chartres admitted only an almost angry ray of purple or crimson here or there across the dark roomy spaces the heart the heart of youth at least sank as one entered stepping warily out of the sunshine over the sepulchral stones which formed the entire pavement of the church a great blazonry of family history from age to age for indefatigable eyes an abundance of almost lifesized sculpture clung to the pillars lurked in the angles seemed with those symbolical gestures and mystic faces ready to speak their parts to be almost in motion through the gloom many years after gaston de latour an enemy of all gothic darkness or heaviness returning to his home full of a later taste changed all that a thicket of airy spires rose above the sanctuary the blind triforium broke into one continuous window the heavy masses of stone were pared down with wonderful dexterity of hand till not a handsbreadth remained uncovered by delicate tracery as from the fair white roof touched sparingly with gold down to the subterranean chapel of saint taurin where the peasants of la beauce came to pray for rain not a space was left unsearched by cheerful daylight refined but hardly dimmed at all by painted glass mimicking the clearness of the open sky in the sombre old church all was in stately order now the dusky jewelled reliquaries the ancient devotional ornaments from the manormuchprized family possessions sufficient to furnish the whole array of a great ecclesiastical function like thisthe lights burning flowers everywhere gathered amid the last handfuls of the harvest by the peasantwomen who came to present their children for the happy chance of an episcopal blessing and the almost exclusively aged people in all their old personal adornments which now so rarely saw the light forming the central group expectant around the young seigneur they had conducted hither seemed of one piece with those mystic figures the old armour clad monumental effigies the carved and painted imageries which ran round the outer circuit of the choira version of the biblical history for the reading of those who loitered on their way from chapel to chapel there was josephs dream with the tall sheaves of the elder brethren bowing to josephs sheaf like these aged heads around the youthful aspirant of today there was jacob going on his mysterious way met by conversing with wrestling with the angels of godrescuing the promise of his race from the profane esau there was the mother of samuel and in long white ephod the much desired earlyconsecrated child who had inherited her religious capacity and david with something of his extraordinary genius for divine things written on his countenance onward to the sacred persons of the annunciation with the golden lily in the silver cup only lately set in its place with dress expression nay the very incidents themselves innocently adapted to the actual habits and associations of the age which had produced them these figures of the old jewish history seemed about to take their places for the imparting of a divine sanction among the living actors of the day one and all spoke of ready concurrence with religious motions a ready apprehension of and concurrence with the provisions of a certain divine scheme for the improvement of ones opportunities in the world would that darkhaired fairskinned lad concur in his turn and be always true to his present purposegaston de latour standing thus almost the only youthful thing amid the witness of these imposing meditative masks and faces could his guardians have read below the white propriety of the youth duly arrayed for dedication with the lighted candle in his right hand and the surplice folded over his left shoulder he might sorely have disturbed their placid but somewhat narrow ruminations with the germs of what was strange to or beyond them certain of those shrewd old ecclesiastics had in fact detected that the devout lad so visibly impressed was not altogether after their kind that together with many characteristics obviously inherited he possessedhad caught perhaps from some ancestor unrepresented heresome other potencies of nature which might not always combine so accordantly as today with the mental requisites of an occasion such as this one of them indeed touched notwithstanding by his manifest piety just then shortly afterwards recommended him a little prayer for peace from the vespers of the roman breviaryfor the harmony of his heart with itself advice which except for a very short period he ever afterwards followed saying it every evening of his life yet it was the lads own election which had led him to this first step in a career that might take him out of the world and end the race of latour altogether approaching their fourscore years and realising almost suddenly the situation of the young gaston left there alone out of what had been a large muchpromising resonant household they wished otherwise but did not try to change his earlypronounced preference for the ecclesiastical calling when he determined to seek the clericature his proposal made a demand on all their oldfashioned religious sentiment but the fund was a deep one and their acquiescence in the result entire he might indeed use his privilege of orders only as the steppingstone to material advancement in a church which seemed to have gone over wholly to the world and of which at that time one half the benefices were practically in the hands of laymen but actually the event came to be a dedication on their part not unlike those old biblical onesan offering in old age of the single precious thing left them the grandchild whose hair would presently fall under the very shears which a hundred years before had turned an earlier brilliant gaston de latour into a monk charles guillard bishop of chartres a courtly vivacious prelate whose quick eyes seemed to note at a glance the whole assembly one and all while his lips moved silently arrived at last and the rite began with the singing of the office for the ninth hour it was like a stream of water crossing unexpectedly a dusty waymirabilia testimonia tua in psalm and antiphon inexhaustibly fresh the soul seemed to be taking refuge at that undevout hour from the sordid languor and the mean business of mens lives in contemplation of the unfaltering vigour of the divine righteousness which had still those who sought it not only watchful in the night but alert in the drowsy afternoon yes there was the sheep astray sicut ovis quae periitthe physical world with its lusty ministers at work or sleeping for a while amid the stubble their faces upturned to the august sunthe world so importunately visible intruding a little way with its floating odours in that semicircle of heat across the old overwritten pavement at the great open door upon the mysteries within seen from the incenseladen sanctuary where the bishop was assuming one by one the pontifical ornaments la beauce like a many coloured carpet spread under the great dome with the white double housefront quivering afar through the heat though it looked as if you might touch with the hand its distant spaces was for a moment the unreal thing gaston alone with all his mystic preoccupations by the privilege of youth seemed to belong to both and link the visionary company about him to the external scene the rite with which the roman church makes a clerk aims certainly at no low measure of difference from the coarser world around him in its supposed scholar and in this case the aspirant the precise claims of the situation being well considered had no misgiving discreetly and with full attention he answers adsum when his name is called and advances manfully though he kneels meekly enough and remains with his head bowed forward at the knees of the seated bishop who recites the appointed prayers between the anthems and responses of his schola or attendant singersmight he be saved from mental blindness might he put on the new man even as his outward guise was changed might he keep the religious habit for ever who had thus hastened to lay down the hair of his head for the divine love the lord is my inheritance whispers gaston distinctly as the locks fall cut from the thicklygrown black head in five places after the fashion of christs crown the shears in the episcopal hands sounding aloud amid the silence of the curious spectators from the same hands in due order the fair surplice ripples down over him this is the generation of them that seek him the choir sings the lord himself is the portion of my inheritance and my cup it was the churchs eloquent way of bidding unrestricted expansion to the youthful heart in its timely purpose to seek the best to abide among the things of the spirit the prospect from their cheerful unenclosed road like a white scarf flung across the land as the party returned home in the late august afternoon was clear and dry and distant the great barns at the wayside had their doors thrown back displaying the dark cool space within the farmsteads seemed almost tenantless the villagers being still at work over the immense harvestfield crazy bells startled them striking out the hour from behind over a deserted churchyard still and tenantless also seemed the manor as they approached door and window lying open upon the court for the coolness or rather it was as if at their approach certain spectral occupants started back out of the daylightwhy depart dear ghosts was what the grandparents would have cried they had more in common with that immaterial world than with flesh and blood there was room for the existing household enough and to spare in one of the two old houses that other the chteau damour remained for gaston at first as a delightful halfknown abode of wonders though with some childish fear afterwards as a delightful nursery of refined or fantastic sentiment as he recalled in this chamber or that its old tenants and their doings from the affectionate brothers onwardsabove all how in one room long ago gabrielle de latour had died of joy with minds full of their recent business it was difficult to go back to common occupations as darkness came on the impressions of the day did but return again more vividly and concentrate themselves upon the inward sense observance loyal concurrence in some high purpose for him passive waiting on the hand one might miss in the darkness with the gift or gifts therein of which he had the presentiment and upon the due acceptance of which the true fortune of life would turn these were the hereditary traits alert in gaston as he lay awake in the absolute moonlit stillness his outward ear attentive for the wandering footsteps which through that wide lightlyaccentuated country often came and went about the house with weird suggestions of a dim passage to and fro and of an infinite distance he would rise as the footsteps halted perhaps below his window to answer the questions of the travellers pilgrims or labourers who had missed their way from farm to farm or halting soldier seeking guidance terrible or terrorstricken companies sometimes rudely or piteously importunate to be let in for it was the period of the religious wars flaming up here and there over france and never quite put out during forty years once in the beginning of these troubles he was then a child leaning from the window as a sound of rickety small wheels approached the enquiry came in broken french voulezvous donner direction from a german one of the mercenaries of the duc de guise hired for service in a civil strife of france drawing wearily a crippled companion so far from home the memory of it awakening a thousand strange fancies had remained by him as a witness to the power of fortuitous circumstance over the imagination one night there had come a noise of horns and presently king charles himself was standing in the courtyard belated and far enough now from troublesome company as he hunted the richfleshed game of la beauce through the endless corn he entered with a relish for the pleasant cleanliness of the place expressed in a shrill strain of halfreligious oaths like flashes of hellfire to gastons suddenly awakened sense it was the invincible nature of the royal lad to speak and feel on these mad alto notes and not unbecoming in a good catholic for huguenots never swore and these were subtly theological oaths well the grandparents repressed as best they could their apprehensions as to what other hunters what other disconcerting incident might follow for catholic france very generally believed that the huguenot leaders had a scheme for possessing themselves of the person of the young king known to be mentally pliable meanwhile they led him to their daintiest apartment with great silver flambeaux that he might wash off the blood with which not his hands only were covered for he hunted also with the eagerness of a madmansteeped in blood he lay there for a few hours after supping very familiarly on his own birds gaston rising from his bed to look on at a distance and afterwards on his knee serving the rosewater dish and spiced wine as the night passed in reassuring silence charles himself as usual keenly enjoying this gipsy incident with the supper after that unexpected fashion among strange people he hardly knew where he was very pale like some cunning italian work in wax or ivory of partly satiric character endued by magic or crafty mechanism with vivacious movement but as he sat thus ever for the most part the unhappy plaything of other peoples humours escaped for a moment out of a world of demoniac politicians the pensive atmosphere around seemed gradually to change him touching his wild temper pleasantly profitably so that he took down from the wall and struck out the notes of a lute and fell to talking of verses leaving a stanza of his own scratched with a diamond on the windowpanelines simpler hearted and more full of nature than were common at that day the life of gaston de latour was almost to coincide with the duration of the religious wars the earliest public event of his memory was that famous siege of orleans from which the young henri de guise rode away the head of his restless family tormented now still further by the reality or the pretence of filial duty seeking vengeance on the treacherous murder of his father following a long period of quiet progressthe tranquil and tolerant years of the renaissance the religious war took possession of and pushed to strangely confused issues a society somewhat distraught by an artificial aesthetic culture and filled with wild passions wildlydramatic personalities a scene already singularly attractive by its artistic beauty a heady religious fanaticism was worked by every prominent egotist in turn pondering on his chances in the event of the extinction of the house of valois with the three sons of catherine de medici born unsound and doomed by astrological prediction the old manors which had exchanged their towers for summerhouses under the softening influence of renaissance fashions found themselves once more medievally insecure amid a vagrant warfare of foreign mercenaries and armed peasants it was a curiously refined people who now took down the armour hanging high on the wall for decoration among newer things so little warlike a difficult age certainly for scrupulous spirits to move in a perplexed network of partizan or personal interests underlay and furnished the really directing forces in a supposed armageddon of contending religious convictions the wisest perhaps like michel de lhpital withdrew themselves from a conflict in which not a single actor has the air of quite pure intentions while religion itself the assumed ground of quarrel seems appreciable all the while only by abstraction from the parties the leaders at once violent and cunning who are most pretentious in the assertion of its rival claims what there was of religion was in hiding perhaps with the socalled political party professedly almost indifferent to it but which had at least something of humanity on its side and some chance of that placidity of mind in which alone the business of the spirit can be done the new sect of papists were not the true catholics there was little of the virtue of the martyr in militant calvinism it is not a catholic historian who notes with profound regret that inauspicious day in the year gastons tenth year when the work of devastation began which was to strip from france that antique garniture of religious art which later ages have not been able to replace axe and hammer at the carved work sounded from one end of france to the other it was a peculiarity of this age of terror that every one including charles the ninth himself dreaded what the accident of war might make not merely of his enemies but of temporary allies and pretended friends in an evenly balanced but very complex strifeof merely personal rivals also in some matter which had nothing to do with the assumed motives of that strife gaston de latour passing on his country way one night with a sudden flash of fierce words two young men burst from the doors of a roadside tavern the brothers are quarrelling about the division lately effected there of their dead fathers morsel of land i shall hate you till death cries the younger bounding away in the darkness and two atheists part to take opposite sides in the supposed strife of catholic and huguenot the deeds of violence which occupy the foreground of french history during the reigns of catherines sons might indeed lead one to fancy that little human kindness could have remained in francea fanatical civil war of forty years that no place at all could have been left for the quiet building of character contempt for human life taught us every day by nature and alas by man himselfall war intensifies that but the more permanent forces alike of human nature and of the natural world are on the whole in the interest of tranquillity and sanity and of the sentiments proper to man like all good catholic children gaston had shuddered at the name of adretz of briquemaut with his great necklace of priests ears of that dark and fugitive montgomeri the slayer as some would have it the assassin of a king now active and almost ubiquitous on the huguenot side still at deuxmanoirs this warfare seething up from time to time so wildly in this or that district of france was for the most part only sensible in incidents we might think picturesque were they told with that intention delightful enough certainly to the curiosity of a boy in whose mind nevertheless they deepened a native impressibility to the sorrow and hazard that are constant and necessary in human life especially for the poor the troubles of that poor people of franceburden of all its righteous rulers from saint lewis downwardsthese at all events would not be lessened by the struggle of guise and cond and bourbon and valois of the valois with each other of those four brilliant young princes of the name of henry the weak would but suffer somewhat more than was usual in the interest of the strong if you were not sure whether that gleaming of the sun in the vast distance flashed from swords or sickles whether that faroff curl of smoke rose from stubblefire or villagesteeple to protect which the peasants still lovers of their churches would arm themselves women and all with fork and scythestill those peasants used their scythes in due season for reaping their leagues of cornland and slept with faces as tranquil as ever towards the sky for their noonday rest in effect since peace is always in some measure dependent on ones own seeking disturbing forces do but fray their way along somewhat narrow paths over the great spaces of the quiet realm of nature la beauce vast enough to present at once every phase of weather its one landmark the twin spires of chartres salient as the finger of a dial guiding by their change of perspective victor or vanquished on his way offered room enough for the business both of peace and war to those enamoured of either when gaston after a brief absence was unable to find his childs gardenbed that was only because in a fine june the corn had grown tall so quickly through which he was presently led to it with all its garish sweets undisturbed and it was with the ancient growths of mindcustoms beliefs mental preferencesas with the natural world it may be understood that there was a certain rudeness about the old manor left almost untouched from age to age with a loyalty which paid little or no heed to changes of fashion the chteau damour indeed as the work of a later age refined somewhat upon the rough feudal architecture and the daintier taste had centred itself in particular upon one apartment a veritable womans apartment with an effect in some degree anticipating the achievement of gastons own century in which the apparatus of daily life became so eloquent of the moods of those to whom it ministered it was the chamber of gabrielle de latour who had died of joy here certainly she had watched at these windows during ten whole years for the return of her beloved husband from a disastrous battle in the east till against all expectation she beheld him crossing the court at last immense privilege immense distinction again and again gaston tried to master the paradox at times in deep concentration of mind seemed almost to touch the point of that wonderful moment hither as to an oratory a religious place the finer spirits of her kin had always found their way to leave behind them there the more intimate relics of themselves to gaston its influence imparted early a taste for delicate things as being indispensable in all his pleasures to come and from the very first with the appetite for some great distinguishing passion the peculiar genius of his age seeming already awake spontaneously within him here at least had been one of those grand passions such as were needed to give life its true meaning and effect conscious of that rudeness in his home and feeding a strong natural instinct for outward beauty hitherto on what was barely sufficient he found for himself in this perfumed place the centre of a fanciful world reaching out to who could tell what refined passages of existence in that great world beyond of which the echoes seemed to light here amid the stillness on his first visit one pensive afternoon fitting the lately attained key in the lock he seemed to have drawn upon himself yet hardly to have disturbed the meditations of its former occupant a century of unhindered summers had taken the heat from its coloursthe couches the curtains half shading the windows which the rain in the south west wind just then touched so softly that great passion of old had been also a dainty love leaving its impress everywhere in this magic apartment on the musical instruments the books lying where they might have fallen from the hands of the listless reader so long since the fragrance which the lads movement stirred around him and there on one of the windows were the verses of king charles who had slept here as in the most courtly restingplace of the house on certain nights gaston himself was not afraid to steal from his own bed to lie in it though still too healthy a sleeper to be visited by the appropriate dreams he so greatly longed for a nature instinctively religious which would readily discover and give their full value to all such facts of experience as might be conformable thereto but what would be the relation of this religious sensibility to sensibilities of another kind now awaking in the young gaston as he mused in this dreamy place surrounded by the books the furniture almost the very presence of the past which had already found tongues to speak of a still living humanity somewhere somewhere in the worldwaiting for him in the distance or perchance already on its way to explain by its own plenary beauty and power why wine and roses and the languorous summer afternoons were so delightful so far indeed the imaginative heat that might one day enter into dangerous rivalry with simple old fashioned faith was blent harmoniously with it they were hardly distinguishable elements of an amiable character susceptible generally to the poetic side of thingstwo neighbourly apprehensions of a single ideal the great passions the fervid sentiments of which gaston dreamed as the true realisation of life have not always softened mens natures they have been compatible with many cruelties as in the lost spirits of that very age they may overflow on the other hand in more equable natures through the concurrence of happier circumstance into that universal sympathy which lends a kind of amorous power to the homeliest charities so it seemed likely to be with gaston de latour sorrow came along with beauty a rival of its intricate omnipresence in life in the sudden tremor of an aged voice the handling of a forgotten toy a childish drawing in the tacit observance of a day he became aware suddenly of the great stream of human tears falling always through the shadows of the world for once the darling of old age actually more than responded in full to its tenderness in the isolation of his life there had been little demand for sympathy on the part of those anywhere near his own age so much the larger was the fund of superfluous affection which went forth with a delicacy not less than their own to meet the sympathies of the aged people who cherished him in him their old almost forgotten sorrows bled anew variety of affection in a household in which many relations had lived together had brought variety of sorrow but they were well nigh healed nowthose once so poignant griefsthe scars remaining only as deeper lines of natural expression it was visible to their surprise that he penetrated the motive of the mass said so solemnly in violet on the innocents day and understood why they wept at the triumphant antiphonsmy soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlerthinking intently of the little tombs which had recorded carefully almost the minutes of childrens lives elizabeth de latour cornlius de latour aged so many years days hours yes the cold pavement under ones feet had once been molten lava surely the resources of sorrow were large in things the fact must be duly marked and provided for with due estimate of his own susceptibility thereto in his scheme of life might he pass through the world unriven by sorrows such as those and already it was as if he stept softly over the earth not to outrage its so abundant latent sensibilities the beauty of the world and its sorrow solaced a little by religious faith itself so beautiful a thing these were the chief impressions with which he made his way outwards at first only in longer rambles as physical strength increased over his native plains whereon as we have seen the cruel warfare of that age had aggravated at a thousand points the everyday appeal of suffering humanity the vast level stretching thirty miles from east to west thirty from north to southperhaps the reader may think little of its resources for the seeker after natural beauty or its capacity to develope the imagination a world he may fancy in which there could be no shadows at best not too cheerful colours in truth it was all accent so to speak but then surely all the finer influences of every language depend mostly on accent and he has but to think of it as gaston actually lived in it to find a singularly companionable soul there gaston at least needed but to go far enough across it for those inward oppositions to cease which already at times beset him to feel at one with himself again under the influence of a scene which had for him something of the character of the seaits changefulness its infinity its pathos in the toiling human life that traversed it featureless if you will it was always under the guidance of its ample sky scowling back sometimes moodily enough but almost never without a remnant of fine weather about august it was for the most part cloudless and then truly under its blue dome the great plain would as it were laugh and sing in a kind of absoluteness of sympathy with the sun ii our ladys church i had almost said even as they like a ship for ever asail in the distance thought the child everywhere the great church of chartres was visible with the passing light or shadow upon its grey weatherbeaten surfaces the people of la beauce were proud and would talk often of its rich store of sacred furniture the wonderworking relics of our lady under the earth and her sacred veil or shift which kings and princes came to visit returning with a likeness thereof replete in miraculous virtue for their own wearing the busy fancy of gaston multiplying this chance hearsay had set the whole interior in arraya dim spacious fragrant place afloat with golden lights lit up over the autumn fields at evening the distant spires suggested the splendour within with so strong an imaginative effect that he seemed scarcely to know whether it was through the mental or bodily eye that he beheld when he came thither at last like many another well born youth to join the episcopal household as a kind of half clerical page he found as happens in the actual testing of our ideals at once more and less than he had supposed and his earlier vision was a thing he could never precisely recover or disentangle from the supervening reality what he saw certainly was greater far in mere physical proportion and incommensurable at first by anything he knewthe volume of the wrought detail the mass of the component members the bigness of the actual stones of the masonry contrary to the usual gothic manner and as if in reminiscence of those old druidic piles amid which the virgin of chartres had been adored long before the birth of christ by a mystic race possessed of some prophetic sense of the grace in store for her through repeated dangers goodfortune has saved that unrivalled treasure of stained glass and then as now the word awful so often applied to gothic aisles was for once really applicable you enter looking perhaps for a few minutes cool shelter from the summer noonday and the placid sunshine of la beauce seems to have been transformed in a moment into imperious angry fire it was not in summer however that gaston first set foot there he saw the beautiful city for the first time as if sheathed austerely in repellent armour in his most genial subsequent impressions of the place there was always a lingering trace of that famous frost through which he made his way wary of petrifying contact against things without to the great western portal on candlemas morning the sad patient images by the doorways of the crowded church seemed suffering now chiefly from the cold it was almost like a funeral the penitential violet the wandering taperlight of this half lenten feast of purification his new companions at the head and in the rear of the long procession forced every one even the lord bishop himself to move apace bustling along crossbearer and acolyte in their odd little copes out of the bitter air which made the jolly life gaston now entered on around the great fire of their hall in the episcopal palace seem all the more winsome notredame de chartres it was a world to explore as if one explored the entire middle age it was also one unending elaborate religious functiona life or a continuous drama to take ones part in dependent on its structural completeness on its wealth of well preserved ornament on its unity in variety perhaps on some undefinable operation of genius beyond but concurrently with all these the church of chartres has still the gift of a unique power of impressing in comparison the other famous churches of france at amiens for instance at rheims or beauvais may seem but formal and to a large extent reproducible effects of mere architectural rule on a gigantic scale the somewhat gothic soul of gaston relished there something strange or even bizarre in the very manner in which the building set itself so broadly couchant upon the earth in the natural richness of tone on the masonry within in its vast echoing roof of timber the forest as it was called in the mysterious maze traced upon its pavement its mazelike crypt centering in the shrine of the sibylline notredame itself a natural or very primitive grotto or cave a few years were still to pass ere sacrilegious hands despoiled it on a religious pretextthe catholic church must pay even with the molten gold of her sanctuaries the price of her defence in the civil war at present it was such a treasurehouse of medieval jewellery as we have to make a very systematic effort even to imagine the still extant register of its furniture and sacred apparel leaves the soul of the ecclesiologist athirst and it had another very remarkable difference from almost all gothic churches there were no graves there its emptiness in this respect is due to no revolutionary or huguenot desecration once indeed about this very time a popular military leader had been interred with honour within the precinct of the high altar itself but not long afterwards said the reverend canons resenting on the part of their immaculate patroness this intrusion the corpse itself ill at ease had protested lifting up its hands above the surface of the pavement as if to beg interment elsewhere and gaston could remember assisting awakened suddenly one night at the removal of the remains to a more ordinary place of sepulture and yet that lavish display of jewellers work on the altars in the chapels the sacristies of our ladys church was but a framing for little else than dead peoples bones to gaston a piteous soul with a touch also of that grim humour which as we know holds of pity relicworship came naturally at deuxmanoirs too there had been relics including certain broken childrens toys and some rude childish drawings taken forth now and then with almost religious veneration with trembling hands and renewal of old grief to his wondering awe at the greatness of mens sorrows yes the pavement under ones feet had once been might become again for him molten lava the look the manner of those who exposed these things had been a revelation the abundant relics of the church of chartres were for the most part perished remnants of the poor human body itself but appertaining to persons long ago and of a faroff

finger of an evangelist the crowned head of saint lubin bishop of chartres long centuries since but still able to preserve its wheatstacks from fire bones of the maries with some of the earth from their grave these and the like of these was what the curious eye discerned in the recesses of those variously contrived reliquaries great and small glittering so profusely about the dusky church itself ministering by its very shadows to a certain appetite in the soul of gaston for dimnessfor a dim place like thissuch as he had often prefigured to himself albeit with some suspicion of what might seem a preference for darkness physical twilight we most of us love in its season to him that perpetual twilight came in close identity with its moral or intellectual counterpart as the welcome requisite for that part of the soul which loves twilight and is in truth never quite at rest out of it through some congenital uneasiness or distress perhaps in its processes of vision as complex yet not less perfectly united under a single leading motiveits sister volume was the ritual order of notredame de chartres a yearlong dramatic action in which every one had and knew his partthe drama or mystery of redemption to the necessities of which the great church had shaped itself all those various offices which in pontifical missal and breviary devout imagination had elaborated from age to age with such a range of spiritual colour and light and shade with so much poetic tact in quotation such a depth of insight into the christian soul had joined themselves harmoniously together one office ending only where another began in the perpetual worship of this mother of churches which had also its own picturesque peculiarities of use proud of its maternal privilege therein and the music rosewarmed expanded or fell silent altogetheras the order of the year the colours the whole expression of things changed gathering around the full mystic effulgence of the pontiff in his own person

of the past therethe actual stones of the temple and that sacred liturgical orderentered readily enough into gastons mental kingdom filling places prepared by the anticipations of his tranquil dreamstruck youth it was the present the uncalculated present which now disturbed the complacent habit of his thoughts proposing itself importunately in the living forms of his immediate companions in the great clerical body of which he was become a part in the people of chartres itself none the less animated because provincial as a thing alien at a thousand points from his preconceptions of life to be judged by him to be rejected or located within how vivid how delightful they werethe other fortynine of the fifty lads who had come hither after the old fashioned way to serve in the household of monseigneur by way of an institution in learning and good manners as to which a grave national assembly more than three centuries before the states general of had judged french youth of quality somewhat behindhand recommending king and nobles to take better care for the future of their education to the end that enlightened and moralised they might know their duties and be less likely to abuse their privileges and how becomingly that cleric pride that selfrespecting quiet sat upon their highbred figures their angelic unspoiled faces saddened transiently as they came under the religious spell for a moment as for gaston they welcomed him with perfect friendliness kept their best side foremost for an hour and would not leave his very dreams in absolute unconsciousness they had brought from their remote old homes all varieties of hereditary gifts vices distinctions dark fates mercy cruelty madness appetite and vanity abounded but with an abundant superficial grace befitting a generation which as by some aesthetic sense in the air made the most of the pleasant outsides of life all the various traits of the dying middle age were still in evidence among them in all their crude effectiveness only blent like rusty old armour wreathed in flowers with the peculiar fopperies of the time shrewdly divined from a distance as happens with competent youth to be in paris itself amid the full delightful fragrance of those dainty visible things which huguenots despisedthat surely were the sum of goodfortune halfclerical they loved nevertheless the touch of steel had a laughing joy in trifling with its latent soul of destruction in mimicry of the great world they had their leaders so inscrutably selfimposedinstinctively they felt and underwent that mystery of leadership with its consequent heats of spirit its tides and changes of influence on the other hand also to gaston dreamily observant it was quaint likeable the way they had of reproducing unsuspectingly the humours of animal nature does not the anthropologist tell us of a heraldry with a large assortment of heraldic beasts to be found among savage or halfsavage peoples as the survival of a period when men were nearer than they are or seem to be now to the irrational world throughout the sprightly movement of the lads daily life it was as if their tribal pets or monsters were with or within them tall exmes lithe and cruel like a tigerit was pleasant to stroke him the tiger was there the parrot the hare the goat of course and certainly much apishness and one and all they were

company one by one his confidantsso loyal to the people there bursting into wild tears over the letter which brought the news of his younger brothers death visibly fretting over it long afterwards still for the most part in their perfect health nothing seemed to reach them but their own boyish ordinances their own arbitrary form it was an absolute indifference most striking when they lifted their welltrained voices to sing in choir vacant as the sparrows while the eloquent farreaching aspiring words floated melodiously from them sometimes with truly medieval license singing to the sacred music those songs from the streets no one cared to detect which were really in their hearts a world of vanity and appetite yet after all of honesty with itself like grown people they were but playing a game and meant to observe its rules say rather a world of honesty and of courage they at least were not preoccupied all day long and if they woke in the night with the fear of death it was part of their precocious worldliness to recognise to feel a little afraid of their new companions intellectual power those obviously meditative souls which seem not to sleep o nights seldom fail to put others on their guard who can tell what they may be judging planning in silence so near to one looking back long afterwards across the dark period that had intervened gaston could trace their ways through the world not many of them had survived to his own middle life reappearing from point to point they connected themselves with the great crimes the great tragedies of the time as so many brightcoloured threads in that sombre tapestry of human passion to recall in the obtuse grieved marred faces of uninteresting men or women the disappointments the sorrows the tragic mistakes of the children they were long ago that is a good trick for taking our own sympathy by surprise which gaston practised when he saw the last or almost the last of some of them and felt a great pity a great indulgence here and now at all events carrying their cheerful tumult through all those quiet ecclesiastical placesthe bishops garden the great sacristy neat and clean in its brown pensive lights they seemed of a piece with the bright simple inanimate things the toys of nature they made one lively picture with the fruit and wine they loved the birds they captured the buckets of clear water drawn for pastime from the great well and jean smurs painted conjuring book stolen from the old sorceress his grandmother out of which he told their fortunes with the musical instruments of others with their carefully hidden dice and playingcards worn or soiled by the fingers of the older gamesters who had discarded them like their elders they read eagerly in racy new translations old greek and latin books with a delightful shudder at the wanton paganism it was a new element of confusion in the presentment of that miniature world the classical enthusiasm laid hold on gaston too but essayed in vain to thrust out of him the medieval character of his experience or put on quite a new face insinuating itself rather under cover of the middle age still in occupation all around him venus mars aeneas haunted in contemporary shape like ghosts of folk one had known the places with which he was familiar latin might still seem the fittest language for oratory sixteen hundred years after cicero was dead those old roman pontiffs draped grandly sat in the stalls of the choir propertius made love to cynthia in the raiment of the foppish amade they played terence and it was but a play within a play above all in natural heartfelt kinship with their own violent though refined and cunning time they loved every incident of soldiering while the changes of the year the lights the shadows the flickering fires of winter with which gaston had first associated his companions so full of artificial enjoyment for the welltodo added themselves pleasantly by way of shifting background to the spectacular effect it was the brilliant surface with which the untried world confronted him touch it where you might you felt the resistant force of the solid matter of human experienceof human experience in its strange mixture of beauty and evil its sorrow its illassorted fates its pathetic acquiescence above all in its overpowering certainty over against his own world of echoes and shadows which perhaps only seemed to be so much as echoes or shadows a nature with the capacity of worship he was straightway challenged as by a rival new religion claiming to supersede the religion he knew to identify himself conclusively with this so tangible world its suppositions its issues its risks here was a world certainly which did not halt in meditation but prompted one to make actual trial of it with a liberty of heart which might likely enough traverse this or that precept if it were not rather a mere scruple of his earlier conscience these its children at all events were as he felt in instinctive sympathy with its motions had shrewd divinations of the things men really valued and waited on them with unquestioning docility two worlds two antagonistic ideals were in evidence before him could a third condition supervene to mend their discord or only vex him perhaps from time to time with efforts towards an impossible adjustment at a later date monseigneur charles guillard then bishop of chartres became something like a huguenot and ceased with the concurrence of ecclesiastical authority from his high functions even now he was but a protg of king charles in his relations to a more than suspicious pope and a rumour of the fact reaching somehow these brisk young ears had already set gastons mind in action tremblingly as to those small degrees scarcely realisable perhaps one by one though so immeasurable in their joint result by which one might part from the living vine and at times he started back as if he saw his own benighted footsteps pacing lightly towards an awful precipice at present indeed the assumption that there was sanctity in everything the kindly prelate touched was part of the wellmaintained etiquette of the little ecclesiastical court but as you meet in the street faces that are like a sacrament so there are faces looks tones of voice among dignified priests as among other people to hear or look upon which is to feel the hypothesis of an unseen world impossible as he smiled amiably out of the midst of his pontifical array on gastons scrupulous devotion it was as if the old roman augur smiled not only to his fellow augur but to the entire assistant world in after years gaston seemed to understand and as a consequence of understanding to judge his old patron equitably the religious sense too had its various species the nephew of his predecessor in the see with a real sense of the divine world but as something immeasurably distant monseigneur guillard had been brought by maladroit worldly goodfortune a little too close to its immediate and visible embodiments from afar you might trace the divine agency on its way but to touch to handle it with these fleshly handswell for monseigneur that was by no means to believe because the thing was incredible or absurd he had smiled not certainly from irreverence nor a prelate for half his life in conscious incredulity but only in mute surprise at an administration of divine gracesthis administration in which he was a high priestin itself to his quite honest thinking so unfitting so improbable and was it that gaston too was a less independent ruler of his own mental world than he had fancied that he derived his impressions of things not directly from them but mediately from other peoples impressions about them and he needed the pledge of their assents to ratify his own only could that after all be a real sun at which other peoples faces were not irradiated and sometimes it seemed with a riotous swelling of the heart as if his own wondrous appetite in these matters had been deadened by surfeit and there would be a pleasant sense of liberty of escape outof doors could he be as little touched as almost all other people by our ladys church and old associations and all those relics and those dark close fragrant aisles at such times to recall the winged visitant gentle yet withal sensitive to offence which had settled on his youth with so deep a sense of assurance he would climb the tower of jean de beauce then fresh in all its array of airy staircase and pierced traceries and great uncovered timbers like some gigantic birdnest amid the stones whence the large quiet country spaces became his own again and the curious eye at least went home he was become well aware of the power of those familiar influences in restoring equanimity as he might have used a medicine or a wine at each ascending storey as the flight of the birds the scent of the fields swept past him till he stood at last amid the unimpeded light and air of the watch chamber above the great bells some coil of perplexity of unassimilable thought or fact fell away from him he saw the distant paths and seemed to hear the breeze piping suddenly upon them under the cloudless sky on its unseen capricious way through those vast reaches of atmosphere at this height the low ring of blue hills was visible with suggestions of that southwest country of peachblossom and wine which had sometimes decoyed his thoughts towards the sea and beyond it to that new world of the indies which was held to explain a certain softness in the air from that quarter even in the most vehement weather amid those vagrant shadows and shafts of light must be deuxmanoirs the deserted rooms the gardens the graves in middistance even then a funeral procession was on its way humbly to one of the village churchyards he seemed almost to hear the words across the stillness they identified themselves as with his own earliest prepossessions so also with what was apt to present itself as being the common human prepossessiona certain finally authoritative common sense upon the quiet experience of thingsthe oldest the most authentic of all voices audible always if one stepped aside for a moment and got ones ears into what might after all be their normal condition it might be heard it would seem in proportion as men were in touch with the earth itself in country life in manual work upon it above all by the open grave as if reminiscent of some older deeper more permanent ground of fact it whispered then oracularly a certain secret to those who came into such close contact with it persistent afterthought would it always survive amid the indifference of others amid the verdicts of the world amid a thousand doubts it seemed to have found and filled to overflowing the soul of one amiable little child who had a kind of genius for tranquillity and on his first coming hither had led gaston to what he held to be the choicest pleasantest places as being impregnable by noise in his small stock of knowledge he knew like all around him that he was going to die and took kindly to the thought of a small grave in the little green close as to a natural sleepingplace in which he would be at home beforehand descending from the tower gaston knew he should find the child seated alone enjoying the perfect quiet of the warm afternoon for all the world was absentgone forth to receive or gaze at a company of distinguished pilgrims coming sometimes with immense prelude and preparation as when king charles himself arrived to replace an image disfigured by profane huguenots sometimes with the secrecy and suddenness of an apparition vanished before the public was aware the pilgrims to our lady under the earth were the standing resource of those such there were at chartres as everywhere else who must needs depend for the interest of their existence on the doings of their neighbours a motley host only needing their chaucer to figure as a lookingglass of life type against type they brought with them on the one hand the very presence and perfume of paris the centre of courtly propriety and fashion on the other hand with faces which seemed to belong to another age curiosities of existence from remote provinces of france or europe from distant halffabulous lands remoter still jules damville who would have liked best to be a sailor to command not in any spiritual ark but in the french fleetshould halfruined france ever come to have oneled his companions one evening to inspect a strange maritime personage stout and square returned contrary to all expectation after ten years captivity among the savages of florida kneeling among the lights at the shrine with the frankness of a good child his hair like a mat his hands tattooed his mahogany face seamed with a thousand weather wrinklings his outlandish offerings lying displayed around him looking listening as they served them in the episcopal guest chamber those young clerks made wonderful leaps from time to time in manly knowledge with what eager shrewdness they noted discussed reproduced the manners and attire of their pilgrim guests sporting what was to their liking therein in the streets of chartres the more cynical or supercilious pilgrim would sometimes present himselfa personage oftenest of high ecclesiastical station like the eminent translator of plutarch amyot afterwards bishop of auxerre who seemed to care little for shrine or relic but lingered long over certain dim manuscripts in the canonical library where our scholarly gaston was of service helping him directly to what he desired to see and one morning early visible at a distance to all the world risen betimes to gaze the queenmother and her three sons were kneeling thereyearning greedy as ever for a hundred diverse perhaps incompatible things it was at the beginning of that winter of the great siege of chartres the morning on which the child guy debreschescourt died in his sleep his tiny bodythe placid massive baby head still one broad smile the rest of him wrapped round together like a chrysaliswas put to rest finally in a fold of the windingsheet of a very aged person deceased at the same hour for a hard winter like that famous winter of the hardest that had been known for fifty years makes an end of the weakthe aged the very young to the robust how pleasant had the preparation for it seemedthe scent of the first woodfire upon the keen october air the earth turning from grey to black under the plough the great stacks of fuel come down lazily from the woods of le perche along the winding eure its wholesome perfume the long soothing nights and early twilight the mind of gaston for one was touched by the sense of some remote and delicate beauty in these things like magicians work like an effect of magic as being extorted from unsuspected sources what winter really brought however was the danger and vexation of a great siege the householders of catholic chartres had watched the forces of their huguenot enemies gathering from this side and that and at last the dreaded circle was complete they were prisoners like the rest gaston and the grandparents shut up in their little hotel and gaston face to face with it understood at last what war really means after all it took them by surprise it was early in the day a crowd of worshippers filled the church of saintefoy built partly upon the ramparts and at the conclusion of the mass the sacrament was to be carried to a sick person touched by unusual devotion at this perilous time the whole assembly rose to escort the procession on its way passing out slowly group after group as if by mechanical instinct the more reluctant led on by the general consent gaston the last lingerer halting to let others proceed quietly before him turned himself about to gaze upon the deserted church half tempted to remain ere he too stepped forth lightly and leisurely when under a shower of massy stones from the coulevrines or great cannon of the besiegers the entire roof of the place sank into the empty space behind him but it was otherwise in a neighbouring church crushed in a similar way with all its good people not long afterwards and in the midst of the siege with all its tumult about her the old grandmother died to the undissembled sorrow of gaston bereft unexpectedly as it seemed of the gentle creature to whom he had always turned for an affection that had been as no other in its absolute incapacity of offence a tear upon the cheek like the bark of a tree testified to some unfulfilled hope something wished for but not to be which left resignation by nature or grace still imperfect and made death at fourscore years and ten seem after all like a premature summons in the midst of ones days for a few hours the peace which followed brought back to the face a protesting gleam of youth far antecedent to anything gaston could possibly have remembered there moving him to a pity a peculiar sense of pleading helplessness which to the end of his life was apt to revive at the sight it might be in an animal of what must perforce remember that it had been young but was old that broken link with life seemed to end some other things for him as one puts away the toys of childhood so now he seemed to discard what had been the central influence of his earlier youth what more than anything else had stirred imagination and brought the consciousness of his own life warm and full gazing now upon the holy and beautiful place as he had gazed on the dead face for a moment he seemed to anticipate the indifference of age and when not long after the rude hands of catholics themselves at their wits end for the maintenance of the religious war spoiled it of the accumulated treasure of centuries leaving notredame de chartres in the bareness with which we see it today he had no keen sense of personal loss iii modernity the besieging armies disappeared like the snow leaving city and suburb in all the hardened soilure of war and winter which only the torrents of spring would carry away and the spring came suddenly it was pleasant after that long confinement to walk afar securely through its early fervours gaston too went forth on his way home not alone three chosen companions went with him pledged to the old manor for months to come its lonely ancient master welcoming readily the tread of youth about him the triumvirateso their comrades had been pleased to call the three that term delightful touch of classic colour on ones own trite but withal pedantic age being then familiar as the designation of three conspicuous agents on the political scene of the generation just departing only these young latinists went back for the associations of the word to its roman original to the three gallants of

augustus so worldly and so fine you might find their mimic semblance more easily than any suggestion of that threadbare triad of french adventurers in the unfolding manhood of jasmin amade and camille they had detached themselves by an irresistible natural effectiveness from the surface of that youthful scholastic world around the episcopal throne of chartres carrying its various aptitudes as if to a perfect triple flower restless amade de lautrec who was to be a soldier dazzled early into dangerous rebellious paths by the iron ideal of the soldiers of the religion and even now fitting his blond prettiness to airs of huguenot austerity camille pontdormi who meant to be a lawyer in an age in which certain legists had asserted an audacity of genius after a manner very captivating to youth with

perhaps a poethimself certainly a poem for any competent reader vainyes a little and mad said his companions of course with his clinging exigent lovers ways it was he who had led the others on this visit to gaston de latour threads to be cut short one by one before his eyes the three would cross and recross gaily pathetically in the tapestry of gastons years and divided far asunder afterwards seemed at this moment moving there before him in the confidential talk he could not always share inseparably linked together like some complicated pictorial arabesque under the common light of their youth and of the morning and of their sympathetic understanding of the visible world so they made their way under the rows of miraculous white thorn blossom and through the green billows at peace just then though the war still blazed or smouldered along the southern banks of the loire and far beyond and it was with a delightful sense of peril of prowess attested in the facing of it that they passed from time to time halfruined or deserted farmbuildings where the remnants of the armies might yet be lingering it was jasmin poetic jasmin who in giving gaston the book he now carried ever ready to hand had done him perhaps the best of services for it had proved the key to a new world of seemingly boundless intellectual resources and yet with a special closeness to visible or sensuous thingsthe scent and colour of the fieldflowers the amorous business of the birds the flush and refledging of the black earth itself in that fervent springtide which was therefore unique in gastons memory it was his intellectual springtide as people look back to a physical spring which for once in ten or fifteen years for once in a lifetime was all that spring could be the book was none other than pierre de ronsards odes with mignonne allons voir si la rose and the skylark and the lines to aprilitself verily like nothing so much as a jonquil in its goldengreen binding and yellow edges and perfume of the place where it had lainsweet but with something of the sickliness of all spring flowers since the days of proserpine just eighteen years old and the work of the poets own youth it took possession of gaston with the ready intimacy of ones equal in age fresh at every point and he experienced what it is the function of contemporary poetry to effect anew for sensitive youth in each succeeding generation the truant and irregular poetry of his own nature all in solution there found an external and authorised mouthpiece ranging itself rightfully as the latest achievement of human soul in this matter along with the consecrated poetic voices of the past poetry hitherto it had seemed hopelessly chained to the bookshelf like something in a dead language dead and shut up in reliquaries of books or like those relics one may only see through a little pane of glass as one of its recent liberators had said sure apparently of its own niche in the temple of fame the recognised poetry of literature had had the pretension to defy or discredit as depraved and irredeemably vulgar the poetic motions in the living genius of today yet the genius of today extant and forcible the wakeful soul of present time consciously in possession would assert its poetic along with all its other rights and in regard to the curiosity the intellectual interest of gaston for instance it had of course the advantage of being close at hand with the effectiveness of a personal presence studious youth indeed on its mettle about scholarship though actually of listless humour among books that certainly stirred the past makes a docile act of faith regarding the witchery the thaumaturgic powers of virgil or may we say of shakespeare yet how faint and dim after all the sorrows of dido of juliet the travail of aeneas beside quite recent things felt or donestories which floating to us on the light current of todays conversation leave the soul in a flutter at best poetry of the past could move one with no more directness than the beautiful faces of antiquity which are not here for us to see and unaffectedly love them gastons demand his youth only conforming to pattern therein was for a poetry as veritable as intimately near as corporeal as the new faces of the hour the flowers of the actual season the poetry of mere literature like the dead body could not bleed while there was a heart a poetic heart in the living world which beat bled spoke with irresistible power elderly people virgil in hand might assert professionally that the contemporary age an age of course of little people and things deteriorate since the days of their own youth must necessarily be unfit for poetic uses but then youth too had its perpetual part to play protesting that after all said the sun in the air and in its own veins was still found to be hot still begetting upon both alike flowers and fruit nay visibly new flowers and fruit richer than ever privately in fact gaston had conceived of a poetry more thaumaturgic than could be anything of earlier standing than himself the age renews itself and in immediate derivation from it a novel poetry also grows superb and large to fill a certain mental situation made ready in advance yes the acknowledged and so to call it legitimate poetry of literature was but a thing he might sip at like some sophisticated rarity in the way of wine for example pleasing the acquired taste it was another sort of poetry unexpressed perhaps inexpressible certainly not hitherto made known in books that must drink up and absorb him like the joyful airhim and the earth with its deeds its blossoms and faces in such condition of mind how deeply delightfully must the poetry of ronsard and his fellows have moved him when he became aware as from age to age inquisitive youth by good luck does become aware of the literature of his own day confirmingmore than confirming anticipation here was a poetry which boldly assumed the dress the words the habits the very trick of contemporary life and turned them into gold it took possession of the lily in ones hand and projecting it into a visionary distance shed upon the body of the flower the soul of its beauty things were become at once more deeply sensuous and more deeply ideal as at the touch of a wizard something more came into the rose than its own natural blush occupied so closely with the visible this new poetry had so profound an intuition of what can only be felt and maintained that mood in speaking of such objects as wine fruit the plume in the cap the ring on the finger and still that was no dubious or generalised form it gave to flower or bird but the exact pressure of the jay at the window you could count the petalsof the exact natural number no expression could be too faithful to the precise texture of things words too must embroider be twisted and spun like silk or golden hair here were real people in their real delightful attire and you understood how they moved the visible was more visible than ever before just because soul had come to its surface the juice in the flowers when ronsard named them was like wine or blood it was such a coloured thing though the grey things also the cool things all the fresher for the contrastwith a freshness again that seemed to touch and cool the soulfound their account there the clangorous passage of the birds at night foretokening rain the moan of the wind at the door the winds self made visible over the yielding corn it was thus gaston understood the poetry of ronsard generously expanding it to the full measure of its intention that poetry too lost its thaumaturgic power in turn and became mere literature in exchange for life partly in the natural revolution of poetic taste partly for its faults faults and all however gaston loyally accepted it those faultsthe lapse of grace into affectation of learning into pedantry of exotic fineness into a trickcounting with him as but the proof of faith to its own dominant positions they were but characteristics needing no apology with the initiated or welcome even as savouring of the masters peculiarities of perfection he listened he looked round freely but always now with the ear the eye of his favourite poet it had been a lesson a doctrine the communication of an artthe art of placing the pleasantly aesthetic the welcome elements of life at an advantage in ones view of it till they seemed to occupy the entire surface and he was sincerely grateful for an undeniable good service and yet the gifted poet seemed but to have spoken what was already in gastons own mind what he had longed to say had been just going to say so near it came that it had the charm of a discovery of ones own that was an illusion perhaps it was because the poet told one so much about himself making so free a display of what though personal was very contagious of his lovesecrets especially how love and nothing else filled his mind he was in truth but loves secretary noting from hour to hour its minutely changing fortunes yes that was the reason why visible audible sensible things glowed so brightly why there was such luxury in sounds words rhythms of the new light come on the world of that wonderful freshness with a masterly appliance of what was near and familiar or again in the way of bold innovation he found new words for perennially new things and the novel accent awakened longslumbering associations never before had words single words meant so much what expansion what liberty of heart in speech how associable to music to singing the written lines he sang of the lark and it was the larks voluble self the physical beauty of humanity lent itself to every object animate or inanimate to the very hours and lapses and changes of time itself an almost burdensome fulness of expression haunted the gestures the very dress the personal ornaments of the people on the highway even jacques bonhomme at his labour or idling for an hour borrowed from his love homely as it was a touch of dignity or grace and some secret of utterance which made one think of italy or greece the voice of the shepherd calling the chatter of the shepherdess turning her spindle seemed to answer or wait for answerto be fragments of loves ideal and eternal communing it was the power of modernity as renewed in every successive age for genial youth protesting defiant of all sanction in these matters that the true classic must be of the present the force and patience of present time he had felt after the thing and here it wasthe one irresistible poetry there had ever been with the magic word spoken in due time transforming his own age and the world about him presenting its everyday touch the very trick one knew it by as an additional grace asserting the latent poetic rights of the transitory the fugitive the contingent poetry need no longer mask itself in the habit of a bygone day gaston could but pity the people of bygone days for not being aboveground to read here was a discovery a new faculty a privileged apprehension to be conveyed in turn to one and to another to be propagated for the imaginative regeneration of the world it was a manner a habit of thought which would invade ordinary life and mould that to its intention in truth all the world was already aware and delighted the school was soon to pay the penalty of that immediate acceptance that intimate fitness to the mind of its own time by sudden and profound neglect as a thing preternaturally tarnished and tame like magic youth or magic beauty turned in a moment by magics own last word into withered age but then to the liveliest spirits of that time it had seemed nothing less than impeccable after the manner of the great sacred products of the past though in a living tongue nay to gaston for one the power of the old classic poetry itself was explained by the reflex action of the new and might seem to justify its pretensions at last from the poem fancy wandered to the poet and curious youth would fain see the writer in personwhat a poet was like with anxious surmises this way and that as to the degree in which the precious mental particles might be expected to have wrought up the outward presence to their own high quality a creature of the eye in this case at least the intellectual hold on him being what it was gaston had no fear of disillusion his poetic readings had borrowed an additional relish from the genial companionable manner of his life at this time taking him into the remotest corners of the vast level land and its outer ring of blue uplands amid which as he rode one day with the three towards perfectly new prospects he had chanced on some tangible rumour of the great poets present abode the hill they had mounted at leisure in talk with a village priest dropped suddenly upon a vague tract of wood and pasture with a dark ridge beyond towards the southwest and the black notch which broke its outline against the mellow space of evening light was the steeple of the priory of croixval of which reverend body pierre de ronsard although a layman was by special favour of king charles superior though a formal peace was come though the primary movers of war had taken hands or kissed each other and were exchanging suspicious courtesies yet the unquiet temper of war was still abroad everywhere with an aftercrop of miserable incidents the captainless national and mercenary soldiers were become in large number thieves or beggars and the peasants hand sank back to the tame labour of the plough reluctantly relieved a little by the sentimental humour of the hour lending as ronsard prompted a poetic and always amorous interest to everything around him poor gastons very human soul was vexed nevertheless at the spectacle of the increased hardness of human life with certain misgivings from time to time at the contrast of his own luxurious tranquillity the homeless woman suckling her babe at the roadside the greybeard hasting before the storm the tattered fortuneteller who when he shook his head at her proposal to read his hand assured him perhaps with some insight into his character you do thatyou shake your head negativelytoo much these and the like might count as fitting human accidents in an impassioned landscape picture and his new imaginative culture had taught him to value surprises in nature itself the quaint exciting charm of the mistletoe in the wood of the blossom before the leaf the cry of passing birds at night nay the most familiar details of nature its daily routine of light and darkness beset him now with a kind of troubled and troubling eloquence the rain the first streak of dawn the very sullenness of the sky had a power only to be described by saying that they seemed to be moral facts on his way at last to gaze on the abode of the new hero or demigod of poetry gaston perceives increasingly as another excellence of his verse how truthful how close it is to the minute fact of the scene around as there are pleasant wines which expressing the peculiar quality of their native soil lose their special pleasantness away from home the physiognomy of the scene was changed the plain of la beauce had ruffled itself into low green hills and gently winding valleys with clear quick water and fanciful patches of heath and woodland here and there a secular oak tree maintained a solitude around it it was the district of the little river loirthe vendomois and here in its own country the new poetry notwithstanding its classic elegance might seem a

owl on the wing cried softly beyond the tops of the spreading poplars was the west front silvergrey and quiet inexpressibly quiet with its worn late gothic flamings from top to bottom as full of reverie to gastons thinking as the enchanted castle in a storybook the village lay thinly scattered around the wide grassgrown space below was the high espaliered gardenwall and within it visible through the open doors a gaunt figure hooknosed like a wizard at work with the spade too busily to turn and look or was it that he did not hear at all the question repeated thricecould one see his reverence the prior at least in his convent church you see him was the answer as a face all nerve distressed nerve turned upon them not unkindly the vanity of the great man aware and pleasantly tickled the unexpected incident had quickened a prematurely aged pulse and in reward for their good service the young travellers were bidden carry their equipment not to the village inn but to the guest chamber of the halfempty priory the eminent man of letters who had been always an enthusiastic gardener though busy just now not with choice flowers but with salutary kitchenstuff working indeed with much effort to counteract the gout was ready enough in his solitude to make the most of chance visitors especially youthful ones a bell clanged he laid aside the spade and casting an eye at the whirling weathervanes announced that it would snow there had been no sunset they had travelled away imperceptibly from genial afternoon into a world of ashen evening the enemies of the lay prior satirists literary and religious falsely made a priest of him a priest who should have sacrificed a goat to pagan bacchus and in truth the poet for a time a soldier and all his life a zealous courtier had always been capable as a poet should be of longsustained meditation adapting himself easily enough to the habits of the religious following attentively the choirservices in their church of which he was a generous benefactor and to which he presently proceeded for vespers gaston and the three sat among the brethren tempting curious eyes in the stalls of the halflighted choir while in purple cope and jaunty biretta the lay prior assisted his confidentiaire or priestly substitute officiating at the altar the long sad lenten office over an invitation to supper followed for ronsard still loved in his fitful retirements at one or another of his numerous benefices to give way to the chance recreation of flattering company and these gay lads enthusiasm for his person was obvious and as for himself the great poet with his bodily graces and airs of court had always possessed the gift of pleasing those who encountered him the snow was falling now in big slow flakes a great fire blazing

reassuring you remembered that from his ninth year he had been the pet of princesses the favourite of kings upon the cabinets chests bookcases around were ranged the souvenirs received from various royal persons including three kings of france the fair queen of scots elizabeth of england and the conversation fell to and was kept going by the precious contents of the place where they were sitting

handled or might handle the pictured faces on the walls in their frames of reeded ebony or jewelled filigree there was the minerva decreed him at a conference of the elegant pedantic jeux floraux which had proclaimed pierre de ronsard prince of poets the massive silver image ronsard had promptly offered to his patron king charles but in vain for though so greatly in want of readymoney that he melted down church ornaments and exacted black contributions from the clergy one of the things in which charles had ever been sincere was a reverence for literature so there it stood doing duty for

gracefully pedantic with their quaintly kerchiefed booksbooks of whatin their pale hands among the ladies on the pictured wall as in life were the poets male companions stirring memories of a more material sort though their common interest had been poetrymemories of that bohemia which even a prince of court poets had frequented when he was young of his cruder youthful vanities in some cases the

king charles himself here perhaps was the single entirely disinterested sentiment of the poets life wholly independent of a long list of benefits or benefices for the younger had turned winsomely appealingly to the elder who forty years of age feeling chilly at the thought had no son and of one only of those companions did the memory bring a passing cloud it was long ago on a journey that he had first spoken accidentally with joachim du bellay whose friendship had been the great intellectual fortune of his life for a moment one saw the encounter at the wayside inn in the broad gay morning a quarter of a century since and there was the facedeceased at thirtyfive pensive plaintive refined by sickness of exceeding delicacy it must from the first have been best suited to the greyness of an hour like this tomorrow where will be the snow the leader in that great poetic battle of the pleiad their host himself he explained the famous device and named the seven chief stars in the constellation was depicted appropriately in veritable armour with antique roman cuirass of minutely inlaid gold and flowered mantle the crisp ceremonial laurelwreath of the roman conqueror lying on the audacious overdeveloped brows above the great hooked nose of practical enterprise in spite of his pretension to the epicurean conquest of a kingly indifference of mind the portrait of twenty years

characteristic triumphant nevertheless in his battle for greek beautyfor the naturalisation of greek beauty in the brown cloudlands of the north he might have been thinking contemptuously of barking little saintgelais or of monsieur marots packthread poems he for his part had always held that poetry should be woven of delicate silk or of fine linen or at least of good homespun worsted to gaston yielding himself to its influence for a moment the scene around seemed unreal an exotic embalming air escaped from some old greek or roman pleasureplace had turned the poets workroom into a strange kind of private sanctuary amid these rude conventual buildings with the march wind aloud in the chimneys notwithstanding what with the long days ride the keen evening they had done justice to the monastic fare the little wine of the country the cream the onionsfine camille and dainty jasmin and the poet turned to talk upon gardening concerning which he could tell them a thing or twoof early salads and those special apples the king loved to receive from him millefleurs pippins painted with a thousand tiny streaks of red yellow and green a dish of them came to table now with a bottle at the right moment from the darkest corner of the cellar and then in nasal voice welltrained to latin intonation giving a quite medieval amplitude to the poets sonorities of rhythm and vocabulary the subprior was bidden to sing after the notation of goudimel the elegy of the rose the author girding cheerily at the clerkly mans assumed ignorance of such compositions it was but a halfgaiety in truth that awoke in the poet even now with the singing and the good wine as the notes echoed windily along the passages on his fortysixth year the unaffected melancholy of his later life was already gathering the deadhe was coming to be on their side the fact came home to gaston that this evocator of the eternally youthful was visibly old before his time his work being done or centered now for the most part on amendments not invariably happy of his earlier verse the little panelled drawers were full of them the poet pulled out one and as it stood open for a moment there lay the first book of the franciade in silken cover white and gold ready for the kings hands but never to be finished gaston as he turned from that stolen reading of the opening verse in jerky feverish gouty manuscript to the writer let out his soul perhaps for the poets face struck fire too and seeming to detect on a sudden the legible document of something by no means conventional below the young mans wellcontrolled manner and expression he became as if paternally anxious for his intellectual furtherance and in particular for the addition of manly power to a grace of mind obviously there already in due sufficiency would he presently carry a letter with recommendation of himself to monsieur michel de montaigne linked they were in the common friendship of the late etienne de la boetie yonder monsieur michel could tell him much of the great onesof the greek and latin masters of style let his study be in them with what justice by the way had those latin poets dealt with winter and wintry charms in their bland italy and just then at the striking of a rickety great bell of the middle age in the hands of a cowled brother came the emblazoned gracecup with which the prior de ronsard had enriched his house and the guests withdrew yesterdays snow was nowhere a surprising sunlight everywhere through which after gratefully bidding adieu to the great poet almost on their knees for a blessing our adventurers returned home gaston intently pondering as he lingered behind the others was aware that this new poetry which seemed to have transformed his whole nature into halfsensuous imagination was the product not of one or more individual writers but it might be in the way of a response to their challenge a general direction of mens minds a delightful fashion of the time he almost anticipated our modern idea or platitude of the zeitgeist a social instinct was involved in the matter and loyalty to an intellectual movement as its leader had himself been the first to suggest the actual authorship belonged not so much to a star as to a constellation like that hazy pleiad he had pointed out in the sky or like the swarm of larks abroad this morning over the corn led by a common instinct a large element in which was sympathetic trust in the instinct of others here truly was a doctrine to propagate a secret open to every one who would learn towards a new management of lifenay a new religion or at least a new worship maintaining and visibly setting forth a single overpowering apprehension the worship of physical beauty a religion the proper faculty of which would be the bodily eye looked at in this way some of the well marked characteristics of the poetry of the pleiad assumed a hieratic almost an ecclesiastical air that rigid correctness that gracious unction as of the medieval latin psalmody that aspiring fervour that jealousy of the profane vulgar the sense flattering to one who was in the secret that this thing even in its utmost triumph could never be really popularwhy were these so welcome to him but from the continuity of early mental habit he might renew the overgrown tonsure and wait devoutly rapturously in this goodly sanctuary of earth and sky about him for the manifestation at the moment of his own worthiness of flawless humanity in some undreamedof depth and perfection of the loveliness of bodily form and therewith came the consciousness no longer of mere bad neighbourship between what was old and new in his life but of incompatibility between two rival claimants upon him of two ideals might that new religion be a religion not altogether of goodness a profane religion in spite of its poetic fervours there were flowers of evil among the rest it came in part avowedly as a kind of consecration of evil and seemed to give it the beauty of holiness rather good and evil were distinctions inapplicable in proportion as these new interests made themselves felt for a moment amid casuistical questions as to ones indefeasible right to liberty of heart he saw himself somewhat wearily very far gone from the choice the consecration of his boyhood if he could but be rid of that altogether or if that would but speak with irresistible decision and effect was there perhaps somewhere in some penetrative mind in this age of novelties some scheme of truth some science about men and things which might harmonise for him his earlier and later preference the sacred and the profane loves or failing that establish to his pacification the exclusive supremacy of the latter iv peachblossom and wine those searchings of mind brought from time to time cruel starts from sleep a sudden shudder at any wide outlook over life and its issues draughts of mental eastwind across the hot mornings into which the voices of his companions called him to lose again in long rambles every thought save that of his own firm abounding youth these rambles were but the last sweet wastefullyspent remnants of a happy season the letter for monsieur michel de montaigne was to hand with preparations for the distant journey which must presently break up their comradeship nevertheless its actual termination overtook them at the last as if by surprise on a sudden that careless interval of time was over the carelessness of the three at all events had been entire secure on the low warm level surface of things they talked they rode they ate and drank with no misgivings mental or moral no too curious questions as to the essential nature of their so palpable wellbeing or the rival standards thereof of origins and issues and yet with all their gaiety as its last triumphant note in truth they were ready to trifle with death welcoming by way of a foil to the easy character of their days a certain luxurious sense of dangerthe nightalarm the arquebuse peeping from some quiet farmbuilding across their way the rumoured presence in their neighbourhood of this or that great military leaderdelightful premonitions of the adventurous life soon to be their own in paris what surmises they had of any vaguer sort of danger took effect in that age of wizardry as a quaintly practical superstition the expectation of cadaverous churchyard things and the like intruding themselves where they should not be to be dissipated in turn by counterdevices of the dark craft which had evoked them gaston then as in after years though he saw no ghosts could not bear to trifle with such matters to his companions it was a delight as they supped to note the indication of nameless terrors if it were only in the starts and crackings of the timbers of the old place to the turbid spirits of that generation the midnight heaven itself was by no means a restful companion and many were the hours wasted by those young astrophiles in puzzling out the threats or the enigmatic promises of a starry sky the fact that armed persons were still abroad thieves or assassins lurking under many disguises might explain what happened on the last evening of their time together when they sat late at the open windows as the night increased serene but covered summer night aromatic velvetfooted what coolness it had was pleasant after the wine and they strolled out fantastically muffled in certain old heraldic dresses of parade caught up in the hall as they passed through gaston alone remaining to attend on his grandfather in about an hours time they returned not a little disconcerted to tell a story of which gaston was reminded seeing them again in thought as if only half real amid the bloomy night with blood upon their boyish flowers as they crossed his path afterwards at three intervals listening for the nighthawk pushing aside the hedgerow to catch the evening breath of the honeysuckle they had sauntered on scarcely looking in advance along the causeway soft sounds came out of the distance but footsteps on the hard road they had not heard when three others fronted them face to facejasmin amade and camilletheir very selves visible in the light of the lantern carried by camille they might have felt the breath upon their cheeks real close definite cap for cap plume for plume flower for flower a light like their own flashed up counterwise but with blood all three of them fresh upon the bosom or in the mouth it was well to draw the sword be ones enemy carnal or spiritual even devils as wise men know taking flight at its white glitter through the air out flashed the brave youths swords still with mimic countermotion upon nothingupon the empty darkness before them curdled at heart for an hour by that strange encounter they went on their way next morning no different there was something in the mere belief that peace was come at last for a moment huguenots were or pretended to be satisfied with a large concession of liberty to be almost light of soul the french who can always pause in the very midst of civil bloodshed to eulogise the reign of universal kindness were determined to treat a mere armistice as nothing less than realised utopia to bear offensive weapons became a crime and the sense of security at home was attested by vague schemes of glory to be won abroad under the leadership of the admiral the great huguenot coligni anxious to atone for his share in the unhappiness of france by helping her to foreign conquests philip of spain had been watching for the moment when charles and catherine should call the duke of alva into france to continue his devout work there instead the poetic mind of charles was dazzled for a moment by the dream of wrestling the misused netherlands from spanish rule altogether under such genial conditions then gaston set out towards those southwest regions he had always yearned to as popular imagination just now set thither also in a vision of french ships going forth from the mouths of the loire and the gironde from nantes bordeaux and la rochelle to the indies in rivalry of spanish adventure the spasmodic gaiety of the time blent with that of the season of the year of his own privileged time of life and allowed the opulent country through which he was to pass all its advantages ever afterwards that low ring of blue hills beyond la beauce meant more for him not less than of old after the reign of his native appleblossom and corn it was that of peachblossom and wine southwards to orleans and the loire then with the course of the sunny river to blois to amboise to tours he traversed a region of unquestioned natural charm heightened greatly by the mental atmosphere through which it reached him black angers white saumur with its double in the calm broad water below the melancholy seigneurial woods of blois ranged themselves in his memory as so many distinct types of what was dignified or pleasant in human habitations frequently along the great historic stream as along some vast street contemporary genius was visible a little prematurely as time would show in a novel and seductive architecture which by its engrafting of exotic grace on homely native forms spoke of a certain restless aspiration to be what one was not but might becomethe old gaulish desire to be refined to be mentally enfranchised by the sprightlier genius of italy with their terraced gardens their airy galleries their triumphal chimneypieces their spacious stairways their conscious provision for the elegant enjoyment of all seasons in turn here surely were the new abodes for the new humanity of this new poetic picturesque age what but flawless bodies duly appointed to typically developed souls could move on the daily business of life through these dreamy apartments into which he entered from time to time finding their very garniture like a personal presence in them was there light here in the earth itself it was a landscape certainly which did not merely accept the sun but flashed it back gratefully from the white gracious carven houses that were like a natural part of it as he passed below fancy would sometimes credit the outlook from their lofty gables with felicities of combination beyond possibility what prospects of mountain and seashore from those aerial window seats and still as in some sumptuous tapestry the architecture the landscape were but a setting for the human figures these palatial abodes never out of sight high on the river bank challenged continual speculation as to their inhabitantshow they moved read poetry and romance or wrote the memoirs which were like romance passed through all the hourly changes of their all accomplished intimate life the loire was the river preeminently of the monarchy of the court and the fleeting human interests fact or fancy which gave its utmost value to the liveliness of the natural scene found a centre in the movements of catherine and her sons still roving after the eccentric habit inherited from francis the first from one house of pleasure to another in the pursuit at once of amusement and of that political intrigue which was the serious business of their lives like some fantastic company of strolling players amid the hushed excitement of a little town the royal family with all its own small rivalries would be housed for the night under the same roof with some of its greater enemieshenri de guise cond the admiral all alike taken by surprisebut courteously and therefore ineffectively and gaston come thus by chance so close to them had the sense not so much of nearness to the springs of great events as of the likeness of the whole matter to a stageplay with its ingeniously contrived encounters or the assortments of a game of chance and in a while the dominant course of the river itself the animation of its steady downward flow even amid the sandshoals and whispering islets of the dry season bore his thoughts beyond it in a sudden irresistible appetite for the sea and he determined varying slightly from the prescribed route to reach his destination by way of the coast from nantes he descended imperceptibly along tall hedgerows of acacia till on a sudden with a novel freshness in the air through a low archway of laden fruittrees it was visiblesand sea and sky in three quiet spaces line upon line the features of the landscape changed again and the gardens the rich orchards gave way to bare grassy undulations only the open sandy spaces presented their own native flora for the fine silex seemed to have crept into the tall wiry stalks of the ixias like grasses the seeds of which had expanded by solar magic into veritable flowers crimson green or yellow patched with black it was pleasant to sleep as if in the seas arms amid the low murmurs the salt odour mingled with the wild garden scents of a little inn or farm forlorn in the wide enclosure of an ancient manor deserted as the sea encroachedlong ago for the figtrees in the riven walls were tough and old next morning he must turn his back betimes with the freshness of the outlook still undimmed all colours turning to white on the shellbeach the wrecks the children at play on it the boat with its gay streamers dancing in the foam bright as the scene of his journey had been it had had from time to time its grisly touches a forbidden fortress with its steelclad inmates thrust itself upon the way the village church had been ruined too recently to count as picturesque and at last at the meetingpoint of five long

of peace and national unity undoubtedly they were still there even in this halcyon weather those causes of disquiet like the volcanic forces beneath the massive chestnutwoods spread so calmly through the breathless air on the ledges and levels of the red heights of the limousin under which gaston now passed on his way southwards on his right hand a broad lightly diversified expanse of vineyard of towns and towers innumerable rolled its burden of fat things down the slope of the gironde towards the more perfect level beyond in the heady afternoon an indescribable softness laid hold on him from the objects the atmosphere the lazy business of the scene around and was that the quarter whence the dry daylight the intellectual iron the chalybeate influence was to comethose coquettish wellkept vinewreathed towers smiling over a little irregular old village itself halfhidden in gadding vine pointed out by the gardeners all labourers here were gardeners as the end of his long pleasant journey as the abode of monsieur michel de montaigne the singular but not unpopular gentleman living there among his books of whom gaston hears so much overnight at the inn where he rests before delivering the great poets letter entering his room at last in a flutter of curiosity in those earlier days of the renaissance a whole generation had been exactly in the position in which gaston now found himself an older ideal moral and religious certain theories of man and nature actually in possession still haunted humanity at the very moment when it was called through a full knowledge of the past to enjoy the present with an unrestricted expansion of its own capacitiesmight one enjoy might one eat of all the treessome had already eaten and needed retrospectively a theoretic justification a sanction of their actual liberties in some new reading of human nature itself and its relation to the world around itexplain to us the propriety on the full view of things of this bold course we have taken or know we shall take ex post facto at all events that justification was furnished by the essays of montaigne the spirit of the essays doubtless had been felt already in many a mind as by a universal law of reaction the intellect does supply the due theoretic equivalent to an inevitable course of conduct but it was montaigne certainly who turned that emancipating ethic into current coin to pascal looking back upon the sixteenth century as a whole montaigne was to figure as the impersonation of its intellectual licence while shakespeare who represents the free spirit of the renaissance moulding the drama hints by his wellknown preoccupation with montaignes writings that just there was the philosophic counterpart to the fulness and impartiality of his own artistic reception of the experience of life those essays as happens with epochmarking books were themselves a life the power which makes them what they are having been accumulated in them imperceptibly by a thousand repeated modifications like character in a person at the moment when gaston presented himself to go along with the great egotist for a season that life had just begun born here at the place whose name he took montaignethe acclivityof saint michael just thirtysix years before brought up simply earthily at nurse in one of the neighbouring villages to him it was doubled strength to return thither when disgusted with the legal business which had filled his days hitherto seeing that france had more laws than all the rest of the world and was what one saw he began the true work of his life a continual journey in thought a continual observation of new and unknown things his bodily self remaining for the most part with seeming indolence at home it was montaignes boast that throughout those invasive times his house had lain open to all comers that his frankness had been rewarded by immunity from all outrages of war of the crime war shelters and opennessthat all was wide open searched through by light and warmth and air from the soilwas the impression it made on gaston as he passed from farmyard to garden from garden to court to hall up the wide winding stair to the uppermost chamber of the great round tower in which sunbaked place the studious man still lingered over a late breakfast telling like all around of a certain homely epicureanism a rare mixture of luxury with a preference for the luxuries that after all were homegrown and savoured of his native earth sociable of sociable intellect and still inclining instinctively as became his fresh and agreeable person from the midway of life towards its youthful side he was ever on the alert for a likely interlocutor to take part in the conversation which pleasantest truly of all modes of human commerce was also of ulterior service as stimulating that endless inward converse from which the essays were a kind of abstract for him as for plato for socrates whom he cites so often the essential dialogue was that of the mind with itself but this dialogue throve best with often actually needed outward stimulusphysical motion some text shot from a book the queries and objections of a living voicemy thoughts sleep if i sit still neither thoughts nor dialogues exclusively but thoughts still partly implicate in the dialogues which had evoked them and therefore not without many seemingly arbitrary transitions many links of connexion to be supposed by the reader constituting their characteristic difficulty the essays owed their actual publication at last to none of the usual literary motivesdesire for fame to instruct to amuse to sellbut to the sociable desire for a still wider range of conversation with others he wrote for companionship if but one sincere man would make his acquaintance speaking on paper as he did to the first person he metif there be any person any knot of good company in france or elsewhere who can like my humour and whose humours i can like let them but whistle and i will run notes of expressive facts of words also worthy of note for he was a lover of style collected in the first instance for the help of an irregular memory were becoming in the quaintly labelled drawers with labels of wise old maxim or device the primary rude stuff or protoplasm of his intended work and already gave token of its scope and variety all motion discovers us if to others so also to ourselves movement rapid movement of some kind a ride the hasty survey of a shelf of books best of all a conversation like this mornings with a visitor for the first timeamid the felicitous chances of that at some random turn by the way he would become aware of shaping purpose the beam of light or heat would strike down to illuminate to fuse and organise the coldly accumulated matter of reason of experience surely some providence over thought and speech led one finely through those haphazard journeys but thus dependent to so great a degree on external converse for the best fruit of his own thought he was also an efficient evocator of the thought of anotherhimself an original spirit more than tolerating the originality of otherswhich brought it into play here was one who through natural predilection reinforced by theory would welcome ones very self undistressed by while fully observant of its difference from his ownones errors vanities perhaps fatuities naturally eloquent expressive with a mind like a rich collection of the choice things of all times and countries he was at his best his happiest amid the magnetic contacts of an easy conversation when gaston years afterwards came to read the famous essays he found many a delightful actual conversation reset and had the key we lack to their surprises their capricious turns and lapseswell montaigne had opened the letter had forthwith passed his genial criticism on the writer and then characteristically forgetting all about it turned to the bearer as if he had been intimate with him from childhood and the feeling was mutual gaston in half an hour seemed to have known his entertainer all his life in unimpeded talk with sincere persons of what quality soeverthere rather than in shadowy converse with even the best booksthe flower the fruit of mind was still in lifegiving contact with its root with books as indeed with persons his intercourse was apt to be desultory bookshe was by way of asserting his independence of them was their very candid friendthey were far from being an unmixed good he would observe the fact was its own scornful comment that there were more books upon books than upon any other subject yet books more than a thousand volumes a handsome library for that day nicely representative not only of literature but of the owners taste therein lay all around and turning now to this now to that he handled their pages with nothing less than tenderness it was the first of many inconsistencies which yet had about them a singularly taking air of reason of equity plutarch and seneca were soon in the foreground they would still be at his elbow to test and be tested masters of the autumnal wisdom that was coming to be his own ripe and placidfrom the autumn of old rome of life of the world the very genius of second thoughts of exquisite tact and discretion of judgment upon knowledge but the books dropped from his hands in the very midst of enthusiastic quotation and the guest was mounting a little turret staircase was on the leaden roof of the old tower amid the fat noonday gascon scenery he saw in birdseye view the country he was soon to become closely acquainted with a country like its people of passion and capacity though at that moment emphatically lazy towards the end of life some conscientious pangs seem to have touched montaignes singularly humane and sensitive spirit when he looked back on the long intellectual entertainment he had had in following as an inactive spectator the ruin of his country through a series of chapters every one of which had told emphatically in his own immediate neighbourhood with its old and new battlefields its business its fierce changes and the old perennial sameness of mens ways beneath them all it had been certainly matter of more assiduous reading than even those choice incommensurable books of ancient greek and roman experience the variableness the complexity the miraculous surprises of man concurrent with the variety the complexity the surprises of nature making all true knowledge of either wholly relative and provisional a like insecurity in ones self if one turned thither for some ray of clear and certain evidence this with an equally strong sense all the time of the interest the power and charm alike of man and nature and of the individual mindsuch was the sense of this open book of all books and things that was what this quietly enthusiastic reader was ready to assert as the sum of his studies disturbingly as gaston found reflecting on his long unsuspicious sojourn there and detaching from the habits the random traits of character his concessions and hints and sudden emphatic statements the soul and potency of the man how imperceptibly had darkness crept over them effacing everything but the interior of the great circular chamber its bookshelves and enigmatic mottoes and the tapestry on the wallcirce and her sorceries in many partsto draw over the windows in winter supper over the young wife entered at last always on the lookout for the sincerities of human nature sincerity counting for lifegiving form whatever the matter might be as he delighted in watching children montaigne loved also to watch grown people when they were most like children at their games therefore and in the mechanical and customary parts of their existence as discovering the real soul in them abstaining from the dice himself since for him such play was not play enough but too grave and serious a diversion and remarking that the play of children is not performed in play but to be judged as their most serious action he set gaston and the amiable unpedantic lady to play together where he might observe them closely the game turning still irresistibly to conversation the last and sweetest if somewhat drowsy relics of this long days recreationswas circes castle here if circe could turn men into swine could she also release them again it was frailty certainly that gaston remained here week after week scarce knowing why the conversation begun that morning lasting for nine months over books meals in free rambles chiefly on horseback as if in the waking intervals of a long daysleep v suspended judgment the diversity the undulancy of human natureso deep a sense of it went with montaigne always that himself too seemed to be ever changing colour sympathetically therewith those innumerable differences mental and physical of which men had always been aware on which they had so largely fed their vanity were ultimate that the surface of humanity presented an infinite variety was the tritest of facts pursue that variety below the surfacethe lines did but part further and further asunder with an everincreasing divergency which made any common measure of

themselves have peradventure their weight measure and conditions but when once we have taken them into us the soul forms them as she pleasesdeath is terrible to cicero courted by cato indifferent to socratesfortune circumstance offers but the matter tis the soul adds the formevery opinion how fantastic soever to some is to another of force enough to be espoused at the risk of life for opinion was the projection of individual will of a native original predilection opinionsthey are like the clothes we wear which warm us not with their heat but with ours track your way as he had learned to do to the remote origin of what looks like folly at home on its native soil it was found to be justifiable as a proper growth of wisdom in the vast conflict of taste preference conviction there was no real inconsistency it was but that the soul looked upon things with another eye and represented them to itself with another kind of face reason being a tincture almost equally infused into all our manners and opinions though there never were in the world two opinions exactly alike and the practical comment was not as one might have expected towards the determination of some common standard of truth amid that infinite variety but to this effect rather that we are not bound to receive every opinion we are not able to refute nor to accept anothers refutation of our own these diversities being themselves ultimate and the priceless pearl of truth lying if anywhere not in large theoretic apprehension of the general but in minute vision of the particular in the perception of the concrete phenomenon at this particular moment and from this unique point of viewthat for you this for menow but perhaps not then now and not then for if men are so diverse not less disparate are the many men who keep discordant company within each one of us every man carrying in him the entire form of human condition that we taste nothing pure the variancy of the individual in regard to himself the complexity of soul which there too makes all judgments in the gross impossible or useless certainly inequitable he delighted to note mens minds were like the grotesques which some artists of that day loved to joint together or like one of his own inconstant essays never true for a page to its proposed subject nothing is so supple as our understanding it is double and diverse and the matters are double and diverse too here as it seemed to gaston was one for whom exceptions had taken the place of law the very genius of qualification followed him through all his keen constant changeful consideration of men and things how many curious moral variations he had to showvices that are lawful vices in us which help to make up the seam in our piecing as poisons are useful for the conservation of health actions good and excusable that are not lawful in themselves the soul discharging her passions upon false objects where the true are wanting men doing more than they propose or they hardly know what at immense hazard or pushed to do well by vice itself or working for their enemies condemnations more criminal than the crimes they condemn the excuses that are selfaccusations instances from his own experience of a hasty confidence in other mens virtue which god had favoured and how even to the worst people it is sweet their end once gained by a vicious act to foist into it some show of justice in the presence of this indefatigable analyst of act and motive all fixed outlines seemed to vanish away the healthful pleasure of motion of thoughts in motionyes gaston felt them the oldest of them moving as he listened under and away from his feet as if with the ground he stood on and this was the vein of thought which oftenest led the master back contemptuously to emphasise the littleness of mani think we can never be despised according to our full desert by way of counterpoise there were admirable surprises in man that crossplay of human tendencies determined from time to time in the forces of unique and irresistible character moving all together pushing the world around it to phenomenal good or evil for such as make it their business to oversee human actions it seems impossible they should proceed from one and the same person consolidation of qualities supposed this did but make character already the most attractive because the most dynamic phenomenon of experience more interesting still so tranquil a spectator of so average a world a too critical minimiser it might seem of all that pretends to be of importance montaigne was constantly gratefully announcing his contact in life in books with undeniable power and greatness with forces full of beauty in their vigour like lightning the sea the torrentsoverpowering desire augmented yet victorious by its very difficulty the bewildering constancy of martyrs singlehearted virtue not to be resolved into anything less surprising than itself the devotion of that famed so companionable wife dying cheerfully by her own act along with the sick husband who could do no better than kill himself the grief the joy of which men suddenly die the unconscious stoicism of the poor that stern selfcontrol with which jacques bonhomme goes as usual to his daily labour with a heart tragic for the dead child at home nay even the boldness and strength of those citizens who sacrifice honour and conscience as others of old sacrificed their lives for the good of their country so carefully equable his mind nevertheless was stored with and delighted in incidents personalities of barbarous strengthesau in all his phasesthe very rudest children or our great and powerful mother nature as plato had said twas to no purpose for a soberminded man to knock at the door of poesy or if truth were spoken of any other high matter of doing or making that was consistent with his sympathetic belief in the capability of mere impetuous youth as such even those unexpected traits in ordinary people which seem to hint at larger laws and deeper forces of character disconcerting any narrow judgment upon them he welcomed as akin to his own indolent but suddenly kindling naturethe mere selfwill of men the shrewd wisdom of an unlettered old woman the fount of goodness in a cold or malicious heart i hear every day fools say things far from foolish those invincible prepossessions of humanity or of the individual which bacon reckoned idols of the cave are no offence to him are direct informations it may be beyond price from a kindly spirit of truth in things for him there had been two grand surprises two preeminent manifestations of the power and charm of man not to be explained awayone within the compass of general and public observation the other a matter of special intimacy to himself there had been the greatness of the old greek and roman life so greatly recorded there had been the wisdom and kindness of etienne de la boetie as made known in all their fulness to him alone that his ardent devotion to the ancients had been rewarded with minute knowledge concerning them was the privilege of the age in which he was born late in the revival of letters but the classical reading which with others was often but an affectation seducing them from the highest to a lower degree of reality from men and women to their mere shadows in old books had been for him nothing less than personal contact the qualities and fortunes of the old romans especially their wonderful straight ways through the world the straight passage of their armies upon them the splendour of their armour of their entire external presence and show their riches and embellishments above all the suddenness of augustus in that grander age for which decision was justifiable because really possible had ever been more in his head than the fortunes of his own country if we have no hold even on things present but by imagination as he loved to observethen how much more potent steadier larger the imaginative substance of the world of alexander and socrates of virgil and caesar than that of an age which seemed to him living in the midst of it respectable mainly by its docility by an imitation of the ancients which after all left untouched the real sources of their greatness they had been indeed great at the least dramatically redeemed in part by magnificent courage and tact in their very sins our force is no more able to reach them in their vicious than in their virtuous qualities for both the one and the other proceed from a vigour of soul which was without comparison greater in them than in us and yet thinking of his friendship with the incomparable etienne de la boetie so perfect inviolate and entire that the like is hardly to be found in story he had to confess that the sources of greatness must still be quick in the world that had remained with him as his one fixed standard of value in the estimate of men and things on this single point antiquity itself had been surpassed the discourses it had left upon friendship seeming to him poor and flat in comparison of the sense he had of it for once his sleepless habit of analysis had been checked by the inexplicable the absolute amid his jealously guarded indifference of soul he had been summoned to yield and had yielded to the magnetic power of another we were halves throughout so that methinks by outliving him i defraud him of his part i was so grown to be always his double in all things that methinks i am no more than half of myself there is no action or thought of mine wherein i do not miss him as i know that he would have missed me tender yet heroic impulsive yet so wise he might have done what the survivor so it seemed to himself was but vainly trying to do it was worth his while to become famous if that hapless memory might but be embalmed in ones fame it had been better than lovethat friendship to the building of which so much concurrence had been requisite that twas much if fortune brought the like to pass once in three ages actually we may think the sweet society of those four years in comparison with which the rest of his so pleasant life was but smoke had touched montaignes nature with refinements it might otherwise have lacked he would have wished to speak concerning it to those who had experience of what he said could such have been found in despair of that he loved to discourse of it to all comershow it had come about the circumstances of its sudden and wonderful growth yet after all were he pressed to say why he had so loved etienne de la boetie he could but answer because it was he because it was i and the surprises there are in man his complexity his variancy were symptomatic of the changefulness the confusion the surprises of the earth under ones feet of the whole material world the irregular the unforeseen the inconsecutive miracle accident he noted lovingly it had a philosophic import it was habit rather than knowledge of them that took away the strangeness of the things actually about one how many unlikely matters there were testified by persons worthy of faith which if we cannot persuade ourselves to believe we ought at least to leave in suspensethough all that had arrived by report of past time should be true it would be less than nothing in comparison of what is unknown on all sides we are beset by the incalculablewalled up suddenly as if by malign trickery in the open field or pushed forward senselessly by the crowd around us to goodfortune in art as in poetry there are the transports which lift the artist out of as they are not of himself for orators also those extraordinary motions which sometimes carry them above their design himself in the necessity and heat of combat had sometimes made answers that went through and through beyond hope the work by its own force and fortune sometimes outstrips the workman and then in defiance of the proprieties whereas poets sometimes flag and languish in a prosaic manner prose will shine with the lustre vigour and boldness with the fury of poetry and as to affairshow spasmodic the mixture collision or coincidence of the mechanic succession of things with mens volition mere rumour so large a factor in eventswho could trace out its ways various events he was never tired of illustrating the fact followed from the same counsel fortune chance that is to say the incalculable contribution of mere matter to man would still be mistress of events and one might think it no unwisdom to commit everything to fortuity but no fortune too is ofttimes observed to act by the rule of reason chance itself comes round to hold of justice war above all being a matter in which fortune was inexplicable though men might seem to have made it the main business of their lives if the force of all counsel lies in the occasion that is because things perpetually shift if manhis taste his very consciencechange with the habit of time and place that is because habit is the emphatic determination the tyranny of changing external and material circumstance so it comes about that every one gives the name of barbarism to what is not in use round about him excepting perhaps the greeks and romans somewhat conventionally and montaigne was fond of assuring people suddenly that could we have those privileged greeks and romans actually to sit beside us for a while they would be found to offend our niceties at a hundred points we have great power of taking ourselves in and pay ourselves with words words too language itself and therewith the more intimate physiognomy of thought slip every day through our fingers with his eye on his own labour wistfully he thought on the instability of the french language in particulara matter after all so much less perennial than brass in no respect was nature more stable more consecutive than man in nature indeed as in ones self there might be no ultimate inconsequence only the soul looks upon things with another eye and represents them to itself with another kind of face for everything has many faces and several aspects there is nothing single and rare in respect of itself but only in respect of our knowledge which is a wretched foundation whereon to ground our rules and one that represents to us a very false image of things ah even in so dear a matter as bodily health immunity from physical pain what doubts what variations of experience of learned opinion already in six years of married life of four children treated so carefully never for instance roughly awaked from sleep wherein he would observe children are much more profoundly involved than weof four children two were dead and one even now miserably sick seeing the doctor depart one morning a little hastily on the payment of his fee he was tempted to some nice questions as to the moneys worth there are so many maladies and so many circumstances presented to the physician that human sense must soon be at the end of its lessonthe many complexions in a melancholy person the many seasons in winter the many nations in the french the many ages in age the many celestial mutations in the conjunction of venus and saturn the many parts in mans body nay in a finger and suppose the cure effected how can we assure ourselves that it was not because the disease was arrived at its period or an effect of chance or the operation of something else that the child had eaten drunk or touched that day or by virtue of his mothers prayers we suppose we see one side of a thing when we are really looking at another as for me i never see all of anything neither do they who so largely promise to show it to others of the hundred faces that everything has i take one and am for the most part attracted by some new light i find in it and that new light was sure to lead him back very soon to his governing method ignorancean ignorance strong and generous and that yields nothing in honour and courage to knowledge an ignorance which to conceive requires no less knowledge than to conceive knowledge itselfa sapient instructed shrewdly ascertained ignorance suspended judgment doubt everywherebalances very delicate balances he was partial to that image of equilibrium or preponderance in things but was there after all so much as preponderance anywhere to gaston there was a kind of fascination an actually aesthetic beauty in the spectacle of that keenedged intelligence dividing evidence so finely like some exquisite steel instrument with impeccable sufficiency always leaving the last word loyally to the central intellectual faculty in an entire disinterestedness if on the one hand he was always distrustful of things that he wished on the other he had many opinions he would endeavour to make his son dislike if he had one what if the truest opinions were not always the most commodious to man being of so wild a composition he would say nothing to one party that he might not on occasion say to the other with a little alteration of accent yes doubt everywhere doubt in the far background as the proper intellectual equivalent to the infinite possibilities of things doubt shrewdly economising the opportunities of the present hour in the very spirit of the traveller who walks only for the walks sakeevery day concludes my expectation and the journey of my life is carried on after the same fashion doubt finally as the best of pillows to sleep on and in fact gaston did sleep well after those long days of physical and intellectual movement in that quiet world till the spring came round again but beyond and above all the various interests upon which the philosophers mind was for ever afloat there was one subject always in prominencehimself his minute peculiarities mental and physical what was constitutional with him as well as his transient humours how things affected him what they really were to him michael much more than man all this gaston came to know as the world knew it afterwards in the essays often amused sometimes irritated but never suspicious of postures or insincerity montaigne himself admitted his egotism with frank humourin favour of the huguenots who condemn our private confession i confess myself in public and this outward egotism of manner was but the symptom of a certain deeper doctrinal egotismi have no other end in writing but to discover myself and what was the purport what the justification of this undissembled egotism it was the recognition over against or in continuation of that world of floating doubt of the individual mind as for each one severally at once the unique organ and the only matter of knowledgethe wonderful energy the reality and authority of that in its absolute loneliness conforming all things to its law without witnesses as without judge without appeal save to itself whatever truth there might be must come for each one from within not from without to that wonderful microcosm of the individual soul of which for each one all other worlds are but elementsto himselfto what was apparent immediately to him what was properly of his own having and substance he confidently dismissed the inquirer his own egotism was but the pattern of the true intellectual life of every one the greatest thing in the world is for a man to know that he is his own if the world find fault that i speak too much of myself i find fault that they do not so much as think of themselves how it had been lodged in its authorthat surely was the essential question concerning every opinion that comes to one man from another yet again even on this ultimate ground of judgment what undulancy complexity surprisesi have no other end in writing but to discover myself who also shall peradventure be another thing to morrow the great work of his life the essays he placed now high now low with great doubt and inconstancy what are we but sedition like this poor france faction against faction within ourselves every piece playing every moment its own game with as much difference between us and ourselves as between ourselves and others whoever will look narrowly into his own bosom will hardly find himself twice in the same condition i give to myself sometimes one face and sometimes another according to the side i turn to i have nothing to say of myself entirely and without qualification one grows familiar with all strange things by time but the more i frequent myself and the better i know myself the less do i understand myself if others would consider themselves as i do they would find themselves full of caprice rid myself of it i cannot without making myself away they who are not aware of it have the better bargain and yet i know not whether they have or no ones own experiencethat at least was ones own low and earthy it might be still the earth was emphatically good goodnatured and he loved emphatically to recommend the wisdom amid all doubts of keeping close to it gaston soon knew well a certain threadbare garment worn by montaigne in all their rides together sitting quaintly on his otherwise gallant appointmentsan old mantle that had belonged to his father retained as he tells us in spite of its inconvenience because it seemed to envelope me in him it was the symbol of a hundred natural perhaps somewhat material pieties parentage kinship relationship through earththe touch of that was everywhere like a caress to him his fine taste notwithstanding he loved in those long rambles to partake of homely fare paying largely for it everywhere it was as if the earth in him turned kindly to earth under the sun the sturdy purple thistles the blossoming burrs also were worth knowing let us grow together with you they seem to say himself was one of those whom he thought heaven favoured in making them die so naturally by degrees i shall be blind before i am sensible of the decay of my sight with such kindly artifice do the fatal sisters entwist our lives i melt and steal away from myself how variously is it no longer i it was not he who would carry a furry robe at midsummer because he might need it in the winterin fine we must live among the living and let the river flow under the bridge without our care above all things avoiding fear that great disturber of reason the thing in the world i am most afraid of is fear and still health the invincible survival of youth admonished him to a better wisdom than years and sickness was there anything better fairer than the beautiful light of health to be in health was itself the sign perhaps the essence of wisdoma wisdom rich in counsels regarding all ones contacts with the earthy side of existence and how he could laughat that king of thrace for instance who had a religion and a god all to himself which his subjects might not presume to worship at that king of mexico who swore at his coronation not only to keep the laws but also to make the sun run his annual course at those followers of alexander who all carried their heads on one side as alexander did the natural secondbest the intermediate and unheroic virtue even the church as we know by no means requiring heroic virtue was perhaps actually the best better than any kind of heroism in an age whose very virtues were apt to become insane an age guilty and extravagant in its very justice for which as regards all that belongs to the spirit the one thing needful was moderation and it was characteristic of montaigne a note of the real helpfulness there was in his thoughts that he preferred to base virtue on low safe ground the lowest walk is the safest tis the seat of constancy the wind about the tower coming who knows whence and whithercould one enjoy its music unless one knew the foundations safe twenty feet belowground always he loved to hear such words as soften and modify the temerity of our propositions to say less than the truth about it to dissemble the absoluteness of its claim was agreeable to his confidence in the natural charm the gaiety of goodness that fair and beaten path nature has traced for us over against any difficult militant or chimerical virtuenever had any morose and illlooking physician done anything to purpose in that age it was a great thing to be just blameless virtue had its bounds which once transgressed the next step was into the territories of vice all decent and honest means of securing ourselves from harm were not only permitted but commendable any man who despises his own life might always be master of that of another he would not condemn a magistrate who sleeps provided the people under his charge sleep as well as he though a blundering world in collusion with a prejudiced philosophy has a great suspicion of facility there was a certain easy taking of things which made life the richer for others as well as for ones self and was at least an excellent makeshift for disinterested service to them with all his admiration for the antique greatness of character he would never commend so savage a virtue and one that costs so dear as that for instance of the greek mother the roman father who assisted to put their own erring sons to death more truly commendable was the custom of the lacedaemonians who when they went to battle sacrificed always to the muses that these might by their sweetness and gaiety soften martial fury how had divine philosophy herself been discredited by the sour mask the sordid patches with which her enemies surely had sent her abroad into the world i love a gay and civil philosophy there is nothing more cheerful than wisdom i had like to have said more wanton was that why his conversation was sometimes coarse all the contraries are to be found in me in one corner or another if delicacy so also coarseness delicacy there was certainlya wonderful fineness of sensation to the end he tells us that sleep should not so stupidly escape from me i have caused myself to be disturbed in my sleep so that i might the better and more sensibly taste and relish itof scents the simple and natural seem to me the most pleasing and i have often observed that they cause an alteration in me and work upon my spirits according to their several virtues in excessive heats i always travel by night from sunset to sunrise i am betimes sensible of the little breezes that begin to sing and whistle in the shrouds the forerunners of the stormwhen i walk alone in a beautiful orchard if my thoughts are for a while taken up with foreign occurrences i some part of the time call them back again to my walk to the orchard to the sweetness of the solitude and to myselfthere is nothing in us either purely corporeal or purely spiritual tis an inhuman wisdom that would have us despise and hate the culture of the body tis not a soul tis not a body we are training up but a man and we ought not to divide him of all the infirmities we have the most savage is to despise our being there was a fineness of sensation in these unpremeditated thoughts which to gaston seemed to connect itself with the exquisite words he had found to paint his two great affections for his father and for etienne de la boetiea fineness of sensation perhaps quite novel in that age but still of physical sensation and in pursuit of fine physical sensation he came on his broad easy indifferent passage through the world across the coarsest growths which also thrive under the sun and was not revolted they were akin to that ruder earth within himself of which a kind of undissembled greed was symptomatic the love of meats little roasted very high and even as to several quite gone while in drinking he loved clear glass that the eye might taste too according to its capacity akin also to a certain slothfulnesssleeping he says has taken up a great part of my life and there was almost nothing he would not say no fact no story from his curious halfmedical reading he would not find some plausible pretext to tell mans kinship to the animal the material and all the proofs of ithe would never blush at them in truth he led the way to the immodesty of french literature and had his defence a sort of defence ready i know very well that few will quarrel with the licence of my writings who have not more to quarrel with in the licence of their own thoughts yet when gaston twenty years afterwards heard of the seemingly pious end of monsieur de montaigne he recalled a hundred always quiet but not always insignificant acts of devotion noticeable in those old days on passing a village church or at home in the little chapelsuperstitions concessions to others strictly appropriate recognitions rather as it might seem of a certain great possibility which might lie among the conditions of so complex a world that was a point which could hardly escape so reflective a mind as gastons and at a later period of his life at the harvest of his own second thoughts as he pondered on the influence over him of that twosided thinker the opinion that things as we find them would bear a certain oldfashioned construction seemed to have been the consistent motive however secret and subtle in its working of montaignes sustained intellectual activity a lowly philosophy of ignorance would not be likely to disallow or discredit whatever intimations there might be in the experience of the wise or of the simple in favour of a venerable religion which from its long history had come to seem like a growth of nature somewhere among mens seemingly random and so inexplicable apprehensions might lie the grains of a wisdom more precious than gold or even its priceless pearl that free and roving thing the human soulwhat might it not have found out for itself in a world so wide to deny at all events would be only to limit the mind by negation it was not however this side of that double philosophy which recommended itself just now to gaston the masters wistful tolerance so extraordinary a characteristic in that age attracted him in his present humour not so much in connexion with those problematic heavenly lights that might find their way to one from infinite skies as with the pleasant quite finite objects and experiences of the indubitable world of sense so close around him over against the worlds challenge to make trial of it here was that general licence which his own warm and curious appetite just then demanded of the moral theorist for so pronounced a lover of sincerity as monsieur de montaigne there was certainly a strange ambiguousness in the result of his lengthy inquiries on the greatest as well as on the lightest matters and it was inevitable that a listener should accept the dubious lesson in his own sense was this shrewd casuist only bringing him by a roundabout way to principles he would not have cared to avow to the great religious thinker of the next century to pascal montaigne was to figure as emphatically on the wrong side not merely because he that is not with us is against us it was something to have been in the matter of religious tolerance as on many other matters of justice and gentleness the solitary conscience of the age but could one really care for truth who never even seemed to find it did he fear perhaps the practical responsibility of getting to the very bottom of certain questions that the actual discourse of so keen a thinker appeared often inconsistent or inconsecutive might be a hint perhaps that there was some deeper ground of thought in reserve as if he were really moving securely over ground you did not see what might that ground be as to gaston himselfhad this kindly entertainer only been drawing the screws of a very complex piece of machinery which had worked well enough hitherto for all practical purposeswas this all that had been going on while he lingered there week after week in a kind of devout attendance on theories and for his part feeling no reverberation of actual events around him still less of great events in preparation these were the questions gaston had in mind as at length he thanked his host one morning with real regret and took his last look around that meditative place the manuscripts the books the emblemsthe house of circe on the wall vi shadows of events we all feel i suppose the pathos of that mythic situation in homer where the greeks at the last throb of battle around the body of patroclus find the horror of supernatural darkness added to their other foes feel it through some touch of truth to our own experience how the malignancy of the forces against us may be doubled by their uncertainty and the resultant confusion of ones own mindblindfold night there too at the moment when daylight and selfpossession are indispensable in that old dreamland of the iliad such darkness is the work of a propitiable deity and withdrawn at its pleasure in life it often persists obstinately it was so with the agents on the terrible eve of st bartholomew when a mans foes were those of his own household an ambiguity of motive and influence a confusion of spirit amounting as we approach the centre of action to physical madness encompasses those who are formally responsible for things and the mist around that great crime or great accident in which the gala weather of gastons coming to paris broke up leaving a sullenness behind it to remain for a generation has never been penetrated the doubt with which charles the ninth would seem to have left the world doubt as to his own complicity therein as well as to the precise nature the course and scope of the event itself is still unresolved so it was with gaston also the incident in his life which opened for him the profoundest sources of regret and pity shaped as it was in a measure by those greater historic movements owed its tragic significance there to an unfriendly shadow precluding knowledge how certain facts had really gone a shadow which veiled from others a particular act of his and the true character of its motives for the scene of events being now contracted very closely to paris the predestined actors therein were gradually drawn thither as into some narrow battlefield or slaughterhouse or fell trap of destiny and gaston all unconsciously along with themhe and his private fortunes involved in those larger ones result of chance or fate or cunning prevision there are in the acts great and littlethe acts and the words alikeof the king and his associates at this moment coincidences which give them at least superficially the colour of an elaborate conspiracy certainly as men looked back afterwards all the seemingly random doings of those restless months ending in the noces vermeilles marriage of henry of navarre with margaret of france lent themselves agreeably to the theory of a great plot to crush out at one blow in the interest of the reigning valois not the huguenots only but the rival houses of guise and bourbon the word the act from hour to hour through what presented itself at the time as a longcontinued season of frivolity suggested in retrospect alike to friend and foe the close connexion of a mathematical problem and yet that damning coincidence of date day and hour apparently so exactly timed in the famous letter to the governor of lyons by which charles the trap being now ready seems to shut all the doors upon escaping victims is admitted even by huguenot historians to have been fortuitous gaston recalling to mind the actual mien of charles as be passed to and fro across the chimeric scene timid and therefore constitutionally trustful towards older persons filially kissing the hand of the grim coligni mon pre mon preall his clineries in that age of courtesy and assassinationswould wonder always in time to come as the more equitable sort of historians have done what amount of guilty foresight the young king had carried in his bosom and this ambiguity regarding the nearest agent in so great a crime adding itself to the general mystery of life touched gaston duly with a sense of the dim melancholy of mans position in the world it might seem the function of some cruel or merely whimsical power thus by the flinging of mere dust through the air to double our actual misfortunes however carefully the critical intelligence in him might trim the balance his imagination at all events would never be clear of the more plausible construction of events in spite of efforts not to misjudge in proportion to the clearness with which he recalled the visible footsteps of the accursed valois he saw them irresistibly in connexion with the end actually reached moving to the sounds of wedding music through a world of dainty gestures amid sonnets and flowers and perhaps the most refined art the world has seen to their surfeit of blood and if those accursed valois might plead to be judged refinedly so would gaston had the opportunity come have pleaded not to be misunderstood of the actual event he was not a spectator and his sudden absence from paris at that moment seemed to some of those he left there only a cruelly characteristic incident in the great treachery just before that delirious night set in the news that his old grandfather lay mortally sick at deuxmanoirs had snatched him away to watch by the dying bed amid the peaceful ministries of the religion which was even then filling the houses of paris with blood but the yellowhaired woman light of soul whose husband he had become by dubious and irregular huguenot rites the religious sanction of which he hardly recognisedflying after his last tender kiss with the babe in her womb from the ruins of her home and the slaughter of her kinsmen supposed herself treacherously deserted for him on the other hand the pity of it the pity of the thing supplied all that had been wanting in its first consecration and made the lost mistress really a wife his recoil from that damaging theory of his conduct brought home to a sensitive conscience the fact that there had indeed been a measure of selfindulgent weakness in his acts and made him the creature for the rest of his days of something like remorse the gaiety the strange devils gaiety of france at least in all places whither its royalty came ended appropriately in a marriagea marriage of the reform in the person of prince henry of navarre to catholicism in the person of margaret of valois margaret of the memoirs charless sister in tacit defiance of or indifference to the pope with the great huguenot leaders with the princes of the house of guise and the court like one united family all in gaudy evidence in its streets paris ever with an eye for the chance of amusement always preoccupied with the visible side of things always catholicwas bidden to be tolerant for a moment to carry no firearms under penalties to renew no past quarrels and draw no sword in any new one it was the perfect stroke of catherines policy the secret of her predominance over her sons thus with a flight of purchaseable fair women ever at command to maintain perpetual holiday perpetual idleness with consequent perpetual most often idle thoughts about marriage amid which the actual conduct of affairs would be left to herself yet for paris thus catholic there was certainly even if the pope were induced to consent and the huguenot bridegroom to conform something illicit and inauspicious about this marriage within the prohibited degrees of kinship in fact the cunningly sought papal dispensation never came charles with apparent unconcern fulfilled his threat and did without it must needs however trick the old cardinal de bourbon into performing his office not indeed in the face of the church but in the open air outside the doors of the cathedral of notredame the catholics quietly retiring into the interior when that starveling ceremony was over to hear the nuptial mass still the open air the august sunshine had lent the occasion an irresistible physical gaiety in this hymeneal assumption weather paris suppressing its scruples its conscientious and unconscientious hatreds at least for a season had adorned herself as that fascinating city always has been able to adorn herself if with something of artifice certainly with great completeness almost to illusion whatever gloom the middle age with its sins and sorrows might have left there was under gallant disguise today in the train of the young married people jeunes premiers in an engagement which was to turn out almost as transitory as a stageplay a long month of masquerade meandered night and day through the public places his carnality and hers so startling in their later developments showed now in fact but as the engaging force of youth since youth however unpromising its antecedents can never have sinned irretrievably yet to curious retrospective minds not long afterwards these graceful follies would seem tragic or allegoric with an undercurrent of infernal irony throughout charles and his two brothers keeping the gates of a mimic paradise in the court of the louvre while the fountains ran winewere they already thinking of a time when they would

opportunity a religious pretext had brought into sudden evidence all the latent ferocities of a corrupt though dainty civilisation and while the stairways of the louvre the streets the vile trapdoors

aged assists patiently with his immemorial consolations at this long leisurely scarce perceptible ending to a long leisurely life on the quiet doubleholiday morning the wild news of public disaster

instigator of the murder of his father seemed a martyrdom and around that central barbarity the slaughter had spread over paris in widening circles with conflicting thoughts in wild terror and grief

private distress queries on points of more general interest in the event would not be excluded with whom precisely in whose interest had the first guilty motion beengaston on the morrow asked in vain as the historian asks still and more and more as he picked his way among the direful records of the late massacre not the cruelty only but the obscurity the accidental character yet alas also the treachery of the public event seemed to identify themselves tragically with his own personal action those queries those surmises were blent with the enigmatic sense of his own helplessness amid the obscure forces around him which would fain compromise the indifferent and had made him so far an accomplice in their unfriendly action that he felt certainly not quite guiltless thinking of his own

suffering of the whole world in its plenitude of piteous detail in those unvalued caresses that desire towards himself that patient half expressed claim not to be wholly despised poignant now for ever for he failed to find her and her brothers being presumably dead all he could discover of a certainty from the last survivor of her more distant kinsmen was the fact of her flight into the country already in labour it was thought and in the belief that she had been treacherously deserted like many another at that great crisis in the one place in the neighbourhood of paris with which his knowledge connected her he seeks further tidings but hears only of her passing through it as of a passage into vague infinite space a little onward dimly of her death with the most damaging view of his own conduct presented with all the condemnatory resources of huguenot tongues but neither of the place nor the circumstances of that event nor whether as seemed hardly probable the child survived it was not till many years afterwards that he stood by her grave still with no softening of the cruel picture driven then as with fire into his soul her affection her confidence in him still contending with the suspicions the illconcealed antipathy to him of her hostile brothers the distress of her flight half in dread to find the husband she was pursuing with the wildness of some lost

the naturally devout gaston that habituated to yield himself to the poetic guidance of the catholic church in her wonderful yearlong dramatic version of the story of redemption he had ever found its greatest day least evocative of proportionate sympathy the sudden gaieties of easter morning the congratulations to the divine mother the sharpness of the recoil from one extreme of feeling to the other for him never cleared away the lenten preoccupation with christs death and passion the empty tomb with the white clothes lying was still a tomb there was no human warmth in the spiritual body the white flowers after all were those of a funeral with a mortal coldness amid the loud alleluias which refused to melt at the startling summons any more than the earth will do in the march morning because we call it spring it was altogether different with that other festival which celebrates the descent of the spirit the tongues the nameless impulses gone all abroad to soften slowly to penetrate all things as with the winning subtlety of nature or of human genius the gracious pentecostal fire seemed to be in alliance with the sweet warm relaxing winds of that later securer season bringing their spicy burden from unseen sources into the close world like a walled garden about him influences from remotest time and space found their way travelling unerringly on their long journeys as if straight to him with the assurance that things were not wholly left to themselves yet so unobtrusively that a little later the transforming spiritual agency would be discernible at most in the grateful cry of an innocent child in some good deed of a bad man or unlookedfor gentleness of a rough one in the occasional turning to music of a rude voice through the course of years during which gaston was to remain in paris very close to other peoples sins interested all but entangled in a world of corruption in flower pleasantly enough to the eye those influences never failed him at times it was as if a legion of spirits besieged his door open unto me open unto me my sister my love my dove my undefiled and one result certainly of this constant prepossession was that it kept him on the alert concerning theories of the divine assistance to man and the worldtheories of inspiration on the feast of pentecost on the afternoon of the thirtieth of may news of the death of charles the ninth had gone abroad promptly with large rumours as to the manner of it those streams of blood blent themselves fantastically in gastons memory of the event with the gaudy colours of the seasonthe crazy red trees in blossom upon the heated sky above the old grey walls like a fiery sunset it might seem as he looked back over the ashen intervening years to charless successor he and the queenmother now delightfully secure from fears however unreasonable of charless jerking dagger the day became a sweet one to be noted unmistakably by various pious and other observances which still further fixed the thought of that sunday on gastons mind with continual surmise as to the tendencies of so complex and perplexing a scene the last words of charles had asserted his satisfaction in leaving no male child to wear his crown but the brother whose obvious kingly qualities the chief facts really known of him so far charles was thought to have enviedthe gallant feats of his youth de ses jeunes guerres his stature his highbred beauty his eloquence his almost pontifical refinement and gracehad already promptly deserted the halfbarbarous kingdom his acceptance of which had been but the mask of banishment though he delayed much on his way to the new one passing round through the cities of venice and lombardy seductive schools of the art of life as conceived by italian epicures of which he became only too ready a student on whitmonday afternoon while charles went in lead amid very little private or public concern to join his kinsfolk at saintdenys paris was already looking out for its new king following through doubtful rumour his circuitous journey to the throne by venice padua ferrara mantua turin over mont cenis by lyons to french soil still building confidently on the prestige of his early manhood seeing him at last all were conscious in a moment of the inversion of their hopes had the old witchcrafts of poland the old devilries of his race laid visible hold on the hopeful young man that he must now take purely satiric estimate of so great an opportunity with a programme which looked like formal irony on the kingly position a premeditated mockery of those who yielded him on demand a servile reverence never before paid to any french monarch well the amusement or business of parisians at all events would still be that of spectators assisting at the last act of the valois tragedy in the course of which fantastic traits and incidents would naturally be multiplied fantastic humour seemed at its height in the institution of a new order of knighthood the enigmatic splendours of which were to be a monument of henrys superstitious care or as some said of his impious contempt of the day which had made him master of his destinythat great church festival towards the emphatic marking of which he was ever afterwards ready to welcome any novel or striking device for the spending of an hour it was on such an occasion thenon a whitsunday afternoon amid the gaudy red hues of the season that gaston listened to one who as if with some intentional new version of the sacred event then commemorated had a great deal to say concerning the spirit above all of the freedom the indifference of its operations and who would give a strangely altered colour for a long time to come to the thoughts to the very words associated with the celebration of pentecost the speaker though understood to be a brother of the order of saint dominic had not been present at the massthe daily university red mass de spiritu sancto but said today according to the proper course of the season in the chapel of the sorbonne with much pomp by the italian bishop of paris it was the reign of the italians just then a doubly refined somewhat morbid somewhat ash coloured italy in france more italian still what our elisabethan poets imagined about italian cultureforcing all they knew of italy to an ideal of dainty sin such as had never actually existed there that the court of henry so far as in it lay realised in fact men of italian birth to the great suspicion of simple people swarmed in paris already flightier less constant than the girouettes on its steeples and it was love for italian fashions that had brought king and courtiers here this afternoon with great clat as they said frizzed and starched in the beautiful minutely considered dress of the moment pressing the learned university itself into the background for the promised speaker about whom tongues had been busy not only in the latin quarter had come from italy in an age in which all things about which parisians much cared must be italian there might be a hearing for italian philosophy courtiers at least would understand italian and this speaker was rumoured to possess in perfection all the curious arts of his native language and of all the kingly qualities of henrys youth the single one which had held by him was that gift of eloquence he was able also to value in others an inherited gift perhaps for amid all contemporary and subsequent historic gossip about his mother the two things certain are that the hands credited with so much mysterious ill doing were fine ones and that she was an admirable speaker bruno himself tells us long after he had withdrawn himself from it that the monastic life promotes the freedom of the intellect by its silence and selfconcentration the prospect of such freedom sufficiently explains why a young man who however wellfound in worldly and personal advantages was above all conscious of great intellectual possessions and of fastidious spirit also with a remarkable distaste for the vulgar should have espoused poverty chastity and obedience in a dominican cloister what liberty of mind may really come to in such places what daring new departures it may suggest even to the strictly monastic temper is exemplified by the dubious and dangerous mysticism of men like john of parma and joachim of flora the reputed author of a new everlasting gospel strange dreamers in a world of sanctified rhetoric of that later dispensation of the spirit in which all law will have passed away or again by a recognised tendency in the great rival order of saint francis in the socalled spiritual franciscans to understand the dogmatic words of faith with a difference the three convents in which successively bruno had lived at naples at citt di campagna and finally the minerva at rome developed freely we may suppose all the mystic qualities of a genius in which from the first a heady southern imagination took the lead but it was from beyond monastic bounds that he would look for the sustenance the fuel of an ardour born or bred within them amid such artificial religious stillness the air itself becomes generous in undertones the vain young monk vain of course would feed his vanity by puzzling the good sleepy heads of the average sons of dominic with his neology putting new wine into old bottles teaching them their own business the new higher truer sense of the most familiar terms of the chapters they read the hymns they sang above all as it happened every word that referred to the spirit the reign of the spirit and its excellent freedom he would soon pass beyond the utmost possible limits of his brethrens sympathy beyond the largest and freest interpretation such words would bear to words and thoughts on an altogether different plane of which the full scope was only to be felt in certain old pagan writerspagan though approached perhaps at first as having a kind of natural preparatory kinship with scripture itself the dominicans would seem to have had wellstocked and liberallyselected libraries and this curious youth in that age of restored letters read eagerly easily and very soon came to the kernel of a difficult old author plotinus or platoto the real purpose of thinkers older still surviving by glimpses only in the books of others empedocles for instance and pythagoras who had been nearer the original sense of things parmenides above all that most ancient assertor of gods identity with the world the affinities the unity of the visible and the invisible of earth and heaven of all things whatever with one another through the consciousness the person of god the spirit who was at every moment of infinite time in every atom of matter at every point of infinite space aye was everything in turn that doctrinelantica filosofia italianawas in all its vigour there like some hardy growth out of the very heart of nature interpreting itself to congenial minds with all the fulness of primitive utterance a big thought yet suggesting perhaps from the first in still small immediately practical voice a freer way of taking a possible modification of certain moral precepts a primitive moralitycall it congruous with those larger primitive ideas with that larger survey with the earlier and more liberal air returning to this ancient pantheism after the long reign of a seemingly opposite faith bruno unfalteringly asserts the vision of all things in god to be the aim of all metaphysical speculation as of all enquiry into nature the spirit of god in countless variety of forms neither above nor in any way without but intimately within all things is really present with equal integrity and fulness in the sunbeam ninety millions of miles long and the wandering drop of water as it evaporates therein the divine consciousness has the same relation to the production of things as the human intelligence to the production of true thoughts concerning them nay those thoughts are themselves actually god in man a loan to man also of his assisting spirit who in truth is the creator of things in and by his contemplation of them for him as for man in proportion as man thinks truly thought and being are identical and things existent only in so far as they are known delighting in itself in the sense of its own energy this sleepless capacious fiery intelligence evokes all the orders of nature all the revolutions of history cycle upon cycle in ever new types and god the spirit the soul of the world being therefore really identical with the soul of bruno also as the universe shapes itself to brunos reason to his imagination ever more and more articulately he too becomes a sharer of the divine joy in that process of the formation of true ideas which is really parallel to the process of creation to the evolution of things in a certain mystic sense which some in every age of the world have understood he too is the creator himself actually a participator in the creative function and by such a philosophy bruno assures us it was his experience that the soul is greatly expanded con questa filosofia lanima mi saggrandisce mi se magnifica lintelletto for with characteristic largeness of mind bruno accepted this theory in the whole range of its consequences its more immediate corollary was the famous axiom of indifference of the coincidence of contraries to the eye of god to the philosophic vision through which god sees in man nothing is really alien from him the differences of things those distinctions above all which schoolmen and priests old or new roman or reformed had invented for themselves would be lost in the length and breadth of the philosophic survey nothing in itself being really either great or small and matter certainly in all its various forms not evil but divine dare one choose or reject this or that if god the spirit had made nay was all things indifferently then matter and spirit the spirit and the flesh heaven and earth freedom and necessity the first and the last good and evil would be superficial rather than substantial differences only were joy and sorrow also together with another distinction always of emphatic reality to gaston for instance to be added to the list of phenomena really coincident or indifferent as some intellectual kinsmen of bruno have claimed they should the dominican brother was at no distant day to break far enough away from the election the seeming vocation of his youth yet would remain always and under all circumstances unmistakably a monk in some predominant qualities of temper at first it was only by way of thought that he asserted his libertydelightful latefound privilegetraversing in strictly mental journeys that spacious circuit as it broke away before him at every moment upon evernew horizons kindling thought and imagination at once the prospect draws from him cries of joy of a kind of religious joy as in some new canticle of the creatures some new hymnal or antiphonary nature becomes for him a sacred termconform thyself to nature with what sincerity what enthusiasm what religious fervour he enounces that precept to others to himself recovering as he fancies a certain primeval sense of deity broadcast on things a sense in which pythagoras and other inspired theorists of early greece had abounded in his hands philosophy becomes a poem a sacred poem as it had been with them that bruno himself in the enthusiasm of the idea drew from his axiom of the indifference of contraries the practical consequence which is in very deed latent there that he was ready to sacrifice to the antinomianism which is certainly a part of its rigid logic the austerities the purity of his own youth for instance there is no proof the service the sacrifice he is ready to bring to the great light that has dawned for him occupying his entire conscience with the sense of his responsibilities to it is the sacrifice of days and nights spent in eager study of plenary disinterested utterance of the thoughts that arise in him at any hazard at the price say of martyrdom the work of the divine spirit as he conceives it exalts inebriates him till the scientific apprehension seems to take the place of prayer oblation communion it would be a mistake he holds to attribute to the human soul capacities merely passive or receptive she too possesses initiatory power as truly as the divine soul of the world to which she responds with the free gift of a light and heat that seem her own yet a nature so opulently endowed can hardly have been lacking in purely physical or sensuous ardours his pantheistic belief that the spirit of god is in all things was not inconsistent with nay might encourage a keen and restless eye for the dramatic details of life and character however minute for humanity in all its visible attractiveness since there too in truth divinity lurks from those first fair days of early greek speculation love had occupied a large place in the conception of philosophy and in after days bruno was fond of developing like plato like the christian platonists combining something of the peculiar temper of each the analogy between the flights of intellectual enthusiasm and those of physical love with an animation which shows clearly enough the reality of his experience in the latter the eroici furori his book of books dedicated to philip sidney who would be no stranger to such thoughts presents a singular blending of verse and prose after the manner of dantes vita nuova the supervening philosophic comment reconsiders those earlier physically erotic impulses which had prompted the sonnet in voluble italian entirely to the advantage of their abstract incorporeal theoretic equivalents yet if it is after all but a prose comment it betrays no lack of the natural stuff out of which such mystic transferences must be made that there is no single name of preference no beatrice or laura by no means proves the young mans earlier desires to have been merely platonic and if the colours of love inevitably lose a little of their force and propriety by such deflexion from their earlier purpose their later intellectual purpose as certainly finds its opportunity thereby in the matter of borrowed fire and wings a kind of old scholastic pedantry creeping back over the ardent youth who had thrown it off so defiantly as if love himself went in now for a university degree bruno developes under the mask of amorous verse all the various stages of abstraction by which as the last step of a long ladder the mind attains actual union for as with the purely religious mystics union the mystic union of souls with one another and their lord nothing less than union between the contemplator and the contemplatedthe reality or the sense or at least the name of such unionwas always at hand whence that instinctive tendency towards union if not from the creator of things himself who has doubtless prompted it in the physical universe as in man how familiar the thought that the whole creation not less than the soul of man longs for god as the hart for the water brooks to unite oneself to the infinite by largeness and lucidity of intellect to enter by that admirable faculty into eternal life this was the true vocation of the spouse of the rightly amorous soul a filosofia necessario amore there would be degrees of progress therein as of course also of relapse joys and sorrows therefore and in interpreting these the philosopher whose intellectual ardours have superseded religion and physical love is still a lover and a monk all the influences of the convent the sweet heady incense the pleading sounds the sophisticated light and air the grotesque humours of old gothic carvers the thick stratum of pagan sentiment beneath all thissanta maria sopra minervamare indelible in him tears sympathies tender inspirations attraction repulsion zeal dryness recollection desirehe finds a place for them all knows them all well in their unaffected simplicity while he seeks the secret and secondary or as he fancies the primary form and purport of each whether as a light on actual life or as a mere barren scholastic subtlety never before had the pantheistic doctrine been developed with such completeness never before connected with so large a sense of nature so large a promise of the knowledge of it as it really is the eyes that had not been wanting to visible humanity turned now with equal liveliness on the natural world in that region of his birth where all the colour and force of nature are at least two fold nature is not only a thought or meditation in the divine mind it is also the perpetual energy of that mind which ever identical with itself puts forth and absorbs in turn all the successive forms of life of thought of language even what seemed like striking transformations of matter were in truth only a chapter a clause in the great volume of the transformations of the divine spirit the mystic recognition that all is indeed divine had accompanied a realisation of the largeness of the field of concrete knowledge the infinite extent of all there was actually to know winged fortified by that central philosophic faith the student proceeds to the detailed reading of nature led on from point to point by manifold lights which will surely strike on him by the way from the divine intelligence in it speaking directly sympathetically to a like intelligence in him the earths wonderful animation as divined by one who anticipates by a whole generation the baconian philosophy of experience in that those bold flighty pantheistic speculations become tangible matter of fact here was the needful book for man to read the full revelation the story in detail of that one universal mind struggling emerging through shadow substance manifest spirit in various orders of beingthe veritable history of god and nature together with the true pedigree and evolution of man also his gradual issue from it was still all to learn the delightful tangle of thingsit would be the delightful task of mans thoughts to disentangle that already bruno had measured the space which bacon would fill with room perhaps for darwin also that deity is everywhere like all such abstract propositions is a twoedged force depending for its practical effect on the mind which admits it on the peculiar perspective of that mind to dutch spinosa in the next century faint consumptive with a naturally faint hold on external things the theorem that god was in all things whatever annihilating their differences suggested a somewhat chilly withdrawal from the contact of all alike but in bruno eager and impassioned an italian of the italians it awoke a constant inextinguishable appetite for every form of experiencea fear as of the one sin possible of limiting for ones self or another the great stream flowing for thirsty souls that wide pasture set ready for the hungry heart considered from the point of view of a minute observation of nature the infinite might figure as the infinitely little no blade of grass being like another as there was no limit to the complexities of an atom of earthcell sphere within sphere and the earth itself hitherto seemingly the privileged centre of a very limited universe was after all but an atom in an infinite world of starry space then lately divined by candid intelligence which the telescope was one day to present to bodily eyes for if bruno must needs look forward to the future to bacon for adequate knowledge of the earth the infinitely little he could look backwards also gratefully to another daring mind which had already put that earth into its modest place and opened the full view of the heavens if god is eternal then the universe is infinite and worlds innumerable yes one might well have divined what reason now demonstrated indicating those endless spaces which a real sidereal science would gradually occupy that the stars are suns that the earth is in motion that the earth is of like stuff with the starsnow the familiar knowledge of childrendawning on bruno as calm assurance of reason on appeal from the prejudice of the eye brought to him an inexpressibly exhilarating sense of enlargement in the intellectual nay the physical atmosphere and his consciousness of unfailing unity and order did not desert him in that broader survey which made the utmost one could ever know of the earth seem but a very little chapter in the endless history of god the spirit rejoicing so greatly in the admirable spectacle that it never ceases to evolve from matter new conditions the immoveable earth as we term it beneath ones feetwhy one almost felt the movement the respiration of god in it and yet how greatly even the physical eye the sensible imagination so to term it was flattered by the theorem what joy in that motion in the prospect the music the music of the sphereshe could listen to it in a perfection such as had never been conceded to plato to pythagoras even veni creator spiritus mentes tuorum visita imple superna gratia quae tu creasti pectora yes the grand old christian hymns perhaps the grandest of them all seemed to lend themselves in the chorus to be deepened immeasurably under this new intention it is not always or often that mens abstract ideas penetrate the temperament touch the animal spirits affect conduct it was what they did with bruno the ghastly spectacle of the endless material universeinfinite dust in truth starry as it may look to our terrestrial eyesthat prospect from which the mind of pascal recoiled so painfully induced in bruno only the delightful consciousness of an everwidening kinship and sympathy since every one of those infinite worlds must have its sympathetic inhabitants scruples of conscience if he felt such might well be pushed aside for the excellency of such knowledge as this to shut the eyes whether of the body or the mind would be a kind of sullen ingratitudethe one sin to believe directly or indirectly in any absolutely dead matter anywhere as being implicitly a denial of the indwelling spirita free spirit certainly as of old through all his pantheistic flights from horizon to horizon it was still the thought of liberty that presented itself to the infinite relish of this prodigal son of dominic god the spirit had made all things indifferently with a largeness a beneficence impiously belied by any theory of restrictions distinctions of absolute limitation touch see listen eat freely of all the trees of the garden of paradise with the voice of the lord god literally everywherehere was the final counsel of perfection the world was even larger than youthful appetite youthful capacity let theologian and every other theorist beware how he narrowed either the plurality of worldshow petty in comparison seemed those sins the purging of which was mens chief motive in coming to places like this convent whence bruno with vows broken or for him obsolete presently departed a sonnet expressive of the joy with which he returned to so much more than the liberty of ordinary men does not suggest that he was driven from it though he must have seemed to those who surely had loved so loveable a creature there to be departing like the prodigal of the gospel into the farthest of possible far countries there is no proof of harsh treatment on their part or even of an effort to detain him it happens most naturally of course that those who undergo the shock of spiritual or intellectual change sometimes fail to recognise their debt to the deserted causehow much of the heroism or other high quality of their rejection has really been the product of what they reject bruno the escaped monk is still a monk and his philosophy impious as it might seem to some a religion very new indeed yet a religion he came forth wellfitted by conventual influences to play upon men as he had been played upon a challenge a warcry an alarum everywhere he seemed to be but the instrument of some subtly materialised spiritual force like that of the old greek prophets that enthusiasm he was inclined to set so high or like impulsive pentecostal fire his hunger to know fed dreamily enough at first within the convent walls as he wandered over space and time an indefatigable reader of books would be fed physically now by ear and eye by large matteroffact experience as he journeys from university to university less as a teacher than a courtier a citizen of the world a knighterrant of intellectual light the philosophic need to try all things had given reasonable justification to the stirring desire for travel common to youth in which if in nothing else that whole age of the later renaissance was invincibly young the theoretic recognition of that mobile spirit of the world ever renewing its youth became the motive of a life as mobile as ardent as itself of a continual journey the venture and stimulus of which would be the occasion of evernew discoveries of renewed conviction the unity the spiritual unity of the worldthat must involve the alliance the congruity of all things with one another of the teachers personality with the doctrine he had to deliver of the spirit of that doctrine with the fashion of his utterance great reinforcements of sympathy in his own case certainly when bruno confronted his audience at paris himself his theme his language were alike the fuel of one clear spiritual flame which soon had hold of his audience also alien strangely alien as that audience might seem from the speaker it was intimate discourse in magnetic touch with every one present with his special point of impressibility the sort of speech which consolidated into literary form as a book would be a dialogue according to the true attic genius full of those diversions passing irritations unlookedfor appeals in which a solicitous missionary finds his largest range of opportunity and takes even dull wits unaware in bruno that abstract theory of the perpetual motion of the world was become a visible person talking with you and as the runaway dominican was still in temper a monk so he presented himself to his audience in the comely dominican habit the reproachful eyes were today for the most part kindly observant registering every detail of that singular company all the physiognomic effects which come by the way on people and through them on thingsthe shadows of ideas in mens faceshis own pleasantly expressive with them in turn de umbris idearum it was the very title of his discourse there was heroic gaiety there only as usual with gaiety it made the passage of a peevish cloud seem all the chillier lit up in the agitation of speaking by many a harsh or scornful beam yet always sinking in moments of repose to an expression of highbred melancholy the face was one that looked after all made for sufferingalready half pleading half defiant as of a creature you could hurt but to the last never shake a hairsbreadth from its estimate of yourself like nature like nature in that opulent country of his birth which the nolan as he delighted to call himself loved so well that born wanderer as he was he must perforce return thither sooner or later at the risk of life he gave plenis manibus but without selection and was hardly more fastidious in speech than the asinine vulgar he so deeply contemned his rank unweeded eloquence abounding in play of words rabbinic allegories verses defiant of prosody in the kind of erudition he professed to despise with here and there a shameless imagethe product not of formal method but of neapolitan improvisationwas akin to the heady wine the sweet coarse odours of that fiery volcanic soil fertile in such irregularities as manifest power helping himself indifferently to all religions for rhetoric illustration his preference was still for that of the soil the old pagan religion and for the primitive italian gods whose names and legends haunt his speech as they do the carved and pictorial work of that age of the renaissance to excite to surprise to move mens minds like the volcanic earth as if in travail and according to the socratic fancy to bring them to the birth was after all the proper function of the teacher however unusual it might seem in so ancient a university fantasticfrom first to last that was the descriptive epithet and the very word carrying us to shakespeare reminds one how characteristic of the age such habit was and that it was pre eminently due to italy a man of books he had yet so vivid a hold on people and things that the traits and tricks of the audience seemed to strike from his memory all the graphic resources of his old readings he seemed to promise some greater matter than was then actually exposed by him to be himself enjoying the fulness of a great outlook the vague suggestion of which did but sustain the curiosity of the listeners and still in hearing him speak you seemed to see that subtle spiritual fire to which he testified kindling from word to word what gaston then heard was in truth the first fervid expression of all those contending views out of which his written works would afterwards be compacted of course with much loss of heat in the process satyric or hybrid growths things due to hybris insult insolence to what the old satyrs of fable embodiedthe volcanic south is kindly prolific of these and bruno abounded in mockery though it was by way of protest so much of a platonist for platos genial humour he had nevertheless substituted the harsh laughter of aristophanes paris teeming beneath a very courtly exterior with mordant words in unabashed criticism of all real or suspected evil provoked his utmost powers of scorn for the triumphant beast the installation of the ass shining even there amid the university folkthose intellectual bankrupts of the latin quarter who had so long passed between them however gravely a worthless parchment and paper currency in truth aristotle the supplanter of plato was still in possession pretending as bruno conceived to determine heaven and earth by precedent hiding the proper nature of things from the eyes of men habitthe last word of his practical philosophyindolent habit what would this mean in the intellectual life but just that sort of dead judgments which because the mind the eye were no longer really at work in them are most opposed to the essential quickness and freedom of the spirit the shadows of ideas de umbris idearum such in set terms have been the subject of brunos discourse appropriately to the still only half emancipated intellect of his audienceon approximations to truth the divine imaginations as seen darkly more bearably by weaker faculties in words in visible facts in their shadows merely according to the doctrine of indifference indeed there would be no real distinction between substance and shadow in regard to mans feeble wit however varying degrees of knowledge constituted such a distinction ideas and shadows of ideas the phrase recurred often and as such mystic phrases will fixed itself in gastons fancy though not quite according to the mind of the speaker accommodated rather to the thoughts which just then preoccupied his own as already in his life there had been the shadows of eventsthe indirect yet fatal influence there of deeds in which he had no part so now for a time he seemed to fall under the spell the power of the shadows of ideas of brunos ideas in other words of those indirect suggestions which though no necessary part of yet inevitably followed upon his doctrines what for instance might be the proper practical limitations of that telling theory of the coincidence the indifference of opposites to that true son of the renaissance in the light of his large antique pagan ideas the difference between rome and the reform would figure of course as but an insignificant variation upon some deeper and more radical antagonism between two tendencies of mens minds but what about an antagonism deeper still between christ and the world saychrist and the fleshor about that so very ancient antagonism between good and evil was there any place really left for imperfection moral or otherwise in a world wherein the minutest atom the lightest thought could not escape from gods presence who should note the crime the sin the mistake in the operation of that eternal spirit which was incapable of mis shapen births in proportion as man raised himself to the ampler survey of the divine work around him just in that proportion did the very notion of evil disappear there were no weeds no tares in the endless field the truly illuminated mind discerning spiritually might do what it would even under the shadow of monastic walls that had sometimes been the precept which larger theories of inspiration had bequeathed to practice of all the trees of the garden thou mayest freely eatif ye take up any deadly thing it shall not hurt youand i think that i too have the spirit of god bruno a citizen of the world bruno at paris was careful to warn off the vulgar from applying the decisions of philosophy beyond its proper speculative limits but a kind of secrecy an ambiguous atmosphere encompassed from the first alike the speaker and the doctrine and in that world of fluctuating and ambiguous characters the alerter mind certainly pondering on this novel reign of the spiritwhat it might actually bewould hardly fail to find in brunos doctrines a method of turning poison into food to live and thrive thereon an art to paris in the intellectual and moral condition of that day hardly less opportune than had it related to physical poisons if bruno himself was cautious not to suggest the ethic or practical equivalent to his theoretic positions there was that in his very manner of speech in that rank unweeded eloquence of his which seemed naturally to discourage any effort at selection any sense of fine difference of nuances or proportion in things the loose sympathies of his genius were allied to nature nursing with equable maternity of soul good bad and indifferent alike rather than to art distinguishing rejecting refining commission and omission sins of the former surely had the natural preference and how would paolo and francesca have read this lesson how would henry and margaret of the memoirs and other susceptible persons then present read it especially if the opposition between practical good and evil traversed diametrically another distinction the opposed points of which to gaston for instance could never by any possibility become indifferentthe distinction namely between the precious and the base aesthetically between what was right and wrong in the matter of art notes from aus
