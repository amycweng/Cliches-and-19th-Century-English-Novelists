in this age of transition and progress when the pleasureseeker like the athenian of old is for ever searching for things new and strange when old landmarks are ruthlessly demolished and respectable antiquities are shelved in outer darkness then to some conservative minds it is refreshing to stumble upon some oldworld corner fragrant with memories of the past and as yet untouched by the finger of the destroyer cleveland terrace chelsea is one of these spotsthe cobwebs of antiquity seem to cling with the vines to the tall narrow old houses with their flagged courtyards and high iron gates and small useless balconies there is something obsolete oldfashioned and behind the age in the whole aspect of the place one could imagine some slim demure damsel in a shortwaisted gown not long enough to hide the dainty shoes and sandals with a huge bonnet disguising a pyramid of curls tripping down the few worn steps and across the road on her way to join her friends at ranelagh just opposite is chelsea hospital with its scarlet and bluecoated pensioners basking in the sunshine grand old veterans who have grown grey with service their breasts decorated with the medals they have wonsome in a hale green old age others in the sear and yellow leaf toothless senile tottering slowly but surely towards their long home one reads a whole page of history as one gazes at the worn wrinkled old faces ah they have been young once but now the battle of life is nearly over for them the rollcall will only sound once more in their ears let them sit in the sunshine and tell their old stories and fight their battles over again in the ears of some admiring recruit how their dim eyes sparkle with senile enthusiasm there were two of the black devils but i bayoneted them one after anotherspitted them like larks and serve them right too thats where i got this medal and here a fit of asthmatic coughing impedes the bloodthirsty narrative one can imagine the thrilling tales told round the fire towards night as the grim old warriors nestle cosily in the high wooden settle while envious comrades watch them from afar how heavily the poor wooden legs stump through the long echoing corridors grey hairs old wounds the chill stiffness of decrepit agewell thank god for their peaceful harbourage where the weary limbs can rest in comfort there is a sweet old spot just where the long lime avenue leads to old ranelagh adjoining the little plots of garden ground cultivated by the pensioners one golden afternoon in september when a fresh pleasant breeze was rippling the limes a girl in brown came down the avenue and as she tripped past the gnarled and twisted treeboles the slanting sunbeams seemed to meet and envelop her until her shabby frock became like cinderellas robe and the green and golden banners overhead were a canopy of glory above her who does not know the beauty of a lime avenue in the early autumn when the very air is musical with faint soughing and every leaf adds its tiny vibrating voice to the universal symphonywhen children and birds and sunshine and all young living things seem to have their own way and play in unison the girl was coming up from the river in the direction of old ranelagh and she was walking with so light and airy a step that one could have imagined it set to musicfor her feet which were very small and pretty though alas shabbily shod seemed scarcely to touch the ground she was small almost childish in stature with a thin erect little figure and a pale oval face framed in short curly hair and at first sight people always called her plain an insignificant puny little thingthat was what they said until they saw her eyesand they were the most wonderful and spirituelle eyes in the world and after that they were not so sure of the plainness for comparisons are odious and there is no hard and fast rule with respect to feminine beauty at least tastes differ and here and there a philistine might be found who would be ready to swear that dark spirituelle eyes brimful of intelligence and animation with a mirthful sparkle underneath were worth a score of pinkandwhite beauties in spite of their fine complexions and golden hair just at the end of the avenue two old pensioners were sitting and at the sight of them and at the sound of their raised voices the girl began smiling to herself then she stepped quietly across the grass picking her way daintily until only a tree divided her from the old men and there she stood shaking with silent laughter i tell you it is a lee jack there were three of them as sure as my name is fergus mcgill look hereand here the speaker rose stiffly to his feet he was a tall old man with a long grey beard and the pinnedup sleeve and the filmy look of the sightless eyes told their own tale his breast was covered with decorations and medals and in spite of his high cheekbones his massive almost gigantic figure and grand face would have become an ajax his companion was a short sturdy man with a droll physiognomy his light prominent blue eyes had the surprised look of a startled kitten and he had a trick of wrinkling his forehead as he talked until his eyebrows disappeared and when he took off his cocked hat his stubby grey hair looked as stiff as medusas crest of snakes wideawake jack was the name by which his mates accosted himin reality corporal marks he too was decorated and had a wooden leg which he found useful in conversation when emphasizing some knotty point he was tapping the ground pretty smartly at this moment as he cut himself another quid of tobacco lees he returned in a huffy voice it is the truth and nothing but the truth and ill take my oath to that but here a little peal of girlish laughter interrupted him these two old men loved each other like david and jonathan or damon and pythias or like any other noble pair of friends and would have died for each other and yet would wrangle and argue and spar fifty times a day and the chief bone of contention was a certain episodeon an indian battlefield half a lifetime before human nature is sadly faultyand even in chelsea hospital there were mischievous spirits and on cold windy nights when old bones ached and there was general dullness and the draughts made one shiver and huddle round the firethen would one or another slyly egg on sergeant mcgillor corporal markswith some such question as this was it three of them sepoys that mcgill bayoneted before he got that swordthrustor only two or perhaps more cunningly and artfully i wish i had nabbed two of those dratted sepoys like mcgill marks can tell that story best two john perks interrupted mcgill wrathfully it was three that i killed with my own hand and the third was so close to me that i could see the whites of his eyesand the devils smile on his wicked lipsand i laughed as i ran him through for i thought of those poor women and childrenand it is the goot english i am speaking for i have forgotten the gaelic i have lived so long in the land of the sassenachsnot but what the gaelic is milk and honey in the tongue that speaks it when that little mocking laugh reached their ears both the old men reddened like children discovered in a fault then they drew themselves up and saluted gravely but the girls eyes were full of mirth and mischief arent you ashamed of yourselves you two quarrelling over a silly old battle that every one else has now forgotten one would think you were heathens and not christians at all to hear you talk in that sanguinary style the girls voice was deep but very clear and full and there was a curious timbre in it that somehow lingered in ones memoryit was so suggestive of sweetness and pathos are you fery well miss ward ah it is always a good thing when one has the joke readyand sergeant mcgills tone was full of dignitybut it is not quarrelling that we are after miss wardonly a little difference of opinion yes i know but what does it matter mcgill how many of those poor wretches you killed but she might as well have spoken to the wind it was three miss ward returned mcgill obstinately and if you had seen the sight that jack and i saw you would not be calling them poor for they were the devils sons every one of them and their hearts was black as sin and it was the third man that i got by the throat and when jack came up but here the girl shrugged her shoulders and a little frown came to her face yes i know but please spare me those horrible details and then she laughed again but there were tears in her eyes i daresay there were more than three if the truth were known corporal why do you vex him with contradiction if you were in another part of the field how could you know what he did ah it is the goot english that miss ward speaks murmured mcgill but corporal marks struck in hold your tongue mcgillyou are like a woman for argifyingarglebarking as sergeant drummond calls itfrom noon to night this was how it was miss ward our company was scattered and i found myself suddenly in the corner of the ricefield where mcgill was there was a barricade of dead sepoys round him and he had his foot on one of them and had got another by the throat and then but a peremptory gesture stopped him thank you i have heard enough but i am inclined to take mcgills part for how could you see clearly in all that smoke and crowd come let us change the subject i owe you sixpence for those flowers that you brought yesterday for my sister tells me that she never paid for them no miss ward and there was no sixpence owing at all i left the flowers with my duty ah but that is nonsense corporal returned the young lady quickly i will not rob you of all your lovely flowers its not robbing miss ward replied mcgill in his soft thick voice it is a pride and pleasure to jack that you take the flowers for it is the goot friend you have been to us and the books you have read and the grand things you have told us and what are roses and dahlias compared to that well well you are a couple of dear old obstinate mules but i love you for it but please do not argue any more goodbye sergeant goodbye corporal and the girl waved her hand and again the old men saluted they are two of the most pugnacious squabbling old dears in the whole hospital she thought as she walked quickly on i wonder which of them is right neither of them will yield the point and then she smiled and nodded to a little group that she passed and indeed from that point to cleveland terrace it was almost like a royal progress so many were the greetings she received and it was good to see how the old faces brightened at the mere sight of the girl presently she stopped before one of the tall old houses in cleveland terrace and glanced up eagerly at the vinedraped balconied windows as though she were looking for some one but no face was outlined against the dingy panes then she let herself into the dim little hall with its worn linoleum from which all pattern had faded long ago and its dilapidated mahogany hatstand with two pegs missing and an odd assortment of male and female headgear on the remaining ones and then she called out mollie mollie finishing off with a shrill sweet whistle that made an unseen canary tune up lustily and the next moment another whistle quite as clear and sweet answered her and a deliciously fresh voice said i am in the studio darling and the girl with a wonderful brightness on her face ran lightly up the stairs oh what an age you have been waveney you poor dear how tired and hungry you must be and here another girl painting at a small table by the back window turned round and held out her arms when people first saw mollie ward they always said she was the most beautiful creature that they had ever seen and then they would regard waveney with a pitying look and whisper to each other how strange it was that one twin should be so handsome and the other so pale and insignificant but they were right about mollies beauty her complexion was lovely and she had irish grey eyes with dark curled lashes and brown hair with just a dash of gold in it and her mouth was perfect and so was her chin and the curves of her neck but perhaps her chief attraction was the air of bonhomie and unconsciousness and a general winsomeness that cannot be described where is father mollie asked waveney but her eyes looked round the room a little anxiously ah i see the picture has gone and then a look of sorrowful understanding passed between the sisters yes he has taken it almost whispered mollie but he will not be back yet ann is outshe has gone to see her mother so i must go and get your tea noel is downstairs and indeed at that moment a cracked boyish voice could be heard singing the latest street melody and murdering it in fine style mollie rose from her chair rather slowly as she spoke and thenah the pity of itone saw she was lamenot actually lame so as to require crutches but as she walked she dragged one leg and the awkward ungraceful gait gave people a sort of shock mollie never grew used to her painful infirmity though she had had it from a child it was the result of accident and bad treatment a sinew had contracted and made one leg shorter than the other so that she lurched ungracefully as she walked once in the night waveney had awakened with her sobbing and had taken her in her warm young arms to comfort her what is it mollie darling she had asked trembling from head to foot with sympathy and pity it means that i am a goose mollie had answered but i could not help it waveney i was dreaming that i was at a ball and some one quite a grandlooking man in uniform had asked me to dance and the band was playing that lovely new waltz that noel is always whistling and we were whirling round and roundah it was delicious and then something woke me and i remembered that i should never never dance as long as i live or run or play tennis or do any of the dear delightful things that other girls do and here poor mollie wept afresh and waveney cried too out of passionate love and pity mollie did not often have these weak moments for she was a bright creature and disposed to make the best of things every one had something to bear she would say with easy philosophyit was her cross the crook in her lot the thorn in her side one must not expect only roses and sunshine she would add but indeed very few roses had as yet strewn the twins path when mollie had lumbered out of the room waveney folded her arms behind her and paced slowly up and down as though she were thinking out some problem that refused to be solved it was really two rooms divided at one time by foldingdoors but these had been taken away long ago it was a nondescript sort of apartment half studio and half sittingroom and bore traces of family occupation an empty easel and several portfolios occupied one front window in the other near the fireplace was a round table strewn with study books and workbaskets mollies painting table was in the inner room a big comfortablelooking couch and two easy chairs gave an air of cosiness and comfort but the furniture was woefully shabby and the only attempt at decoration was a picturesquelooking red jar in which corporal marks flowers were arranged presently waveney stopped opposite the empty easel and regarded it ruefully it will only be another disappointment she said to herself with a sigh poor father poor dear father and he works so hard too something must be done we are getting poorer and poorer and noel has such an appetite what is the use of living in our own house and pretending that we are well off and respectable and all that and we are in debt to the butcher and the coalmerchant and it is not fathers fault for he does all he can and it is only because he loves us so that he hates us to work and then she sat down on the couch as though she were suddenly tired and stared dumbly at the vineleaves twinkling in the sunshine and her lips were closed firmly on each other as though she had arrived at some sudden resolution chapter ii monsieur blackie it would be argument for a week laughter for a month and a good jest forever a corinthian a lad of metal a good boyking henry iv a shrill earpiercing series of whistles of a peculiarly excruciating description broke in upon waveneys meditation she shook herself frowned ran her fingers through her short curly hair thereby causing it to wave more wildly than everthen ran downstairs the ground floor room corresponded with the one aboveonly the folding doors had not been removed and over them in a schoolboys round hand roughly painted in red and gold was noel ward his study with a pleasing and serpentine ornamentation embellishing the inscription in vain had mollie with tears in her eyes implored her father to obliterate the unsightly record an amused shake of the head only answered her leave it alone he would say it is only a nursery legend and does no harmwhen noel evolves another original idea it will be time to erase it and so noel ward his study still sprawled in ungainly characters over the lintel as waveney entered the room with rather an offended air she saw the youthful student standing in the doorway he was a tall thin stripling of fifteenbut looked older perhaps because he wore spectacles and had classical wellcut features and an odd trick of projecting his chin and lifting his head as though he were always on the lookout for celestial objects but notwithstanding this eccentricity and a cracked and somewhat highpitched voice the heir of the wards was certainly a goodly youth well old storm and stress he observed with a derisive grin as he balanced himself skilfully on his heels between the foldingdoors so the pibroch roused you pibroch returned his sister wrathfully how often have i told you you bad boy that you are not to make this horrible din caterwauling is music compared to it or even a bagpipe out of tune it was my best and latest work returned noel regarding the ceiling disconsolately a farmyard symphony with roulades and variations of the most realistic and spirited description and would bring the house down at a penny reading at present we had only reached the braying solobut the chorus of turkeycocks with peacock movement would have created a sensation they have returned mollie stealing softly behind him and treating him to a smart box on the ears but noel merely pinned her hands in a firm grasp and went on with his subject little interruptions of this sort did not disturb him in the least he rather liked them than otherwise nothing pleased him better than to get a rise out of his sisters for whatever virtues he possessed he certainly lacked the bump of veneration dear sweet mollie with her angelic face was often addressed as old stickinthemud pegtop or the wobbly one while waveney his special chum the creature whom he loved best in the world next to his father was storm and stress a singular soubriquet evolved from her name and her sudden and sprightly movements for one is nearly blown away he would say there is always a breeze through the house when that girl is in it it is like playing a scale upside down and wrong side outwards to hear her coming downstairs and very often he would come to his meals with his collar up and flourishing a red silk handkerchief ostentatiously and speak in a croaking nasal voice until his father asked him mildly where he had caught such a cold and then waveney would nudge him furiously under the table on the present occasion poor mollie was kept in durance vile until noel had finished his disquisition on his novel symphony then he released her and contemplated the teatable with a fixed and glassy stare which conveyed mute reproach noel dear it is a fresh loaf she said hastily and apprehensively and it is beautifully crusty and the butter is gooda penny a pound dearer and at the best shop where are the shrimps asked noel and he so lengthened the word that it sounded almost as terribly in mollies ears as mrs siddons give me the dagger for so much depends on expression and if one is only melodramatic even the words shrimps can be as sibilant and aggressive as the hissing of snakes oh dear how tiresome you are noel returned mollie quite sharply for her for she was housekeeper and the strain and responsibility were overwhelming at times especially when her poor little purse was empty i could not afford them really noel she continued welling into tenderness at the thought of his disappointment there were some nice brown ones but i dared not get them for i had only twopence left so i bought watercresses instead ask a blessing my child and i will forgive you and then much to his sisters relief noel subsided and began cutting the bread while under cover of the tablecloth waveney slipped sixpence into mollies hand and made a movement with her lips suggestive of tomorrow and mollie nodded as she poured out the tea noel had a volume of eugene aram propped up before him as he ate but it did not engross him so utterly that he could not interpolate the conversation whenever he pleased and it pleased him to do so very often mollie was giving a graphic and heartbreaking account of the way in which she and her father had packed the precious picture and how it had been bumped three times while they carried it down the narrow stairs i quite missed the dear old thing wave she went on and the studio looked so dull without it noel was so absurd he threw an old shoe after it for good luck and it nearly knocked fathers hat offand then he bolted indoors and there was father looking at me so astonished and he was not quite pleased i could see that so i said it is not me dad it is the other boy yes and it was real mean of you grumbled noel but there what are you to expect from a woman poor old padre he will be precious tired with hauling along king canute and it will bump all the worse going upstairs oh noel exclaimed both the girls in a shrill crescendo of dismay you dont really believe that the dealers will refuse king canute ejaculated mollie father has worked so hard at it and it is really his best picture noel shrugged his shoulders then he pointed his chin in an argumentative way the dealers buy awful rubbish sometimes but they wont buy this every kid knows how the old buffer gave his courtiers a lesson but no one wants to be always looking on while he does it the public hates that sort of thing you know i told father so over and over again but he would not listen why dont you try something lively and less historical i said to him the two gravediggers in hamlet or touchstone and audrey we might get corporal marks to sit for touchstonethe public would think that fetching but no nothing but that solemn old dane would suit himthe wards are terribly obstinate i am my fathers son and speak feelingly and then noel shouldered his book and marched back to the study do you think noel is right whispered mollie he is very clever for all his ridiculous nonsense and i am not quite sure whether king canute will really interest people oh dont ask me returned waveney in an exasperated tone if only dear father would stick to his schools and his drawingclasses and not try to paint these pictures they seem grand to us but they are not really well done dont you remember mr fullarton said so we were in the back room but we heard him plainly you are too ambitious wardthat was what he said the public is tired of these old hackneyed subjects why dont you hit on something pathetic and suggestivesome fetching little incident that tells its own story child and st bernard dog for example returned father grimly and write under it nellies guardian would that do fullarton but i suppose anything would do for potboilers oh yes i recollect returned mollie with a longdrawn sigh poor old dad how low he seemed that day and this evening if but waveney would not let her finish the sentence never mind that just now it is no use crossing the bridge till you come to it let us go upstairs and be cosy for i have a lot i want to say to you and then they went up arminarmmollie was almost a head taller than her sisterand sat down side by side on the big couch and then waveney began to laugh oh mollie i have had such an adventure i did not want noel to hear it because he would have teased me so unmercifully dont you recollect that horrid notebook that we found and then at the recollection mollie began to giggle and finally both she and waveney became so hysterical with suppressed mirth that they had almost to stifle themselves in the cushions for fear noel should hear them for it was only lately that they had become acquainted with the dark and machiavellian policy of that artful youth evening after evening as they had exchanged their girlish confidences noel had sat by them with a stolid and abstracted look apparently drawing penandink devilsa favourite amusement of his but it was mollie who found him out the adventures of waveney edna ward alias storm and stress was scrawled on the titlepage and thereupon followed a series of biographical sketches profusely illustrated storm and stress with the bull of bashana singularly graphic description of waveneys terror at meeting an angry cow in the lane no iistorm and stress saving an orphans lifethe orphan being a deserted halfstarved kitten now an elderly cat rejoicing in the name of mrs muggins and so on every little incident touched up or finely caricatured in a masterly manner pere ward had been so charmed with this manifestation of his sons talent that he had carried off the notebook and locked it up amongst his treasures that boy will make his mark he would say proudly but we must give him plenty of scope and indeed it could not be denied that noel had a fairly long tether as soon as waveney could recover herself she sat up and rebuked mollie severely for her levity for how is a person to talk while you are cackling in that ridiculous manner and it is really quite an interesting adventure andwith an important airit is to be continued in our next and this sounded so mysterious that mollie wiped her eyes and consented to be serious well you know began waveney in a delightfully colloquial manner father had told me to take the omnibus that would put me down at kings street all the outside places were taken but there was only the usual fat woman with bundle and baby inside and presently a gentleman got in you know i always make a point of noticing my fellow passengers as dad says it helps to form a habit of observation so i at once took stock of our solitary gentleman he was a little dark man very swarthy and foreign looking and he wore an oddlyshaped peaked sort of hatrather like guy fawkes without the featherand he had a black moustache that was very stiff and fierce so of course i made up my mind that he was a frenchman and probably an artist for though his clothes were good he had rather a bohemian look here waveney paused but mollie gave her a nudge go on wave i am beginning to feel interested was he really french not a bit of it my dear for he talked the most beautiful english and directly he opened his mouth i found out he was a gentleman for his voice was perfectly cultured and so pleasant i rather took to him because he was so kind to the fat woman he held her bundle while she and her baby got out and he scolded the conductor for hurrying her i thought that rather nice of him so few young men trouble themselves about fat women and babies oh he was young in an appreciative tone well youngish two or three and thirty perhaps but now i am coming to the critical point of my story directly we were left alone the conductor came to ask for our fares he was a surlylooking man with a red face and his manner was not over civil most likely he resented the scolding about the fat woman well no sooner had monsieur put his hand in his pocket than he drew it out again with a puzzled look some one has picked my pocket he said out loud but he did not look so very much disturbed my sovereign purse has gone and some loose silver as well and then he searched his other pockets and only produced a cardcase and some papers and then he began to laugh in rather an embarrassed way my good fellow you see how it is the beggars have cleaned me out five or six pounds gone confound those lightfingered gentry if i had not left my watch at the makers it would have gone too that is all very well returned the conductor in a disagreeable voice but what i wants to know sir is how am i to get my fare oh you will get it right enough replied monsieur but he was not monsieur at all only the name suited him but for the present i can only offer you my card and then he held it out with such a pleasant smile that it might have softened halfadozen conductors but old surly face was not so easily mollified i dont want your bit of pasteboard he growled do you call yourself a gentleman to ride in a public conveyance without paying your fare then the motto of the wards flashed into my mind open hand good luck and the next minute i produced a sixpence from my pursethere were just two sixpences in it will you allow me to offer you this i said in my grandest manner but i felt a little taken aback when he lifted his hat and beamed at me i say beamed for it was really the most friendly jovial smile his whole face quite crinkled up with it i could not refuse such a good samaritan a thousand thanks for your kind loan there sir handing over the sixpence sternly give me the change and next time keep a civil tongue in your head and then greatly to my surprise he pocketed the threepence i am in your debt for a whole sixpence he continued and i am as grateful to you as though you had returned my missing sovereigns is it not kingsley who points out the beauty and grace of helping lame dogs over stiles now will you add to your kindness by informing me of your name and address i stared at him blankly and i am afraid i blushed there is no occasion i said feebly at last sixpence is not a great sum and i was very glad to be of service for i could not help feeling how absurd it was making so much of a trifle but monsieur seemed indignant at this i could not be in debt to any young lady even for sixpence he said severely i was too well brought up for that and then of course i was obliged to tell him where i lived and he actually made me repeat it twice he was so anxious to remember it miss ward cleveland terrace chelsea he observed why that is just opposite the hospital i know it well strange to say i am staying in chelsea myself then he took out his cardcase hesitated and grew rather red and finally put it back in his pocket my name is ingram he said rather abruptly and then the omnibus stopped and he handed me out i must be in your debt until tomorrow i fear were his parting wordsand oh mollie do you really think that he will actually call and pay the sixpence of course he will and of course he ought returned mollie excitedly oh wave what an adventure it was just like a bit in a novel when the hero meets the heroineonly an omnibus is the last place for a romance then waveney made a face no no mollie little dark frenchified men are not my taste even if they have nice voices my private hero must be very different from monsieur blackie then a crackling laugh from behind the sofa made both the girls jump up in affright and the next moment waveney looked not unlike her soubriquet as uttering dire threats of vengeance she flew round and round the room after the treacherous eavesdropper until noel exhausted by laughter subsided into a corner and submitted to be shaken monsieur blackie to be continued in our next exclaimed the incorrigible lad when waveney grew weary with her punitive exertions my word there must be a new notebook for this storm and stress enacting the part of good samaritan and here noel fairly crowed himself out of the room he has heard every word observed waveney in a dejected tone i am afraid we laughed too loud and that roused his curiosity oh dear what a boy he is and none of us keep him in order but mollie was too exhausted to answer her chapter iii king canute comes back care to our coffin adds a nail no doubt and every grin so merry draws one out john walcot and nature swears the lovely dears her noblest work she classes o her prentice han she tried on man and then she made the lasses o burns as the soft september twilight stole over the room the girls became more silent waveney seemed buried in thought and mollie tired out with laughing nestled against her comfortably and very nearly went to sleep but she was roused effectually by waveneys next speech sweethearther pet name for molliei am going to make you miserable i am afraid but i have been telling myself all day long that we must face the situation if father does not get a good price for his picture what are we to do but he must sell it returned mollie in a distressed voice barker is getting disagreeable about his bill and his man says nasty things to ann when he leaves the meat and we owe chandler for two tons of coal yes i know and waveney sighed heavily those two tons have been on my mind all day you poor dear no wonder you looked tired ah how hateful and mean it is to be poor ah you are not as wicked and rebellious as i am wave i sometimes cry with the longing for the pretty things other girls have i cannot resign myself to the idea of being shabby and pinched and careworn all my life long if this goes on we shall be old women before our time when i am ordering dinner i feel nearly a hundred waveney stroked the glossy brown head that rested against her shoulder but made no other answer she was thinking how she could best break some unwelcome news to mollie mollie was emotional and cried easily and her father always hated to see one of his girls unhappy father would cut the moon up into little pieces and give them to us if he could she thought nothing is too good for us but when mollie frets he takes it so to heart oh dear if only doing ones duty were made easier but there is no learning or reading without tears in the handbook of life and then she set her little white teeth together firmly as a child does when some nauseous medicine is offered mollie dear i cannot keep it back any longerit makes me miserable to have a secret from you i have been to harley street today and talked to miss warburton and she has something on her books that is likely to suit me then the sob she dreaded to hear rose to poor mollies lips ah wave you cant really mean it this is worst of all it is positively dreadful how am i to live without you and father and noel what are they to do and here the tears rolled down her face but waveney who had been schooling herself all day refused to be moved from her stoicism mollie please listen to me it is childish to cry do you remember our last talkthe one we had in the lime walk and how we agreed that we must do all we could to help father but i do help him returned mollie in a woebegone voice i keep the house and mend things and look after that stupid clumsy ann and the fineart publishers seem to like my little drawings and i am never idle for a single instant no darling you put us all to shame do you think i am finding fault with you but you must not do it all that is just it and as mrs addison no longer requires me i must look out for another situationfor during the past year waveney had acted as secretary to a lady living near them in cheyne walk it had only been a morning engagement and the pay had not been much but waveney and mollie too had found immense pleasure in spending the scanty earnings of course i know you must do something returned mollie rather irritably for even her sweet nature resented the idea of losing waveney as an insufferable injury but you might find something in chelsea no dear returned waveney gently i have tried over and over again and i can find nothing suitable i cannot teachi have never been educated for a governess and no one near us seems to want a secretary or reader or companion are you quite sure of that waveney quite sure i have been wasting two whole months waiting for something to turn up so this morning i made up my mind that i would see miss warburton she was so nice mollie she is such a dear woman a little quick and decided in her mannerwhat some people would call abruptbut when she gets interested in a person she is really quite soft and kind she heard all i had to say asked me a few questions and then turned to her book it is rather a lucky chance you came in this morning miss ward she said for a lady who called yesterday is in want of a young person who can read well and then she explained to me that this ladys sister was troubled at times with some weakness in her eyes that prevented her from reading to herself especially of an evening and that they required some pleasant ladylike girl who would make herself useful in little ways and the name waveney the name is harford and they live at the red house erpingham they are very nice people but at the present moment she is staying with some friends in berkeley square and she will interview me there oh dear you speak as though everything were settled no indeed no such luck miss warburton was very kind very sympathetic and anxious to help me but she advised me not to set my heart on it for fear i should be disappointed miss harford may think you too youngyes i know as i was about to protest indignantly at thisyou are really nineteen but no one would think you were over seventeen isnt it humiliating mollie that strangers will always think i am a child if only my hair would grow and not curl over my head in this absurd way people always take you for the eldest and you are to see miss harford tomorrow yes dear and you must get noel to throw another old shoe after me for luck then her lip trembled and her eyes grew misty dear do not make it harder for me than you can help dont you know how i hate to leave my old sweetheart i would rather stay at home and live on bread and water than fare sumptuously in other folks houses i feel as though i should die with homesickness and ennui oh it is no crying matter i assure you it is the rack and the thumbscrew and the burning faggots all in one and if you want a new martyr for the calendar and have any spare halos on hand i am your woman and then of course mollie did as she was expected to do left off crying and began to laugh in the manner that often made her father call her his wild irish girl and indeed there was something very irish in mollies mercurial and impressionable temperament the next minute their attention was attracted by strange noises from below something heavy was being dragged along the passage accompanied by extraordinary sibilant sounds resembling the swishing and hissing of an ostler rubbing down a horse both the girls seemed to recognise the sounds for waveney frowned and bit her lip and mollie said in a troubled tone oh it is poor old canute come back and then they ran into the passage and looked over the balusters noel and a little fair man in a shabby velveteen coat were hauling a large picture between them with much apparent difficulty one end had got jammed in the narrow staircase and noels encouraging swishes and whoa theresteady old man keep your pecker up and dont kick over the traces might have been addressed to a skittish mare then he looked up and winked at his sisters and almost fell backwards in his attempt to feign excessive joy hurrah three cheers here we are againlarge as life and as heavy as the fat woman in mrs jarleys waxworks but whats the odds as long as you are happy as the lobster said as he walked into the pot hold your tongue noel returned his father goodnaturedly it is your fault the confounded thing has got wedged keep it straight and we shall manage it well enough and then he looked up at the two faces above him there you are my darlings he said nodding to them you see i am bringing our old friend back we will have him up directly if only this young jackanapes will leave off his monkey tricks and then in a singularly sweet tenor voice he chanted you hear that boy laughing you think it is fun but the angels laugh too at the good he has done the children laugh loud as they troop to his call and the poor man that knows him laughs loudest of all oliver wendell holmes whispered mollie but waveney made no answer she only ran down a few steps and gallantly put her shoulder to the wheel and after a few more tugs king canute was safely landed in the studio where noel executed a wardance round him with many a wild whoop after the manner of redskins father dear whispered mollie in a delightfully coaxing voice sit down on grumps while i make your coffee for the ward family being somewhat original gave queer names to their belongings and since they were children the old couch had been called grumps tired hands and tired limbs and aching hearts always finding it a comfortable refuge so i will dear returned mr ward and then both the girls hung about him and kissed him and mollie brushed back his hair and put a rose in his buttonhole but waveney only sat down beside him and held his hand silently there was no difficulty in discovering where noel got his good looks in his youth everard ward had been considered so handsome that artists had implored him to sit to them and for many years wellprincipled heads of girls colleges feared to engage him as drawingmaster and even now in spite of the tired eyes and careworn expression and the haggardness brought on by the tension of overwork and late hours the face was almost perfect only the fair hair had worn off the forehead and was becoming a little greypepper and salt mollie called it but the thing that struck strangers most was his air of refinement in spite of his shabby coat and old hat no one could deny that he was a gentleman and in this they were right everard ward was a man who if he had mixed in society would have made many friends in the old days he had been dearly loved and greatly admired but just when his prospects were brightest and the future seemed gilded with success he suddenly took the bit between his teeth and boltednot down hill his mothers sweet memory and his own dignity prevented thatbut across country down side roads that had no thoroughfare and which landed him in bogs of difficulty for in spite of his soft heart and easy goodnature everard was always offending people his wealthy godfather for example when he refused to take orders and to be inducted into a family living and again his sole remaining relative an uncle who wished him to go into the war office life is an awful muddle he would say sometimes but in reality he made his own difficulties his last act of youthful madness was when he left the stock exchange where an old friend of his father had given him a berth and had joined a set of young artistic bohemians at that time he was supposed by his friends to be on the brink of an engagement to an heiress he had seemed warmly attached to her until at a ball he met dorothy sinclair and fell desperately in love with her this was his crowning act of madness and when he married her his friends shook their heads disapprovingly and said to each other that that fool of a ward had done for himself now why the fellow must be imbecile to throw away a fortune and a good sort of woman like that to marry a pretty little girl without a penny for her dower and indeed though dorothy was a lovely young creature and as good and lovable as her own mollie she was the last woman everard ought to have married the heiress would have made a man of him and he would have spent her money royally and been the best of husbands to her but dorothy lacked backbone she was one of those soft weak women who need a strong arm to lean upon and so when the children came and the cold cold blast of adversity began to blow upon them when everard could not sell his pictures and poverty stared them in the facethen she lost heart and courage everard dearest i have not been the right wife for you she said once for that long fatal illness taught her many things oh i see it all so much more clearly now i have disheartened you when you needed encouragement and when our troubles came i did not bear them well you have been the sweetest wife in the world to me was his answer and then dorothy had smiled at him well pleased yes he had been her true lover and he was her lover to the last and when she died leaving three young children to his care everard ward mourned for her as truly as any man could do those were terrible years for him that followed his wifes death his twin girls were only ten years old and noel a palefaced urchin of five he never quite knew how he lived through them but necessity goaded him to exertion he worked doggedly all day long coming home whenever it was possible to take his meals with the children sometimes some kindhearted schoolmistress would tell him to bring one of his little girls with him and this was always a redletter day for waveney and mollie for the poor little things led a dull life until everard was able to send them to dayschool and after that they were quite happy he used to watch them sometimes as they went down the street with their satchel of books waveney would be dancing along like a fairy child with little springy jumps and bounds as though the sunshine intoxicated her and mollie would hurry after her limping and lurching in her haste with her golden brown hair streaming over her shoulders and her sweet innocent face lifted smilingly to every passerby my sweet moll she is her mothers image everard would say to himself and his eyes would be a little dim for with all his faults and troubles and idiosyncrasies no father was more devoted his twin daughters were the joy and pride of his heart when he came home at night tired out with a long days work the very sound of their voices as he put the latchkey in the door seemed to refresh and invigorate him heres dad heres dear old dad they would cry running out to meet him and then they would kiss and cuddle him and purr over him like warm soft young kittens noel would pull off his boots and bring him his slippers and then grumps would be dragged up to the fire and ann would be ordered to bring up the tea quick and then they would all wait on him as though he were a decrepit old man and noel who was a humorist even at that early age would pretend to be a waiter and say yessir and no sir and next thing sir with an old rag of a towel on his arm to represent a napkin i saw ward the other evening a friend of his said one day to a lady he teaches drawing at welbeck college where i take the literature classes so i often see him and one evening he took me home with him to cleveland terrace poor old ward he was not cut out for a drawing master he was always a bit flighty and full of whimsies and used to fly his kite too high in the old days but he made a fool of himself you know with that unlucky marriage indeed returned the lady quietly ah well that is all ancient history he has made his bed poor fellow and must just lie on it but i do so hate seeing a mans career marred especially if he is a good sort like ward and you went home with him observed his hearer in the same quiet tone yes and upon my word it was really a pretty little family picture there was ward looking like a sleepy adonis with his fair hair rumpled all over his head and two sweet little girls hanging on each arm and cooing over him and that fine boy of his lying on the rug with a picture i declare my snug bachelor rooms looked quite dull that night when anything ailed one of the twins everards misery would have touched the most stony heart when mollie had measles he nursed her night and day and when waveney and noel also sickened he was so worn out that if a kindly friend had not come to his assistance he would soon have been on a sickbed happily it was holiday time and there were no schools or classes miss martin was a governess herself but with the divine selfabnegation of a goodhearted woman she gave up a pleasant visit to a country house to help poor mr wardwomen were always doing that sort of thing for everard ward but her little patients gave her a great deal of trouble mollie cried and would not take her medicine from anyone but father and waveney was pettish but noel was the worst of all miss martin was plainfeatured and wore spectacles and noel who inherited his fathers love of beauty objected to her strongly go away he said fretfully we dont want no frights in goggles and he began to roar so lustily that everard was roused from his sleep and came pale and weary and dishevelled to expostulate with his son and heir but noel who was feverish and uncomfortable repeated his offence we dont want no frights here dad tell her to go for shame noel returned his father sternly i am quite shocked at you this kind lady has come to help us and dont you know my boy that to a gentleman all women are beautiful please dont scold him mr ward returned miss martin goodnaturedly but her sallow face was a little flushed noel and i will soon be good friends it is only the fever makes him fractious and as tact and good temper generally win the day the children soon got very fond of their dear marty as they called her and as they grew up she became their most valued friend and adviser until her death it was miss martin whose sensible arguments overcame everards rooted aversion to the idea of his girls working as long as i live i will work for them he would say but miss martin stuck to her point gallantly life is so uncertain mr ward an accident any day might prevent you from earning your breadyou will forgive me for speaking plainly let them work while they are young but though everard owned himself convinced by her arguments it was a bitter day to him when waveney became mrs addisons secretary father would cut the moon up in little bits and give them to us waveney had said to herself and indeed to the fond foolish fellow no gift could have been too precious for those cherished darlings of his heart everard always told people that he loved them just alike and he honestly thought so and yet if waveneys finger ached it seemed to pain him all over and all the world knows what that means chapter iv the ward family at home and the night shall be filled with music and the cares that infest the day shall fold their tents like the arabs and as silently steal away longfellow as soon as mollie had left the room on household cares intent waveney lighted a small shaded lamp that stood on the table it was a warm evening and both the windows were thrown up the moon had just risen and the vineleaves that festooned the balcony had silver edges as waveney turned up the lamp she said cheerfully now we can see each others faces and then she sat down again and slipped her hand in her fathers arm tell me all about it dad directly minute and then a smile came to mr wards tired face for this was one of the family stock jokes that were never stale never anything but delightful and fresh and whenever one of his girls said it it brought back waveney in her baby days a tiny despot in red shoes with a head brimming over with curls stamping her little feet and calling out in shrill treble directly minute miss baby wont wait nohow there is nothing good to hear little girl returned mr ward with a strained laugh when you spell failure spell it with a big f my dear thats all but another skilful question or two soon drew forth the whole story he had had a harassing disappointing day the dealers who had sold one or two of his smaller pictures refused to give king canute houseroom they could not possibly dispose of such a picture they said it was too large and cumbersome and there were serious defects in it one or two of the figures were out of drawing the waves were too solid looking like molten lead there was no finesse no delicacy of execution the colouring was crude in fact the criticism had been scathing they were so rough on me that my back was up at last went on mr ward and when wilkes said i might leave it if i liked and he would try and get a customer for it i saw he was only letting me down a bit easier and that he did not believe it would sell so i just called a cab and brought it back waveney winced all this cab hire could not be afforded and then what were they to do but the next moment she was stroking the worn coatsleeve tenderly and her voice was as cheerful as ever dad it is a long lane that has no turningremember that and it is no use fretting over spilt milk tomorrow we will get noel to hang up dear old king canute in that blank space and if the stupid cantankerous old dealers will not have anything to say to him mollie and i will admire him every day of our lives molten lead indeed jerking her chin contemptuously but mr ward who had been too much crushed to revive at once only shook his head and sighed in his heart he knew the dealers were right and that the work was not really well done the stormy sunset looked blotchy and unreal and the solidity of the water was apparent even to him the whole thing was faulty mawkish amateurish and futile he had been in a perfect rage against himself the dealers and all the rest of the world as he clambered into his cab he had had a rap upon the knuckles once too often well he had learnt his lesson at last but what a fool and dunce he had been take your punishment my boy he had said to himself grimly write yourself everard ward ua unmitigated ass and wear your fools cap with a jaunty air you wanted to paint a big historical picture to be something better than a drawingmaster oh you oaf you dotard you old driveller to think that you could set the thames on fire that you could do something to keep your memory fresh and green go back to your watercolour landscapes to your waterwheels and cottages your porches smothered in woodbine you are at the bottom of your class my lad and there you will be to the end of the chapter and thenfor his imagination was very vividhe saw himself an elderly man in his shabby greatcoat going out all weathers to his schoolsa little shrunk a little more hopeless and his girls his twin blessingsbut here the hot tears rose to his eyes and he bit his lips oh it was hard hardand it was for their sakes he had worked and toiled just then mollie came with a little tray there was a tall curious old china cup on it which was known in the family as dives and was considered one of their choicest treasures when any one was ill the sight of dives filled to the brim with fragrant coffee or delicious chocolate would bring a smile to pale lips as she placed the tray beside her father mollies face wore a triumphant air as though she would have said if any one could beat that cup of coffee or make better toast i should like to see her thats all thanks dearest returned her father gently but you have scorched your face my sweet moll oh that is nothing returned mollie hastily putting up her hands to her hot cheeks she had been through all sorts of vicissitudes during the last halfhour the water would not boil or the fire burn properly though she and noel had put a whole bundle of sticks into it and at every stick he had asked her a fresh conundrum have you told dad about monsieur blackie she asked and then waveney smiled no but i will presently when father has had his supper come out on the balcony a moment mollie is not the moonlight lovely yes i do love these white nights returned mollie ecstatically we used to call them silver nights when we were wee children those roofs look as though they were covered with snow and just see how nice our shabby old courtyard looks those privets are quite grand what an old dear the moon is wave she covers up all little defects so nicely and glorifies all common things but waveney did not hear this little rhapsody neither had she called mollie out to watch moonlight effects moll just listen to me a moment you must not say a word to father about harley streetnot one word mollie looked at her blankly and why not wave oh dear not for worlds returned waveney earnestly he is so low so unlike himself tonight he had so set his heart on that poor old thing being a success but they have all been throwing stones at him and he is so hurt about it dont you know what noel always says you must not hit a man who is down those are school ethics but it is true dad is just like the brere rabbit tonighthim lies lowand we must just talk to him and make him laugh but wave surelyand mollie who was nothing but a big beautiful simple child looked quite shockedsurely you cannot mean to see that lady without speaking to father but i do mean it mollie of course i want to tell fatheri always long to tell him everythingbut it would be rank selfishness tonight it would be the last straw that terrible straw that breaks the camels back and i know just what he would do he would not smoke his pipe and he would not sleep a wink and he would be like a wreck tomorrow when he goes to norwood no when it is settled it will be time enough to tell him and as usual mollie submitted to her sisters stronger will waveney was the clever one she would say she saw things more clearly and she was generally right for mollie thought nothing of herself and was always covered with blushes and confusion if any one praised her so waveney had her way and as mr ward smoked his pipe she told him all about monsieur blackie and then noel shut up his lessonbooks and came up stairs and the three young people sang little glees and songs unaccompanied and presently mr ward laid down his empty pipe and joined too and the girls voices were so fresh and clear and the mans tenor so sweet that a passerby stood for a long time to listen every now and then an odd boyish voice with a crack in it chimed in like a jangling bell out of tune oh noel please do not sing so out of tune you are as flat as a pancake and as rough as a nutmeg grater isnt he moll and then waveney made a face at the unfortunate minstrel dont come the peacock over me began noel wrathfully for any remark on his cracked voice tried his temper hit one of your own size miss hush hush noel observed his father goodhumouredly you will do well enough some day drink to me only with thine eyeslet us sing that my pets and then the voices began again and the listener underneath the window smiled to himself and walked on it was late and mollie was yawning before the little concert was over but when mr ward went to his room that night the weight of oppression seemed less heavy yes he had been a fool but most men made mistakes in their lives and he was not so old yetonly fortyfour for he had married young he would leave off straining after impossibilities and take his friends advicepaint pot boilers in his leisure hours and devote his best energies to his pupils cincinnatus went back to the plough and why not everard ward and then he wound up his watch and went to sleep but long after the heavyfooted ann had climbed up to her attic breathing heavily and carrying the old black cat mrs muggins in her arms and long after mollie had fallen into her first sleep and was dreaming sweetly of a leafy wood where primroses grew as plentifully as blackberries a little white figure sat huddled up on the narrow windowseat staring out absently on the moonlight waveney could see the dim roofs of the hospital the old men were all now asleep in their cabinlike cubiclessome of them fighting their battles over again others dreaming of wives and children after all it must be nice to be old and to know that the fight is over thought the girl a little sadly life is so difficult sometimes when we were children we did not think so i suppose other girls would have said we had rather a dull life but how happy we were what grand times we had that day at the zoological gardens for example and that christmas when father took us to the pantomime i remember the next day mollie and i made up our minds to be balletdancers and noel decided to be a clown and here waveney gave a soft little laugh dear father it was so good of him not to laugh at us most people would have called us silly children but he listened to us quite seriously and recommended us to practise our dancing sedulously only he would not hear of shortening our skirtshe said later on would do for that oh dear oh dear was it not just like him and of course by the next christmas we had forgotten all about it but even these reminiscences amusing as they were could not long hinder waveneys painful reflections the idea of leaving home and going out into the world was utterly repugnant to her she had told mollie in playful fashion that it was the rack and the thumbscrew and the faggots combined but in reality the decision had cost her a bitter struggle and nothing but the strongest sense of duty could have nerved her to the effort waveneys nature was far less emotional than mollies but her affections were very deep her love for her father and twin sister amounted to passion when she read the words little children keep yourselves from idols she always held her breath made a mental reservation and went on if only people liked fathers pictures she sighed and then another pang crossed her as she remembered his tired face how old and careworn he had looked until they had sung some of his favourite songs and then his eyes had become bright again dear old dad how he will miss me but when she thought of mollie the lump in her throat seemed to strangle her they had never in their lives been parted for a single night and yet it is my duty to go thought poor waveney we are growing poorer every day and it will be years before noel can earn much i am afraid the schools are falling off a little oh yes there is no doubt about it and i must go and waveney shed a few tears and then chilled and depressed she got into bed and mollie turned over in her sleep and threw out her warm young arms it was delicious she murmured drowsily and oh wave why are you so cold darling what have you been doing but waveney only shivered a little and kissed her the next morning both the girls rose in good time to prepare the early breakfast noel always left home at half past eightlong ago an unknown friend of mr wards had offered to pay his sons school fees and acting on advice he had sent the boy to st pauls he was a clever lad and in favour with all his masters he liked work and never shirked it but his pet passion was football he was fond of enlarging on his triumphs and gloried in the kicks he received it was understood in the family circle that he was to get a scholarship and go to oxford and of course a fellowship would follow the veiled prophet will expect it my dear mollie would say at intervals when she was afraid he was becoming slack for under this figure of speech they always spoke of their unknown benefactor the whole thing was a mystery the solicitor who wrote to mr ward only mentioned his client vaguelyan old friend of mr wards is desirous of doing him this service and in succeeding letters my client has desired me to send you this cheque and so on the girls and noel who were dying with curiosity often begged their father to go to lincolns inn and see mr duncanthe firm of duncan son was a good oldfashioned firm but mr ward always declined to do this if his old friend did not choose to divulge himself he had some good reason for his reticence and it would be ungrateful and bad form to force his hand he is a good soul you may depend on that was all they could get him to say but in reality he secretly puzzled over it it must be some friend of dorothys he would say to himself there was that old lover of hers who went out to the bahamas and made his pilehe married but he never had any children i do not mention his name to the youngstersbetter not i think but i have a notion it is carstairs he was a melancholy quixotic sort of chap and he was desperately gone on dorothy dads a bit stiff about the prophet noel once said to his sisters but if i am in lucks way and get a scholarship i shall just go up to lincolns inn myself and interview the old buffer and this seemed so venturesome and terrifying a project that mollie gasped and said oh no not really noel and waveney opened her eyes a little widely you bet i do returned noel cocking his chin in a lordly way i shall just march in as cool as a cucumber and as bold as brass i have come to thank my unknown benefactor sir i would say with my finest air for the good education i have received i have the satisfaction of telling you that i have gained a scholarshipeighty pounds a yearand that with the kind permissionofof my occult and mysterious friend i wish to matriculate at balliol as i have now attained the age of manhood is it too much to ask the name of my venerable benefactor oh wave is he not ridiculous laughed mollie but waveney looked at her young brother rather gravely dont noel dear father would not like it but noel only shrugged his shoulders at this he had his own opinions about things and when he made up his mind it was very difficult to move him never were father and son more unlike and yet they were the best of friends mr ward always had a hard days work on tuesday he had two schools at norwood and never came home until evening the girls always took extra pains with the breakfasttable on the norwood days and while mollie made the coffee boiled the eggs and superintended the toastmaking waveney made up dainty little pats of butter and placed them on vineleaves then she went into the narrow little slip of garden behind the house and gathered a late rose and laid it on her fathers plate waveney was in excellent spirits all breakfasttime she laughed and talked with noel while mollie sat behind her coffeepot and looked at her with puzzled eyes how can wave laugh like that when she knows she knows she thought wonderingly but at that moment waveney looked at her with a smile so sweet and so full of sadness that poor mollie nearly choked and her eyes brimmed over with tears chapter v fairy magnificent leave no stone unturned euripides what is useful is beautiful socrates wish me good luck and do not expect me until you see me were waveneys last words as mollie stood at the door with a very woebegone face cheer up moll care killed the cat you know and then she waved her hand and vanished it was still quite early in the afternoon when she reached berkeley square in spite of her assumed cheerfulness her courage was at a low ebb the imposing appearance of the houses awed her she knocked timidly and the butler who opened the door looked like a dignified and venerable clergyman he received her affably as though she were an expected guest miss harford was out driving but would be back shortly his mistress mrs mainwaring had desired that miss ward should be shown into the drawingroom waveney never felt so small and insignificant in her life for the first time she was conscious of a wish to be tall as she followed him down the corridor then the thickness of the carpets distracted her and the cabinets of china then a door was opened and she heard her name announced and a soft little voice said certainly druce show the young lady in for one moment waveney hesitated the owner of the voice seemed invisible it was a beautiful room grander than anything that the girl had ever seen and it was full of sunshine and the scent of flowers tall palms were everywhere and china pots with wonderful japanese chrysanthemums and there were screens and standard lamps and a curtained archway leading to an inner room and here waveney at last discovered a tiny old lady half buried in an immense easy chair she was the prettiest old lady in the world but as diminutive as a fairy her cheeks were as pink as mollies and she had beautiful silvery curls under her lace cap a mass of white fleecy knitting lay on her satin lap and the small wrinkled fingers were loaded with costly brilliants fairy magnificent waveney named her when she was retailing the account of her visit she looked up with a pleasant smile and pointed to a chair you have called to see my niece miss harfordoh yes she is expecting you but she was obliged to pay a business visit my nieces are busy women miss wardperhaps you will find that out for yourself some day waveney began to feel less shy she looked round the room that she might describe it properly to mollie how mollie revelled in that description afterwards it was like a page in a story bookflowers and statues and palms and that beautiful old lady in her satin gown fairy magnificent was evidently fond of talking for she rippled on in her soft voice like a little purling brook knitting all the time oh we all have our gifts my dear but i am afraid in my day girls were terribly worldly it was not the fashion to cultivate philanthropy or altruism as they call it i recollect a young man asking one of my nieces if they went in for slumming i wonder what we should have thought of such a question when i was young does miss harford do that sort of thing asked waveney with something of her old animation she was such a dear little old ladylike a piece of dresden china oh not slumming exactlythey are too sensible to take up every passing craze but they do an immense deal of good they have a home for governesses and brokendown workers very near them at erpingham and they have a room in the garden where they do all sorts of things they have thursday evenings for shopgirls regular social eveningstea and music and talk and the girls are as nicely behaved as possible oh what a grand idea and waveneys eyes began to gleam and sparkle i have always been so sorry for shopgirls i think they have such a hard pushing sort of life the poor things are often so tired but they have to look pleasant all the same mrs mainwaring looked amused at the girls energy but before she could reply there were quick decided footsteps in the outer room and the next moment a tall dark woman in walkingdress entered when waveney rose from her chair the lady looked at her with extreme surprise miss ward i suppose and her manner was a little brusque please sit down again and i will speak to you directly aunt sara may i have the carriage please morris says the horses are quite fresh i find the letter that i expected is at the red house so it will be better for me to talk it all over with althea do as you like doreen returned mrs mainwaring tranquilly but you must attend to this young lady first you know and then miss harford took a seat near waveney the girl was suffering from a sense of painful disillusion mrs mainwarings talk had given her a favourable idea of miss harford but when she saw her her first thoughts were what a grievous pity that such a good woman should be so plain but the next moment she added plain is too mild a term she is really quite ugly and it could not be denied that dame nature had treated miss harford somewhat churlishly her figure was angular and a little clumsy and not even her wellcut tailormade tweed could set it off to advantage her features were strongly marked and her complexion sallow and her low forehead and heavy eyebrows gave her rather a severe look she could not be less than forty probably a year or two over that but there was no affectation of youth either in dress or manner perhaps the only point in her favour was a certain frankness and sincerity in her expression that after a time appealed to people and yet her eyes were a light cold grey strangers seldom took to her at firsther quick decided manners were rather too brusque and then her voice was so harsh and deep but they soon found out that she was to be trusted and byandby they grew to love her doreen harford always spoke of herself as the ugly duckling who would never change into a swan in this world i never do anything by halves she would say laughing and her laugh was as fresh and ringing as a childs though perhaps a little hard i am as ugly as they make them my dearfor she was too happy and busy a woman to fret over her lack of beauty though she adored it whenever she found it and petted all the pretty children and animals theres aunt sara she would go on is she not like one of watteaus shepherdesses did you ever see anything so fine and pink and daintyand she is seventythree she has had lovers by the score and she was only a young woman when general mainwaring died but she would never marry again bless her when miss harford sat down she pulled off her gloves in rather a disturbed manner i was sorry to keep you waiting but i had to go out on urgent business you are very young miss wardyounger than i expected and than miss warburton led me to suppose she spoke in a slightly aggressive voice as though miss ward were somehow to blame for her youthful aspect that will mend in time doreen my love observed mrs mainwaring kindly i think miss ward seems a very sensible young lady and then waveney longed to hug her i am nineteen she said looking miss harford full in the face that is not so very young after all and i have acted as secretary to a lady in cheyne walk it was only a morning engagement certainly but miss warburton knows all about me and she thought this situation would just suit me i am fond of reading aloud and i never get tired and doreen if you do not engage this young lady i think i shall but mrs mainwaring was only joking as her niece knew well for it would have been more than her life was worth to do such a thing for fairy magnificent had a faithful maid who simply worshipped her and would have fought any woman who offered to do her service her mistress wanted no paid companion as long as she was in the house she would say and as rachel ruled her mistressand indeed the whole household there was little probability of her indulging in this luxury miss harfords face brightened she understood the purport of her aunts little joke she liked miss ward and wished her niece to engage her althea will not mind her being young she said significantly and then miss harford turned to waveney miss warburton will have given you some idea of the duties requiredand now her manner had decidedly softened we are very busy people and we lead two lives the working life and the social life and as we are fairly strong we manage to enjoy both unfortunately my sister has had a little trouble with her eyes latelythe doctors say it is on the nerves sometimes when she reads or writes she has pain in them and has to close her book or shut up her desk if she were to persevere the pain would become excruciating it is certainly on the nerves for sometimes she is not troubled at all i understand returned waveney in a low voice our doctor is an old friend and a very sensible man continued miss harford and he proposed that my sister should find some young lady with a good voice and pleasant manner who would read to her especially in the evenings when nothing is going on and to whom she could dictate letters oh i am sure i could do that returned waveney eagerly and then mrs mainwaring chimed in again my dear i am an old woman so you may believe me my nieces are the best women i know and they make every one happy at the red house now aunt sara returned miss harford good humouredly how are miss ward and i to understand each other if you will keep interrupting us you see miss ward the duties are very light and you will have plenty of time to yourself we want some one young and cheerful who will make herself at home and be ready for any little service are you musical i can sing a little but my voice has not been well trained that is a pity now should you mind reading us a page or two and she handed her a novel that was lying open on the table waveney flushed but she took the book at once for the first few minutes her voice trembled then she thought of the new gown she wanted to buy for mollie at christmas and then it grew steady miss ward reads very nicely does she not aunt sara was miss harfords approving comment i think althea will be pleased then turning to waveney with a pleasant smile that lit up her homely features as sunshine lights up a granite rock i really see no reason why we should not come to terms i do not know what we ought to offer you miss ward but my sister thought fifty pounds a year waveney gave a little start of surprise the terms seemed magnificent oh she said impulsively i shall be able to help father what happiness that will be and then her face fell a little will you tell me please is it very far to erpingham do you mean from here no not exactly i am thinking of my own home we live in cleveland terrace chelsea then miss harford seemed somewhat taken aback is your fathers name everard ward she asked abruptly oh yeshave you heard of him returned waveney naively he is an artist but his pictures do not sell and he has only his drawing lessons that is why i want to help him because he works so hard and looks so tired and molliethat is my sisteris a little lame and cannot do much is that all your family you do not speak of your mother miss harford was looking at the girl a little strangely she is dead returned waveney in a low voice she died when mollie and i were ten years old but there is a young brother noel then miss harford turned to her aunt aunt sara i really think it would be best for althea to see miss ward herself you know i have to drive over to erpingham now it is quite early in the afternoon she continued looking at waveney can you not come with me we shall be at the red house in threequarters of an hour i could drop you at sloane square station by seven it will be a pleasant drive and the evenings are still light until eight waveney hesitated what would mollie say to her long absence but then her father never returned home before eight on his norwood days the drive tempted her and then the idea of seeing erpingham if you are sure that i shall be back by seven she said and then miss harford rang the bell and ordered the carriage althea will give us tea come miss ward and then mrs mainwaring held out her soft little hand to the girl goodbye my dear you will be as happy as a bird at the red house give my love to althea doreen and tell her to rest her poor eyes waveney thought of cinderella and the pumpkin coach as she stepped into the luxurious carriage the novelty of the position the enjoyment of the swift smooth motion and the amusement of looking out at the crowded street completely absorbed her and for some time miss harford made no attempt to draw her into conversation but presently she began to talk and then waveney found herself answering all sorts of questions about herself and molliehow they amused themselves and why her fathers pictures did not sell and then waveney who was very girlish and frank told her all their disappointment about king canute and miss harford listened with such kindly interest that waveney felt quite grateful to her father was so low and cast down about it last night he said he should never have the heart to paint a picture again because the dealers were so hard on him and i am afraid he meant it too oh what a nice grey church and actually we are coming to a river oh how picturesque those reddishbrown sails look in the sunshine this is dereham returned her companion it is not such a very long drive is it in little more than ten minutes we shall have reached our destination and then she began pointing out various objects of interestanother church the shops in high street where they dealt then a high narrow house very dull and gloomylooking some dear old friends of ours live in that house she said it is not very invitinglooking is it once they lived in such a beautiful place until old mr chaytor lost his money i am always so sorry for them i think troubles of this kind fall very heavily on some natures waveney assented to this but the subject did not much interest her they had left dereham behind now and before them lay a wide green common with pleasant roads intersecting it a little clear pool by the roadside rippled in the sunlight near it was a broad grassy space shaded by trees two or three nurses sat on benches and some children were dancing hand in hand advancing and retreating and singing in shrill little voices here we go gathering nuts in may they were chanting and then one child fell down and began to cry across the common there were soft blue distances and a crisp wind laden with the perfumes of firs and blackberries fanned their faces then they drove through some white gates a lodge and a long shady lane were before them with long parklike meadows on one side it was all so sweet so still and peaceful in the evening light that waveney was half sorry to find that their journey was at an end for the next moment the carriage stopped and the lodgekeeper opened some more gates curtsying with a look of pleasure when she saw miss harford i have not come home to stay mrs monkton observed miss harford with a friendly nod and then the horses began frisking down a winding carriage drive the shrubbery was thick but every now and then waveney had glimpses of little shutin lawns one with a glorious cedar in the middle and another with a sundial and peacock an old red brick elizabethan house was at the end of the drive with a long sunny terrace round it at the sound of the wheels two little yorkshire terriers flew out to greet their mistress with shrill barks of joy oh what pretty little fellows exclaimed waveney yes they are great pets fuss and fury that is what we call them returned miss harford smiling and i think you will allow that the names suit them chapter vi queen elizabeths wraith life indeed must always be a compromise between common sense and the idealthe one abating nothing of its demands the other accommodating itself to what is practicable and realamiel as they entered the large square hall with fuss and fury frolicking round them a tall respectablelooking woman came forward to meet them i suppose my sister is in the library mitchell asked miss harford quickly yes maam parker has just taken in the tea then will you please give this young lady some take her into my room and make her comfortable i must ask you to excuse me for a short time miss ward as i have to talk over one or two things with my sister but mitchell will look after you oh please do not trouble about me returned waveney and then she followed mitchell down a long passage full of beautiful plants to a pleasant sittingroom with a deep bay window overlooking the lawn with the sundial the peacock was strutting across the grass with the mincing ambling gait peculiar to that bird the peahen following him more meekly through green trellised arches one looked on a tennis lawn and beyond that was a large red brick cottage with a porch when mitchell brought in the teatray waveney asked her who lived there the woman looked a little amused at the question no one lives there maam she answered civilly my mistresses built it for their winter evening entertainments there is only one room with a sort of kitchen behind it it is always called the porch house waveney longed to ask some more questions but mitchell had already retired so she sat down and enjoyed her tea how happy she could be in this lovely place if only mollie were with her and then she thought of the fifty pounds a year after all erpingham was not so far away perhaps they would let her go home once a week if she could only have her sunday afternoons and evenings to herself and then her heart began to beat quickly how delicious that would be how mollie and she would talk and after tea they would sing their old hymns and then they would all go to church together and her father and noel would walk to the station to see her off and then she wondered if she should mind the long walk across the common it would be rather lonely she thought on a dark winters evening and perhaps miss harford would not approve of it while waveney indulged in these surmises and cogitations miss harford had walked briskly across the inner hall and tapping lightly at a door opened it and entered a beautiful long room fitted up as a library it had a grand oriel window with a cushioned seat and a tiny inner room like a recess with a glass door leading to the lawn with the cedartree a lady writing at a table in the centre of the room uttered a little exclamation of surprise why doreen i was just writing to you but it is the unexpected that always happens and then the two sisters kissed each other affectionately you can put away your letter and give me some tea instead doreen said laughing and then althea smiled and walked to a little teatable that had been placed in the window with two invitinglooking easy chairs beside it sit down dorrie do and tell me what has brought you over like a flash of lightning on a summer evening she said as she took up the teapot althea harford was a betterlooking woman than her sister but she could never have been handsome she was very tall and her figure was decidedly graceful she walked well and carried her head with the air of an empress her eyes were expressive and even beautiful but her face was too long and thin and her reddish auburn hair and light eyelashes gave her rather a colourless look she had a long aquiline nose and some people said that she reminded them of queen elizabeth though it may be doubted whether that tudor princess had altheas air of refinement and gentleness she was evidently a year or two younger than her sister but her dress like doreens was very sedate and suitable to her age she had a style of her own which certainly suited her when excited or under the influence of some strong emotion a faint pink colour would come to her cheeks and a vivid light to her eyes at such moments she would be almost beautiful the sisters were very unlike in disposition but in spite of their dissimilarity they were the best of friends and understood each other perfectly doreen took life more lightly she had a robust cheerfulness that seldom failed her althea had a greater sense of humour and far more intellect but there was a veiled melancholy about her as though early in life she had suffered disillusion and she would speak sometimes as though human existence were a comedy where the players wore masks and performed the shadow dance at intervals both sisters were ladies bountiful and gave nobly of their substance but althea could never be brought to acknowledge that she gave enough she had scruples of conscience and would sometimes complain that they were like dives and had their good things in this life and as though we were not rich enough she would grumble aunt sara is actually going to leave us her moneyfor mrs mainwaring had lately made another will in her nieces favour doreen would have a large sum of money but althea who was her favourite would be the chief legatee and althea had groaned in spirit when she heard it it is such a responsibility she sighed but doreen would not listen to this it is such an enjoyment she retorted i do so love spending money and so do you althea in spite of your grumbling and as to aunt saras will we need not make ourselves miserable about that for she will probably live until she is ninety and this view of the case cheered althea greatly altheas temperament was by no means pessimistic but like all deep thinkers she had to pay the penalty of her own acute perceptions the unsolved problems of life saddened her and at times disturbed her comfort she envied doreen her capacity for putting troublesome questions out of her mind i wish i had your mind dorrie she said once it is such a comfortable nicely padded mind when disagreeable things happen you just let down your curtains and keep yourself snug upon my word althea returned doreen goodhumouredly i am glad no one but myself heard that speech you make me out a nice selfish sort of person no no you are not selfish at all you are far more ready to help people than i am you are a good woman doreen and you know i did not mean that then what did your riddle mean well just what i said that you never worry and fret yourself over troublesome questionssocial questions i mean difficult problems that meet one in this world at every corner i often make myself quite unhappy over them and go to bed with a heartache but i do not believe that you ever lose an hours sleep over them i daresay not in that sense i suppose i have a nicely padded mind but althea it is not that i do not realise the difficulty but my dear child what is the good of sitting down before a mountain and waiting for it to open earthquakes of that sort wont happen i put it by until i am grown up and as althea stared at her she nodded her head quite grown up i mean we are only children here and we are not likely to get all our lessons perfect and then in a low voice she said a little solemnly what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter and as doreen said this her plain homely features were transfigured and althea looked at her with reverence for in her simple faith doreen had passed her and taken the higher place well doreen what has brought you over this evening asked althea as she handed her sister a cup of tea i was thinking of driving over tomorrow to see you and aunt sara well i wanted to see you about two or three things miss ward amongst them i have brought her over and she is at present partaking of tea and cake in my room ohdo you think she will do asked althea quickly well that is for you to decide you shall see her presently and judge for yourself at first sight i confess that i was not favourably impressedshe is such a childishlooking little thing with fluffy babyish hair curling over her head but for her eyes and expression i should never have thought her grown up she is rather like laura ridgway only paler laura has very pretty eyes doreen so has miss ward they are quite out of the common aunt sara took rather a fancy to her aunt sara is a very good judge of character her sister observed well i liked her better myself after a time her voice is deep but i somehow admire it and she read very nicely she seems anxious to come to us they are evidently rather poor but here doreen hesitated in rather an embarrassed way out with it dorrie there is something behind i see well it is for you to judge i shall leave the decision in your hands i think aunt sara is right and that miss ward is a nice little thing but she is everard wards daughter althea started she was evidently quite unprepared for this she changed colour slightly are you sure of that doreen she asked in a low voice you know how many wards there aredozens and dozens yes and i never for a moment imagined that it could be everards daughter but directly she mentioned her addresscleveland terrace chelseaof course i recognised her wait a minuteas althea seemed inclined to interrupt herlet me make it all clear to you i put the question to her is everard ward your father that was plain enough was it not and when she said yes i managed to glean two or three particulars that we already know yes but tell me all the same and altheas manner was a little eager well she told me that her mother was deadwe knew thatand that she had a twin sister who was rather lame and a brother noel then at the mention of noels name althea looked a little amused what a strange coincidence she murmured strange enough but rather embarrassing miss ward was very naive and frank it seems the poor man cannot sell his pictures he has one on hand now king canute she called it and none of the dealers will look at it she says her father is very low about it and that they want the money badly well what now althea pretending to frown at her for altheas face was suffused with colour and her eyes were very bright poor everard she said softly there is room for another picture in the porch house and then a queer little smile came to her lips it will be a valuable lesson to the girls then doreen shook her head at her it could not be done you foolish woman you would be found out we must discover another way then returned althea who was quite in earnest perhaps thorold will give it house room but you must be prudent dear i will be discretion itself the picture will not be purchased in my name you can depend on that i begin to think my nature is not straightforward i do so love little plots and underhand schemes i should have made a good secret conspirator now about this girl if she pleases me i can see no objection to our engaging her it is perfectly simple dorrie they are poor and the girls have to work fate or ratherfor it is no joking matterprovidence has brought her to us is it too superstitious to say that i feel that i dare not refuse to take her it may be another way of helping them yes but in my opinion everard ought to know to whom he is sending her ah i agree with you there in spite of my subterranean and complicated schemes i did not propose any fresh masquerade as far as the girl is concerned i am willing to be as open as the day now as we have finished tea shall i go to your room and doreen smiled assent waveney was standing by the window crumbling some sweetcake for the peacock she turned round at the sound of the opening door the evening sun was shining into the room and perhaps the light dazzled waveney a little but certainly she gave a very droll description of althea to mollie afterwards the door opened and a very tall woman in a grey gown seemed to glide in for she walked so quietly that i could not hear a footstep and lo and behold it was queen elizabeths wraith oh waveney what nonsense and i do hate that horrid old elizabeth well so do i but all the same miss harford is remarkably like hersuch a long thin face and nose and reddish hair and she had a sort of ruff of lace round her throat and such a stately manner it was quite queenly and i think really that i should have made my curtsy only she came up to me in the kindest way and took my hand i am so sorry that you have been alone all this time she said in such a sweet voice but my sister and i had so much business to discuss she has told me all about you so i am not going to trouble you with needless questions you can just tell me anything you like about yourself i have a great respect for workers and always love to help them it was nice of her to say that yes it quite won my heart i like both the miss harfords mollie but miss altheaor queen bess as i prefer to call heris more to my taste she interested me directly and we had such a nice talk just as though we were old friends and she said at once that i could have my sunday afternoonsthink of that sweetheart i shall be with you every sunday altheas sympathetic nature had at once grasped the girls trouble at leaving home i think i could arrange for you to spend the greater part of your sundays at home she observed that is if you are a good walker for we never use our horses on sundays unless the weather is very bad we dine early for i always have a busy afternoon in the porch house and i could spare you easily but the long walk back in the dark faltered waveney who knew well that her father would make objections to this then althea considered the point yes you are right you could not walk alone on dark evenings and the winter is coming there are houses of course but they stand so far back and the gates are locked oh no my dear that would never do neither my sister nor i could permit you to walk alone then her face brightened and she continued with more animation i have an idea my maid peachy always goes to see her mother on sunday afternoons she lives near victoria and she always takes the same train back we will find out which that is and then you can walk up the hill together at this the girls joy was so evident that althea had been quite touched just at the close of the interview she had said a few words that greatly surprised waveney and now my dear i should like you to go home and talk things over with your people and then you can write me a line saying whether you wish to come to us we must not decide things finally until your father gives his consent he will know our names and as waveney seemed puzzled at this when we were young he visited at our house oh not here we lived in surrey then but when shall you want me asked waveney anxiously oh i am sure father will give his consent he is dreadfully unhappy at the idea of our working but he knows it must be done still you must consult him returned althea gently and her manner was a little stately as for my wanting you i shall be content if you could come to me in about ten days now i hear the carriage coming round goodbye i think i will add au revoir and then she shook hands very cordially and the next moment doreen joined them there was very little conversation during the drive back miss harford was busy with her letters and notebook and waveney leaned back on the cushions and thought over her talk with althea how strange that father should have known them she said to herself he often talks of his old friends but he has never mentioned their name harfordno i am sure i never heard it until miss warburton spoke of them if i go anywhere it shall be to the red housei have made up my mind to that i like both of themthey are different somehow from other people but i like queen bess far the best chapter vii a humourist and an idealist the world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages since but i think now tis not to be found loves labours lost a merrier man within the limits of becoming mirth i never spent an hours talk withal act ii while waveney was doing her very best to make a favourable impression on the misses harford an interview of a far different character was taking place at number ten cleveland terrace mollie who was conscientious and strictly truthful having been taught from childhood to abhor the very whitest of white lies was trying laboriously to carry out a certain programme drawn up by waveney she was not to cry or to think of anything disagreeable and she was only to look at the clock twice in an hour and there was no need for her either to be always standing on the balcony and straining her eyes after every passerby it was sheer waste of time and it would be far better to finish one of her pretty menucards and mollie who was docile and tractable had agreed to this it shall have a spray of golden brown chrysanthemums she said quite cheerfully and when waveney left the house she arranged her paintingtable and selected the flowers from corporal marks nosegay but alas the bestlaid schemes of mice and men gang aft agley scarcely had mollie wetted her brush before ann the heavyfooted came up with an inflamed face and red eyes the pain was horrible as she expressed it and was not to be borne would miss mollie spare her for half an hour and she would get mr graingers young man to pull the tooth out oh yes ann certainly returned mollie who was tenderhearted but when ann had withdrawn with a snorting sob she mused with some perplexity over all the ills to which maidsofallwork were liable ann had looked so strong when they had engaged her and yet she was always complaining of something she was addicted to heavy colds in her head and to a swollen face sometimes diversified by an earache she was a goodtempered willing creature but her infirmities were great and more than once waveney had advised mollie to send her away but she is so honest mollie would plead and she is so devoted to mrs muggins and so ann had been suffered to remain noel took her off to the life he would tie up his face with a wisp of flannel and sit hugging the cat for ten minutes at a time was it a poorty leddy then and did she want the poor little chickabiddies ann would choke with suppressed laughter when she came in to lay the table aint it natural miss mollie and it is just what i did say to mrs muggins mollie was studying the chrysanthemum pensively when annie put her head in again the fire must not get low miss mollie because of the cake then mollie jumped up in dismay ann was going out and leaving that precious cakenoels birthday cakeand it was such a nice one she had made it herself and it had beautiful pinkandwhite icing on the top that her cake should be spoilt was a thought not to be endured for a moment she knew what anns fires wereblack smoky concerns as mollie rushed into the kitchen the front door bell rang and ann with her hat on admitted a visitor a gentleman miss mollie and i have shown him up in the studio but mollie whose face was in the oven did not hear this her whole attention was absorbed by her cakemenu cards were forgotten she stirred the fire put on coals and then sat down on the rug to watch the oven meanwhile the visitor walked briskly into the studio he was a small dark man and his dress was somewhat bohemian he had a brown velveteen coat and a yellow rose in his buttonhole and he had bright clear eyes that saw everything worth seeing and a good deal that ordinary folk failed to seenot that people always found this out he had plenty of time for observation and when he had grown a little weary of his solitude he made a tour of the room he stood for some time by mollies painting table the menu cards struck him as very pretty and graceful in their design my good little samaritan is artistic i see he said to himself but there was no need for her to put on her best frock because a stranger called but vanity and women are synonymous terms and after this atrocious sentimentwhich all women would utterly repudiatehe looked curiously at a framed picture standing on the floor canute and his courtiers yes i see rather stale that sort of thing canute decidedly wooden ambitious but amateurishwants force and expression and then he shook his head hulloa what have we here and he stepped up to the easel it was a roughly executed sketch in crayon and was evidently a boys work but in spite of considerable crudeness it was not without spirit a young lady was stepping down from an omnibus and a queer little man in a peaked hat and a huge moustache was handing her out he was grinning from ear to ear and in his other hand was a sixpence your eternally obliged monsieur blackie was written under the picture the visitor seemed puzzled then a light dawned finally he threw back his head and laughed aloud we have a humourist here he said to himself and to restore his gravity he began walking up and down the room but every time he passed the easel he laughed again this is clearly not my little samaritan he said to himself he had brought in a beautiful bouquet and had laid it down on the round table every few minutes he took it up and looked at the door the household was certainly a peculiar one an extraordinary young female with her face tied up in flannel had shown him upstairs after telling him that miss ward was in he had been waiting nearly twenty minutes should he ring the bell but there was no bellnot a semblance of one then he thought he would leave the flowers and the sixpence with his card yes perhaps that would be best and then he hesitated it was very absurd but he rather wanted to see the little girl again there was something so bright and piquant about her perhaps she was keeping out of the way on purpose perhaps monsieur blackieand here he laughed afreshwas not to her taste no sooner did this idea come into his head than with manlike perversity he determined to persevere he walked downstairs and into the diningroom here fresh amusement awaited him in the inscription noel ward his study my friend the humourist again he said softly and then he pricked up his ears for in some back premises he could distinctly hear a very clear sweet girlish voice he stole into the passage to listen and this is what he heard heres to the maiden of bashful fifteen heres to the widow of fifty heres to the flaunting extravagant queen and heres to the housewife thats thrifty let the toast pass drink to the lass ill warrant she prove an excuse for the glass school for scandal muttered the stranger a very good song and very well sung i should like to clap let me see that is what they used to do in the arabian nights entertainmentclap hands enter beautiful circassian slave with a golden dish full of jewelled fruits i will knock instead at the mysterious portal oh is that you ann exclaimed a voice cheerfully however did you get in fetch me some coals please and oh i forgot your poor tooth was it very bad pardon me observed the young man hurriedly then at the strange voice mollie turned round once many years ago in a foreign gallery ingram had stood for a long time before a little picture that had captivated his fancy it was the work of an english artist and a very promising one and was entitled cinderella a little workhouse drudge was sitting on a stool in the chimney corner of a dark underground kitchen a black cindery fire was casting a dull glow a thin tabby cat was trying to warm itself the torn draggled frock and grimy hands of the little maidofallwork were admirably rendered but under the tangled locks a pair of innocent childs eyes looked wistfully out a story book with the page opened at cinderella lay on the lap ingram thought of this picture as mollie turned her head and looked at him and man of the world as he was for the moment words failed him he was standing in a dull little kitchena mere slip of a placelooking out on a long straggling garden very narrow and chiefly remarkable for gooseberryandcurrant bushes and sitting on the rug in front of the fire like a blissful salamander was a girl with the most beautiful face that he had ever seen then poor mollie blushing like a whole garden full of roses in her embarrassment scrambled awkwardly to her feet oh dear i thought it was our ann will you tell me your name please father is out and we do not expect him home until eight my business was with your sister returned ingram regaining his selfpossession as he saw the girls nervousness your servant let me in exactly fiveandtwenty minutes ago and as i thought the household was asleep i was endeavouring to discover a bell and then i heard singing let the toast pass drink to the lass awfully good song that oh dear faltered mollieshe would have liked to sink through the floor at that moment to avoid that bright quizzical glance that was fathers song not mine oh i know now who you are you are the gentleman whose pocket was picked yesterday exactly monsieur blackie at your service and then mollie turned cold with dismay ann had let him in and he had been in the studio and noels absurd sketch was on the easel he had recognised himself and mollies confusion and misery were so great that in another minute she would have disgraced herself for ever by bursting into tears only ingram fearing he had taken too great a liberty hastened to explain matters you see miss ward i was anxious to pay my debts and thank your sister if i remember rightly i told her that i should call oh yes at least waveney was not sure that you would and she had to go out i should like to have seen her perhaps another time you will allow me ingram reddened and hesitated she may not be long she has gone to berkeley square on business ah as the bell rang that is ann so please will you go upstairs mollie was not quite equal to the situation she wanted to get rid of monsieur blackie but he did not seem inclined to go and ingram took a mean advantage of her inexperience i have left my hat upstairs he said hypocritically and there are some flowers which i brought for your sister and i think they ought to be put in water this appealed at once to mollie oh certainly she said and as she limped down the passage before him a pained look came in ingrams eyes oh what a grievous pity he thought that lovely face to be allied with such a cruel infirmity oh what flowers exclaimed mollie burying her face in them and then she glanced at the card shyly moritz ingram what a nice name yes he was rather nice too in spite of his droll looks she liked his voice but all the same if he would only go he ought to goand ingram evidently shared this opinion for he was hunting sedulously for his hat and as his efforts were unavailing mollie was obliged to go to his help i brought it upstairs he kept saying manners makye man and i was always remarkable for my good manners why even your sister took me for a frenchman and at this mollie broke into a merry laugh and ingrams eyes twinkled sympathetically the next minute the doorbell rang again and mollie who had just discovered the hat underneath the sofathough how it got there no one knewwas just going to dart to the door when a cracked voice called out cats meat and the faint mewing of mrs muggins was clearly audible in the distance and then noel strolled in he looked at ingram in unfeigned amazement then being an acute lad he grinned noel this is mr ingram the gentleman waveney saw in the omnibus yesterday i recognised myself returned ingram with an airy wave of the hand towards the picture though perhaps it is not a speaking likenessa sort of cross between mephistophiles and daniel quilp with perhaps a soupcon of the artful dodger i prefer to sit for my own portrait dont you know then noel grinned again rather sheepishly for once he was reaping the just reward of his impudence you are a humourist my young friend continued ingram blandly i am an idealist all my lifeand i am exactly thirty seveni have been seeking the impossible she that does not mean interrupting himself as though he feared to be misunderstood any individual woman oh dear no originality is my favourite fetish mollie looked bewildered but she was rather impressed by this fine flow of words but noels eyes brightened was this not a man and a brother women dont understand that sort of thing he observed confidentially they never laugh at the right jokes unless you label them and here noel threw up his head and cocked his chin that is why i have taken to drawinga picture pleases the poor things and the funnier you make it the more they like it indeed remarked ingram mildly and then he looked at the handsome lad with unfeigned approval it is for your sisters benefit that you do these clever sketches i am an artist myselfan embryo artist i ought to say for i have never sold a picturebut i recognise a brother in the art then noel who detected irony in the smooth voice looked a little sulky it is not clever a bit he growled it is beastly rot i did it to get a rise out of waveneywaveney is the other one you know did you say waveney i never recollect hearing the name before no it is a queer sort of name father had a greataunt waveney when i want something short and handy dont you know i call her stormandstress upon my word miss ward your brother is perfectly dangerous if i stay here any longer i shall take the infection i told you my special and particular fetish was originality i seem to have met it here thank youas mollie meekly handed him his hati have trespassed on your kind hospitality far too long already with your kind permission i will call again in the hope of seeing your sister what could i say asked mollie anxiously when she related the account of the afternoon the sisters were safely shut up in their own rooma large front room over the studio mr ward slept in the little room behind i could not say no please do not come i am sure waveney does not want to see you why no of course not you did quite right mollie dear did not dad say he showed his gratitude in a very gentlemanly way and as for noel he has been talking about him all the evening yes noel took a fancy to him and wave i do think he must be nice he says droll things in a soft sleepy sort of voice and i am afraid i was rather stupid and did not always understand but his eyes looked kind and gentle i was not afraid of him after the first few minutes poor little moll well it was rather embarrassing to have to interview a live stranger all alone and in the kitchen toofor mollie had drawn a highly colored and graphic description of her first meeting with monsieur blackie waveney had laughed mercilessly at first mollie ward enacting the part of cinderella or cinder maidenenter the black prince with the glass slipper mollie dear i grieve to say it but your feet are not as pretty as mine and waveney who was excited with her eventful day kicked off her shoes and began dancing in the moonlight her tiny feet scarcely touching the floor and behold the spirit of mischief was in her for as mollie sat on the bed and watched her with admiring eyes she suddenly broke into a song and this is what she sang heres to the maiden of bashful fifteen heres to the widow of fifty heres to the flaunting extravagant quean and heres to the housewife thats thrifty let the toast pass drink to the lass ill warrant shell prove an excuse for the glass chapter viii mollies babyhouse within tis all divinely fair no care can enter my retreat tis but a castle in the air but you and i are in it sweet helen marion burnside it is necessary to retrace our steps a little for it was not until much later that waveney executed her pasdeseul in the moonlight miss harford had kept her word and waveney was deposited at sloane street station punctually at seven and before the quarter had struck she was walking quickly up cleveland terrace mollie whose state of mind by this time baffled description was on the balcony watching for her and had the door opened before waveney was at the gate a few hurried questions and answers had been interchanged and then they had heard their fathers latchkey in the door oh dear oh dear why is father so dreadfully early this evening exclaimed mollie in a lamentable voice never mind returned waveney philosophically we must just wait until bedtime and then wont we make a night of it moll but father will hear us and rap on the wall observed mollie fretfully and tell us to go to sleep like good children oh no he wont if we curl ourselves on the windowseat it is a big room and our voices wont reach him mollie dear remember nothing is to be said to father tonight he is far too tired for fresh worries tomorrow i will take him for a prowl and talk to him severely no as mollie looked at her wistfully i must have him all to myself i can manage him more easily so run down to him now dear while i take off my hat and then i will join you mollie did as she was told and thanks to waveneys management they had another merry evening monsieur blackie was the leading topic waveney was quite touched when mollie handed her the bouquet with a little speech but noel entirely spoilt it by croaking out in an absurd voice your much and eternally obliged monsieur blackie hold your tongue you young rascal returned mr ward in high goodhumour mr ingram is a gentleman and shows that he knows what good manners are manners make man observed mollie slyly and then noel exploded again he was the coolest hand i ever knew he replied if he were his grace the duke of wellington he could not have lorded it better you are a humourist my young friend i should like to have given him one for his impudence and then the cheek of telling the wobbly one that he would call again mr ward frowned noel i will not have you call mollie by that name a jest is a jest but it must not be carried too far pegtop then returned noel unabashed by this rebuke for behind his fathers back he winked at mollie but he was not a bad sort of chap he would be rather useful on an eastwindy dismal sort of a dayhe would make you feel cheerful i like a fellow who can take a joke without turning rusty over itand from noel this was high praise mollie thought the evening dreadfully long and she fidgeted so much and looked at the clock so often that her father called her drowsyhead and begged her to go to bed but this made her redden with confusion and then when they were safe in their room waveney chose to be ridiculous and cut capers but as soon as her little song was finished she produced an old shepherds plaid rug which was known in family annals as the lamb and they both crept under it and tucked up their feet on the windowseat and felt cosy and if an artist could have drawn the picture it would have made his fortune for the rough old plaid set off mollies exquisite face and glorious golden brown hair to perfection while waveneys looked fair and infantine in the moonlight waveney was the talker now and mollie was the listener but every now and then there were little interjections of surprise and admiration at the description of fairy magnificent mollie drew in her breath and said oh miss harfords ugliness rather shocked her she said it was a great pity and waveney had never been used to live with ugly peoplewhich was perfectly true she thought queen elizabeths wraith a rather farfetched description she could not endure queen bess she was such an unladylike person and boxed gentlemens ears and if miss althea were like herbut here waveney interposed dont be a little goose moll she is like queen elizabeth and you would say the same yourself if you saw her but she is so nice and gentle that i am sure i shall soon love her well let me go on i want to tell you about the red house then mollie sighed with satisfaction and composed herself to listen mollie with all her sweetness and goodness was a little sybarite at heart she loved pretty things fine house gems beautiful dresses mr ward had been almost shocked when he had taken her one day to bond street to look at the shops it was impossible to get her away from the jewellers the diamond tiaras and necklets riveted her who buys them dad she had asked in quite a loud voice dukes and earls and those sort of people yes of course returned mr ward a little impatiently and the prince of wales i daresay for he was rather provoked at the attention the child was exciting two gentlemen who were passing and had overheard mollies remark smiled at each other what a beautiful child observed one he was a tall old man with a fine benevolent face you are right duke returned the other with a supercilious laugh some little rustic come to town for the first time come mollie observed her father rather crossly we must not take up the pavement in this way or the bobby will be telling us to move on and then mollie had limped on until another shopwindow attracted her mr ward had felt a little perplexed by mollies unsatiable appetite for pretty things and on their return home he unbosomed himself to waveney all girls like shops he said seriously and i knew mollie would be pleased but i never expected her to glue her face to the glass for half an hour at a time she made herself quite conspicuous and several people laughed at her mollie must be better behaved next time returned waveney smiling father dear i dont think it matters really mollie is young and she leads such a quiet life and sees so few things that when she goes out she just loses her head i think she continued calmly that she does care for pretty things more than most peopleshe would love to be rich and dress grandly and have pictures and jewels and beautiful things when we were tiny children she always would make me read the story of cinderella nothing else pleased her dont you care for pretty things too waveney asked her father a little sadly oh yes dad all girls care a little i think but i am not always longing for them like mollie she makes up stories to amuse herself some one is to leave us a fortune and we are all to be rich suddenly she has actually imagined a house and fitted it up bit by bit and just for the fun of the thing i have helped herit is our playhouse you know but mollie thinks it quite real if you say to her let us go down to kitlands her eyes brighten and she looks quite happy you are foolish children observed mr ward fondly who would have thought that my sweet moll had been such a little worldling at heart no dad you must not say that worldly people are selfish and mollie has not a selfish thought it is just a pretty childish fancy i sometimes believe in kitlands myself we have talked about it so often on windy nights i have seen the oaks tossing their branches in the park and the deer huddling under them and the west room where we always sit of an evening with the bay window and how the red firelight streams out on the terrace and there is a delicious couch by the fire with a lovely japanese screen behind it and but here mr ward put his hand over the girls mouth do you think i am going to be entertained by a description of your babyhouse he said in mock wrath tell mollie she ought to be grown up by this time but when he was left alone he said to himself now why in the world should they have hit on that name kitlands dont i recollect that sunny evening when i walked up the terrace and the red light streamed from the west room he sighed then roused himself bless their dear innocent hearts now if only their mother could have heard all that mollie was perfectly ravished with the description of the red house and as soon as waveney paused to take breath she said why it is almost as nice as kitlands only there is no park and no deer but i wish i had thought of a peacock then she put her head on one side and reflected deeply there is the italian garden you know wave a sundial would do very nicely there and we could choose an inscription but waveney gave her a little push dont be such a baby mollie we are getting too old for kitlands we must put our playhouse away with the dear old dolls but seriously is it not perfectly delicious to think we shall be together every sunday yes that will be nice of course but is it really settled wave and mollies voice was full of melancholy i think so dear but of course i must talk to father darling promise me that you will try and make the best of it the week will pass so quickly and then when sunday comes we shall be together i daresay i shall be with you by halfpast three just after father and noel have started for their afternoon walk i shall come to the station and meet you interrupted mollie will you how nice that will be and we shall have a cosy hour on grumps and you shall tell me all your worriesevery one of them and i will tell mine then when father comes in you and noel shall get tea ready and dad and i will have a little talk and after tea we will sing all our favourite hymns and then we will go to st michaels together and i will have my old place by father yes and then we will all go to the station with you but oh wave how i shall hate monday mornings i shall never feel cheerful until wednesday is over but waveney would not hear of thisshe preached quite a little homily on the duty of cultivating cheerfulness but her eloquence died a natural death when she saw mollie nod and ten minutes later they were both asleep it was a free morning with mr ward and he was not at all surprised when waveney invited him to take a prowl wont mollie prowl too he asked as he noticed her wistful expression but waveney shook her head mollie was an idle girl yesterday she remarked severely she must stay in and finish her menu card there you shall have the black princes flowers to console you and waveney placed them on the paintingtable sweets to the sweetthey are as much yours as mine mollie then mollie blushed a little guiltily more than once the thought had passed through her mindhow nice it would be if she had a monsieur blackie to bring her hothouse flowers for mollie was very human and certainly a creature not too bright and good for human natures daily food and she had her girlish weaknesses not that she envied waveney her flowers but as she sniffed them delightedly her imagination conjured up numberless bouquets for miss mollie ward only the donor must be tall and fair not a little dark frenchified artist like monsieur blackie waveney chatted to her father quite gaily until they had crossed the lime avenue and had reached the landingstage then they walked a little way down the embankment and sat down on a bench under a shady tree it was still early and there were few passengers only now and then a river steamer passed churning the blue water into light foamy waves two or three children were bowling their hoops followed by a panting pug waveney cleared her voice rather nervously then she slid her hand into her fathers arm everard could see the worn little glove fingers on his coat sleeve he stared at the white seams dreamily as he listened he was a man who noticed trifles there was a feminine element in his character that little shabby grey glove appealed to him forcibly father dear i have something to tell youthat is why i did not want mollie to come it is so much easier to talk about difficult things to only one person waveneys voice was not as clear as usual will you promise to listen dearest without interrupting me mr ward nodded but his face was a little grave what could the child have to say waveney told her story very fully she gave her father a description of the red house and fairy magnificent but she never mentioned miss harfords name she spoke of them vaguely as the ladies and you have settled all this without speaking to me and there was a hurt look on mr wards face then waveney nestled closer to him father dear i wanted to tell youi want to tell you everything but you were so tired and i thought it would be kinder to wait until i had spoken to the ladies the ladies what ladies have they no name he asked irritably yes dear of course they have returned the girl gently their name is harford then he turned round a little quickly harford oh i daresay there are plenty of that name i know erpinghamnoel and i walked there one sunday afternoon but i do not remember the red house no it stands in a lane you have to go through some white gates they have not always been at erpingham they used to live in surrey then she felt him start slightly i suppose you did not hear their christian names he asked a little anxiously oh yes dad i did the ugly oneshe was very nice but she is terribly plainwas called doreen and the pale fair one like queen elizabeth was althea then it was evident that mr ward was completely taken aback doreen and althea he muttered it must be the same with a singular coincidence waveney my child tell me one thing was the name of their house in surrey kitlands i dont know father they never told me but stay a moment there was a picture in miss harfords sittingroom of an old elizabethan house standing in a park and under it was written kitlands park i meant to tell mollie about that it is the sameit must be the same he returned in a low voice the names are too uncommon yes and it is true althea was a little like queen elizabeth i would have given five years of my life that this had not happened it is one of the little ironies of fate that my girl should have gone to them oh why father asked waveney piteously her fathers look of bitterness filled her with dismay why was he so disturbed so unlike himself he did not even hear her question he got up from the bench quickly and walked to the railings another steamer was passing mr ward looked after it with vague unseeing eyes everard ward was a proud man in spite of his easygoing ways he had had his ambitions his aspirations and yearnings he had set his ideal high and yet for want of ballast he had suffered shameful shipwreck at the beginning of life he had had his good thingshealth good looks talents and friends doors had opened to him kindly hands had been held out to him and one of them a womans hand but he had turned away in youthful caprice and had chosen his own path he had meant to have carved his own fortunes to have painted pictures that would have made the name of everard ward famous and he was only a drawingmaster who painted little thirdrate potboilers how everard loathed his poverty his shabby coat and mollies pitiful little makeshifts and contrivances were all alike hateful to him too well he remembered the fleshpots of egyptthe goshen of his youth where he had fared sumptuously when he had money to spend and the world smiled at him and then like a foolthe very prince of foolshe had flung it all away he had made a mess of his life but he was not without his blessings and in his better moments when the children were singing their hymns perhaps he would tell himself humbly that he was not worthy of them but as he stood by the river that morning it seemed to him as though the cup of his humiliation was full to the very dregs he had so broken with his old life that few ghostly visitants from the dim past troubled him and now there had started up in his path the two women whom he most dreaded to see and one of them he had wronged when hot with a young mans passion and tempted by dorothys sweet eyes and girlish grace he had drawn back suddenly and selfishly from the woman he had been wooing well he had dearly loved his wife but the disgrace of that shameful infidelity was never effaced from his memory it was a blot a stain upon his manhood a sore spot that often made him wince would he ever forget that day they were in the old walled garden gathering peaches and althea had just handed him one hot with the sun and crimsontinted and bursting with sweetness you always give me the best of everything althea he had said but he was thinking of dorothy as he said it and of her love for peaches i like to give you the bestthe very best althea had answered sweetly and her eyes had been so wistful and tender that he had felt vaguely alarmed how he had made his meaning clear to her he never could remember he had spoken of dorothy and perhaps his voice had trembled for all at once she had become very silent and there was no more gathering of peaches i must go in now she had said suddenly and he noticed her lips were pale doreen wants me yes i understand everard and you have my best wishesmy best wishes and then he had stood still and watched her a tall slim figure in white moving between the fruittrees and carrying her head proudly and it is to althea harford that my daughter has applied for a situation thought everard sadly and again he told himself that he was draining the cup of humiliation to the very dregs chapter ix rosalind and celia a hero worshipped and throned high on the heights of a sweet romance a faithful friend who was always the same till the clouds grew heavy and troubles came but this is life and this is to live and this is the way of the world gertrude carey waveney sat on the bench feeling very forlorn and deserted until her father came back to her he had evidently pulled himself together for he looked at her with his old kind smile though perhaps his lips were not quite steady come little girl dont fret he said tenderly least said is soonest mended and we must just go through with it but father are you sure you do not mind she returned eagerly we are very poor but i would rather please you dear than have ever so much moneyyou know that do you not waveneys eyes were full of tears and her little hands clasped his arm appealingly mr wards laugh was a trifle husky i know i have two good children he returned feelingly look here my child things have got a little mixed and complicated and i find it difficult to explain matters it is my poverty and not my will consents dont you knowand we must just pocket our pride and put a good face on it do you mean that i am to go to miss harford are you very sure that you mean that dad yes certainlybut his face clouded did you not tell me that miss althea suffered with her eyes and needed a reader and companion we were good friends once so why should i put an affront on her by refusing her my daughters services waveney sighed she felt a little oppressed her father took a reasonable and practical view of the case but his voice was constrained he was a proud man and at times he chafed sadly at his limitations he could not forget that he had come of a good old stock he used to tell his girls to carry their heads high and not allow themselves to be shunted by nobodies your mother was a gentlewoman he would say and your greatgrandmother had the finest manners i ever saw she was a markham of maplethorpe and drove in a chariot and four horses when she went to the county ball it was your grandfather who ruined us all he speculated in mines and so maplethorpe was sold i saw it once when i was a little chap i remember playing on the bowling green everard ward thought he was doing his duty in teaching his girls to consider themselves superior to their neighbours but sometimes waveney would joke about it she would come into the room with her little nose tiptilted and her head erect and cross her mittened hands over her bosom am i like my greatgrandmother markham she would say stand back mollie i am going to dance the minuet and then waveney would solemnly lift her skirts and point her tiny foot and her little performance would be so artless and full of grace that mr ward would sit in his chair quite riveted father i wish you would tell me how you first came to know the misses harford asked waveney rather timidly mr ward had relapsed into silence but he roused himself at the question it was in my oxford days child i was quite a young fellow then there were a good many pleasant houses where i visited but there was none i liked so well as kitlands mrs harford was alive then she was rather an invalid but we all liked her i always got on with elderly women they said i understood their little ways i knew your fairy magnificent too she was a great beauty we young fellows used to wonder why she had never married again oh father this is very interesting my good little fairy magnificent then he nodded and smiled when mrs mainwaring came down to kitlands there would be all sorts of gaieties going onriding parties and archery meetings in the summer and dances and theatricals in the winter once we acted a pastoral play in the parkas you like it it was very successful and the proceeds went to the county hospital i remember i was orlando was miss althea rosalind no your mother was rosalind she acted the part charmingly it was her first and last appearance altheahis voice changedwas celia her sister doreen insisted on being audrey because she said she looked the part to perfection then mother knew them too observed waveney in surprise well no dear one could hardly say that we were in great distress for a rosalind and the williams heard of our difficulty and they said they knew a young lady who had studied the part for some private theatricals that had never come off i had already met your mother at the county ball and i was very glad to see her again rosalindhe laughed a littleand orlando clenched the business but father why have you dropped such nice friends it was evident that mr ward had expected this question and was prepared for it well you see my child when i married your dear mother i was supposed by my friends to have done a foolish thing it was difficult enough to hold our heads above water without trying to keep in the swim people quietly dropped us as we dropped them it is the way of the world little girl and then in a wouldbe careless tone he quoted a part played out and the play not oer and the empty years to come with darkning clouds beyond and above and a helpless groping for truth and love but this is life and this is love and this is the way of the world it was a habit of mr wards to quote poetry he often read it to his children he had a clear musical voice but waveney was not content to have the subject so summarily dismissed father dear do you really mean to say that the harfords gave you up because you were poor and her tone was a little severe no dear it was i who gave them up by the bye waveney i wonder why they left kitlands and as the girl shook her head he continued thoughtfully it was a big place and perhaps they did not care to keep it up after their mothers death they always wanted to live nearer town well have we finished our talk and then waveney rose reluctantly he had not told her much she thought regretfully but all the same her girlish intuition went very nearly the truth there was something underneath something that concerned miss althea why had her father looked so pained when she had mentioned the name but with a delicacy that did her honour she was careful not to drop a hint of her suspicions to mollie mr ward thought he had kept his secret well he was impulsive and reckless by nature but his care for his motherless girls was almost feminine in its tenderness they were too precious for the rough workaday world so he tried to hedge them in with all kind of sweet old obsolete fashions for fear a breath should soil their crystalline purity father would like to wrap us up in lavender and put us under a glass case waveney would say laughingly and it must be owned that neither she nor mollie were quite up to date they did not talk slang they were not blase and they had fresh natural ideas on every subject which they would express freely waveney was the most advanced mollie was still a simple child in spite of her nineteen years mollie was very curious on the subject of her fathers intimacy with the harfords but waveney managed to satisfy her without making any fresh mysteries it is all in a nutshell mollie she said quietly when father was a young man he went to a lot of nice houses and kitlands was one of them they were rich people and very gay and gave grand parties and he had quite a good time of it and then he and mother married and they were poor and then somehow all their fine friends dropped off oh what a shame interrupted mollie indignantly well the harfords did not drop him but somehow he left off going there and he has never even heard of them for twenty years i think it upset him rather to have his old life brought up before him so suddenly it made him feel the difference dont you see and waveneys voice was a little sad she could so thoroughly enter into her fathers feelings what a change from the lighthearted young man of fashion acting orlando and making love to rosalind in the green glades of kitlands to the shabby drudging drawingmaster with shoulders already bowed with continual stooping waveney wrote her little note of acceptance the next day it brought a kind answer from miss althea she was very glad that miss ward had decided to come to them she and her sister would do their best to make her feel at home erpingham was so near and they so often drove into town that she could see her people constantly please give our kind remembrances to your father if he has not quite forgotten his old friends was the concluding sentence waveney handed the note silently to her father he reddened over the closing words what a kind womanly letter it was the faint smell of lavender with which it was perfumed was not more fragrant than the warmhearted generosity that had long ago forgiven the slight had he really wounded her by his desertion or had her vanity merely suffered how often he had asked himself this question they had only met once a week before his wedding and she had been very gentle with him asking after dorothy with a friendliness that had surprised him for manlike he never guessed how even a good woman will on occasion play the hypocrite she is a kind creature he said giving back the letter but his manner was so grave that even mollie did not venture to say a word the girls had a good deal on their minds just then waveneys scanty wardrobe had been reviewed and mollie had actually wept tears of humiliation over its deficiencies oh wave what will you do she said sorrowfully and we dare not ask father for more than a few shillings no of course not but waveneys forehead was lined with care as she sat silently revolving possibilities and impossibilities what would the misses harford think of her shabby old trunk that had once belonged to her mother then she threw back her curly head and looked at mollie resolutely mollie dont be silly life is not long enough for fretting over trifles the misses harford know we are poor so they will not expect smart frocks i have my grey cashmere for sundays and i must wear my old serge for everyday i will get fresh trimming for my hat and a new pair of gloves and and boots ejaculated mollie you shall have a pair of boots if i go barefoot all the winter and your shoes are very shabby too wave yes i know i will talk to father and see what is to be done if he would advance me a couple of pounds i could repay it at christmas is it not a blessing that i have one tidy gown for eveningsfor some three months before they had gone to some smart school party and their father being flush of money just then had bought them some simple evening dresses the material was only creamcoloured nunsveiling but mollie had looked so lovely in her white gown that all the girls had been wild with envy the dresses had only been worn once since and as waveney remarked were just as good as new shall you wear it every evening wave mollie had asked in an awed tone and when waveney returned why of course you silly child i have no other frock in big houses people always dress nicely for dinner i found that out at mrs addisons mollie regarded the matter as quite decidedher oracle had spoken mr ward had advanced the two pounds without any demur and the sisters made their modest purchases the following afternoon as waveney was retrimming her hat and mollie painting her menu cards ann flung open the door somewhat noisily mr inkpen miss she announced in a loud voice and the next minute monsieur blackie entered he looked trim and alert as usual his face beamed when he saw waveney it is the right miss ward this time he said shaking hands with her cordially then he looked at mollie and his manner changed will you allow your maid to hang these birds up in your larder and he held out a superb brace of pheasants to the bewildered girl mollie grew crimson with shyness and delight do you mean they are for us she faltered yes for you and your sister and your father and my young friend the humourist and please rememberand now his smile became more ingratiatingthat they are from monsieur blackie no please do not thank me they were shot by a friend of mine i rather object to the massacre of the innocents myself and i prefer doing it by deputy by the bye i find i have a new nameyour maid is a humourist too inkpenthere is something charmingly original and suggestive about that it makes ingram rather commonplace oh i think you have such a beautiful name returned mollie artlessly it is ever so much better than ward then waveney nudged her i think the pheasants ought to be hung up she said rather brusquely and at this broad hint mollie limped off with very pink cheeks whatever made you say that mollie was her comment afterwards i dont think it is quite nice to tell gentlemen that they have beautiful names i am sure i saw an amused look on mr ingrams face but mollie only looked puzzled at this ann is very stupid about names remarked waveney as she took up her work again she always calls me miss waverley and noel master noll somehow she does not seem to grasp sounds was your sister christened mollie he asked quickly and he looked at the menu cards as he spoke yes it was mothers fancy and i do so love the name returned waveney in her frank way i daresay you would not guess itpeople seldom dobut we are twins strangers always think mollie is the elder i should have thought so myself returned ingram and then he took up one of the cards waveney thought he was a little nervoushis manner was so grave these are very pretty he said quietly i thought so the other day the design is charming may i ask if your sister ever takes orders for them yes indeed a lady has commissioned mollie to paint these she is to have twelve shillings for the set twelve shillings and here ingrams voice was quite indignant miss ward he continued turning round to mollie who had just reentered the room it is a shame that you should be so fleeced why the design is worth double that sum now there is a friend of mine who would willingly give you two guineas for a set of six she is very artistic and fond of pretty things and if you are willing to undertake the commission i will write to her tomorrow willing mollies eyes were shining with pleasure if she could only earn the two guineas they should furnish sop for cerberusalias barker waveneys earnings would not be due until christmas and the constant nagging of the aggrieved butcher was making anns life miserable master says if meats wanted it must be paid for and he does not hold with cheap cuts and long reckonings drat the man i hates the very sight of him remarked ann wrathfully to her usual confidante mrs mugginsfor with toothache a swollen face and an irascible butcher life was certainly not worth living then i will write to myto the lady tomorrow both mollie and waveney noticed the little slip i wonder if he is married waveney said to herself but mollies inward comment was very likely mr ingram is engaged but he does not know us well enough to tell us so mr ingram was trying to regain his airy manner but a close observer would have detected how keenly he was watching the two girls as he talked nothing escaped himthe new hat trimmings and the faded hat waveneys worn little shoe and the white seams in mollies blue serge cinderellahe always called her cinderella to himselfwas no whit smarter than she had been the other day her hair was rather rough as though the wind had loosened it and yet with what ease and sprightliness they chattered to him their refined voices their piquante girlish ways free from all selfconsciousness delighted the young man who had travelled all over the world and had not found anything so simple and artless and real as these two girls it was waveney to whom he directed his conversation and with whom he carried on his gay badinage but when he spoke to mollie his voice seemed to soften unconsciously as though he were speaking to a child chapter x it is the voice of sheila in the grey old chapel cloister i sit and muse alone till the dials timeworn fingers mark the moment when we twain shall in paradisal sunlight walk together once again helen marion burnside there was no doubt that both waveney and mollie found their guest amusing his views of life were so original and there was such a quiet vein of humour running through his talk that after a time little peals of girlish laughter reached anns ears it was mollie who first struck the keynote of discord mr ingram had been speaking of a celebrated singer whom he had heard in paris she is to sing at st james hall next saturday week he went on they say the place will be packed a friend of mine has some tickets at his bestowal if you and your sister would care to go as usual he addressed waveney but mollies face grew very long oh dear how nice it would have been she sighed but waveney is going away and her eyes filled with tears going away he echoed in surprise yes she is going to be a reader and companion to a lady living at erpingham and she will only come home on sundays and then a big tear rolled down mollies smooth cheek and dropped into her lap and we have never been apart for a single day she finished with a little sob dear mollie hush whispered waveney we ought not to trouble mr ingram with our little worries erpingham is a nice place she continued trying to speak cheerfully do you know it oh yes he returned quickly most people know it there is a fine common and some golf links and there are some big houses there yes but the red house is in erpingham lane then mr ingram started i think some ladies of the name of harford live there he said carelessly two are very much given to good works oh do you know them asked waveney eagerly but it struck her that he evaded the question we have mutual friends he replied rather stiffly they are excellent women and do an immense amount of good they have a sort of home for brokendown governesses and they do a lot for shopwomen i have an immense respect for people who do that sort of thing recovering his sprightliness i tried slumming once myself but i had to give it up it was not my vocation the boys called me guy fawkes and that hurt my feelings by the bye as they both laughed at this i have never explained the purport of my visit i understood from your sister and here he looked at waveney that mr ward had a picture for sale king canute was it not well a friend of mine has a picturegallery and he is always buying pictures he wants to fill up a vacant place in an alcove and he suggested some early english historical subject he has an alfred toasting the cakes in the swineherds cottage and a st augustine looking at the saxon slaves in the marketplace and it struck me that king canute would be an excellent subject what lots of friends you seem to have remarked mollie innocently there is the one who shoots pheasant and the one who buys menu cards and now another who buys pictures ingram looked a little embarrassed but he was amused too one cant knock about the world without making friends he said lightly do you recollect what apolinarius says for i am the only one of my friends i rely on but the chinese have a better maxim still there are plenty of acquaintances in the world but very few real friends is the picture friend only an acquaintance asked mollie rather provokingly no indeed returned ingram energetically we are like brothers he and i and i have known him all my life well miss mollie do you think your father would be willing to let my friend have king canute it is a famous subject and brings back the memories of ones school days and then he walked to the picture and stood before it as though he were fascinated but in reality he was saying to himself now what am i to offer for this very mawkish and stilted performance and the question was so perplexing that he fell into a brown study mollie looked at her sister she was brimful of excitement but waveney shook her head would it not be better for your friend to see the picture first she said in a cool businesslike tone but inwardly she was just as excited as mollie ten pounds would pay all they owe to barber and chandler would wait i am sure that father would be pleased to see any one who cared to look at the picture she finished boldly mr ingram regarded her pleasantly you are very good but there is not the slightest occasion to trouble you i am my friends agent in this sort of thing i have been abroad a good deal and have served my apprenticeship to art i am an art critic dont you know now would you mind telling me miss ward how much your father expected to get from the dealers i dont know returned waveney doubtfully there was no fixed price was there mollie father told us that he would be content with ten pounds my dear miss ward returned ingram in a tone of strong remonstrance your father undervalues himself ten pounds for that work of art heaven forgive me all the fibs i am telling he added mentally and then he cleared his throat i am no jew and must decline to drive a hard bargain if mr ward will let my friend have king canute i shall be willing to pay on his behalf fiveandtwenty pounds i meanlooking calmly at the girls agitated facefiveandtwenty guineas they were too overwhelmed with surprise and pleasure to answer him and just at that momentthat supreme momentthey heard their fathers latchkey ingram described the little scene later on to a dear friend it was atalantas race dont you know they both wanted to reach their father first he was the golden apple pro tem the lame miss ward had long odds but my littlefriend of the omnibus beat her hollow can you fancy titania coming down her ladder of cobwebs well you should see miss ward number two running downstairsit would give you a notion of it and there was the golden apple on the doormat waiting for her you are very absurd returned his hearer laughing but your description amuses me so please go on there is something very refreshing in such originality he murmured languidly i have an idea that gwen would love those girls gwen is all for nature and reality conventionality might have suggested that it was hardly mannerly to leave a guest in an empty room even for golden apples but no such idea would have occurred to the misses ward they even forgot that sound ascends and that i could hear every word dear me that was very awkward but the lady spoke maliciously i could hear every word he repeated and then his eyes twinkled but he was honourable enough not to repeat the little conversation father monsieur blackie is upstairs and here mollie giggled his real name is ingram but ann calls him mr inkpen all right my pet so i suppose i had better go upstairs but waveney pulled him back wait a moment father dear what a hurry you are in and your hair is so rough and your coat is dusty give me the brush mollie we must put him tidy dad such a wonderful thing has happened mr ingram wants to buy king canute for a rich friend who has a picturegallery and he will pay you fiveandtwenty guineas nonsense child but from his tone mr ward was becoming excited too let me pass mollie you are forgetting your manners children leaving a visitor alone and everard ward marched into the studio with his head unusually high the golden apple alias ward pere was a shabby fair little man with a face like a greek god continued ingram he must have been a perfect adonis in his youth he had brown pathetic eyes rather like a spanielsyou know what i mean eyes that seemed always to be saying i am a good fellow though i am down on my luck and i should like to be friends with you it was evident that the two men took to each other at once ingrams pleasant manners and undisguised cordiality put mr ward at his ease and in a few minutes they were talking as though they were old friends the subject of king canute was soon brought forward again and ingram explained matters with a good deal of tact and finesse everard ward reddened and then he said bluntly you are very good mr ingram to offer me such a handsome price but sheer honesty compels me to say the picture is not worth more than ten pounds i have not worked out the subject as well as i could wish and then he added a little sadly it is a poor thing but my own my dear sir returned ingram airily we artists are bad critics of our own work my friends regard me as an optimist but i call myself an idealist i am a moral sisyphus for ever rolling my poor stone up the hill difficulty then as he noticed mollies puzzled look he continued blandly sisyphus was a fraudulent and avaricious king of corinth whose task in the world of shades is to roll a large stone to the top of a hill and fix it there the unpleasant part of the business is that the stone no sooner reaches the hilltop than it bounds down again excuse this lengthy description which reminds me a little of sandford and merton but revenons a nos moutons i am ready mr ward to take the picture for my friend at the price i mentioned to your daughters and as i have the money about meand here he produced a russian leather pocketbooki think we had better settle our business at once everard ward was only human and the bait was too tempting his conscience told him that the picture was a failure and hardly worth more than the cost of the frame and yet such is the vanity innate in man that he was willing to delude himself with the fancy that the strangers eyes had detected merit in it and indeed ingrams manner would have deceived any one it is the very thing he wants for the alcove he murmured stepping back a few paces and regarding the picture through half closed eyes the light will be just right andhere he appeared to swallow something with difficultythe effect will be extremely good and then he began counting the crisp banknotes waveneys eyes began to sparkle and she and mollie telegraphed little messages to each other not only the insolent barker would be paid but the muchenduring chandler when mr ward went downstairs to open the door for his guest waveney threw her arm round her sister and dragged her down upon grumps oh mollie i quite love that dear little monsieur blackie she cried enthusiastically think of ten whole pounds to spend father can have a new greatcoat and noel those boots he wants so dreadfully and you must have a new jacketi insist on it mollie i shall do very well with my old one until christmas but mollie would not hear of this for a moment if any one had the new jacket it must be waveney what did it matter what a poor little cinderella wore at home and they both got so hot and excited over the generous conflict that mr ward thought they were quarrelling until he saw their faces i like that fellow he said rubbing his hands he is gentlemanly and agreeable he told me in confidence that though he calls himself an artist he only dabbles in art if a relative had not left me a nice little property i should long ago have been in queer street he said in his droll way oh then he is not poor as we are observed mollie in a disappointed tone no he is certainly not poor returned her father laughing i should think he is tolerably welltodo judging from appearances and certainly he has rich friends he has asked my permission to call again when he is in the neighbourhood and both the girls were pleased to hear this waveney had not seen her old friends at the hospital for more than a week so one morning she went across to wish them goodbye she had a little cake that mollie had made for them and some tobacco that she had bought with her own money it was a wet day and most of the pensioners were in the big hall one of them told waveney that sergeant mcgill was in his cubicle with the corporal as usual in attendance they do say the sergeants a bit poorly continued her informant and a moment afterwards she came upon corporal marks stumping along the corridor with a newspaper in his hand the little man looked dejected but he saluted waveney with his usual dignity i hear the sergeant is not well i trust it is nothing serious then the corporal shook his head and his blue eyes were a little watery well no miss ward not to say seriouswe are none of us chickens so to speak and we have most of us cut our wisdom teeth a good many years ago the sergeant has been poorly for a week now he is down in the mouth and i cant rouse him nohow would you believe it miss ward i was trying to argify with him this morning about that there sepoy for it stands to reason mcgill i said to him that there could only be two of them and he fairly flew at me lost his temper and told me i was an infernal liar why you might have knocked me down with a feather i was so taken aback and the corporals droll face was puckered up with care never mind corporal returned waveney soothingly mcgill was ill and not himself or he would not have been so irritable with his old comrade look here i have come to bid you all goodbye because i am going away and my sister has made you one of those cakes you like and i have brought you some tobacco then the corporals face cleared a little they found the old soldier lying on his bed with a rug over his feet his face looked drawn and pallid at the sound of waveneys light step he turned his sightless eyes towards her and a strange expression passed over his features there was only one step that was as light he murmured in his thick soft voice and that was sheilas and hers hardly brushed the dewdrops from the heather then as waveney took hold of his great hand and it was her small fingers too the brown little hands that carried the creel of peat and stacked it underneath the eaves and it is sheila that has come to meheaven bless her sweet facebefore i take the long journey my dear old friend do you not know me and waveney looked anxiously at him it is not sheila it is miss ward who has come to wish you goodbye then the old man looked bewildered and raised himself on the pillow and are you ferry well miss ward and it is i who have made the mistake like the old fool that i was it may be i was dreamingi was always clever at the dreams as the corporal knows but it seemed to me as though i could see the blue water of the loch and the grey walls of our cottage and the shingly roofs and even the cocks and hens pecking in the dust and there was sheila coming up from the beach with her bare feet and red kerchief tied over her dark hair and her smile was like sunshine and her hands were full of great scarlet poppies and if it was a dream it was a good dream was sheila your sister asked waveney softly for she knew that sergeant mcgill had never been married though the corporal was a widower then at the beloved name mcgill roused to complete consciousness no miss ward i had no sister only six brothers and sheila was the lass of my heart and when i had got my stripes we were to have married but it was my fate for when i came from the wars there was the loch and the purple moors and the grey walls of the cottage but sheila she would never come to meet me again with the poppies in her hand and the wild rose in her cheek she lay in the graveyard on the hillside where the dead can hear the bees humming in the heather but it is not the goot manners to be telling you of the old troubles and very soon it is sheila herself that i shall see tell miss ward the message that sheila left with her mother mcgill it was this that she said he continued in a proud tone you must bid fergus mcgill not to grieve he is a grand soldier and a good lad and dearly i would have loved to have been his wife but gods will be done tell him i will be near the gates and that if the angels permit that it is sheila who will be there to welcome him that message must have made you very happy returned waveney tenderly they were goot words and i do not deny that they have given me comfort replied mcgill solemnly but for years i had a heavy heart for when a highlander loses the lass of his heart the world is a barren place to him but it is the truth that sheila has spoken and it is herself that i shall see with these dim old eyes he sank back a little heavily on the pillows waveney leant over him and spoke gently in his ear mcgill she said in her clear girlish voice do you know you have hurt the poor corporals feelings you were angry with him this morning and called him names then there was a flush of shame on the grand old face it was myself that was in fault miss ward for i lost my temper but it is not the corporal who will quarrel with his old comrade it was the liar that i called him but it was i who disgraced myself never mind old mate i was wrong to argify and so we are quits there for it stands to reason continued the corporal that when a man is poorly he is not in a condition for fighting still it was the bad manners to be calling any one a liar returned sergeant mcgill but a highlanders temper is not always under control so i ask your pardon marks but it was three sepoys that i killed with my own hand and i had the third by the throat dear sergeant interposed waveney softly corporal marks quite understands all that and what does it mattera little difference between two old friends then a strangely sweet smile lighted up the wrinkled old face it is the voice of sheila and what will she be saying again and again blessed are the peacemakersand they are grand words shall i read to you a little asked the girl timidly then the corporal took down an old brown testament from the shelf and waveney read slowly and reverently passage after passage until the heavy breathing told her that mcgill was asleep then she closed the book and went out into the corridor he is very ill she said sorrowfully so feeble and so unlike himself but the corporal refuted this stoutly mcgill is but poorly he returned so gruffly that waveney did not venture to say more when he has taken a bottle or two of the doctors stuff he will pick up a bit he sleeps badly and that makes him drowsy and confused and then he saluted and stumped back to his comrade waveney heard a different story downstairs have you seen mcgill two or three said to her the poor chap he is breaking fast the corporal wont believe it but it is plain as a pikestaff and so on mollie dear observed waveney sadly i have such bad news to tell you dear old sergeant mcgill is very ill and i fear he is going to die and what will the corporal do without him and it is so strange she went on he thinks he is a lad again in his highland home and that his sweetheart sheila is coming to meet him he calls her the lass of his heart and it is all so poetical and beautiful and waveneys voice was so full of pathos that mollies eyes filled with sympathetic tears chapter xi a noticeable man with large grey eyes as high as we have mounted in delight in our dejection do we sink as low wordsworth after all mollie had her way and waveney in spite of piteous pleading and remonstrance became the reluctant possessor of a warm dress and jacket mr ward had put his foot down in a most unexpected manner if waveney would not buy her jacket he would go without his greatcoat barker and chandler had been paid and there was sufficient money for everything and when waveney understood that any shabbiness on her part would be grievous in his eyes she yielded at once if father wishes it i will get the things she said to mollie but i never enjoy anything unless you share it but mollie would not listen to this what does it matter about me she said gaily i am only a poor little cinderella whose pumpkin coach has not arrived my old jacket will do quite well until christmas and then when the purchases were made mollie was like a sunbeam for the rest of the day waveney went twice to the hospital before she started for erpingham but each time she found mcgill more rambling and confused and though he roused at the sound of her voice he always thought she was sheila corporal marks looked more dejected than ever but he maintained that the sergeant was doing finely waveney thought it was only the little mans natural pugnacity and habit of arguing and that he did not really believe his own assertion but though he pretended to grumble he nursed his friend devotedly that there corporal never leaves him one of the pensioners remarked to waveney you would think they were brothers to see themand fight they would too about those plaguey sepoys that you might have taken them for a pair of kilkenny cats but bless you miss it was just for the fun of it the days slipped away all too fast and one morning mollie awoke with the thought that only one whole day remained before waveney left home they were very busy all the morning packing her box and in the afternoon waveney who felt restless and rather lowspirited at the sight of mollies woebegone face proposed they should visit their favourite haunts the lime avenue old ranelagh and the embankment it is so warm and the house feels so stuffy she added for waveney loved air and exercise and would gladly have been out of doors the greater part of the day mollie willingly assented to this but she was languid and out of spirits and soon grew tired so they sat down under an acacia in old ranelagh and watched the children playing round them it was one of those golden days of september when the very air seems impregnated with strange sweet fragrance when one thinks of waving cornfields and how the wheat ripples in the breeze like a yellow sea and of deep quiet laneswith nut copses and blackberry thicketsor better still of a hillside clothed with purple heather as though nature had flung one of her royal robes aside a day when the grand old earth seemed mellow and ripe for the sickle of old time and a soft sadness and sense of quiet brooding are over everything the summer is over it seemed to say and the fleeting shows of youth and the fruits of the earth are garnered in natures storehouse and the feast of all good things is ready so eat and enjoy and be thankful the sisters were sitting hand in hand and waveneys small face looked pinched and long from inward fretting for she was one who took the troubles of life with outward calmness and chafed under them inwardly but the sunshine and the crisp sweet air and the soft patter of red and yellow leaves brought their message of comfort mollie she said trying to speak cheerfully i am thinking what a beautiful world it is and how good life is after all in spite of worries here we are making ourselves miserable because i have to go away tomorrow do you know we are like those two foolish children we saw that day when father took us in the country dont you remember how they cried because their nurse wanted them to go down a laneit was so dark and narrow they said and they were sure the wolves would eat them up but the nurse knew there was that lovely open meadow beyond do you read my little parable dear yes i think so returned mollie but she spoke doubtfully waveney was rather prone to moralise when she found herself alone with mollie she called it thinking aloud mollie was her other self she could tell her things that she would not have breathed to any other creature well you see went on waveney one has steep little bits of road now and then like that poor king of corinthsisyphuswas not that his name we have to roll our stone up the hill difficulty but one never knows what may happen next by the bye mollie i rather fancy that monsieur blackie only pretends to play at things and that he is really a clever man there is something i cannot make out about him he is mysterious and then why did he buy king canute because his friend wanted a historical picture returned mollie who always believed what people said i know he told us so replied waveney thoughtfully mollie i have a sort of conviction that you will often see himthat he means to turn up pretty frequently at cleveland terrace whatever makes you think so asked mollie much astonished at this what a ridiculous idea wave when you told him yourself that you were leaving home tomorrow but he does not come to see me retorted waveney and then she added hastily he is a friendly sort of person and comes to see us all oh yes of course returned mollie perfectly satisfied with this view of the case then i daresay he will come sometimes when father is at home he asked me very particularly when he was likely to be in and if i went out in the afternoon and i said oh dear no i always go out early to do the marketing and then i am too tired to go out again waveney he did look so kindly at me when i said that walking tires you then what a pity and he seemed quite sorry for me he is a nice little black prince replied waveney rather absently the children had left the gardens with their nurses and the place was now quite deserted the next moment a gentleman crossed the lime avenue and walked slowly down the path as he passed their bench he looked at the two girls in a quiet observant way and passed on as soon as he was out of hearing waveney said a little wickedly mollie we have found him at last the noticeable man with large grey eyes for this was an old joke of theirs they had been reading wordsworth together one summers day on this very bench and when waveney had come to this stanza she had laid down the book i like that description mollie she had said it gives one a pleasant idea of a person a noticeable man with large grey eyes now i wonder if we shall ever see any one answering to that description mollie laughed and looked interested when waveney said this but a moment later she whispered hush he is coming back and then to mollies alarmfor she was very shy and timidhe stopped and lifted his hat will you have the kindness to inform me he said addressing mollie in a peculiarly clear mellow voice if this path will take me to dunedin terrace i am not well acquainted with chelsea mollie blushed and looked confused topography was not her strong point i think so i am not quite sure do you know waveney yes but it is rather a roundabout way dunedin terrace is quite half a mile away and then waveney rose from the bench and considered her bearings while the stranger quietly awaited her decision he was a tall man and though his face was plain there was something in his expression that attracted notice an air of unmistakable refinement and culture the keen grey eyes had already noted mollies lovely face now they were fixed on the plainer sister i think i can direct you properly now observed waveney with her usual brightness but it is just a little complicated you must go out of this gate and cross cleveland terrace take the second turning to the right and the first to the left and you will be in upper dunedin terrace thank you very much and then he repeated her directions gravely and slowly and then lifting his hat with another thank you walked quickly away yes i was right continued waveney he is certainly a noticeable man and what large clear eyes but mollie shrugged her shoulders a little pettishly i think he was rather ugly she remarked and he is quite oldfiveandthirty at least and did you notice his shabby coatwhy it was almost as shabby as fathers no returned waveney i did not notice that i was only thinking what a grandlooking man he was and he spoke so nicely too then as mollie was evidently not interested she changed the subject and they sat talking until it was time for them to go home to tea it was a melancholy evening in spite of all waveneys efforts mr ward was tired and dull and noel was out of humour but his sisters who understood him thoroughly knew that this was only his mode of expressing his feelings so he drew up his coatcollar and answered snappishly whenever waveney addressed him and grew red and pretended to be deaf when she alluded to her going away and when she was bidding him goodnight and her fingers touched his rough hair caressingly he threw back his head with an annoyed jerk i hate having my hair pulled he said crossly so give over old stormandstress and then he whistled and walked out of the room with his chin in the air but not before waveney saw that his glasses were misty mollie darling remember i shall be home on sunday and it is tuesday now were waveneys last words as she jumped into the train and her father closed the door waveney stood at the window until the dark tunnel hid them from her sight mollies sweet face was swollen with crying and her fathers countenance was sad and full of care the child whom he had cherished with peculiar tenderness was leaving his roof because he was incapable of providing for his household properly he had been a failure all his life and he knew it but it was bitter to him that his old friend althea should know it too waveney took a cab when she reached dereham the driver touched his hat when she told him to drive to the red house erpingham i know it he said as he took off his horses nosebag there aint a cabdriver in dereham that dont know the ladies at the red house they give us a supper in christmas week and there is another for the costers that use their donkeys welland it is a rare spread too and then he smacked his lips and jumped on the box waveney looked out and tried to interest herself in the various objects they passed but her head felt heavy as lead the common looked lovely in the afternoon sunshine and as before the children were dancing in and out the trees some little boys were sailing a boat on the pond and a newfoundland was swimming across it with a stick in his mouth some riders were cantering over the grass every one seemed gay and animated and full of life dogs barked children laughed and the cawing of rooks filled the air as they drove in at the lodge gates the two little yorkshire terriers ran out barking and the elderly maid mitchell came to the door my mistresses are out maam she said pleasantly but nurse marks has orders to make you comfortable will you please to go in and i will see to the box and pay the cabman no maam as waveney timidly offered her some money miss harford always pays the cabmen herself aye and pays them well too observed the driver with a complacent grin no arguing with a poor chap who has to work hard for his living about an extra sixpence waveney felt very strange and forlorn as she stepped into the hall with fuss and fury barking excitedly round her and then she saw a little old woman with a very long nose and hair as white as snow bundling down the wide staircase to meet her for no other word could describe nurse markss rolling and peculiar gait she is the most wonderful little old woman i have ever seen wrote waveney in her first letter home if you were to dress her in a red cloak and peaked hat she would make an excellent mother hubbard or the old woman who lived in her shoe or that ambitious old person who tried to brush the cobwebs from the sky to see her poking that long nose of hers into corners is quite killing she has bright eyes like a dormouse and a cosy voicedo you know what i mean by thatand she wears the funniest cap with a black bow at the top but there you must see her for yourself my ladies are out dearie she began at once rather breathlessly miss doreen is at the home and mrs mainwaring has sent for miss althea unexpectedly to go to some grand at home but she will be back to dinner and she begged that you would excuse her absence and i am going to take you to my room and give you some tea for you are tired dearie i know and then nurse marks led the way upstairs and waveney followed feeling as though she were the heroine of a fairystory and that some benevolent fairy had her in tow my ladies always calls this the cubbyhouse observed nurse marks in a proud tone and to my thinking it is the nicest room in the house though it is oddshaped as mitchell says and a trifle low it was oddly shaped indeed one corner had been cut off and the window a wide one had been set in an extraordinary angle so that part of the room was insufficiently lighted here there was a large japanese screen which hid the bed and washstand a round table was in the centre of the room and an old carved wardrobe and a nursery cupboard occupied the wall space some comfortablelooking rocking chairs and a worn old couch gave it a cosy aspect but the chief feature of the room was the number of photographs and watercolour paintings that covered the walls while framed ones stood by dozens on the mantelpiece and chestofdrawers one of them at once attracted waveney why that is the corporal she said in surprise corporal marks i mean and she spoke in puzzled tones aye thats jonadab returned nurse marks complacently it is a grand picture and his medals come out finely dinah thought a heap of that photo and then the bright dormouse eyes looked at waveney curiously well it beats me that you should know brother jonadab after all the world is not so big as we think it of course i know corporal marks returned waveney excitedly but there was a lump in her throat too at the sight of the little corporals familiar face with its round surprised eyes and shock of grey hair and i know sergeant mcgill too then at the mention of mcgill nurse marks sat down and indulged in a hearty laugh well now if that is not like a book and you are the young lady that jonadab is always telling about is it not comfortable to know that their good works do follow them thats true even in this world for it stands to reason that things cant be hidden for ever sit down dearie and i will pour you out some tea you are a bit homesick and strange but that will pass so keep up your heart dear lamb and nurse marks poked her long nose into the teapot for she was shortsighted and waveney watched her a little anxiously but she need not have feared nurse marks was a clever woman and could always measure her distances accurately aye he is a grand man mcgill she remarked as she cut some delicate breadandbutter with a practised hand but he is not long for this world jonadab will miss him sorely i fear they are a queer pair to look at them but they are just bound up in each other they are like a couple of old children i tell them they quarrel just for the sake of making it up but there as dinah used to saypoor thingher man was fine at argifying was dinah your brothers wife aye dearie and jonadab thought a deal of her and grieved sore when the dear lord took her you will be wondering at his name maybe for it is out of the common is jonadab but mother used to tell us that when the boy came father was so proud and pleased that he went at once to the bible for a name and presently he came to mother looking as pleased as possible as though he had found a treasure rachel he says in a loud voice there is not a finer fellow to my thinking than jonadab the son of rechab and he was dead against the drink too and it is jonadab that we will call him and so jonadab it was finished nurse marks complacently chapter xii the panzy room and cosy nook there is rosemary that is for remembrance and there is pansies thats for thoughts shakespeare that way madness lies let me shun that king lear it was impossible for waveney not to be amused by nurse marks quaint tales her sense of humour was too strong and the atmosphere of the cubbyhouse was so full of comfort that in spite of herself her sad face began to brighten if you knew sergeant mcgill she said presently perhaps you knew his sweetheart sheila too then nurse marks smiled and nodded as she cut another appetising slice of breadandbutter and laid it on waveneys platesuch sweet homemade bread and fresh creamy butter aye dearie i knew sheila mctavish well for when i was a slip of a girl i had a bad illness and my mothers cousin effie stuart took me back with her to the highlands to bide with her for more than a year the mctavish cottage was next to ours and not a day passed that i did not see sheila coming up from the lochside with her creel with her bare feet and red petticoat and maybe a plaid over her bonnie brown hair i was always a homely body even in my young days but never before or since have i seen a lovelier face than sheila mctavish the flower of the deesidethat was what they called her was she engaged to mcgill then aye my dearie she had broken the sixpence with him but he was away in india then i remember one day as i sat on the churchyard wall sheila came over the moor and she had a sprig of white heather in her hand she held it up to me with a smile it is good luck kezia she said and her eyes seemed full of brown sunshine and this morning i have heard from fergus mcgill himself and it is he who is the guid lad with his letters he is coming home he says and then we are to be wed and it is the white heather that will bring us luck ah dearie before three weeks were over sheila our sweet flower of the deeside lay in her coffin and they put the white heather on her dead breast and when fergus mcgill came home there was only the grave under the rowan tree there there it is a queer world finished nurse marks and there is many a lovestory left unfinished for man and woman too is born into trouble and i know that the women get the worst of it sometimes for it stands to reason continued the old woman garrulously that they think a deal more of a love tale now as we have finished tea shall i take you to your room my dearie it is called the pansy room and is close to mine miss althea is a grand one for giving names all the bedrooms are called after flowers to match the paper and cretonne there is the rose room and the forgetmenot and the pink room and the leafy room and the marigold room where they put gentlemen which is miss altheas asked waveney quickly oh the rose room miss althea has a passion for roses miss doreen sleeps in the forgetmenot room everything is blue there the other rooms are for their guests but near the servants quarters there are two pretty little attics called faith and charity where they put shopgirls who have broken down and need a rest and these are never empty all the year round there is a little sittingroom attached where they take their meals there they are crossing the tennislawn this moment from the porch house the tall one is laura cairns she has had an operation and has only just left the hospital and the little fat one is ellen sturt there is not much the matter with her except hard work and too much standing oh how good they are thought waveney as nurse marks bundled down the passage before her every one seems to have something to say in their praise even the cabdriver and then she looked round the pansy room well pleased it was so fresh and dainty and pretty and after her room at cleveland terrace so luxuriously comfortable for there was actually a cosylooking couch and an easychair and beautiful flowers on the toilettable and some hanging bookshelves full of interesting books the window looked over the tennislawn with the porch house where the girls were pacing arminarm one of them looked up at the window and smiled a little as waveney gazed down at her nurse marks who was already beginning to unpack went on talking briskly it was miss altheas thought but miss doreen helped her to carry it out it is always like that with my ladies they are just the two halves of a pair of scissors but they work together finely what one says the other does it is like the precious ointment thats what it is miss ward my dear and never a misunderstanding or a contrary word between them the girls come for a month and sometimes they stay longer and if they are well enough they wait on themselves or if not reynolds the under housemaid sees to them and when the weather permits they are in the garden or on the common the whole day long and they have the run of the porch house too and help themselves to books from the library they are no trouble and fall in with our ways and the blessing the red house is to some of those poor things is past my telling now dearie shall i hang these things in the wardrobe for youthere is plenty of room and to spare and then i will go back and finish a bit of mending for miss althea waveney was not sorry to be left alone she wanted to begin a letter to mollie she had so much already to tell her so she sat down at the writingtable and her pen flew over the paper until a quick light tap at her door roused her and miss althea entered waveney gave a vivid description of her to mollie afterwards she looked so grand and stately that i felt quite shy but her dress was charming it was a soft cloudy grey but it shimmered as though it were streaked with silver and she had a close little bonnet that looked like silver too and a ruff of fine cobwebby lace round her long neck i fancy she always wears a ruff and she looked more like queen bess than ever somehow she is oddly picturesque and makes other people look commonplace beside her but there you must see her one day for yourself althea came up to the writing table as waveney rose a little confused and held out her hand to the girl with one of her winning smiles i was so sorry to be out when you arrived she said kindly but my aunt mrs mainwaring sent for me most unexpectedly i hope nurse marks took good care of you oh yes returned waveney shyly she was very kind oh my dear old nurse is the kindest creature in the world she literally bubbles over with benevolence is not the cubbyhouse delightful did you see the toy cupboard where all our dear old dolls and toys are stored marks wont part with one of them she is quite huffy if we propose to give them away when children come to the house she lets them play with them under her own eye one day she came into the library with a long face to tell me that little audrey neale had broken bopeeps arm and althea laughed quite merrily then she looked at the clock on the mantelpiece and uttered an exclamation halfpast seven and i am not dressed what will peachey say i will come back and fetch you directly the gong sounds and then waveney was left to finish her letter she did not see miss doreen until they entered the diningroom and then she welcomed her very cordially to waveney the dinnertable was a revelation she had never taken a meal out of her own home and the soft shaded lights the hothouse fruits and flowers the handsome silver and the fineness of the damask excited her wonderment the servant moved so noiselessly over the thick carpets and then she thought of ann stumping round the table in her heavy boots ah they would be just sitting down to supper and mollie would be mixing the salad as usual for everard ward had learnt to enjoy a salad in his paris days and would sup contentedly on breadandcheese or even breadandbutter if only he could have a handful of cress or a stalk or two of endive to give it a relish doreen and althea were quite aware that the forlorn little stranger was not at her ease the small childish face looked subdued and thoughtful and the dark spirituelle eyes were sad in their wistfulness but with their usual tact and kindness they left her alone and talked to each other in their cheerful way althea gave a description of her afternoon party which was full of gentle humour and doreen had a great deal to say about the home she had had tea with old mrs wheelerand as usual the poor old soul was full of her grievances against miss mason she is a cantankerous eastwindy sort of body went on doreen with a laugh as she helped herself to some grapes and she leads poor miss mason a life but there one must not judge her she has led a hard grinding sort of existence althea these grapes are unusually fine dont you think laura cairns would enjoy some ellen likes pears better and then doreen heaped up a plate with fine fruit and bade mitchell take it to the brown parlour when the sisters rose from the table althea touched waveneys arm come with me to the library she said in a kind voice we shall sit there this evening we do not often use the drawingroomit is a very big room and we always feel rather lost in it i call this big too remarked waveney in rather an awed voice she had never seen such a beautiful room in her life it was better than any of the dream rooms at kitlands the grand oriel window with its cushioned seat the carved oak furniture and bookcases filled with handsomelybound books the fine engravings on the wallsall excited her admiration but when althea drew back a curtain and showed her a tiny room hidden away behind it with a glassdoor opening on the terrace she could not refrain from an exclamation of delight oh what a dear little room she said quite naturally yes i call it my cosy nook but it is not really a room it is merely a recess and waveney thought how well miss altheas name suited it there was a small writingtable prettily fittedup an easychair and a worktable i am so glad you have taken a fancy to it went on miss altheaand she looked very much pleasedbecause this is to be your little sanctum you see it would never do for me to have my reader and companion far away from me and yet i imagine we should both find it irksome to be always togethereven my sister and i could not stand that but you see when the curtain is dropped you will be quite private and it is really for me and waveneys eyes sparkled with pleasure then miss althea smiled and put her hand kindly on the girls arm i want you to be happy with us my dear and not to look upon us as strangers because in the old days your father was a dear friend of ours last night an idea struck me do you think you would feel more at home with us if we were to call you by your christian name you have such a pretty name and it is so uncommon oh please do returned waveney flushing with shy pleasure it was silly of me but i was so dreading that miss ward and somehow a load seemed lifted off her at that moment she is such a little childish thing observed miss althea afterwards and yet she has plenty of character we are very unconventional people doreen you and i but i never could endure these artificial barriers my dignity such as it is is innate it does not need bolstering up i could not be stiff and proper with everard wards daughter and then a strangely sad look came into altheas eyes as though some ghost from the past had crossed her path no certainly not to everard wards daughter and doreen smiled as though she understood her doreens world was inhabited by warmblooded human beings no ghostly visitants ever haunted her i am a woman without a story she would say most people have some sort of romance in their liveseven unmarried women have their unfinished idylls but my life has been bare prose but she always laughed when she made these speeches for there was nothing morbid in doreens character althea proposed as the evening was mild and balmy that they should take a turn in the garden it will be very pleasant on the terrace and in the kitchengarden she remarked but of course we must avoid the grass are not these shutin lawns pretty through that arch if it were light enough you would have a glimpse of my flowergarden i call it mine because i give it my special supervision doreen takes more interest in the kitchengarden and when i boast of my roses and begonias she is dilating on the excellence of her strawberries and tomatoes i think i should care most for the flowergarden observed waveney and then of her own accord she began telling miss althea about the pensioners little gardens and the corporals flowers althea listened with much interest and then little by little her quiet questions and sympathetic manner induced waveney to break through her shy reserve and speak of her home althea soon found out all she wanted to know the home that was so perfect in waveneys eyes the little warm nest that held all her dear ones seemed meagre and bare to the elder woman who had been used to luxury all her life and had never had a want ungratified as the girl talked on in a naive way all at once a vision rose before altheas eyes of a brilliantlylighted ballroom and of a fair boyishlooking man with stephanotis in his buttonhole standing before her with eager looks it is our valse althea and i have been looking forward to it all the evening and thenand thenbut she started from her reverie with a quick feeling of shame why had these thoughts come to her he was dorothys lover not hers had he ever cared for her really it was all a mistake it was not he who was to blame it was ii and even in the september darkness she smote her hands angrily together the love had been in her imagination it had never existednever she had bartered her warm womans heart for a shadow and alas alas it was not in altheas nature to change if i love once i love for ever she had once said in a bitter moment to doreen how she repented that speech afterwards no you do not understand neither do i but i think it is my nature to be faithful when althea roused from her brooding she found that waveney had become silent you were speaking of your sister were you not she said gently some one told me she continued a little vaguely that she was very pretty oh yes returned waveney eagerly everyone thinks mollie quite lovely it is such a pity she is lame it spoils things so much for her poor darling but people admire her just the samein the street they turn round and stare at her but mollie never seems to notice them a bit that reminds me of such a funny speechand here waveney began to laugh an old irishwoman who works for us sometimes once said to her it is my belief miss mollie darlint that the powers above were after fashioning an angel and then they thought better of it and changed it into a fleshandblood woman for the angel still laughs out of your eyes mavourneen and would you believe it miss harford that mollie only burst out laughing when biddy said that but i think it was beautiful i must see your pretty mollie returned althea thoughtfully but we must go in now i think i must tell moritz that she said to herself with a smile the angel still laughs out of your eyes mavourneen how very like an irishwoman chapter xiii concerning guardian angels and ithuriels spear though many a year has oer us rolld since lifes bright morningtide im dreaming still the dream of old we once dreamt side by side helen marion burnside it had been a long trying day to waveney and it was a great relief when she found herself again in the pansy room it was still early in the evening but as soon as the door had closed upon the girl althea rose from her chair i have had a tiring afternoon dorrie she said in rather a weary voice a welldressed crush always flattens meso many smart bonnets and so few brains somehow society always reminds me of a trifle all sweetness and froth arent you a little mixed althea returned her sister goodhumouredly there is froth certainly but in my experience there is plenty of richness and sweetness underneath if you only dig deep enough oh i daresay and then a droll idea came to althea and she laughed softly dont you remember the gingerbread queens that we used to buy when we were children at the medhurst fair and how angry i was when some one stripped the gilt off i thought it was real goldlike nebuchadnezzars image well some of those fine ladies reminded me of the gingerbread queens doreen looked amused you are in a pessimistic mood dear then she put her hands on her sisters shoulders and scrutinised her face a little anxiously you are very tired are your eyes paining you althea no dear but i think i shall go to bed but when she had left the room doreen did not at once resume her book i wonder what is troubling her she said to herself i know her expression so well and with all her little jokes she is not at ease i hope that we have not made a grievous mistake in engaging miss wardand yet she seems a nice little thing but there is a look in altheas eyes tonight as though she had seen a ghost when one is no longer young the ghosts will come and then doreen sighed and took up her book althea was very tired but it was mental not bodily fatigue that had brought the dark shadows under her eyes but it was not her habit to spare herself or to shunt her duties so instead of going straight to her room she turned down the passage that led to the two little chambers where their humbler guests slept and sat for a few minutes beside laura cairns bed the girl slept badly and altheas sympathetic nature guessed intuitively how a few cheering words would sweeten the long night and she never missed her evening visit it is better to lie awake in the country than in tottenham court roads she said presently then laura smiled oh yes miss harford it is so heavenly the peace and silence but at first it almost startled me in london the cabs and carts are always passing and there seems no quiet at all but here one can lie and think of the birds in their nests and how good it is to be free from pain oh i am so much better and it is all owing to your kindness and this dear old place and here the girls lips rested for a moment on the kind hand that held hers but you will not leave me without my message miss harfordfor it was one of altheas habits to give what she called night thoughts to the sick girls who came to the red house althea paused a moment for once she had forgotten it then some words of thomas a kempis came to her seek not much rest but much patience and she repeated them softly will that do laura oh yesand thank you so much miss harford not much rest but much patience i must remember that i must remember it too thought althea and then she went to the cubbyhouse to bid her old nurse goodnight and to have a little chat with her nurse marks was loud in her praises of waveney i like her miss althea my dear she said eagerly she has pretty manners and a good heart dear dear just to think of it being jonadabs young lady he thinks a deal of her does jonadab she will be a comfort to you my dearie but there you are looking weary my lamb and peachey will be waiting to brush your hair and althea was thankful to be dismissed she sent peachey away as soon as possible and then sat down in an easy chair by the window her eyes were aching but the darkness rested them she was a good sleeper generally but tonight she knew that no wooing of the drowsy god would avail her doreen was right and the ghost of the past had suddenly started up in her path altheas youth had been a very happy one until the day when she and everard ward had gathered peaches together in the walled garden at kitlands and then it had seemed to her as though they were the very apples of sodommere dust and ashes everard had judged his own case far too leniently he had been eager to clear himself from blame a young fellow has his fancies before he settles down finally he would say in his careless way oh yes you are right egerton i was sweet on althea harfordthere was something fascinating about her she was rather fetching and picturesqueyou know what i mean but dorothywell it was love at first sight the real thing and no mistake i wanted to ask her to marry me that very first evening only i could not do it you know i suppose not returned his friend dryly you are a cool hand everard upon my word i wonder what miss harford thought about it all perhaps i am a bit oldfashioned but in my day we did not think it good form to pay court to one girl and marry another but this plain speaking only offended everard probably because in his inner consciousness he knew the older man had spoken the truth through the sweet spring days and the glorious months of summer everard ward had wooed the young heiress with the eager persistence that was natural to him altheas fascinating personality her gentleness and bright intelligence all dominated the young man and for a time at least he honestly believed himself in love with her he was not fickle by nature and if dorothy sinclair had not crossed his path and played rosalind to his orlando in the green glades of kitlands park he would to a certainty have married althea harford hearts do not break they say but when althea walked down the terrace steps that day with her basket of peaches on her arm she knew that the gladness and sweetness of her young life had faded and that if her heart were not actually broken it was only because her unselfishness and sense of right forbade such wreckage i shall live through it dorrie she had said to her sister in those early days of misery and god helping me it shall not make me bitter but it has robbed me of my youth one cannot suffer in this way and keep young and she was right if you could only hate him ejaculated doreen in your circumstances i know i should loathe and despise him but althea only shook her head how could i hate him when i have grown to love him with my whole heart when i have regarded myself as his but here she stopped and hid her face in her hands with a choking sob oh dorrie that is the worst of all that i should have believed it and that he never meant it that he never really loved me i think he was very fond of you althea returned doreen eagerly mother was saying so only last night yes he was fond of me we were friends but i was not his closest and dearest dorrie we must never talk of this again you and i a wound like this so sore and deep should be covered up and hidden i must hide it even from myself there is only one thing that i want to say and then we will bury our dead i cannot hate everardhatred is not in my natureand neither can i ever cease to love him oh there is no need for you to look so shockedas doreens face expressed strong disapproval of this there will be no impropriety in the love i shall bear him if i could i would be his guardian angel and keep all troubles from him then she sighed and put her hand gently on her sisters shoulder seek not much rest but much patience that shall be my new years motto we will bury our dead those had been her words and for twenty years the grass had grown over that grave and yet on this september night the ghost of her old love had haunted her and the ache of the old pain had made itself felt is there any grave deep enough to bury a womans love althea harford was nearly fortyone and yet the memory of everard ward with his perfect face and boyish winning ways his gay insouciance and lighthearted mirth made her heart throb with quickened beats of pain all these yearsthese weary yearsshe had never met any one like himnever any one whom she could compare with him people had often told her that he was not specially clever that his talents were by no means of a firstclass order but she had never believed them to her fond fancy he was the embodiment of every manly gift and beauty even dorothy with all her love for her husband would have marvelled at altheas infatuation and now everards daughter was under her roof and the knowledge that this was so had driven the sleep from her eyes and filled her with a strange restlessness waveneys smile and the turn of her head and something in her voice recalled everard more than once that evening she had winced as some familiar tone brought him too vividly before her waveneys artless confidence had given her food for thought she had long known the hard fight that everard ward was waging in his attempts to keep the wolf from the door on more than one occasion her secret beneficence had lightened his weight of care if everard had guessed who was the real purchaser of some of his pictures he would not have pocketed the money quite so happily but althea kept her own counsel if i could only be his guardian angel she had said in her girlish misery and no purer wish had ever been expressed by womans lips in some ways she had been everard wards good angel all these years still she had never realised the extent of his poverty until waveney had told her about the purchase of king canute a friend of mr ingrams wanted a historical picture and it was so fortunate that he took a fancy to king canutehe had actually paid fiveandtwenty guineas and they had paid off the disagreeable butcher and now father would have the new greatcoat that he wanted so badly waveney had said all this with girlish frankness as she and her new friend had paced up and down the garden path in the september darkness but althea had made no answer she only shivered a little as though she were cold and a few minutes later she proposed to return to the house it is a beautiful evening but we must not forget that it is september she had observed but her voice was a little strained no she had never really realised until that moment how badly things had gone with him that mention of the greatcoat had effectually opened her eyes and then as though to mock her a little scene rose before hera certain golden afternoon spent in an old studio at chelsea where everard ward and a friend had established themselves how well she remembered it and the balcony full of flowers overlooking the river with a gay awning overhead it was summer time and she had put on a white gown in honour of the occasion and everard had brought her a cluster of dark velvety roses they will give you the colour you need he had said looking at her admiringly what an ideal artist he had seemed to her in his brown velveteen coat the yellow sunshine seemed to make a halo round his fair hair you look like a glorified angel ward his friend had said laughingly what do you say miss harfordwould he not do for ithuriel in my picture of adam and eve sleeping in paradise with the evil one whispering in eves ear do you remember the passage him thus intent ithuriel with his spear touched lightly look here old man you must sit for me tomorrow but everard had only grumbled and looked bored in those days greatcoats had certainly not been lacking and as this thought occurred to her althea had shivered and become silent about fourandtwenty hours later mollie received the following letter which she carried off to her bedroom and read over and over again she had already had the note in which waveney had described the cubbyhouse and her pansy room and mollie had certainly not expected another so soon my own sweethearthere i am actually writing to you again but i know what a long weary day this has been and how my sweet moll has been missing me and i said to myself a letter by the last post will send her to sleep happily and make her think that we are not so far apart after all well and how do you think i have been spending my first day of servitude why all by myself on the common and if you had been there it would have been simply perfect the common is such a beautiful place and it stretches away for miles but you will be saying to yourself is this the way miss harfords reader performs her duties my dear child i have not seen my miss harford today at breakfast time miss doreen told me that her sister had had a bad night and that she was suffering great pain in her eyes it is so severe an attack she explained that she cannot bear a vestige of light and reading would drive her distracted her maid peachey is looking after her and most likely by evening the pain will have worn itself out and then she advised me to take a book out of the library and sit on the common as she would be absent the greater part of the day it was rather a business choosing a book but i took ayalas angel at last as it looked amusing and angels always remind me of my mollie there is that not a pretty speech the two little yorkshire terriers accompanied mefuss and furythey are such dear little fellows and it was just lovely there was a little green nook with a comfortable bench a little way back from the road and there i spent the morning miss doreen was still at the house so i had luncheon alone and afterwards i went out in the garden the two shopgirls were there they had hammock chairs under a tree the tall pale girl was working and the other was reading to her i stopped to speak to them and then i found a delightful seat in the kitchen garden it was so warm and sunny that you would have thought it was august mitchell came to tell me when tea was ready and now i am up in my pansy room writing to you there is a pillar box quite near and when i have finished it i shall slip out and post it and then a few loving messages to her father and noel closed the letter chapter xiv thursdays at the porch house and touchd by her fair tendance gladlier grew milton when waveney crossed the hall after posting her letter the dressingbell rang and mitchell who encountered her on the stairs informed her with quiet civility that both her mistresses were in the library and had desired that she would join them as soon as she was ready it did not take many minutes for waveney to brush out her curly hair and put on her white dress it was almost severe in its simplicity and absence of trimming but in hers and mollies eyes it was a garment fit for a princess and when waveney had pinched up the lace ruffles and put in the little pearl broochwhich had belonged to her mothershe was innocently pleased with her appearance she had rather a shock when she entered the library doreen was not there but althea was sitting with her back to the light with a green shade over her eyes the pale tints of her gownwaveney discovered she always wore soft neutral tintsthe pallor of her long thin face and the disguising shade gave her a strangely pathetic look she held out her hand with a faint smile i am so sorry my dear that this should have happened and on your first day too it is the worst attack i have had for months and no remedies seemed to have any effect but the pain has gone now and tomorrow i shall be myself again oh i am so glad of that i am glad of it too returned althea for i would not willingly miss one of our thursday evenings you will be surprised to hear that we have begun a course of shakespeare readings some of the girls are so intelligent and read so well our old friend mr chaytor helps us he is a barrister but a very poor one i am sorry to say but he is wonderfully clever he used to read to the girls then he got up an elocution class and now he has started these shakespeare readings and the girls do so enjoy them it sounds very nice i think you will say so we have had tempest and twelfth night and tomorrow it is to be as you like it mr chaytor is to be touchstone and the melancholy jacques rather contrasts are they not at this moment doreen reentered she looked pleased as she noticed the animation in her sisters voice and as the gong sounded she said you will like miss ward to come and talk after dinner althea while i write those letters and althea smiled and nodded she looks very ill waveney said in a low voice as they walked down the corridor oh yes returned miss harford she always looks bad after one of these attacks it is the pain you seemy sister does not bear pain well it wears her out waveney felt relieved when dinner was over doreen was very kind and pleasant but she was not a great talker and hardly knew how to interest her young companion girls were more in altheas line she said to herself althea had such marvellous sympathy and understood them so thoroughly she herself got on better with older women and once or twice she smiled in an amused way when she lifted her eyes from her plate and saw the little figure in white opposite her she reminded me of one of moritzs pictures she said afterwards to althea whichever could it be i have been puzzling myself all dinnertime the white frock makes her look more like a child than ever her eyes are lovely but she is not pretty not exactly but i like her face i expect you mean that picture of undine yes she is wonderfully like it only this undine has her soul by the bye we have not seen moritz for an age i shall write to gwendoline and tell her that her boy is up to mischief when waveney returned to the library she found that one or two shaded lamps had been lighted but that althea was still seated in the darkest corner of the room she bade waveney draw up a chair beside her my head is too confused to listen to reading she observed so you shall just talk and amuse me tell me anything about yourself or mollie or your brother everything human interests me and nothing in the world pleases me better than to listen to the story of other peoples lives waveney laughed but she was a little embarrassed too shall i tell you about my dear old men at the hospital she said rather nervously and althea concealed her disappointment and said yes certainly tell me anything you like and so waveney began and as usual her narrative was very picturesque and graphic but lo and behold before many minutes were over she had crossed the green sward and the lime avenue and was standing in fancy before a certain high narrow house with vinedraped balcony and an old courtyard and as she talked her eyes were shining with eagerness and now the beloved names were on her lipsfather and mollie and noel althea almost held her breath as she listened oh we were so happy exclaimed the girl i think no one could have been happierwe were never dull not even when noel was at school and father away but of course we liked the evenings best oh yes of course echoed althea softly i think the winter evenings were best returned waveney reflectively because we could make up such a lovely fire father was often cold and tired but he always smiled when he saw our fire and sometimes we would roast chestnutsthat was noels treatand tell stories and sing father has such a beautiful voice and so has mollie and when they sing in church people look round and wonder who they are your brother is happy at school then happy i should think so he is so clevereven his masters say so and then he never shirks his work like other boys oh do you know miss harford he has set his heart on getting a scholarship he is working for his examination now if he gets it we hope he will be able to go to oxford for he does so want to be a barrister but my dear eighty pounds a year would not pay his expenses at any university and then althea bit her lip as though she had said more than she intended oh we know that returned waveney eagerly but we thoughtat least noel thoughtthat perhaps the veiled prophet and then she broke into a laugh how absurd i am as though you could understand but noel is always so ridiculous and gives such funny names to people the veiled prophet is that kind friend of mothers who has sent him to st pauls a friend of your mothers my dear altheas tone was a little perplexed father always says it is some friend of mothers but of course it is all guesswork the lawyer who pays his bills tells us nothing and then partly to amuse her hearer and partly because it gave her pleasure to narrate anecdotes of the lads cleverness and sense of humour she told her how noel intended one day to go to lincolns inn and interview the old lawyer and there was something so racy in the girls manner and she imitated noels voice so well that althea who had been trying to suppress her amusement for some minutes gave up the effort and broke into a hearty laugh my dear you have done me good she said when they were serious again and my evening thanks to you has passed very pleasantly but i am going to send you away now as i must not talk any more and then as waveney rose from her chair at this dismissal she drew her gently towards her and kissed her cheek i am your friend remember that waveney she said in her quiet voice and the girl blushed with surprise and pleasure the next morning waveney was summoned to the library she found althea looking pale and weak but she had discarded her shade she was resting in a deep easychair and her lap was full of letters waveney found that her work was cut out for her and for more than an hour she was busily engaged in writing the answers dictated to her one was to mrs wainwaring and waveney felt great pleasure in writing it she had not forgotten fairy magnificent she had taken a fancy to the pretty old lady and longed to see her again when althea had finished her correspondence she put a volume of robert brownings life into the girls hand i must not use my eyes today she said with a sigh so if you will be good enough to read to me i will finish my jersey knitting and crochet are my only amusements on my blind days we work for the seamens mission and then she added brightly it is such a luxury having some one to read to me we shall get through so many nice books you and i the morning passed so quickly that both of them were surprised when the gong sounded after luncheon waveney was told to go out and amuse herself until teatime and she spent a delightful afternoon rambling over the common with fuss and fury frolicking beside her the little terriers evidently regarded her as a new playmate and were on the friendliest terms with her on going up to her room to dress for dinner which was always an hour earlier on thursdays she noticed a group of girls in the verandah of the porch house some were sitting down and others standing about with racquets in their hands through the open window she could hear merry voices and laughter laura cairns and the other girl were with them the young housemaid who waited on her volunteered an explanation as she set down the hotwater can those are the young ladies from the dereham shops maam it is early closingday with most of them and they come up early to play tennis althea looked amused when waveney repeated this speech they are young ladies to dorcas she said laughing but indeed some of these girls are so intelligent and so truly refined that one need not grudge them the term one or two of them would grace any drawingroom but of course we have our dressy smart girls too by the bye waveney do you play tennis and as waveney shook her head i thought not the houses in cleveland terrace have only small gardens and you would have no opportunity of practising but i am a devout believer in tennis mollie and i always longed to play returned waveney with a sigh but of course it was out of the question for mollie yes but it is quite possible for you and if you like nora greenwell will teach you she is our crack player even my sister who is severely critical allows that she makes wonderful strokes eh dorrie she plays exceedingly well returned doreen looking up from a scrapbook she was making for a childrens hospital but then miss greenwell does everything well she is to take rosalinds part tonight is she not althea winced slightly as doreen asked the question to her dying day she would never hear rosalinds part read or acted without secret emotion she had dreaded this evening ever since the play of as you like it was decided upon but none the less she had determined to be present yes she returned rather hastily of course mr chaytor selected that part for her as nora is certainly our best reader minnie alston will be celia and then she turned to waveney they are my two favourites when my sister wishes to tease me she calls them my two paragons and indeed i am proud of them oddly enough they serve in the same shopthat big haberdashergardiner wells miss ward has not passed the shop althea she has yet to make acquaintance with dereham why do you call her miss ward returned althea playfully it is far too stiff a name for her follow my example and call her waveney but doreen looked a little dubious at this she was a kindhearted woman but an undemonstrative one and her sisters pretty speeches and little caressing ways often filled her with envy dinner that evening was rather hurried and the moment it was over althea took up a light wrap and invited waveney to accompany her to the porch house the girls had finished their tea and were now arranging the room for their reading althea paused doubtfully on the threshold as she heard the commotion we are a little early she said and they never like me to find them in confusion i will show you the kitchen waveney is this not a nice little place and that room beyond is where the girls wash their hands and brush their hair there is a storeroom too where i keep my jams and cake a palefaced young widow was washing up the teacups as they entered she brightened up as althea addressed her that is my caretaker mrs shaw observed althea in a low voice come they are fairly quiet now and we may as well go in as mr chaytor is generally punctual waveney felt a little shy as she followed althea the great room seemed full of girls there were thirty or forty of them but althea shook hands with every one and had a pleasant word for each this is my friend miss ward she said in her clear voice to the assembled girls nora singling out a tall girl with an interesting face i am going to ask you to teach miss ward to play tennis the asphalt court behind the porch house will soon be ready thanks to the early closing movement some of you will be able to have a game before it gets dark yes indeed miss harford and we can practise our skating too interposed a pretty dark girl waveney found out afterwards that it was minnie alston and that she and nora were great chums that will be charming returned althea she looked more like queen bess than ever as she stood in the circle of girls with the light shining on her ruddy hair and soft ruffles now girls we must take our places and then she beckoned waveney to a long highbacked settle that stood by the fire the room was large and a little cold so a fire had been lighted waveney looked round with intense interest the recreation hall as it was called was of noble dimensions and evidently welllighted from the number of windows there was a platform at one end with a piano and two or three easels and half a dozen round tables with gay crimson cloths occupied the centre of the room these were at once surrounded by groups of girls some with books in their hands the floor was stained and some warmcoloured rugs gave an air of comfort a wellfilled bookcase a few wellchosen prints and a carved oak chair known as miss harfords throne comprised the remainder of the furniture this evening althea had vacated her throne for the settle and a few minutes later doreen entered the room and with a pleasant nod to the girls she seated herself by her sister althea looked pleased but she was evidently surprised waveney discovered afterwards that it was not miss harfords habit to attend the thursday meetings the sisters had their different hobbies doreens active energies found plenty of scope in her home for brokendown workers and though althea had contributed largely to it and always visited it at least once a week it was doreen who was the head and mainspring of the whole concern the committee of management comprised of a few personal friends in the neighbourhood were merely tools in her vigorous hands i wanted to hear miss greenwells rosalind she whispered and then a mans step sounded in the little passage there was a quick rap at the door the girls all rose from their seats and althea went forward with a smile of welcome you are punctual to a minute thorold she said as she shook hands miss ward this is our old friend mr chaytor but as waveney bowed demurely a sudden gleam of amusement sparkled in her eyes for lo and behold it was the noticeable man with large grey eyes who had enquired the way in ranelagh gardens chapter xv orlando to the rescue macbeth if we should fail lady macbeth we fail but screw your courage to the sticking place and well not fail shakespeare waveney was secretly piqued to see that there was no sign of recognition in mr chaytors eyes he bowed as though to a stranger in whom he took slight interest exchanged a few words with the sisters looked at his watch and then lifted his hand as a signal for silence and the buzzing girlish voices were instantly hushed the readers had already taken their places round the centre table miss harfords throne and a readingdesk stood beside it the rest of the girls had grouped themselves round the tables with their work a few of them had a volume of shakespeare in their hands the moment after mr chaytors entrance one of the girls had left the room rather hurriedly and a minute later althea was summoned mr chaytor was giving a few instructions in a low voice and had not noticed the circumstance until althea returned with a perturbed countenance i am so sorry she said in a tone of vexation it is most unfortunate but miss pierson has one of her giddy attacks and is obliged to go home she is in tears about it but as i tell her it is no fault of hers mr chaytor looked blank his audience was impatient already he had heard sundry thimbles rap the table and his readers were eager to begin but now there was no orlando what was to be done such failure was not to be borne he frowned considered the point and then looked persuasively at althea if you will be so good he began but althea shook her head and turned a little pale not for worlds would she have read that part to her relief doreen came to her aid you must not ask althea she said in her quick decided way she was quite ill yesterday and her head is not right today i wish i could help you but i am no reader as you know but there is miss ward i think she would do nicely you will help them will you not turning to waveney poor waveney was ready to sink through the ground she grew hot and then cold do try dear althea whispered coaxingly and to her dismay she found mr chaytors grave intent look fixed on her the clear grey eyes were somewhat beseeching it will be a great kindness he said your audience will not be critical miss ward let me beg you to do us this favour it is impossible i should spoil everything stammered waveney in great distress i have only once read as you like it and that was a long time ago but she might as well have spoken to the wind mr chaytor evidently had a will of his own his only reply was to put a book in her hand and offer her a chair i have promised that we will not be critical he said quietly you will soon get into the swing of it to give you confidence i will read orlandos opening speech to adam then as waveney took her place with hot cheeks and downcast eyes a delightful clapping of hands welcomed her althea looked anxious as she returned to the oak settle poor little thing she is frightened to death she whispered but thorold was so masterful with her i like men to be masterful returned doreen in an undertone but i wish he would try it on with joanna and then they both smiled and althea said hush as mr chaytors full rich tones were audible waveneys turn came all too soon her voice trembled and was sadly indistinct at first but as one girl after another took up her cue she soon forgot her nervousness and entered into the spirit of the play several of the girls read well but none of them equalled nora greenwell celia was passable and phoebe certainly understood her role but nora read with a sprightliness and animation that surprised waveney the girl seemed a born actor her enunciation was clear and the changes of expression in her voice its mirth and passion its rollicking girlish humours and droll witcheries were wonderfully rendered but it was mr chaytors reading that kept waveney spellbound when as first lord he narrates the story of the melancholy jacques and the sobbing deer the pathos of his voice brought the tears to her eyes and as touchstone his dry humour and clownish wit were so cleverly given that once waveney laughed and was covered with confusion twice the reading was interrupted by a charming little interlude when three or four girls went up on the platform and sang under the greenwood tree and blow blow thou winter wind at the conclusion of the play which was shortened purposely althea took her seat at the piano and all the girls joined in an evening hymn waveney did not sing for her heart was full the evenings performance had excited her and her imagination which was always remarkably vivid seemed suddenly to grasp the full beauty and meaning of the scene was not this christian socialism in its fairest aspect she thought could any picture be sweeter or more symbolical than that group of young faces gathered round the two dear ladies for doreen was on the platform too some of the faces were far from being beautifulsome were absolutely plain and one or two sicklylooking girls with tangled hair and decked out with cheap finery were singularly unattractive and yet as altheas long slim fingers touched the notes and the dear old tune that they had loved in childhood floated through the wide hall each face brightened into new life they are all workers thought waveney as she watched them some of them have hard toilsome lives they are away from their homes and amongst strangers and though they are so young they know weariness and heartache but when they come here it is like home to each one and it makes them happy if i were a shopgirl at dereham i should look forward to my thursday evening as i look forward to sunday and then she said to herself happily tomorrow i shall say the day after tomorrow and how delightful that will be waveney was smiling to herself when she suddenly raised her eyes and encountered mr chaytors amused glance he had evidently been watching her for some time for he was leaning back in the carved armchair with the air of a man who felt he had earned his repose the next moment he came towards her the hymn was over but the girls were still gathered round althea and wishing her goodnight under the cover of their voices he addressed waveney i have not properly thanked you for your kind assistance miss ward but i assure you that i was most grateful miss piersons indisposition had placed us in an awkward dilemma but you came to our help most nobly i am afraid i acquitted myself badly returned waveney she would have given much for a word of praise people generally liked her reading but she feared that mr chaytor would be no ordinary critic you did very well he returned quietly indeed considering you had only once read the play i ought to give you greater praise you see shakespeare is a sort of divinity to me i think a lifetime is hardly long enough to study him properly my reverence for him makes me unreasonable orlando did not suit you you would have made a better rosalind if you were staying at the red house and liked to join my thursday evening classes i could give you a few valuable hints i should like to join them observed waveney colouring a little if miss harford could spare me and as he looked a little perplexed at this she added hastily i have come to the red house as miss altheas reader and companion and this explanation evidently satisfied him but the next moment as waveney was moving away he stopped her will you pardon me miss ward if i ask if we have ever met before i have a fancy that your voicehe was going to say eyes but he checked himselfis not quite unknown to me i have been puzzling over it half the evening oh yes we have met before returned waveney who was quite at her ease now it was in old ranelagh gardens and you asked us to direct you to dunedin terrace i hope you found it and he smiled assent to this you were with your sister he hazarded and waveney nodded and then doreen joined them and mr chaytor said no more of course he recalled it now and it was only last monday too but how was he to identify the little girl in her shabby hat with this dainty little figure in white true her eyes had attracted him that day but this evening he had not seen them fully until a few minutes ago he recalled everything now the beautiful face of the other girl and the sweet refined voices of both he had wondered who they were and why they were sitting hand in hand in the sunshine and looking so sad and it was only three days ago doreen proposed that waveney should come back with her to the house my sister and mr chaytor often stop behind for a little chat about the girls she explained and waveney glancing at them as she left the room saw that she was right althea had seated herself on the settle and was holding up a small screen between her face and the firelight and mr chaytor was standing with one arm leaning against the mantelpiece looking down at her i am so glad the reading went off so well she said when the door had closed after her sister and waveney at one moment i was terribly afraid until our little orlando came to the rescue she read very nicely thorold yes very fairly considering all things but the part did not suit her i hope you were proud of your pet protegee i consider miss greenwell achieved a striking success tonight i am not easy to please but really once or twice i found myself saying bravo under my breath no as a critic you are terribly censorious thoroldyou will laugh at mebut noras cleverness and her undoubted talents almost frighten me what is the good of her learning all this euclid and french and robbing herself of some of her rest to get time for her studies if she is to spend her life in snipping off lengths of ribbon and tape from one end of the year to the other all the good in the world he returned in a most energetic tone why need the snipping of ribbon as you describe it interfere with the development of the higher life your argument is a weak one you might as well say that cutting muslin by the yard for so many hours at a stretch interferes with the religious life and yet i expect plenty of shopwomen are good christians there was a flash of amusement in altheas eyes though she pretended to be indignant how absurd you are but i will not believe that you have so misunderstood me let me explain what i really do mean i am very proud of nora but i am so afraid that all this education and cultivation will make her discontented with her surroundings no life can be perfect that is out of harmony with its environment i know a dozen girls from gardiner wells and only one of them minnie alston is worthy of noras friendship she is very lonely and as you know her home is most unsatisfactorya virago of a stepmother and a lot of boisterous children her work does not suit her but she dare not throw herself out of a situation yes i see what you mean returned mr chaytor gravely increase of knowledge often creates loneliness and one member of a family may move on a different plane where his relations cannot follow him but if they are sensible people they do not beg him to climb down to them and leave off his stargazing i think we need not disquiet ourselves about miss greenwell perhaps she may have good things waiting for her mr chaytor spoke in an enigmatical tonehe was grave and reticent by nature and some uptodate people would have thought a few of his ideas antiquated he had a great dislike to any kind of gossip and never mentioned reports which reached him until they were actually verified some one had hinted to him that nora greenwell had found favour in the eyes of her employers son robert gardiner was well educated and intelligent but his parents who were very proud of him wished him to marry well i have saved my pennies bob and when you think of taking a wife i shall buy a plot of ground in the mortimer road and build you a house but as mr gardiner said this he was thinking of his partners only childannie wells she was a pretty freshlooking girl and when her father died she would have six or seven thousand poundsfor gardiner wells drove a flourishing trade in dereham if mr chaytor had mentioned this report to althea it would have thrown a little light on a circumstance that had come under her observation there had been a mistake in her quarterly account with gardiner wells and one thursday afternoon robert gardiner had walked up to the red house to speak to miss harford althea kept him waiting for ten minutes as she was entertaining a visitor but on entering the diningroom she found him standing at the window so intent on watching a game of tennis that she addressed him by name before she could gain his attention i beg your pardon miss harford he said hastily he was a fair goodlooking man and almost gentlemanly in manner i was watching the game you have a capital tenniscourt so every one says miss greenwell is our best player she plays splendidly i never saw such strokes and all through the brief interview althea noticed how his eyes were following the girls graceful movements if nora and minnie had not been playing i think i should have invited him to have a game she said afterwards to doreen but i thought of gardiner pere and was afraid i might shock his sense of propriety it would not have been good taste returned doreen sensibly you may depend upon it that robert gardiner has very little to do with the young ladies of the establishment and then they both laughed by the bye althea observed mr chaytor when they had finished the subject of nora greenwell i am so glad you have taken your friends advice and have engaged a reader i am sure miss ward will be a comfort to you i think so too she is very bright and intelligent and she talks in the most amusing way she is so natural and unsophisticated so i should imagine where did you pick her up doreen applied to an agency in harley street but thorold and here her voice changed what singular coincidences there are in life is it not strange that she should be everard wards daughter mr chaytor was now sitting beside her and as she said this he turned round and looked at her he was evidently very much surprised i had no idea of that he said in a low tone there are so many wards such a thought would never have occurred to me and then he glanced at her keenly is it not a little awkward for you althea then a faint flush came to her cheeks she was five or six years older than thorold but they had been old playfellows and dear friends and his brother had been one of altheas lovers in the kitlands days and he knew all about the ward romance and lad as he was he had predicted its ending as he watched dorothy play the part of rosalind in the pastoral play i do not see why it should be awkward she observed quietly i have not met mr ward for twenty years but i should have no objection to do so tomorrow he is very poor thorold and i am afraid they are often in difficulties his pictures do not sell well perhaps they are not worth much i fancy wards genius is purely imaginary none of his friends believed that he would do much as an artist well it is getting late and i am keeping you up and then doreen will scold me let me help you turn out the lights and then i will walk with you to the house it is a glorious night and i shall enjoy my stroll home but as they stood in the porch a moment in the starlight althea touched his arm how is joa she asked kindly she is quite well he returned joanna seldom ails anything but she is no happier poor soul i sometimes think she never will be then his voice grew suddenly tired i do not profess to understand women althea i suppose some natures are naturally depressed and live in an atmosphere of worry but they are scarcely pleasant housemates i am afraid that is hardly a brotherly speech and he laughed a little grimly as he shook hands poor thorold althea said to herself as she crossed the hall joa is the old man of the mountains to him she is a dead weight on him and yet how seldom he utters a word of complaintscarcely ever and only to me but he can say what he likes to me he knows i am a safe confidante chapter xvi sir reynard and the grapes her angels face as the great eye of heaven shyned bright and made a sunshine in the shady place spensers faerie queene it is the opinion of certain wiseacres that enjoyment consists mainly in anticipation and retrospection and that the actual pleasure is reduced to a minimum but to waveney her first sunday at the red house was simply perfect not the shadow of a shade crossed her path until she said goodbye to mollie in the evening even the weather was propitious and when the morning mist had rolled off the common another of those golden days peculiar to autumn seemed to flood erpingham with warm mellow sunshine the rich brown and amber tints of the bracken excited waveneys admiration as they crossed a corner of the common on their way to church it was the longest way doreen explained but she had some business that took her to the upper end of the village then they walked slowly down the main street past the fountain and the roman catholic church with its old lychgate on their way waveney learned how the sisters spent their sunday afternoons doreen always went to the home of rest for workers one of the inmates had partially lost her sight and doreen generally read to her and wrote her letters it was her custom to remain to tea it gave the matron an hours freedom and made a change for the ladies the porch house was always thrown open for the girls use from two to six on sunday afternoons there was no meal provided but some of them liked to come up for an hour or twos reading or study or to meet their friends in winter there was always a bright fire and plenty of light and althea stealing down the dark garden paths would peep unseen at the merry group of chattering girls gathered round the fire altheas bibleclass was always held in the diningroom of the red house about twenty girls attended it waveney discovered later that althea spent most of her mornings preparing for this class but when she expressed her surprise at the amount of labour it involved althea only smiled my dear it is very necessary labour she returned it is no easy matter i assure you to keep ahead of girls like nora greenwell and alice mitchell i have to study for dear life and sometimes their questions are so difficult to answer that i have to apply for help to our good vicar i am very fond of my sunday work she said as she and waveney walked slowly on until doreen should overtake them two or three of the girls always remain to tea i give my invitations on thursday evening and as i make no distinction and each one has her proper turn there is no margin for jealousy i limit the number to four as i like my sunday teaparties to be cosy we call them library teas and mrs willis is generally very liberal with her cakes well dear why do you look at me so i was only thinking how full your life is and how happy you must be returned waveney simply and a faint flush rose to altheas cheek all lives ought to be full she said gravely it always makes me angry when people talk of empty blighted or disappointed lives and her tone was so severe that waveney felt vaguely surprised but miss harford she observed timidly a great many women are disappointed you know oh yes of course life is as full of disappointments as this bush is full of blackberries this morning but all the same they have only themselves to blame if their existence is dull and colourless there is too much mawkish sentiment talked at the present day she went on i was only telling my girls so the other day when trouble comes to a womanand heaven knows they have their share of suffering i suppose for their souls goodit is no good creeping along the ground like a bird with a broken wing they must summon all their pluck and fight their way through the thorns of course even the brave ones get a little torn and scarred but they are too proud to show their wounds look here comes my sister and we will change the subject and then as doreen joined them they walked on quickly but altheas blue eyes had a strange glow in them when waveney reached sloane square she found mollie had kept her word and was on the platform to receive her she gave a little cry when she saw waveney and more than one passerby looked round with kindly amusement as the sisters rushed into each others arms oh mollie how lovely you look what have you done to yourself but mollie only laughed and then like two children they walked up the stairs handinhand and to mollie it might have been the golden ladder that leads to paradise her dearer self her twin sister was beside her and the five blank days were over father and noel have gone for a walk she said as they turned down king street i shall have you to myself for a whole hour oh wave how are we to talk fast enoughso much has happened even in these five days i wish i could write clever letters like you but i am so stupid nonsense sweetheart why i loved your letters and always slept with them under my pillow did you really oh wave what a darling you are but of course i did the same and i was so amused at your meeting the noticeable man with the large grey eyes father heard me chuckling and he insisted on my reading your letter to him but he was quite startled when i came to mr chaytors name i dont think he was quite pleased what makes you think that mollie dear oh he frowned and bit his lip you know his way and then he took up the newspaper and cleared his throat but i heard him mutter as though to himself another of them now i wonder which of them it is but as you only said mr chaytor i could not tell him it was thorold returned waveney and then as they came in sight of the house she kissed her hand to it in a sort of ecstasy oh you dear old place i have dreamt of you every night and then as mollie used her latchkey mrs muggins came to meet them purring loudly with uplifted tail dear me i never noticed how steep and narrow the staircase is remarked waveney innocently and mollie dear you really must cause father to get some new stairdrugget crimson felt would look so nice and warm and would not cost much but mollie shook her head we must wait for that i am afraid she said sadly then she cheered up but wave father has got such a lovely new greatcoat and he does look so nice in it and noel insisted on his getting a new hat too i tell father that he will be ashamed to walk with me now he has grown such a dandy and then mollie broke off in confusion and began to blush for waveneys eyes were fixed on the round table in the studio a magnificent basket of hothouse grapes stood in the centre waveney regarded it with the look of a cat that sees cream there were three pounds at least and the purple bloom of the fruit made a rich spot of colour in the room waveneys expression was inscrutable mollie she said at last the black prince has been here again yes dear stammered mollie with the air of a culprit discovered in a fault but i did not expect himi told you so i was on my knees darning the staircarpets because father caught his foot in a hole that very morning and when ann opened the door there he was and of course he saw me oh of course there is nothing wrong with sir reynards eyes muttered waveney they are very good eyes i should say but this remark seemed to puzzle mollie why do you call him reynard waveney he is not sly not a bit of it he was so funny he wanted to help me with the staircarpethe said he was a good hand at darning but i would not hear of such a thing and of course i took him into the study well child what then and waveney seated herself on grumps and patted the sofa gently as an invitation for mollie to do the same and then sir reynard presented his grapes mollie stamped her little foot i will not have it waveney you shall not call our nice little monsieur blackie by such a horrid name yes he offered the grapes with such a droll little speech but i cant remember exactly what he said only that a friend of his had a splendid vinery and he always sent him such quantities of grapes and it would be a charity to help him to eat them and so on yes and so on and you said thank you my dear black prince you are very generous to poor little cinderella waveney if you talk such nonsense i wont love you a bit of course i thanked himand i must have done it nicely for he looked pleased almost as though he were relieved thats right he said heartily what a sensible young lady you are miss mollie you take things naturally and as you oughtand i wanted to please you you know i always want to please you waveney caught her breath and there was almost a look of fear in her eyes did he say those very words mollie yes dear in a tranquil tone and i am sure he meant it too he did look so very kind do you know i wanted to please you the very first day i saw you he went on and it has been the same every day since i am such a lonely sort of fellow since gwen left me gwen is my sister you know and that fetched you of course but waveney did not speak in her usual tone and how she watched the bright speaking face beside her yes indeed i thought of you and i asked such a lot of questions about this gwendoline and i am sure he liked answering them she is not pretty wave not a bitugly in fact but her husband adores her she is very tall and graceful but he told me he would not show me the picture he had in his pocket because plain people were not in my line wasnt that a funny speech and then we had a quarrel but he stuck to his point he said he hoped that some day he would be able to introduce her to us and that he would rather wait till then but wave what am i thinking about i meant you to have some grapes and then she jumped up from her seat and limped quickly to the table and for a moment waveneys eyes were a little misty how innocent she is what a child but i dare not enlighten her she said to herself i wonder what father thinks if i can i will just give him a hint i think he ought to find out who mr ingram really is we know nothing about him he may be in earnestvery likely he is but he ought not to come when mollie is alone the hour passed all too quickly and just as waveney was giving a full description of thursday evening her fathers voice made her start from her seat and fly downstairs but there was no one that day to liken her to titania how everards face brightened at the sight of his darling and even noel chortled in his joy to use his favourite expression he actually submitted to be kissed twice without making a wry face though he immediately turned up the collar of his coat it has been rather tropical lately he observed blandly but now old stormandstress has come we must look out for draughts but waveney was admiring the greatcoat and took no notice it is fathers turn exclaimed mollie cheerfully noel you must come and help me get tea ready we shall have it in the studio of course and then she stumped off to the kitchen and waveney and her father went upstairs they had a little talk together everard asked a few questions about his old friends and seemed much interested in all waveneys descriptions i think you have a good berth dear he said presently and that you are likely to be very happy with the misses harford yes father and i am sure that i shall soon learn to love miss altheagood queen bess as i call her butbutthe colour rising to her face as she squeezed his arm with her little handsi would rather be at home with my dad i know that darling and dad has missed his little girl badly by the bye waveney there seems a plentiful crop of ghosts at the red house mollie tells me that the other night you met a mr chaytor yes father mr thorold chaytor he seemed very nice and he read so beautifully miss althea says he is a barristerbut that though he is so clever he gets few briefs and that he ekes out his income by doing literary work he was always a clever fellow returned mr ward but i remember i liked tristram best poor old trist he was a bit soft on althea i remember how angry he was when some one told him it was lads love thorold was a cut above us and we were rather in awe of him i wonder what sort of looking fellow he is now he is tall and rather distinguished looking i mean people cannot help noticing him then mr wards eyes twinkled mischievously a noticeable man eh waveney with large grey eyes then waveney blushed and laughed what a perfidious mollie but father it is really such a true description mr chaytor is quite plain and ordinarylooking and he is old toofiveandthirty i should say but when he speaks you would never call him plain no i know what you mean but his brother tristram was a very handsome man did you know them well father very well indeed the chaytors lived at the old manor housetheir grandfather had bought it it was a fine old place about two miles from kitlands and when i visited them they lived in good style and entertained largely old chaytor as we called him was fond of life and gaiety though we youngsters knew little about it he kept racers and about the time i married his losses were so heavy that they could no longer afford to live in the old manor house were there only those two brothers father dear no there was a sister joannajoa they called hera pretty fair girl she and althea were great friends she was engaged to leslie parker the parkers were neighbours of theirs they lived in a quaint old house in the village called the knolls but i heard afterwards that when the old manor house was sold and mr chaytor died the marriage was broken off i never cared much for the parkers they were a mercenary lot all the sons married women with money but it was hard lines on poor little joa oh father how dreadfully interesting all this is i do so love ancient history it was by no means interesting for the chaytors returned mr ward with a laugh old chaytors love for the turf ruined them when he died his sons found that his affairs were hopelessly involved and that he had left heavy debts i had lost sight of them by that time but i heard a year or two afterwards that mrs chaytor was dead too and that tristram had gone to new zealand rumour said that he had turned out unsatisfactorily and that his brother had shipped him off but i know nothing more neither do i except they are living in a dulllooking house in dereham and then mollie limped in with the teatray and noel followed carrying a huge plum cake on his head like one of the black slaves in the arabian nights and then as he made an obeisance like lord batemans proud young porter it rolled to his feet after which mollie boxed his ears and his father called him a young ass they had a merry tea and then they drew round the fire and sang hymns and churchtime came only too quickly waveney had her old place between her father and mollie and when the gas was turned down during the sermon mollie slipped her hand into hers and a dark young man who was sitting a few pews behind them watched them attentively through the service and when in the dusk he saw mollie nestle up to her sister a great softness came into his eyes and he said to himself poor little thing but as noel strutted beside his sisters on the way to the station to see waveney off he said a thing that surprised them did you see my friend the idealist he asked with his chin elevated my word he looked quite the swagger gentleman in his new frock coat do you mean monsieur blackie asked waveney and she pressed mollies arm involuntarily she had had no opportunity of giving her father that hint and now she must wait for another week yes monsieur blackiemonsieur blackiemonsieur blackie returned the provoking lad in a falsetto squeak hold hard father you have nearly landed me into the gutter and then a little dark gentleman who was following them unperceived gave a low laugh my friend the humorist at his tricks again he murmured i wish gwen could see that lad she would love him chapter xvii like ships that pass in the night the situation that has not its duty its ideal was never yet occupied by man yes here in this miserable despicable actual wherein thou even now standest here or nowhere is thy ideal work it out therefore the ideal is in thyself the impediment too is in thyself carlyle something there was in her life incomplete imperfect unfinished longfellow one evening about a week later thorold chaytor walked quickly over the dereham bridge on his way from the station his day as usual had been spent in his dingy chambers in lincolns inn he had worked hard and felt unusually weary and the damp chilliness of the mists rising from the river made him shiver and button up his coat more closely a slight mizzling rain was now falling the pavements were wet and greasy the gas lights on the towing path seemed to waver and then flare up with windy flickers the black hulls of the boats and barges moored to the shore loomed through the mist like vast monsters weltering in the mud and the grey river flowing under the bridges washed silently against the piers in the darkness mr chaytors chambers in lincolns inn were high up and very small and inconvenientchaytors sky parlour some of his friends called it for in reality it consisted of only one room and a goodsized cupboard but the view of chimneypots from the window was certainly unique to be sure it was somewhat cold in winter and at times the chimney was given to smoking and in summer it certainly resembled the black hole in calcutta but these were trifles to be borne stoically if not cheerfully in this den thorold chaytor did most of his literary work and waited for briefs nor did he wait wholly in vain althea had spoken of him as a poor man and this opinion was shared by many others when old friends of the family who had visited at the old manor house came down to the dull shabbylooking house in high street where thorold and his sister lived they used to sigh and shrug their shoulders it was grievous they would say no wonder poor joanna looked so old and careworn and they only kept one servant too and then they would talk under their breath of the wasteful extravagance at the old manor house and then of that racing establishment at newmarket to which the chaytor fortunes had been sacrificed but if thorold and joanna practised rigid economy and only kept one servant it was because they stinted themselves of their own freewill thorold chaytor was not really poor his literary work was successful and his papers on social questions were so brilliant and versatile so teeming with thought and sparkles of wit that he was already making his mark as a clever writer and in his own profession he was not doing so badly quite recently he had distinguished himself in some case chaytor is a clearheaded lawyer he is sharp and has plenty of brains his friends would say he will get on right enough if he does not kill himself with work first thorold loved his work the hours spent in that grimy den were full of enjoyment to him he was equally happy solving some legal problem or doing some of his journalistic work his clear strong brains delighted in labour he had one curious companion of his solitudea small yellow cat who had only three legs whom he had rescued from a violent death and who refused to leave him sisera was not an attractive animal but his heart was in the right place he adored his master and when thorolds step sounded on the stairs in the morning sisera would jump off the old coat on the shelf where he was accustomed to pass the night and limp with loud purrs to the door sisera was as much a hermit as his master he took his exercise among the chimneypots and never went downstairs where unseen enemies lurked unnumbered for him he had his pennyworth of milk and his skewer of cats meat and a share of his masters frugal luncheon and on sundays the fat old housekeeper toiled up the stairs and deposited the rations for the day grumbling as she did so but although thorold already earned a fair income he lived as though he were poor and both he and his sister were almost parsimonious in their habits but not even althea who was their closest friend did more than guess at the reason for all this thrift thorold had set himself an herculean taskto pay his fathers debtsand in this joanna had willingly helped him with all her faults and failings she was a good woman and her sense of honour was almost as strong as his thorold was still at oxford when his father died his brother tristram was three or four years older he had been summoned in haste to the deathbed but to his relief his father recognised him it is a bad business my boy he said faintly as thorold took his hand if i could only have my life again i would do differently and a few minutes later when they thought he was sleeping he opened his eyes never get into debt trist he murmured it is hard for a man to die peacefully with a millstone round his neck and thorold was struck by the look of anguish that crossed his face father he said gently for he was young and impressionable and perhaps in his wish to give comfort he hardly knew what he was saying father you shall die in peace and trist and i will work hard and pay your debts yes yes murmured tristram with a sob we will pay them dad then a wonderful smile came over the sick mans face good lads good lads he muttered god bless you both those were his last words but even as he lay in his coffin thorold began to realise that the millstone was already round his own neck those first few years that followed his fathers death were very sad ones to thorold his mothers failing health and joannas disappointment embittered the peace of their home and worse than all tristram became a care to them he had been brought up in expectation of a fortune and as far as work was concerned his life at the university had been a failure what does it matter whether i grind or not he would say i am having a good old time and the governor will pay my debts and when the evil days came and george chaytors sons had to put their shoulders to the wheel and earn their bread there seemed nothing that tristram could do again and again a berth had been found for him but he had failed to keep it either he had been wanting in steadiness or application or he had lost his temper and quarrelled with his employer he is not worth his salt one of them said angrily to thorold in sheer desperation thorold went to an old cousin who had already shown him a great deal of kindness and with his help tristram was equipped and shipped off to new zealand perhaps he will do better in a new world thorold said when joanna bewailed his departure rather bitterly tristram was her darling she loved him far better than she did thorold like many other prodigals tristram chaytor was not without his endearing qualities women loved him and he was good to them but in character he was selfish and unstable as water and very prone to fall into temptation already as thorold knew he had become addicted to low pleasures his friends were worthless and dissipated but joanna who was mildly obstinate on occasion turned a deaf ear to all thorolds hints on this subject tristram seemed to do better for a time in his new environment then he foolishly married some pretty penniless girl who took his fancy and after that they lost sight of him thorold was thinking of him now as he walked over the wet bridge although he was a neerdowell he was his only brother and in the old days they had been close chums and playfellows dear old trist he said to himself i wonder what he is doing now and if ella makes him a good wife and then in the darkness tristrams handsome face and tender humourous smile seemed to rise vividly before him he could even hear his voice clear and boyish close to his earwell played old chappiebut it was a fluke for all that what on earth makes me think of trist tonight thorold asked himself in some perplexitybut if he had only guessed the truth he need not have puzzled himself at that very moment under the flickering windblown gaslight the brothers had passed each other without recognition like ships that pass in the night thorold was trying to keep his umbrella steady and took no notice of the passenger who almost brushed his elbowthough he heard a small childish voice say i dont like english rain father but the answer did not reach him aye it is a bit saft betas the scotch folk say creep under my inverness cape little one and it will keep you dry and then the little feet toiled on wearily and bravely in the darkness as thorold let himself in with his latchkey the parlourdoor was opened hastily and a womans face peeped out anxiously is that you thorold then the man bit his lip with sudden irritation day after day month after month this was joannas nevervarying formulauntil is that you thorold seemed to be dinned into his brain like a monotonous singsong who should it be he longed to answer this evening what other fellow do you suppose would let himself in with my latchkey but he controlled himselfjoanna had no sense of humour and did not understand sarcasm yes here i am as large as life he returned cheerfully but dont touch me dear for i am a trifle wet is supper ready i will just change my coat and be with you in a moment ah rabatlakoum as a big grey persian cat rubbed against his legs so you are there old mother of all the cats and you are coming up with me eh dont forget to rub your feet thorold there were marks on the landing carpet yesterday and then joanna went back to pick up her knitting feeling that she had properly welcomed her brother joanna chaytor had been a pretty girl with that soft rounded prettiness that belongs to youth but at sixandthirty she was faded and oldmaidish doreen and althea who were several years older scarcely looked their age but joanna had worn badly disappointment and sorrow and the small carking cares of daily life had washed away the pretty bloom from her cheeks and had sharpened the lines of her face her brown hair was streaked with grey and though her figure was still graceful and she dressed youthfully strangers always thought she was at least fortyfive women are as old as they feel people say but in that case joanna would have been seventy at least to her the drama of life had been wholly tragical she had lost her father and the mother she adored and the beloved home of her childhood the man to whom she had given her young affections and whom she looked upon as her future husband had basely deserted her in her adversity and as though this were not enough her favourite brother was in exile separated from her by the weary ocean if joanna had married leslie parker she would have made an excellent wife and mother but her present environment did not suit her she grew thin and weedy as althea once phrased it joanna was not a clever woman she was dense and emotional and her mild obstinacy and tenacity were powerful factors in her daily life she had long ago shelved her deeper griefs but a neverending crop of minor worries furnished her with topics of conversation thorold was fond of his sister but she was no companion to him his calm selfrestrained nature was the very antipodes of joannas fretful and nervous temperament manlike he failed to understand why the dust and sweepings of the day should be brought for his inspection joanna had not toiled long hours in hard strenuous brain labour in a grimy attic with a threelegged sisera curled up at her feet her work had been light compared to his sometimes when he felt lonely and weary and the need for companionship was unusually strong he would try and interest her in his days work but it was always a failure she would listen and then her attention would fly off at a tangent or he would see her trying to stifle a yawn there was something he wanted to tell her this evening for the day had been eventful to him if althea had been his sister he would have followed her into the sittingroom wet as he was and would have told her triumphantly that his foot was on the rung of the ladder at last and that he had begun to climb in earnest and he would have told her too that before long their fathers debts would be all cleared off thorold had not done this unaided about eighteen months before the old cousin who had come to his assistance with tristram died and with the exception of five hundred pounds to joanna left all his savings amounting to several thousands to thorold thorold never consulted any one he asked no advice he paid in twelve hundred pounds at his bankers that it might be ready for a rainy day and then he went around to his fathers creditors paying off each one by turn the racing debts had been settled years ago in his fathers lifetime by the sale of the old manor house and the lands adjoining but he had lived recklessly and his creditors were many he owed large sums to a carriagebuilder in baker street and to his tailor wine merchant and other tradespeople one of them a small jobbing carpenter who lived in the village stared incredulously at the cheque in his hand and then fairly burst out crying it is for joy mr thorold cried the poor fellow rubbing his coatsleeve across his eyes for i never expected to see a penny of the squires money and we have had hard times lately business has been slack and my missis has been poorly and run up a doctors bill and god bless you sir for your honest dealing with a poor man for i shall be able to keep the shop together now and for that afternoon at least thorold felt a lightening of the millstone round his neck joanna looked at him a little tearfully when he showed her the receipted bills she was not too dense to understand the grandeur of the action how few men would have considered themselves bound by a few impulsive words gasped out by a deathbed you have used all cousin ruperts money in paying fathers debts she said and there was a queer look in her eyes no dear he returned gently i have not spent it all i am keeping twelve hundred pounds for a rainy day i thought that would be only right but joa there are only two bills left and most of the things owing were for tristram tristram in a startled voice are you sure of that yesthings that he wanted at oxford and that father ordered but three or four hundred will clear off the whole account thorold returned his sister plaintivelyand now she was actually cryingyou do not expect me to help with my money no of course not what an idea he replied hastily but all the same he felt vaguely surprised all these years joanna had stinted herself of comforts had scraped and saved and pared down every unnecessary expense with ungrudging cheerfulness and with all her grumblings and worries she had never said one word of blame on this score and now she was hugging her small fortune almost jealously i am very sorry dear but i cannot give you my money she went on quickly it is my own money you know dear cousin rupert left it to me i have helped you as well as i could all these years but i must keep this for my very own of course you shall keep it returned her brother for joanna was growing quite excited i suppose you will put it into the london county bank yes that will be best and then i can get it out easily the consols would be better perhaps he continued musingly and you would get more interest or you might buy some of those shares that doreen was mentioning no no i prefer the london county returned joanna obstinately let me do what i like with my own money and thorold said no more but now and then he wondered if joanna had drawn on her secret hoard as far as he could see she had bought nothing fresh for the house and certainly not for her dress during the last eighteen months and their bill of fare was not more luxurious chapter xviii joanna tangles her skein a child of our grandmother eve a female or for thy more sweet understanding a woman shakespeare men are born with two eyes but with one tongue in order that they should see twice as much as they say colton the house in high street where the chaytors lived was somewhat dingy and uninviting in its outward aspect but inside it was not without its advantages a small paved court separated it from the street and at night its front windows were illuminated by the flaring gaslights from the opposite shops all day long the ceaseless patter of footpassengers on the pavement and the rumble and rattle of cabs omnibuses and carts made the narrow windows shake in their frames and it was far into the night before silence brooded over the old town on one side of the passage was a small room where thorold kept a good many of his books and papers it was called the study but he never sat there joanna had long ago proved to him that with one servant and a limited purse an extra fire would be quite a sinful extravagance it was for this reason too that she so seldom used her drawingroom it was a pretty room on the first floor with a pleasant view of the garden and in summer she liked to sit at the open window with her work and watch thorold digging and raking in the borders gardening was his favourite amusement and he took great pride in his flowerbeds sometimes when she had leisure joanna would weed or water a little but she always made much of these labours the room they mostly used was a large one on the ground floor it extended from the front to the back of the house and the two narrow windows at the farther end overlooked the shady old garden this part of the room was furnished as a study the stained bookshelves were loaded with ponderouslooking books a writingtable occupied one window and two comfortable easychairs and joannas overflowing workbasket stood on either side of the fireplace a bookstand and a readinglamp were by thorolds chair the front portion of the room was used for their meals when thorold came down that evening the room looked warm and cosy the crimson curtains were drawn and a bright fire blazed cheerfully the supper was laid and jemima had just brought in a small covered dish and placed it before her mistress thorold was hungry for his luncheon had been a light one for a wonder the chops were well cooked and hot and as he helped himself to the nicely browned mashed potatoes he felt disposed to enjoy himself he would tell joanna about his visit to murdoch williams she would be interested and for once they would have a sociable evening he even thought that he would ask for a cup of coffee as he felt chilled and tired and then by way of making himself pleasant he commended jemimas cookery it was an unfortunate choice of subjects joanna who had been tranquilly eating her supper suddenly grew red and querulous ah she can cook well enough if she chooses she returned but there she so seldom chooses to take pains thorold i shall have to part with that girl her wastefulness and extravagance are beyond everything and then she is so selfwilled tooshe will not mind anything i tell her again and again i have begged her not to put an egg in the rice pudding but she does it all the same i suppose she thinks the egg will make the pudding nicer returned thorold mildly and then to change the subject he said boldly i have rather a headache this evening dear do you think jemima could make me a cup of coffee she could make it but i doubt if you would care to drink it she returned fretfully and she wants to go out too she has got a young man i know she has i taxed her with it this very morning and she was as impertinent as possible my dear joafor his sense of fairness was roused by thiswhy should not the poor girl have a lover she is very goodlooking and as long as she conducts herself properly i can see no objection to the young man yes and she will be having him in and giving him supper when we are outnot that i ever do go out heaven knows i declare i quite envy you thorold going out every morning to your work womens lives are far more dull and monotonous than mens here joannas voice waxed more plaintive than everit was naturally rather a sweet voice but fretfulness and discontent had deadened the harmony if as they say the closing of an eyelid will shut out the lustre of a planet so to joanna the small everyday worries seemed to obliterate the larger and grander interests of life jemimas good looks her lover her small impertinences and misdemeanours loomed like gigantic shadows on her horizon if she could only learn the right proportion of things thorold had said once to althea almost in despair when joanna made her dolorous little speech thorold raised his eyes from his plate and looked at her why do you not go to the red house oftener he asked gravely you know how glad they would be to have you you stay at home too much joa but it is your own fault you know doreen and althea are always sending you invitations yes i know and i am very fond of althea but somehow i never care to go to the red house it reminds me too much of the dear old manor house that room of altheas makes me quite shiver when i enter it oh i would not give way to those feelings joa he returned hastily in life one has to harden ones self to all sorts of things and it is no use moping and brooding over troubles that cannot be altered if jemima wants to go out perhaps we had better not wait any longer and then he lighted his reading lamp and unfolded his paper in spite of the wellcooked chops supper had certainly not been more festive than usual and then a strange fancy came to thorold how would it be with him if some younger brighter face were to be opposite to him evening after evening would not his home humble as it was be a very different place he knew why he was happier in his chambers at lincolns inn to his reserved temperament solitude was far preferable than uncongenial fellowship with this small human soul this weary little pilgrim forever carrying her heavy pack of worries poor dear joa he said to himself for his keen eyes had noticed the reddened eyelids very likely she remembers that it is tristrams birthday and that he is thirtyeight today jemima had cleared the table and vanished he was still alone and rabatlakoum was curled up like a huge grey ball at his feet the leading article was unusually clever and absorbed him until a sudden fragrance pervaded the room and there stood joanna at his elbow with a steaming cup of coffee i waited until jemima went out and then i made it myself it is very strong coffee thorold and it will do your head good joannas voice was a little more cheerful as she said this and the slight flush from her exertions made her look younger thorold was quite touched he put out his hand and patted his sisters arm caressingly how good of you to take so much trouble my dear i never thought of the coffee again sit down joa and let us be comfortable i have been wanting to tell you something all the evening have you indeed and joanna brightened wait a moment i want to wind some wool i can hear you talk all the same and yet i must mention one thing before you begin the gas man called for his account and you forgot to leave the cheque did i i was in a hurry but i will write it before i go to bed thank you and there is one other thing thorold if jemima goes at her month as she threatens will she not forfeit her wages you are a lawyer so you ought to know i am quite sure jemima means to do nothing of the kind he returned impatiently look here joa she is the best servant we have had yet and i would rather raise her wages than part with her take my advice for once praise her a little more and find fault with her a little less and if you are wise you will leave her young man alone and then he drank his coffee moodily joanna had quenched his attempt at conversation again joanna pondered thorolds advice as she unravelled her skein of yarn it was somewhat tangled and as she pulled it with nervous jerks the yarn snapped and the ball rolled from her hand thorold suppressed a forcible interjection as he groped under his chair for the ball if ever he married he determined that one of the first rules he would make for his wifes guidance would be that all woolwinding should be done by daylight joanna had a tiresome habit of leaving a tangled skein for the comparative leisure of the evening hours thorold used to wonder sometimes if all her skeins were tangled it got on his nerves sometimes and spoilt the enjoyment of his reading joannas limp nerveless movements her jerky beginnings and abrupt endings her brief spasms of energy and the inevitable hunt for the unlucky ball irritated him at times beyond endurance it is quite ridiculous and almost derogatory to ones dignity to think how much daily life is marred by these small frets and torments the buzzing of a bluebottle against the windowpane is certainly preferable to a brass band when the instruments are cracked but the whizzing and fizzing of the insect may in time jar on the ear and to thinskinned people a midges bite is fruitful of irritation joanna was making up her mind slowly that her brother had given her good counsel and that perhaps it would be well for her to follow it thorold was the master of the house and if he wished to keep joanna of course the girl must stay and when joanna had arrived at this point she broke the thread of her yarn again i thought there was something you wanted to tell me thorold she said rather reproachfully when she had found a new beginning i have brought my work and am ready to talk but you do nothing but read then thorold threw down his paper impatiently i thought you were too busy with that work he returned rather curtly and after all it does not matter it was only about my own business affairs oh but i want to hear it replied his sister with much mild obstinacy it is seldom that you do care to talk to me thorold and here joannas voice was decidedly plaintive i sometimes think that if it were not for finding fault with jemima i should almost lose the use of my voice thorold was fast losing patience joanna was in one of her most trying moods she was at once aggressive and despondent she was at all times very tenacious of her sisterly privileges and nothing offended her more than being kept in the dark well he might as well get it over and be done with it but he would be as brief as possible i only wanted to tell you that i have had a very satisfactory interview with murdoch williams oh indeedand here joanna frowned anxiously over her skein they are solicitors are they not yes but they are very big people joa i think i am likely to get the brief you seewarming to his subjectour last case was so satisfactory and we got our client such heavy damages that murdoch williams were quite pleased the junior partner made himself very pleasant and said all kinds of civil things and you think you will get it thorold and joanna actually laid down her skein i shall certainly get it and thorolds eyes flashed with triumph as he spoke at such moments his face was full of expression it will be a big case joa and sergeant rivington will be leading counsel on our side and then again he told himself that his foot was on the rung of the ladder and that he had begun to climb in earnest i am very glad theo and joannas blue eyes were rather tearful she and tristram had often called him theo but she seldom used the old pet name now thorold smiled a little sadly as he heard it i knew you would be pleased dear and his voice softened it will make a great difference to our income joa i have made up my mind that the last of the debts shall be paid off before christmas and we will begin the new year free and untrammelled there shall be an end of all your small peddling economies we shall not be rich but at least we need not hoard our cheeseparings and candleends i do not know what you mean thorold returned joanna in a puzzled tone we never use candles except in the coal cellar then thorold gave a grim unmirthful laugh if he ever married the lady of his choice should have some sense of humour nothing is more harassing and trying to the temper than to have to talk down to the level of ones daily companion althea once said rather wittily that joas brains were like a nutmeggraterone had to rub ones nutmeg very hard before the spicy fragments would filter through it perhaps we may have a better house soon he said after a pause i should like to be out of the town and higher up the hill the air is fresher and it would be quieter oh yes much quieter joanna smiled and a pretty dimple came into view at that moment she looked almost like a girl we must wait for our good things a little continued thorold but there is no need for us to stint ourselves and joa here he hesitatedwhy should you not smarten yourself up a bit get one or two new dresses or any fallals you requirefor his keen observant eyes had noticed that the old lilac silk that joanna always wore of an evening a relic of the old manor house days was faded and darned and of obsolete fashion he was a man who was always keenly alive to the wants and wishes of his womankind but even as he made the suggestion he wondered why joanna was hoarding her five hundred pounds and why she should not use a few pounds to replenish her scanty wardrobe he knew and had been very angry when he heard it that althea had actually presented her with a beautiful dress for church because she said joa was too miserly to spend a penny on herself joanna blushed slightly when thorold made his goodnatured proposition you are very kind theo she said gently as she folded her white nervouslooking hands over her skein but i go out so seldom that i do not require many new dresses i have altheas merino andeyeing her lilac silk complacentlythere is plenty of wear to be got out of my old gown yet well you know best returned thorold indifferently if he had stated his opinion candidly he would have suggested that the gown in question should be relegated to jemima or the ragbag well he had done his part nobly and now he might take up guizots life but the next moment joannas plaintive tones arrested him theo do you remember what day this is and as he nodded she continued mournfully trist is eightandthirty today it is actually ten years since we have seen himten long years and now a slow tear or two welled down joannas face what a weary time it has been and he and ella have never writtennot a line not a single word since their little girl was born he was going to australia then and he seemed to write in good spiritswe have his letter still joa he was so pleased with his little daughter and the prospect of the new berth offered him yes but that was eight or nine years ago oh thorold why does he never write do you think he has ceased to care for us no my dear certainly not replied her brother kindly for he was moved by her deep dejection but you know how casual and happygolucky the dear old chap always was bad habits grow stronger as we grow olderremember that joa trist never liked making little efforts he hated writing letters even in his school daysprobably he hates it still and yet for all that he may be flourishing on some sheep farm or other but this view of the case did not comfort joanna and during the rest of the evening she shed silent tears over her tangled skein and all the time not half a mile away a man and a child sat hand in hand over a smoky little cindery fire the childs shivering form wrapped in an old inverness cape is it always cold in england father why does not mrs grimson make up a big fire well you see coals are dear bet and the stove is a small one but my old coat is warm and thick why you look as snug as a robin in its nest or a squirrel in its hole or a dormouse or anything else you like to name i wonder what aunt joa will think of my little betty when she sees her then the child laughed gleefully shall we really find them father of course we shall find them my girlie but we must not tire those poor little feet too much put them up on my knee darling and dad will rub them and keep the chilblains away and then as he took the tiny feet in his hand bets thin little arm went round his neck oh father i do love you so it makes me ache all over to love you so hard and then bet rested her rough tangled head against her fathers shoulder chapter xix a check for the black prince simplicity of all things is the hardest to be copiedsteele how absolute the knave is we must speak by the card or equivocation will undo ushamlet before many days had passed waveney had settled down happily at the red house and though she still missed mollie and had to combat frequent pangs of homesickness her environment was so pleasant and her work so congenial that it would have seemed to her the basest ingratitude not to be thankful for her advantages sweet temper and high principles are important factors in a girls happiness waveney knew she was walking in the path of duty and that she had done the right thing in severing herself from the home life a sense of independence and welldoing sweetened her daily duties and at night after she had prayed for her dear ones she would sleep as calmly and peacefully as a tired child i think waveney is happy with us althea said once in a satisfied voice and indeed at that moment the girls clear notes were distinctly audible singing to herself in the corridor as she had been accustomed to sing in the old house in chelsea waveneys duties were not very irksome when altheas eyes troubled her her young companion would spend the morning and the greater part of the evening reading to her or writing from her dictation and in this way waveney gained a great deal of valuable information it is a liberal education to talk to my dear miss althea she would say to mollie she is so clever and knows so much and yet she thinks so little of herself i believe i love and admire her more every day but you like miss doreen too observed mollie tentatively oh yes i am quite fond of her and she is always as nice as possible but she could never come up to queen bess she is more earthly and commonplace but there i am not expressing myself properly miss althea is human too but she is so much more sympathetic and picturesque but the old ladies at the home like miss doreen best retorted mollie yes dear old ladies are her specialities and girls are miss altheas you would think sometimes to hear her talk that she was a girl herself and knew exactly how they felt some of them almost worship her and no wonder i wish i could see her sighed poor mollie i love her too for being so good to youfor her unselfish nature knew no taint of jealousy when altheas eyes were in good order waveney merely wrote a few letters or copied some extracts neatly and then her duties in the library were over sometimes she would walk across to the home and read for an hour to the blind lady miss elliot or she would do little errands in the town for one or other of the sisters sometimes she would carry the weekly basket of flowers that althea always sent to joanna but she never thoroughly enjoyed her visits she told mollie that miss chaytor was a rather depressing sort of person i daresay she is good and amiable she observed she must have virtues or miss althea would not be so fond of her but she looks as though she has been out too long in a bleak wind and has got nipped and pinched i think if she would only speak more briskly and cheerfully that she would feel better she wants prodding somehow like the old costermongers donkey and mollie laughed at this waveney certainly had her good times althea had presented her with a beautiful racket and a pair of tennis shoes and on thursday afternoons she and nora greenwell played tennis on the new asphalt court behind the porch house she also joined mr chaytors shakespeare readings they were to get up the merchant of venice next and to her secret delight the part of jessica was allotted her mr chaytor took no special notice of her she sat amongst the other girls and listened to his instructions sometimes when thorold had finished some masterly declamation he would look up suddenly from his book waveneys little pale face and curly head were just opposite to him the deep spirituelle eyes seemed glowing with golden light where was she not in the recreation hall but on some marble steps belonging to a doges palace the dark water was washing almost to her feet gondolas were passing and repassing in the moonlight greybearded men in velvet doublets and ruffs were standing in a group under the deep archway and portia in her satin gown was walking with proud and stately step followed by her train it is your turn miss ward observed thorold quietly and then as waveney started and flushed he bit his lip with an effort to suppress a smile he knew by a sort of intuitive sympathy where her thoughts had strayed her absorbed attention pleased and flattered him he began to feel interested in so promising a pupil miss greenwell reads better he thought but i doubt if she grasps the full meaning and beauty of a passage as miss ward does and on more than one evening the little pale face and dark vivid eyes seemed to haunt him strangely enough he had used doreens comparison she is like undine he said to himself and somehow the name seemed to suit her waveneys sundays were always her happiest days they were redletter days and high festivals to her as well as to mollie but each time she went home she thought mollie looked lovelier and on each occasion she found relics of the black prince the grapes had long ago been eaten but a generous box of paris chocolate had replaced them and there were always fresh hothouse flowers in the red bowl mollie who was becoming hardened scarcely blushed as she pointed them out and informed waveney quite coolly that a hare or a brace of pheasants were hanging up in the larder sir reynard at his tricks still thought waveney and one evening she did give her father a hint dad she said a little nervously for she felt her task a delicate one mr ingram is very kind to dear molliehe is always bringing her things and of course she is pleased but i do not think he ought to come so often when she is alone everard started and looked at her his little girl had plenty of penetration and sense as he knew no dear i suppose you are right he said slowly i will talk to miss mollie and she must give mr ingram a hint the little puss has encouraged him i suppose and then he frowned and said a little anxiously you dont think the fellow is making up to her eh waveney father dear how can we tell mollie is such a great baby in these sort of things i think she fancies that she is not grown up yet but she is nineteen dad i think he must like her a little but he ought only to come to the house when you are at home wont you try and find out all about him but mr ward shook his head he hardly knew how that was to be done he is a gentleman he returned rather gravely and he is a good fellowi am sure of that and he has plenty of means i like mr ingram he is a little eccentric but he is honourable and straightforward i would take my oath of that well well i will give mollie a good strong hint and mr ward kept his word so a day or two later when mr ingram walked into the studio with some fresh flowers and a beautifully bound volume of jean ingelows poems under his arm that mollie had innocently remarked that she longed to read mollie seemed hardly as pleased as usual to see him she even turned a little pale when he presented the book with one of his joking speeches oh thank you you are very kind she stammered fluttering the pages and you have written my name in too mollie spoke hurriedly and breathlessly she had not even asked him to sit down mr wards hint had certainly been a strong one mr ingram looked at the girl a little keenly then he took a chair and seated himself comfortably what is it miss mollie he said gently you have something on your mind oh you cannot deceive me as mollie blushed and shook her head i can read you like a book and for some reason poor monsieur blackie is in disgrace oh no no protested mollie quite shocked at this you could not think me so ungrateful there can be no question of gratitude between you and me returned the young man gravely and he looked a little pained then as mollies sweet wistful face seemed to plead forgiveness he recovered himself with an effort i am only troubled because i am afraid of hurting you she went on and i am sorry too because i do so enjoy your visits we know so few people mr ingram but father said but here mollie utterly broke down and why ever was mr ingram looking at her in that way was he angry or unhappy you do not surely mean miss mollie that your father has forbidden my visits and now it was mr ingrams turn to look pale oh no no gasped mollie how could you think of anything so dreadful only father would like to see you sometimes and then the stern look of gravity was no longer on ingrams face my dear miss mollie he said kindly please do not distress yourself so let me finish that sentence for you your father does not in the least object to my visits but he would like me to pay them when he is at home and he wishes you to tell me this oh yes thank you but how could you guess so cleverly and mollie looked as though a world of care had rolled off her but only an inscrutable smile answered her sir oracle has spoken he said trying to resume his old manner now miss mollie i may be an idealist but i can be practical too will you kindly tell me on which afternoon i am likely to find your father only on saturdays for certain very well then will you tell mr ward with my compliments that unless his house be on fire nothing will induce me to ring his doorbell on monday tuesday wednesday thursday or friday unless by special invitation but on saturday i will do myself the pleasure of calling is that a message to father asked mollie a little puzzled at his tone but mr ingram only laughed and rose from his chair i am rather a riddle to you am i not he said taking her soft little hand and then his manner suddenly changed miss mollie he continued do you remember the first time i saw you you were sitting in the ashes like cinderella i have called you cinderella ever since oh not really mr ingram but of course i remember the day for i was never so startled in my life when the door opened i thought it was ann and oh dear how frightened i was for a moment it was like a picture went on ingram and his eyes looked grave and intent the kitchen was a little dark but a ray of sunshine was full on your face and you were singing do you remember miss mollie and mollie hung her head as though she were rather ashamed of herself oh yes that old song of fathers and then rather pettishly but i dont want to remember that i shall never forget it i wish i were the fairy godmother instead of monsieur blackie and then there is the prince what are we to do about the prince miss mollie oh i dont know murmured mollie confusedly for mr ingrams manner was rather baffling that afternoon but how amused he would be if he knew that waveney often called him the black prince there never are princes in real life she finished demurely oh i would not be too sure of that he returned coolly life is full of surprises why i heard of a fellow last yearhe was only a dairyman and a rich uncle who had made his pile in chicago and was a millionaire died and left him all his money he told me in confidence that for the first month he was nearly out of his mind with worry for he and his wife had not a notion what to do with it i gave him a lot of advice i told him to give his children the best education possible and to live comfortably without trying for grandeur and he was a sensible fellow and followed my advice he has a good house and a model farm and his breed of alderney cows is the finest in the country and i have a great respect for him and his wife and often go and see them mollie was much impressed with this story she was sorry when mr ingram took his leave he had paid such a very short visit and she knew her fathers message was the cause but he had quite recovered his spirits for as he went downstairs she could hear him singing to himself in a low melodious voice heres to the maiden of bashful fifteen heres to the widow of fifty heres to the flaunting extravagant quean and heres to the housewife thats thrifty let the toast pass drink to the lass ill warrant shell prove an excuse for the glass waveney was far happier in her mind when she heard from mollie that mr ingrams visits were always to be paid on saturday afternoons and even mollie owned that she preferred this you see wave she explained it is a little awkward entertaining mr ingram all by myself if i were like you i should not mind it so much but i never can talk properly and he is so dreadfully clever well he has travelled and seen the world but he is not clever like mr chaytor mollie that man is a perfect well of knowledge but this comparison did not seem to please mollie i think mr ingram clever she persisted and so does father he said last evening that he was a thoroughly wellinformed man oh wave i forgot to tell you something i asked him yesterday how long he meant to stay in chelsea and he looked quite surprised at the question he said he had not been staying there for weeks and that he was at his diggings as usual but that he generally spent a night or two in town every week when i am up in town i always sleep at my club he said now waveney is it not odd that he has never told us where he lives and i did not like to ask him and waveney assented to this the following sunday when waveney went home she found mollie in a state of great excitement it was a cold november afternoon and a dull moisture seemed to pervade everything the pavements were wet and greasy the horses coats steamed and the raw dampness was singularly penetrating as the two girls hurried along arminarm mollie poured out her story breathlessly oh wave you will never guess such a wonderful thing is going to happen mr ingram has got a box at st jamess theatre for wednesday for aylmers dream and he has actually invited father and noel and me and father says we may go aylmers dream returned waveney i heard mr chaytor talking about that to miss althea he told her that she and miss doreen ought certainly to see itthat miss leslies representation of the crazed lady aylmer was the most perfect piece of acting and mr sargent as sir reginald aylmer was almost as fine yes i daresay interrupted mollie impatiently for she had no wish to discuss the merits of the play beforehand but do listen to me wave dear mr ingram will fetch us in a carriage and he has promised to go early so that i may see the curtain draw up i shall wear my white dress but what am i to do for a nice wrap mollies voice was a little troubled and for the moment waveney did not answer she realised at once the difficulty of the situation i shall not draw my salary until christmas she said presently that will be a month hence and we must not ask father for any money no certainly not well then we must just make the best of it went on waveney your black jacket is impossible and so is your waterproof so there only remains tids old red rag of a shawla title they had borrowed from a charming tale they had read in their childhood oh waveney dear mothers old red shawl and mollies voice was decidedly depressed what will mr ingram say he will sayat least he will thinkthat you look sweet how could he help it darling mothers shawl is warm and in the gaslight it wont look so very shabbyyou can throw it off directly you get into the box father must buy you some new gloves and with a few flowers you will do as well as possible but though mollie tried to take this cheerful view of the case she did not quite succeed and tids old rag of a shawl lay heavily upon her mind chapter xx dads little betty we have seen better days romeo and juliet her little face like a walnut shell with wrinkling lines henley on monday morning when waveney went into the library althea would always ask a kindly question or two about the previous evening to which waveney would gladly respond but when the girl told her with sparkling eyes about mollies promised treat and mr ingrams kindness she looked extremely surprised and not a little amused doreen who had followed them into the room and was hunting through the bookshelves for a volume she needed turned with an exclamation but althea put her finger on her lip with a warning gesture aylmers dream why that is the very play that thorold is so anxious for us to see she observed calmly why should we not have a box too you are driving into town this afternoon dorrie and you can easily go to st jamess it will be a treat for waveneyand you know we always intended to go yes but not on wednesday returned doreen in a doubtful tone but again althea looked at her meaningly as for waveney she was speechless with delight althea sent her into the diningroom the next moment to fetch the times and doreen took instant advantage of her absence althea are you serious do you really wish me to take a box for wednesday oh yes returned althea flushing a little but there was a mischievous smile on her lips i am quite serious moritz is masquerading and i want to find out his little game my lord is too busy to call on his old friends but i will be even with him hush here the child comes dorrie we will have a nice little drama of our own on wednesday i long to see pretty mollie and that lad of pairts noel and it will be a grand opportunity then as waveney returned with the paper doreen contented herself with a disapproving shake of the head althea was very impulsive she thought when she at last left the room it was all very well to talk about moritz but she feared that she was putting herself in an awkward situation everard ward would be there as well as mollie and noel and they could hardly leave the theatre without speaking to him but old maid as she was the idea of hinting this to althea made her feel hot all over althea would only laugh at me and pretend not to understand she said to herself and if she makes a plan nothing will induce her to give it up in truth althea was quite enamoured of her little scheme now waveney she said in a mysterious voice you are not to say one syllable to mollie mind that is it to be a surprise asked waveney opening her eyes as widely as the wolf in red riding hood why of course it is we will all remain snugly hidden at the back of our box until the curtain draws up and then they will be too absorbed to notice us think how delightful it will be to see mollies start of astonishment when at last she catches sight of you oh what fun it will be exclaimed the girl joyfully yes yes it will be far better not to tell mollie but i hope she will not call out when she sees me monsieur blackie too and father and noel oh miss althea how glorious it will be there i am forgetting your letters and you wanted them written for the early post but althea only smiled indulgently waveney could settle to nothing properly that day she had only been to the theatre twice in her life and then only in the gallery but to be in a boxwell her excitement was so great that she took a long walk over the common to calm herself presently an unwelcome thought obtruded itself her white frock was losing its freshness with constant wear but there was no possibility of buying a new one until christmas and she had no suitable wrapnot even tids old red rag of a shawl for a moment she was full of dismay then with her usual good sense she determined to confide the difficulty to miss althea she found her opportunity that very evening althea listened to her attentively my dear child she said very kindly when waveney had finished do you know the same thought occurred to me but there is no need to trouble yourself i have two or three evening cloaks that peachy will not let me wear because she says they do not suit me and of course you can have one oh yes there is a blue plush one that will just do and waveney thanked her delightedly there was nothing now to mar her enjoyment or to damp her anticipation and the next morning a letter from mollie gave her fresh pleasure oh wave darling it began it is so late and father says i ought to be in bed but i must write and tell you about such a wonderful thing that has just happened i was mixing fathers salad for supper and thinking how he would enjoy it with the cold pheasant when the doorbell rang and the next minute ann brought in a big boxone of those cardboard boxes that always look so tempting it was from marshall snelgrove she said and there was nothing to pay and there was my name miss mollie ward written as plainly as possible oh dear how excited i was but father would not let me cut the string and he was such a time fumbling over the knots and all the while he was laughing at me and calling me an excitable little goose there were layers and layers of tissue paper and thenoh wave dear never never in all our lives have we seen such a cloak i was almost afraid even to touch it father was right when he said rather gravely that it was more fit for one of the young princesses of wales than for his daughter but i must try to describe it it is a rich ivory silk with a lovely pattern running through it that looks like silver and it is so warm and soft and lined with the faintest and most delicate pink like the palm of a babys handthat was fathers idea and all round is the most exquisite feather trimming and when i put it on father said i looked like a white pigeon in its nest oh wave do you think that our good little monsieur blackie sent it there was no name no clue of any kind what am i to do ought i to thank him for it but there is no one else who would do such a kind thing and yet if he did not send it how awkward that would be you must think over it and help me darling your loving but distracted mollie waveney did not long delay her answer i am delighted about the cloak sweetheart she wrote and he is the very prince of black princes to make my sweet moll so happy and now mothers old red shawl can go back into the cedar box why of course it is monsieur blackie do you suppose any other person would do such a delightfully unconventional thing it is like a fairy story it is cinderella in real life the pumpkin coach and all but mollie take my word for it he will never own it perhaps if you get an opportunity you might tell him that you had been much mystified by receiving a beautiful present anonymously and that you greatly desired to thank the kind donor and then you will see what he says oh he is a deep one sir reynard and i should not be surprised if he professes entire ignorance on the subject if i could only peep at you on wednesday oh had i but aladdins lamp if only for a day i have been singing that ever since i read your letter and then waveney closed her note abruptly for fear she should say too much but some subtle feeling of delicacy prevented her from telling althea that the cloak was mr ingrams gift she never doubted for a moment but though she had written jokingly to mollie and called him the very prince of black princes in reality she was secretly dismayed if he loves her why does he not tell her so thought the girl anxiously instead of showering gifts on her in this oriental fashion is it because mollie is so unconscious and that she will not see and this is his way of winning her mr ingram does nothing like other men he is an idealist as he says he is good and kind but he is not good enough for my mollie she is worth a kings ransom she is the dearest and the loveliest and the best and here waveney broke down and shed a few tears for her heart felt full to overflowing with mingled pride and pain waveney had some errands to do in the town that afternoon and amongst other things she had to take the usual basket of flowers to miss chaytor waveney never cared for these visits she liked mr chaytorhe interested her more than any man she had ever seen but his sister bored her she told mollie once that she was as soft and damping as a november mist she found her this afternoon in one of her most depressing moods she had been having an argument with jemima and as usual had retired baffled from the contest jemima was a clever girl and had long ago taken her mistresss measure and she had an invariable resource on these occasions if i dont suit you maam i can leave this day month she would say crushingly and then joanna would hurriedly reply please dont talk nonsense jemima you suit me very well but all the same you had no right to stand talking to the milkman for a quarter of an hour well ten minutes then as jemima with some heat protested against this and i will thank you to be more careful for the future waveney heard the whole history of jemimas misdemeanours joanna had taken a fancy to the girl and often mentioned her to her brother she has such a pretty manner and she is bright and sympathetic she is just the person for althea and thorold had assented to this joanna wanted her to stay to tea but waveney had had an excuse readyshe was only too glad to get out of the house her own vitality was so strong and the interest of her own personality so absorbing that she could not understand how any human existence could be so meagre and colourless as miss chaytors seemed to be is it because she is an old maid thought the girl as she walked over the bridge if mollie or i did not marry should we ever be like that and then she added piously heaven forbid what was it miss althea had said that first sunday morning as they walked through the villagethat it always made her angry when people talked of empty blighted or disappointed lives and that it was their own fault if they did not find interests i wondered at the time what miss althea could mean she said to herself it sounded a little hard but i have thought it out since we must fertilise and enrich our lives properly and not let them lie fallow too long there is no need that any life should be thin and weedy i suppose miss chaytor has had her troubles but she is not without her blessings too i daresay her brother is very good to her oh yes certainly miss chaytor has her compensations waveney had finished all her errands but she meant to take a turn on the embankment the grey november afternoon had a certain charm for her it was not at all cold and she wanted to sit down for a few minutes and watch the barges being tugged slowly against the tide how mysterious they looked emerging from the dark arches of the bridge already they were lighting the gas and bright flickers were perceptible across the river a faint wind was flapping the brown and tawny sails of some vessels that were waiting to be unladen they reminded her of the tattered pennons in the chapel at chelsea hospital and then she thought sadly of the dear old sergeant he had died peacefully in his sleep about a week after her visit and his last conscious words had been about sheila mollie had seen the corporal two or three times and one sunday she and waveney had gone over to the hospital the little corporal had looked aged and dwindled but at the sight of waveney he had brightened aye he is gone he said in a subdued voice mcgill is gone and i am fairly lost without him ah he was a grand man for argufying and would stick to his guns finely for it stands to reason says i that a man with two eyes can see farther than a blind onenot that mcgill was blind thenand ill take my oath that there were only two of those darned black niggers and then how he would speechify and bluster and there would be a ring round us in no timeand go it mcgill and up at him corporal ah those were grand times but the lord gave and the lord hath taken awayand here corporal marks bared his grey head and must you be going miss ward well goodbye and god bless you and now the slow tears of age were coursing down the corporals wrinkled face aye jonadab frets sorely after his old comrade remarked nurse marks when waveney told her about her interview with the corporal what is it we are told my lambone taken and the other left and it stands to reason that the world is a poorer place for him waveney was thinking about her old friends as she seated herself on a bench overlooking the river at the farther corner a little girl was sitting but there was no one else in sight waveney was fond of children so she smiled and nodded to the child in quite a friendly way you must not sit long or you will take cold my dear she said oh i am always cold returned the child in a plaintive little voice and i am tired too for i have got two bones in my legs and they do ache so waveney looked at her curiously she was not a pretty childindeed it was rather a singular little face with oddly pronounced features she had patheticlooking eyes and fair hair which she wore in a long plait and in spite of her shabby dress and worn boots her voice was refined and sweet when she made her little speech she sidled up to waveney in the most confiding way do you have bones in your legs toobut you are one of the grownups grownups dont mind being tired daddie says when my legs grow longer they will leave off aching and i suppose daddie knows poor mite thought waveney pityingly and then she said kindly are you alone little one is your home near but the child shook her head daddie and i have not got any home she returned wearily there arent any homes in england are there we live with mrs grimson in chapel road i think she is a good woman she continued gravely in her oldfashioned way she bathed my feet so nicely when i got wet but i dont like her rooms they are not like my own dear home where was your home my dear asked waveney taking the little cold hand in hers but the child hesitated we had many homes but they were all across the sea a long long way off we came in a big ship with such a nice captain daddies gone to hamerton to look for aunt joa and mrs grimsons susan left me here i never knew before that grownups could be lost but we have been looking for aunt joa till i have got the aches in my legs and we have not found her yet this was rather puzzling to waveney but she was one of those motherly girls who knew by instinct how to win a childs heart so she only cuddled the cold little hands comfortably and asked her if she had a pretty name then the little girl smiled showing a row of white pearly teeth as she did so dad and i think it nice she returned nodding her head but it is very short daddie says i am too small to have a big name i am betty with an important air dads little betty but dad does always call me bet is your name long or short waveney was about to answer this friendly question when a mans voice behind them made her start why bet it said why are you perched up here like a lost robin and susan has been looking for you half over the place it is my daddie it is my dear dad cried the child joyously and the next moment she was running to meet a tall man who was walking quickly towards them waveney watched the meeting she saw the man stoop and kiss the little one fondly and then bet took hold of his rough coat and drew him towards the seat susan was naughty dad she did tell me to sit there and she would fetch me and she did never come at all but this young lady was very kind so i did not cry thats my brave little bet and then the man took off his hat to waveney thank you very much he said heartily i was obliged to leave my little girl and i am afraid they neglected her waveney felt vaguely perplexed the mans face and even his voice seemed strangely familiar to her and yet she was sure she had never seen him before he was a handsome man though his face looked weatherbeaten and somewhat worn his clothes were rough and shabby but his voice was unmistakably cultured he had evidently seen better days susan is not always naughty observed betty she gave me a peppermint once and it was very nice dad dear did you find aunt joa then the man shook his head in rather a depressed way no bet and we are still down on our luck there is no such name at hamerton perhaps this lady may know itand then he looked a little eagerly at waveney i am a stranger in these parts can you tell me if any one of the name of chaytor lives at dereham why yes returned waveney surprised by the question miss chaytor and her brother live in high street and their namestheir christian names i mean asked the stranger hoarsely mr chaytors name is thorold returned waveney simply and his sister is joanna then the man snatched up the child in his arms he seemed almost beside himself thank god we have found them bet my dear old theo and joa oh what a fool i have been going so far afield and all the time they are actually at dereham and then he sat down and a few words cleared up the mystery about an hour later as joanna was drawing the crimson curtains over the window jemima threw open the door with a little fling there is a child outside wanting to speak to you maam i would not let her into the passage because she might have come to beg but she said she wanted miss chaytor most particular very well jemima i will go and speak to her and joanna who was very tenderhearted and never turned away a tramp unfed went quickly to the door a little girl a tiny creature was standing there she looked up in joannas face wistfully oh please will you tell me if you are miss chaytormiss joanna chaytor correcting herself with careful pronunciation that is my name certainly returned joanna rather surprised at this and what do you want with me my little girl oh please aunt joa returned the child i am betty dads little betty and daddy is at the gate and then the next moment a mans shadow was distinctly visible chapter xxi a childs creed i was born sir when the crab was ascending and my affairs go backwardscongreve heaven lies about us in our infancywordsworth thorold chaytor was not an imaginative man he was neither emotional nor impressionable and more than once lately he had puzzled himself over the singular persistency with which his longlost brother tristram haunted him for the last two or three years he had hardly thought of him but now as he crossed the bridge of an evening little tricks of speech and longforgotten scenes would recur to his memory but he never spoke of this to joanna poor old trist i hope nothing has happened to him he said to himself one evening when the impression of his brothers presence had been so unusually strong that the familiar face had seemed as though it had been limned against the darkness and then he thought sadly and shuddered at the thought how it was a wellknown psychological fact that people at the point of death had often appeared or rather seemed to appear to some relative or friend of course it is only animal magnetismthe transmission of thoughtthe influence of one mind over another he thoughta strong wavebeat of sympathy but i should not have thought that i was the man for that sort of experience and then he put this latchkey into the door and let himself in as he hung up his hat on its accustomed peg he was aware of an unusual silence in the house the parlour door was not opened and there was no joanna with her irritating question is that you thorold neither did he hear her soft gliding footsteps overhead perhaps she has gone to the red house after all he said to himself and the thought of an evening of blissful solitude pleased him well but as he entered the sittingroom he started there were no preparations for the evening meal the teathings were still on the table and to his intense surprise a childactually a childwas fast asleep on the couch by the fire thorold crossed the room softly and contemplated the little stranger with puzzled eyes it must be one of joas waifs and strays he thoughtfor he was aware of his sisters charitable propensities and yet she hardly looked like a tramps child very likely the poor little thing has lost her way and joa is taking her in for the night he continued poor child she seems tired out and then his eyes softened as he noticed how carefully joanna had wrapped her up in her old fur cloak the next moment he heard his sisters footsteps on the stairs and went out into the passage to question her but when he saw her face he was struck dumb with astonishment joanna was looking radiant she was dimpling and smiling like the girl joa of old and her blue eyes were shining through happy tears oh thorold why are you so late we have wanted you so and joannas thin white hands grasped him almost convulsively who is that child he whispered loudly is it some one you have found in the street then in her excitement she gave him an hysterical little push you have seen her oh thorold is she not like him his little betty my darling tristrams little betty and as he stared at her and turned palefor a sudden prevision of the truth had come to himshe sobbed out yes yes tristram has comehe is upstairs he is in your room thorold go to him dear while i get your supper ready and then thorold drew a long breath and darted upstairs and joanna crying softly out of sheer bliss and gratitude busied herself in womanly ministrations thorold was thankful to meet his brother alone in spite of his reserve he was a man of deep feelings and when he felt tristrams mighty grasp of his hand and heard his familiar voice say in broken accents theo dear old fellowdear old chap he was almost too moved to speak why have you not written to us all these years were his first coherent words but tristram shook his headhe had no excuse to offer he had drifted from place to place seeking work and not always finding it and he did not wish his friends to know how hardly things had gone with him i was always a proud beggar thorold he said with a sigh but my back is pretty well broken now and theres bet you see and ellawhere is your wife trist then tristram turned his head aside ella is dead i buried her two years ago he returned sadly poor dear ella she never had her good things in this life you have taken me for better or for worse but there has been no better in it at all i often said to her but she never liked me to say it ah she was the best wife a man could have but she lies in the cemetery at melbourne and little theo lies with heri called him after you old chap but he never got over the fever i think it was the loss of the boy that finished ella for she never seemed to hold up her head again tristram evidently felt his wifes death acutely and thorold with quiet tact said a word or two of sympathy and then changed the subject before their brief talk was over and they went downstairs to join joanna thorold found out that tristram was utterly unchanged the handsome neerdowell as althea used to call him was only a little older and perhaps a trifle rougher but he was the same irresponsible happygolucky easytempered tristram of old shiftless and indolent he had drifted wherever the tide of circumstance had carried him sometimes he had worked and at other times he had starved but when any good samaritan stretched out a helping hand and drew him out from the slough of despond he would pull himself together and go on gaily as though the sun of prosperity had always shone on him never were there two brothers so widely dissimilar but tristram was no evilliving prodigal no black sheep to be dreaded and shunned by all rightminded people he had loved his wife and had treated her well and the poor woman had repaid him with the truest devotion and now his sister had received him with tears of joy his sins were the sins of a weak nature a nature that disliked effort and chose the softest paths for itself and which landed him in strange places sometimes i have made an awful muddle of my life he said when thorold questioned him with kindly interest dont you recollect the dear old governor said something of the kind on his deathbed upon my word old chap i think i am the unluckiest beggar that ever walked this earth nothing prospers with me if i make a little money i somehow contrive to lose it i am pretty nearly at the end of my tether i can tell you that what made you leave melbourne asked thorold in his calm judicial way then tristram shrugged his shoulders and seemed unwilling to answer the question well i was a fool he returned presently and he pulled his rough moustache a little fiercely the biggest fool out if you will but i got into a regular panic there were two of them lying there and bet was seedy and i got it into my head that the climate of melbourne did not suit her and then i thought what a fine thing it would be if joa could look after her a bit a child wants a womans care and as i smoked my pipe that evening i had such a fit of homesickness that i was nearly crazy i had a bit of money put by and i took our berths the next day and here we are old chap and you must just make the best of us and tristram brought down his hand heavily on his brothers shoulder they went downstairs after this and found betty awake and sitting on her aunts lap the little one was chattering happily to her and joanna was fondly stroking the plait of fair hair so he says to me you are dads betty are you my little miss and i said yes of course mr captain that is what daddie does always call me and he laughed in his beard oh such a great laugh why bet you chatterbox are you talking about your friend the captain exclaimed tristram come here you monkey and speak to uncle theo and betty came with ready obedience i am very glad to see you uncle theo she said gravely slipping her little hand into his and thorold stooped down and kissed her cheek then a little awkwardly he lifted her on his knee and scrutinised the childish features bets blue eyes opened rather widely she was vaguely alarmed by her new uncles solemnity daddie she said after a few minutes silent endurance does not uncle theo like me he do stare so and he has such big eyes for even to wee betty the noticeable man with large grey eyes was a formidable being at close quarters they all laughed at this and thorold kissed her again and told her to run to aunt joa and she would make her more comfortable but to his astonishment bet refused to leave him her nature was a curiously sensitive one and she had got it into her small mind that her plain speaking had hurt him and that she must somehow make it up with him i dont mind big eyes if they are nice ones she said graciously and yours are pretty nice uncle theo bet was rather aggrieved when her flattering speech was received with fresh mirth she was not so sure after that that she did not like aunt joa much the best when supper was over bet went to bed joanna had refused to part with her and had carried her off to her own room to the jaded disappointed woman the sight of bet kneeling by the bedside and saying her simple prayers was very sweet and touching god bless dear daddie and my own dear mammie and dear little brother theo and uncle theo and aunt joa too for ever and everamen bet darling whispered joanna pressing the little whitegowned figure tenderly in her arms did father teach you those prayers yes he did teach me returned bet sleepily and then she roused up there was an old woman once aunt joa she was a silly old woman and she did say to dad why do you let that baby pray for her mother i am quite shocked and dad he did say i am sorry maam that you should be shocked but i dont think the angels are a bit offended because my little girl asks god to bless one of the dearest of mothers oh i did laugh i was so pleased when dad said that when joanna went downstairs she found the two brothers talking over the fire she sat down beside tristram but on this evening there was no tangled skein in her hands they were folded placidly in her lap it was occupation enough for her to look at tristams brown weatherbeaten face and to listen to his voice now and then he looked at her with a kind smile trist do you know that thorold has nearly paid off fathers debts she said presently then tristram regarded his brother almost with awe oh you were always a fine fellow theo he said enviously you are the good elder brother you know and i am the prodigal here he sighed heavily well i am weary of my husks i want to turn over a new leaf and settle down you will find me some work old chap and ill stick to it like a trojan i give you my word i will work is not so easy to find returned thorold quietly but i will do what i can to help you i am pretty busy myself for i have to get up an important case we will talk about ways and means tomorrow yes and i must be going to my diggings now or mother grimson will think i am lost shes a decent body mother grimson and has been very good to my bet as tristram rose from his chair joanna caught hold of his arm wait a moment tristi want to ask thorold something before you go why should not trist and betty come hereat least for a time there is plenty of room and i could look after betand jemima is so fond of children do have them my dear it will make me so happy and joanna timidly put her hand on thorolds arm no no returned tristram but he spoke a little hoarsely you are a good creature joa but i must not take advantage of your kindness i have made my own bed and it is a hard one and i must lie on it but he looked at his brother very wistfully as he said this there was no hesitation in thorolds manner joanna is right he said calmly you had better come to us trist at least for a time while you are looking for a berth to suit you and tristram accepted this offer with gratitude oh thorold you have made us both so happy exclaimed joanna gratefully when tristram had left them bet is such a darling i could not bring myself to part with her but thorold only smiled at her without speaking when joanna had gone up to her room he sat down by the fire he wanted to think over things quietly the millstone that had been so long round his neck was slipping off and now he must adjust his shoulders to a new burden the wanderer had returned and he and his helpless child were to be received under his roof was he glad or sorry for this was the burden or the joy the greater would his home life be gladdened or still further depressed by these new inmates thorold could not answer these questions his straightforward sincere nature only grasped the one fact it is my duty with all his faults and follies he is my only brother god do so to me and more also if i refuse to help my own flesh and blood althea was very much moved when waveney carried home the news that evening she drove down to high street so early the next morning that joanna was still doing her marketing she found tristram sitting by the fire with bet on his knee he put down the child when he saw a stranger do you remember an old friend tristram she said holding out her hand and looking at him kindly then a sudden light dawned on him is itcan it be althea he asked and as she smiled he wrung her hands so energetically that she winced with pain oh yes of course i recognise you now you are just the same althea you are not a bit changed all these years no i have only grown older we all do that you know and this is your little girl tristram but she is not like you no bet takes after her mother but ella was pretty and bet is not bless her then betty who was snugly ensconced in altheas arm peeped out at her father with a protesting face did you want your little bet to be pretty dad she asked rather sadly no my pet he returned laughing i dont want her any different oh i am glad of that returned the child and then she frowned anxiously you are quite sure dad i could try very hard you know every one can try hard to be pretty and then in a low voice and i could ask god to help me mother always did say i might ask for anything i want and i could just say dad wants his little girl to be real pretty so please make me so for ever and for everamen tristram looked at althea with a smile he was used to bets quaint speeches he was surprised to see that altheas eyes were full of tears how beautiful it is she sighed the faith of little children how it shames us poor worldlings but at that moment joanna entered the room and bet with a joyful exclamation ran to meet her chapter xxii between the acts in all the humours whether grave or mellow thous such a touchy testy pleasant fellow hast so much wit and mirth and spleen about thee that theres no living with thee or without thee addison spectator the way is as plain as way to parish churchas you like it in all london there were no two happier girls than waveney and mollie ward that wednesday evening nevertheless mollies cup of bliss lacked one ingredient to make it perfect if only waveney were there if she had only known that at that very moment waveney was peeping at her from the back of the box opposite there is my dear mollie she whispered excitedly then althea much perplexed swept the boxes with her operaglass she could not see the girl anywhere but just opposite them standing quite alone in the front of a box there was a young lady in a white silk cloak and a pink shower bouquet in her hand and she had the sweetest and most beautiful face that althea had ever seen what a lovely girl she said to herself and she was not surprised to see that operaglasses from all parts of the house were levelled in that direction but the next moment she startedfor surely she recognized that dark foreignlooking man who had just entered the box moritz she ejaculated good heavens could that exquisite young creature be mollie ward and then altheas colour changed as a slight fair man joined them followed by a tall aristocraticlooking youth with pincenez father and noel whispered waveney in a voice of suppressed ecstasy but only doreen heard her altheas lips were white and trembling the lights were flickering before her eyes the tuning up of the instruments in the orchestra sounded harsh and discordant no she had not expected thisto find him so unchanged it was twentyone years since they had met and yet it seemed to her that it was the same everard ward whom she remembered so well he even wore the same white stephanotis in his coat he was a little older perhaps a trifle thinner but it was the same perfect face distance and the electric light softened down defects althea could not see how shiny and worn everards dresscoat was any more than she could see the lines on his forehead and round his eyes or the threatened baldness she only noticed that he stood in his old attitude his head raised and one hand lightly twirling his moustache althea stifled a sigh well she was glad to have seen him again very glad when ghosts were troublesome it was well to lay them and then though her womans heart failed her and she vaguely felt that doreen had been wiser and more prudent than she she determined to pluck up spirit and play her little drama to the bitter end the curtain had now drawn up and they were at liberty to seat themselves comfortably in the front of the box mollies and waveneys eyes were fixed on the stage but mr ingram who had seen the play before was not so engrossed he had just discovered a picturesque little girl in a sapphire blue cloak and a curly babyishlooking head who reminded him of his little samaritan he wanted to take another look at her but he could only see her profile and then altheas long pale face and reddish hair came into view and beside her doreens darkcomplexioned features now what on earth has put it into my cousins heads to come here tonight he said to himself in a vexed voice it is not like althea to spoil sport in this fashion and they have brought little miss ward too and then he frowned and twisted his moustache fiercely and growled under his breath confound those women in quite irate fashion any one who knew mr ingram wellhis mother if he had one or his sisterfor there was certainly no wife en evidencewould have seen that he was greatly chagrined and perplexed but being a humourist and one of the most goodnatured men living he worked off his wrath harmlessly by parodying the wellknown verse and muttering it softly for his own refreshment oh woman in our hour of ease a giddy flirt a flippant tease as aggravating as the shade by blind venetian ever made when pain and anguish wring the brow a veritable humbug thou and lo and behold he was so pleased with his own cleverness that his exasperation died a natural death the first act was over before mollie caught sight of waveney and then her delight and excitement were so great that her father had to gently admonish her that they were surrounded by strangers and noel in a melodramatic whisper threatened to take strong measures unless she behaved properly and left off kissing her hand like a crazy infant the next moment mr ingram left his seat and althea who guessed that he was coming across to them went to the back of the box to receive him he looked at her gravely et tu brute he said reproachfully as he took her hand althea laughed oh i was not spying on you my lord she returned playfully but he exclaimed hush for pitys sake in such an agonised tone that althea nearly laughed again that child does not hear us she said soothingly shall we take a turn in the corridor and as he nodded assent they went out together waveney had not even seen him enter the box she was busily telegraphing to mollie well moritz demanded althea in an amused tone you may as well make a clean breast of it why have you forgotten your poor old cousins at the red house and why are you masquerading in this mysterious fashion they call you mr ingram these children but you are not mr ingram now and though i am not curiousoh not the least bit in the world as he smiled provokingly i should like to know what it all means what it means upon my word althea you have asked a difficult question one cannot always tell the meaning of things and then moritz pulled his moustache in a perplexed way havent you watched some boy throw a stone in a pond it may be a mere pebble but the circles widen and widen until the whole surface of the water is covered with intersecting circles why yes she returned coolly but we are not throwing stones just now are we no it was only a parable i deal in parables sometimes i was just flinging my little pebble for mere sport and idleness when i called myself by my old name i wanted to be incognito to have no gaudy tag or bobtail attached to my humdrum personality only you see the play has lasted longer than usual but why she persistedbut her tone was a little anxious moritz please do not think me disagreeableyou were always a whimsical being and only gwen knows the extent of your eccentricities but i am interested in these people here she caught her breath a little when mr ward knows he might not be pleased oh i will take my chance of that he returned obstinately but althea had not finished all she had to say we used to know him so well in the old days he was constantly at kitlands no i know you and gwen never saw him there you were living abroad those two years but thorold chaytor knew him i was thinking that all this masquerading might lead to awkward complications by and by nonsense he returned quickly what makes you so fainthearted my dear cousin there will be no complications at all but althea shook her head almost sadly listen to me he went on with increased animation it is a pretty little comedy in real life and full of dramatic situations i am enjoying my incognito immensely it is the best bit of fun i have had since poor old ralston died in cleveland terrace i am monsieur blackie i adore the nameit suits me down to the ground then as althea laughed he took hold of her arm in a coaxing fashion althea you are a good creatureyou must promise to keep my secret for a little while i have made all my plans and prepared my denouement and i shall want your help in carrying it out no hints to gwen no treasonable correspondence gwen is a good girl but her honesty is almost clumsyit is yea yea and nay nay with her and jack too my masquerading as you call it would simply shock her now i have promised miss mollie to bring her sister to our box and i must keep my word perhaps moritzs voice changed as he said this but althea looked at him rather earnestly she is beautiful as an angel she said in a low voice take care of yourself moritz but only a flash of his eyes answered her certainly althea looked very grave when she reentered the box mr ingram had warned mollie that there must be no stage embrace so she had to content herself by squeezing waveneys hand at intervals the second act had already commenced and until it had ended there could be no conversation between the sisters but when the curtain fell for the second time mollie dried her eyesfor she had been shedding a deluge of tearssniffed daintily at her flowers and then asked waveney in a loud whisper if miss althea had given her that pretty cloak waveney nodded yes is it not sweet of her she says i am to keep it but mollie dear yours is almost too lovely do you know miss althea would not believe you were mollie ward because you were so beautifully dressed cinderella is turned into a princess tonight and then she put her lips to mollies ear did you find out anything from the black prince yesnooh please hush returned mollie with a distracting blush and a timid glance at ingram no dear he will not own to it but of course i know there the curtain is going up again and we shall hear if that dear girl is really dead mollie had made her little attempt while she was waiting for her father and noel mr ingram had come early but mollie was already dressed and limping up and down the room for she was far too restless to sit still i have brought you some flowers he said simply as he handed her the magnificent bouquet then as mollie blushed and thanked him she carefully rehearsed the little speech that she had prepared beforehand he was looking at her cloak admiring it yes his eyes certainly expressed decided approbation mr ingram she stammeredfor tact and finesse were not strong points with mollie do you know i have had a great surprise i have had such a beautiful present it came the other night and there was no name and no address and i do so want to thank the kind friend who sent it mr ingram was arranging the flowers in his buttonhole a leaf was awry and he was the soul of neatness perhaps this was why he did not look at mollie dear me he said quietly an anonymous gift this sounds interesting a little mystery always enhances the value of a thing oh do you think so returned mollie rather nonplussed by his tone i suppose being a girl i think differently about that i am sure that i should enjoy wearing my beautiful cloak a hundred times more if i could thank the giver there now observed ingram in a voice of supreme satisfaction i did not like to ask the question for fear you should think me inquisitive and it is really that cloak that becomes you so wellthat is the mysterious presenti congratulate you miss mollie i do indeed for i never saw you look better in my life upon my word if i were ordering an evening cloak for gwen i would choose her just such another poor mollie all this glib talk bewildered her but she was far too grateful and too much in earnest to give up her point so she only raised her lovely eyes to ingram and said very wistfully you could not help me to find out i do so want to know but ingram only shrugged his shoulders he even looked a trifle bored you may ask me anything else miss mollie but i assure you i should make a bad detective why he continued airily i find it difficult enough to keep my own secrets without finding out other peoples oh here comes our friend the humourist and now may i beg to inform you that monsieur blackies carriage stops the way waveney did not return to her friends box and at the conclusion of the play they all met in the lobby waveney was hanging on her fathers arm but he disengaged himself hastily when he saw the sisters althea who had been nerving herself for this moment all the evening was only a little paler than usual as she held out her hand to him it is a great many years since we met mr ward she said with a grave smile yes he returned looking at her with equal gravity but his eyes were sad more than twenty years i think and then he shook hands with doreen rather stiffly while althea spoke to mollie and noel i should like you to come and see me my dear she said to the delighted girl would next tuesday suit you waveney shall come over in the carriage and fetch you and perhaps your brother would join you and take you back in the evening and mollie accepted this invitation with great readiness everard who had overheard this came a step nearer i must take this opportunity of thanking you for your kindness to my dear child he said with strong feeling in his voice it was hard to part with her but you make her so happy that mollie and i try to be resigned to her loss you do not owe me any thanks returned althea her lips paling with evident emotion for we love her for her own sake and she is a great comfort to me ah i see my cousin is beckoning to you so i will wish you goodnight everard shook hands with her rather absently but a moment later he came back to her side miss harford pardon me but did you say just now that ingram was your cousin then althea looked a trifle confused how incautious she had been yes she returned guardedly moritz is certainly our cousinonce removed when we were at kitlands his father colonel ingram lived abroad so that is why you never met him did you not ever hear us speak of moritz and gwendoline i think noti am sure not but everards eyes were downcast as he spoke then without another word he lifted his hat and turned away the mention of kitlands had been like a stab even althea hardly guessed how this meeting had tried him and how cruelly his pride had suffered althea was very silent all the way home she was tired she said and doreen and waveney must discuss the play without her but as she leant back in her corner of the carriage very little of the conversation reached her ears ah she had noted all the changes now the shiny dresscoat the lines the slight baldness had all been apparent under the flaring gaslights in the lobby she could see now that everard was aged and altered the spring and brightness of youth had gone and care and disappointment and ceaseless drudgery had given him the stoop of age already his shoulders seemed bowed as though some heavy load lay on them but the face grave and careworn as it was was the face of her old lover the features were as finely chiselled as ever no sorrow no failure no wearing sense of humiliation would ever rob everard ward of his mans beauty though perhaps an artist would no longer desire to paint him as ithuriel i am glad to have seen him again thought althea but a dry sob rose in her throat as she said it how coldly how gravely he had accosted her he had expressed no pleasure in meeting his old friends had asked no single question about their welfare a few stiff words of thanks for her kindness to waveney but nothing more nothing more and altheas eyes grew misty with unshed tears in the darkness there were some lines by miss murdoch that everard had once written in her album she had read them so often that she knew them by heart they were haunting her now forgotten no we never do forget we let the years go wash them clean with tears leave them to bleach out in the open day or lock them careful by like dead friends clothes till we shall dare unfold them without pain but we forget not never can forget it is my nature to be faithful althea had once touchingly said to her sister and to forget was certainly not possible to her chapter xxiii across the golf links learn to live and live to learn ignorance like a fire burns little tasks make large returns bayard taylor sits the wind in that quarter shakespeare when waveney went home the following sunday she carried with her a choice little piece of information which she retailed with much gusto at the teatable father she said in a mysterious voice i have found out something so interesting about our dear little monsieur blackie then mollie who was pouring out the tea paused in her task to listen he is a relation of the misses harfordstheir cousin once removed miss althea told me so his father colonel ingram was their own cousin mollies face wore an awed expression she was evidently much impressed but mr ward looked a little perplexed ingram he muttered i do not remember the name and yet i thought i knew all their relations no father dear returned waveney gently miss althea said you had never seen any of themthey were living abroad because mrs ingrams health was so bad there was only one daughter gwendoline and she is married now but i thought you and mollie would be interested to know that he is a connection of the dear ladies at the red house then noel solemnly rapped on the table with his knife i propose monsieur blackies health he said grandly he seems a respectable sort of party and i am proud to have made his acquaintance i regreti may say i deeply regretthat i once made the unlucky observation that his head was like a scrubbing brush and that his moustache was of the mephistophelian pattern but what are such trifles between friends and then his voice grew thin and nasal for i guess and do calculate ladies and gentlemen that the party in question is boss of the whole show and will boom considerable and then he sat down and glared at mollie through his pincenez but mollie who seemed a little flurried and excited said nothing at all only as she and waveney were putting on their hats for church she said in rather a subdued quiet little voice wave dear of course i am glad about mr ingram but it does not make any real difference does it for we always knew he was a gentleman father thinks he must be rich he is so generous with his money but he will never be too grand to be our friend will he mollies voice was not quite steady when she said this to her simplicity it seemed a surprising thing that their homely kindly monsieur blackie should have such grand relations mollie spent a very happy day at the red house althea who knew what girls love best told waveney to take her all over the house and show her everything and left them alone together she and doreen had an engagement for the afternoon but tea was served up as usual in the library when althea returned she found them nestled together in the big easychair by the fire looking like a couple of babes in the wood she said to doreen afterwards and it was so pretty and effective a picture that she forbade them to move and then she sat down and talked to them in so sweet and friendly a way that mollies soft heart was soon won and when noel arrived looking a little shy and awkwardafter the fashion of boyshe found them all talking merrily together both althea and doreen were charmed with mollie doreen frankly owned to her sister that she had never seen so beautiful a face if it were not for her lameness she would be perfect she said regretfully and althea agreed to this it is a pity of course she returned gently but there is something pathetic in it and then her unconsciousness is so childlike she is a sweet creature and i love her already but not so much as i love my little undine for somehow both she and doreen often called her by this name waveney had not seen her little friend betty again but althea and doreen were constantly at the house in high street and she often heard them mention her name sometimes of an evening when she was reading to herself she heard them talking about the chaytors and as they never dropped their voices she thought it no harm to listen joa is a different woman doreen once said i never saw such a change in any one i always knew tristram was her favourite thorold has to play second fiddle now i am a little sorry for him sometimes your sorrow is wasted dorrie returned her sister with a smile thorold is too big and strong for these petty feelings he values joas peace of mind far too much to disturb it by paltry jealousy he tells me that for the present tristram and the child will continue to live with them until tristram can earn enough to keep a respectable roof over his head it was very lucky finding him that berth and it really suits him very well but joa says that betty misses her father terribly she spends half her time at the window watching for him bettys name was perpetually on the sisters lips her queer little speeches her odd ways her shrewdness and intelligence and above all her warm childish heart were favourite topics and bets last was a standing joke with them waveney began to wish to see her again but miss althea never sent her now to the chaytors once joanna called and had tea at the red house but betty was not with her the child had a slight cold she said and she had left her with jemima but throughout the visit she talked of little else bets lessons her storybooks the new doll that althea had given her and the basinette that she was trimming for a christmas present were all discussed quite seriously waveney listened eagerly in her corner for once she found miss chaytor interesting her voice had lost its fretful strain she spoke with animation and as she talked there was a pretty dimple that waveney had never noticed she must have been very pretty when she was a girl thought waveney she is goodlooking now and her face is quite pleasant when she smiles and then again she heard bets name and composed herself to listen the love of that mite for her father is quite wonderful went on joanna even thorold notices it quite an hour before trist is due bet will be gluing her face and flattening her nose against the window and nothing will move her and all the time she is humming to herself like a little birdsuch funny little scraps of tunes and then when he crosses the road she is out of the room like a dart and to hear all her oldfashioned questions to him in the passage oh it almost makes me cry to listen to her are you very tired father dear have you had a hard day does your head ache and are your feet cold but aunt joa has made up such a big firesomething like that every night bless her little heart observed doreen sympathetically but althea only smiled and then she brings him in and makes such a fuss over him went on joanna just as though he were some feeble gouty old gentleman but tristram lets her do it i think he likes to feel her little fingers busy about him she fetches him his warm slippers and a footstool or a screen if the fire is hot and when he is quite comfy as she calls it she climbs up on his knee and gives him an account of the day when joanna had taken her leave althea stood looking into the fire with a grave abstracted look but when doreen returned to the room she changed her attitude slightly joa seems very happy does she not dorrie she has not worn so bright a face since the old manor house days no indeed and it is all bets influence she is like a hen with one chick it almost makes me laugh to hear her i felt nearer crying i assure you but dorrie is it not beautiful to see how love effaces self and a little child shall lead them do you remember those words already bets tiny fingers have smoothed out the lines on joas face and taught her to smile again waveney only saw mr chaytor on thursday evenings at the porch house the shakespeare readings were still in full swing and she still sat beside nora greenwell she sometimes thought that mr chaytor spoke less to her than to the other girls though he was always careful to point out any fault of punctuation now and then when she was a little weary of following the text she would raise her eyes from her books and more than once it had given her an odd shock to find at that very moment mr chaytor was quietly regarding her then some sudden shyness made her eyelids droop again mr chaytor took no apparent notice of her when the reading was over he always joined althea and a grave bow or perhaps a pleasant goodnight when waveney left the room was all that passed between them it was strange then that as thorold chaytor walked down the hill in the wintry darkness a little pale face and a pair of dark spirituelle eyes should invariably haunt him never in his life had he seen such eyes so soft and deep and magnetic and then that babyish crop of brown curly hairhe wondered why she wore it so it made her look so childish but he liked it tooit struck him that she was lighter and more sprightly and full of grace and lissomeness than any girl he had seen and that his name of undine suited her down to the ground he remembered well her sisters lovely face but of the two he preferred his little undine once when he had entered the recreation hall and the seat beside nora greenwell was vacant a troubled look came into his eyes but waveney who had only gone across to the house for a book althea wanted reentered a moment later and thorolds brow cleared like magic as her light springy step passed by his chair i hope i have not disturbed you she said rather timidly as he rose from his seat and wished her goodevening but miss harford had forgotten her shakespeare not at all but we will begin now then as waveney opened her book she wondered at mr chaytors grave intent look about ten days before christmas waveney attended by her little companions fuss and fury started off for a walk over the common it was one of those ideal afternoons in december when all young creatures feel it is a joy to be alive there had been a heavy frost in the night and the bright wintry sunshine had not yet melted it the frost king had touched the saplings with his white fingers and even the bare blackberry bushes were transformed into things of beauty the vast common seemed to glitter with whiteness under the pink glow of the winters sky waveney had turned her steps towards the golf links the wind blew more bleakly there but the wide stretch of open common with the black windmill in the distance always gave her a pleasant sensation of freedom she loved to watch the sun sinking into his bed of brightcoloured clouds but when the pink glow faded and the skyline became a cold steely blue she shivered a little as though she had stayed too long at some pageant and set her face homewards she had walked too far and she knew the darkness would overtake her long before she reached the red house and then miss althea would gently admonish her for her imprudence the little dogs were tumbling over each other and wetting their silky coats in the frosty grass waveney called them sharply to order if no one were in sight she thought she would race them across the common but the next moment she heard footsteps behind her involuntarily she quickened her own steps it was rather a lonely part of the common there was no one to be seen only the gaunt black arms of the windmill seemed to stretch into the darkening sky the rapid even footsteps behind her made her nervous and gave her the feeling of being in a nightmare if she could only look around and then to her intense relief a familiar voice pronounced her name mr chaytor she gasped for her heart was beating so fast that she could hardly speak oh how glad i am it was very foolish of me but i never can bear to be followed in a lonely place i was afraid i frightened you he said coming to her side but you were walking so fast that i found it difficult to overtake you forgive me i know i have no right to lecture but at this hour the golf links is far too lonely a place for a young lady yes you are right returned waveney touched by this kind interest in her welfare and i must never walk here again so late butwith a sigh of regreti do love it so do you returned mr chaytor quickly i wonder why but with his habitual reserve he forbore to add that it was his favourite walk it is so wide she replied in her earnest voice all this space with nothing between you and the sky makes one feel so free and happy the sunsets are always so beautiful here and if it were not for the loneliness i should love to watch the darkness like a big black ogre swallow up all the lovely light it was a pity waveney could not see mr chaytors smile shall we stand and watch it now he said indulgently you have a safe escort so we need not fear your ogre only you must not take cold but waveney only thanked him and said that she was late already and that they had better go what a walk that was and how waveney remembered it afterwards if mr chaytor had laid himself out to please and interest her he could not have succeeded better books pictures accounts of his old summer wanderings and yet not for one moment did waveney feel that he was talking down to her level it seemed the spontaneous outpouring of a wellbred intellectual man glad to impart information to a congenial companion but if waveney was charmed and interested certainly mr chaytor was gratified miss wards bright intelligence her racy and picturesque remarks her frankly confessed ignorance were all delightful to him since the old manor days he had seen so few girls and none of them had attracted him in the least there was something unique out of the common about miss ward he felt vaguely that he would like to know more of her perhaps it was this feeling that made him say presently i am afraid you have forgotten your little friend bettyfor he knew all about that meeting on the embankment betty had given him a most realistic and graphic account and the little lady did warm my hands so uncle theoand here bet rubbed away at his hands until she was red in the faceand all the time she did talk and her great big eyes were laughing at me bet has a good memory for her friends and she often talks about you continued thorold she is a fascinating little person even to me though i do not profess to understand children she is full of surprises you never get to the end of her my sister fairly worships her yes i know returned waveney softly and i am so very gladglad for your sister i mean i should love to see betty again i am not like you mr chaytor i have been a childworshipper all my life oh i know they are naughty sometimes but they are so much nearer the angels than we are and they are not such a long way off from heaven heaven lies about us in our infancy are you a student of wordsworth miss ward but she shook her head i have read some of his poems she returned modestly but i am afraid i know very little good poetry that is a pity but one can always mend a fault at easter i propose having a course of reading from tennyson and mrs browning ah here we are at the red house you will come in and have a cup of tea after your long walk observed waveney miss doreen is in town but i know miss althea is at home then after a moments hesitation mr chaytor assented and followed her into the house my dear child how late you are observed althea rather anxiously as waveney opened the library door i was getting nervous about you i am afraid i am rather late confessed the girl but fortunately i met mr chaytor and he has come in with me for some tea then there was no lack of welcome in altheas face and voice fresh tea was ordered and another supply of hot buttered scones a big pinelog thrown on the fire and as thorold sat in his luxurious chair with a glass screen between him and the blaze with his little walking companion opposite him and altheas warm smile on them both he had never felt himself more comfortable or at his ease chapter xxiv lost stolen or strayed rainy and rough sets the day theres a heart beating for somebody i must be up and away somebodys anxious for somebody swain mr ingram had once compared the english climate to unregenerated womanhood and had declaimed on this subject in his own whimsical fashion at cleveland terrace much to the delight of his young friend the humourist it is womanhood pure and simple and unadulterated by civilisation he continued blandly as he twisted his mephistophelian moustache it is the savage mother and no mistake with all her crude grand humours sometimes she is benevolent fairly brimming over with the milk of loving kindness she has her sportive moods when she bubbles over with smiles and mirtha may day for examplewhen she walks through the land as meekly as a garlanded lamb hear hear observed noel sotto voce but mollie who was deeply impressed frowned him down mr ingram paused as though for welldeserved applause he felt himself becoming eloquent so he took up his parable again but the savage mother knows how to sulk and frown and her tearstorms and icy moods are terribly trying there is no coquetry about her then it is the storm and stress of a great passion and with this grand peroration mr ingram gave his moustache a final twist and as noel phrased it brought down the house waveney thought of monsieur blackies parablefor of course it had been duly retailed to her in mollies weekly budgetwhen the weather changed disastrously before christmas the frost king no longer touched the earth with his white fingers the wintry sunshine had faded from the landscape the skies were grey and threatening and the raw cold made ones flesh creep hardly christmas weather althea observed regretfully as she looked out from the library window at the blackened grass and sodden uninviting paths only under the wide verandah of the porch house a crowd of birds were feeding waveney was as usual watching them i am afraid it will rain before evening returned doreen the barometer is going down fast i do so dislike a wet christmas and to this althea cordially agreed but no amount of impending rain could damp waveneys pleasurable expectations for she had a delightful programme before her that year christmas day fell on saturday and as althea and doreen always dined with mrs mainwaring althea proposed driving her to cleveland terrace aunt sara would be delighted to see you dear she saidindeed you were included in the invitation but i told her that you would far rather be with your own people oh thank you thank you returned the girl gratefully but her joy was unbounded when althea suggested that she should not return to the red house until tuesday afternoon i shall need all my helpers then she finished smiling and waveney understood her the christmas programme had been duly unfolded to her there was to be a grand tea and entertainment for altheas girls at the porch house a festive evening at the home for workers a supper for the dereham cabmen and another for the costermongers and on twelfth night the servants at the red house always entertained their relations and friends in the recreation hall in fact as doreen expressed it no one would have time to sit down comfortably until the feast of epiphany had passed but though doreen spoke in a resigned tone of a weary worker it might be doubted if any one enjoyed more thoroughly the bustle and preparation the day before christmas was a busy one for all the inmates of the red house doreen was at the home all day superintending the christmas decorations and althea spent most of her time at the porch house where a band of voluntary helpers were making garlands of evergreens and framing christmas mottoes in ivy under her skilful direction waveney would willingly have helped in the work but althea had other employment for her some of her pensioners lived on the other side of the river and waveney who often acted as her almoner went off early in the afternoon to order parcels of groceries and other good things and to carry them to two or three old women who lived in the almshouses the old women were garrulous and detained her with accounts of their various ailments so it was quite dark before the little gate of the almshouse garden closed behind her for some time she had heard the pattering of the rain against the windowpanes and knew that she would have a long wet walk home aye but it is a wild night observed mrs bates lugubriously as she stirred her bright little fire afresh and it makes one shiver to ones very bones that it do but your warm shawl will be a comfort returned waveney cheerfully well i must go now a happy christmas to you mrs bates and i hope your rheumatism will soon be better and then waveney unhasped the upper half of widow batess door and peered out into the darkness it was not inviting certainly the cold sleety rain was falling in torrents a wild night assuredly and one that meant mischief but waveney wore a stout waterproof cloak that althea had lent to her and thought she would be proof against any amount of rain or sleet true her umbrella was just a little slit but she would soon have it recovered a narrow winding passage resembling a cathedral close led to high street a few oldfashioned houses fronted the garden wall of the vicarage here it was so dark that waveney was rather startled when she heard a childs voice close to her elbow oh please i am quite lost and will you take me home there was something familiar in the voice but in the darkness it was impossible to see the childs face but waveneys ear was never deaf to any childish appeal oh you poor little thing she said kindly where do you live and what is your name i am dads little betty returned the child she spoke in a tired dreary little tone and i live across the water past the church with uncle theo and aunt joa then in spite of the wet waveney stooped down and put her arm round her why it is my little friend betty she said in a puzzled tone why are you out alone this dreadful night oh you poor darling your frock and jacket are quite soaking come come we must go home as fast as possible give me your hand dear and come closer to me so that my umbrella may shelter you is it my little lady asked betty in a perplexed voice she did speak to me so kindly once on the seat by the river but i have never never seen her again but we shall see each other presently when we get to the shops returned waveney cheerily betty darling tell me why are you out by yourself i wanted to meet dad returned betty with a little sob aunt joa was out and i was so lonely all by myself and jemima was busy and told me to run away and i was aching dreadful because it was christmas eve and dad did not come and i thoughtand bet sobbed afreshit would be such fun to see him pass me and then i should call out loud heres bet dad and i have come to meet you but there was no dad at all yes and then you missed your way it was so dark returned bet plaintively and there were trees and i fell down and hurt myself and then i got frightened are you frightened in the dark too no i am only frightened of doing wrong things betty dear i am afraid you have been very naughty and that poor aunt joa will be anxious can you walk faster darling but bet tired and miserable felt as though her poor little legs were weighted with lead but for the umbrella waveney would have carried her it hurt her to hear the child sobbing to herself quietly in the darkness it was a cruel night for any child to be out mr ingrams savage mother was in her fiercest mood and seemed lashing herself up to fresh fury there was scarcely a footpassenger to be seen on the bridge but a few shivering men and women were in the town making their christmas purchases bet cheered up a little when the bridge had been crossed we shall soon be there now she sighed do you know my home little lady yes dear and i know your aunt joa too and your uncle theo and dad no darling not dad but i daresay i shall know him some day see how pretty all those lights look yes this is the house as betty pulled at her hand and the next moment they were standing on the doorstep to waveneys surprise mr chaytor opened the door he regarded them with amazement waveneys old umbrella had not fulfilled its mission and the velvet on her hat was soaking and so was her hair but she was nothing to betty in the lamplight she looked the most abject little child possible she was splashed with mud from head to foot and her plait of fair hair was so wet that mr chaytor hurriedly withdrew his hand why she is wet through he said in a shocked voice then waveney hurriedly explained matters i am afraid betty has been rather naughty she said quickly she went out by herself in the hope of meeting her father and then she lost herself and got frightened she was just by aylmers almshouses when she spoke to me aylmers almshouses across the river he exclaimed quite horrified why i thought she was with my sister what are we to do miss ward looking at her with all a mans helplessness joanna may not be back for an hour and jemima has gone to the general postoffice and the child is dripping with wet from head to foot waveney was quite equal to the emergency i think if you will allow me i had better take her upstairs she returned quietly and get off her wet things and if you could get her something hot to drinkmilk or teaanything so that it is hot then mr chaytor looked relieved i could make her a cup of tea he returned if you are sure that will do the kettle is boiling now thank you very much was all waveney answered now betty dear will you show me the way to your room i sleep in aunt joas room replied betty making brave efforts to restrain her tears her poor little lips were blue with cold and her teeth were chattering and her fingers were so numb that they could not turn the handle of the door and waveney had to come to her help it was a large pleasant room furnished simply and a bright fire gave it an air of comfort a childs cot stood beside the bed there were some fine old prints on the walls and the silver and ebony brush on the toilettable and the quilted silk eiderdown on her bed spoke of better days waveney took off her dripping waterproof and hat and then she set to work and in five minutes bettys wet things lay in a heap on the floor and she was wrapped up in her aunts warm flannel dressinggown and ensconced in the big easychair then waveney sat down on the rug and rubbed the frozen little feet betty she said coaxingly i do wish you would be a good child and go straight to bed but betty puckered up her face at this and looked so miserable that waveney did not dare to say more its my dads birthday and christmas eve she said in a heartbroken voice dad would not enjoy his tea one bit unless i buttered his toast and gave him his two lumps of sugar well then you must tell me where to find you some dry clean clothes returned waveney with a disapproving shake of her head but just then there was a tap at the door and when she said come in to her surprise mr chaytor entered with two large cups of steaming tea in his hands jemima is still playing truant he said apologetically so i was obliged to bring the tea myself and then he set down the cups on a little table piling up joannas small possessions in a most ruthless fashion to make room for them perhaps the novelty of the situation bewildered him or something in the little fireside scene appealed to him for he stood beside bettys chair for two or three minutes without speaking betty in her scarlet dressinggown was certainly a most picturesquelooking little object but thorolds eyes rested longer on the girlish figure on the rug at the busy ministering hands and the damp curly hair still glistening with wet do please drink your tea before it cools he said pleadingly when jemima comes back i shall send her up to help you and clear all the wet things away and then he went downstairs and set on the kettle again to boil and all the while the memory of a bare little foot resting on a girls soft pink palm haunted him it is the eternal motherhood he said to himself that is in all true women no wonder bet loves her how could she help ithow could she help it and then the doorbell rang and jemima entered with profuse apologies at her tardiness she was sent upstairs with a supply of hot water and towels and as soon as betty had finished her tea her face and hands were washed her hair dried and neatly tied with a ribbon then she was dressed in clean fresh garments i have got my best frock on and i feel quite nice and like christmas eve exclaimed betty with a quaint little caper oh i am sure dad must have come and aunt joa too do let us go downstairs let me wash my hands first darling pleaded waveney and oh dear how untidy i look and betty stood by the toilettable watching with critical eyes while waveney tried to bring the unruly locks into order aunt joa has such long long hair she observed when she sits down it almost touches the floor but yours is nice baby hair tooit is like little rings that have come undone but it is pretty dont you think sofeeling that waveney must be the best judge of such a personal matter jemima giggled as she picked up the little muddy boots law miss bet she said reprovingly how you do talk no little ladies that i ever knew said such things theres your pa he is downstairs and awaiting for his tea but bet heard no more come come she said pulling waveney by the dress dad is downstairs and the curls dont matter one bit then waveney reluctantly followed her her hat and gloves were drying she could not possibly put them on for another halfhour and she could hardly stay ruminating in miss chaytors bedroom joanna had not yet returned she was evidently weatherbound at some friends house but a goodlooking weatherbeaten man in a rough grey coat stood with his back to the fire bet ran to him at once oh dad i did so want to be ready for you but i got wet and the little lady was helping me to dress up again yes i know bet and then her father kissed her a little gravely and held out his hand to waveney i am very grateful to you miss ward my brother has been telling me of your kindness to my little girl she has been a very naughty child i am afraid then bet looked up in his face and her lip quivered was it really bad of me to go out and meet you dadreally and truly yes darling really and truly and then tristram took her on his knee what would dad have done without his little bettyand she might have been lost or run over oh i would have found my way back returned bet with a wise little nod of her head but i wont never do it again and then her little arms went round his neck and she rested her head against the rough grey coat for her childish heart was full to the brim miss ward observed thorold in rather a pleading voice as my sister is absent may i ask you to pour out the tea then waveney blushing a little at the unexpected request took her place quietly at the teatray chapter xxv a wet night and a difference of opinion i am sir oracle and when i ope my lips let no dog bark merchant of venice beggar i am i am even poor in thanks hamlet what a strange christmas eve it was waveney felt as though she were in a dream as she sat there demurely pouring out the tea with betty beside her counting the lumps of sugar in each cup two for daddie and one big one for uncle theo oh that is not big enough is it uncle theo and oh dearin a reproachful voiceyou did put in the milk first i shall know better next time returned waveney smiling and then she watched betty spreading her fathers toast with butter the childs concentrated earnestness her absorbed gravity amused her but tristram evidently took it as a matter of course what a cosy room it was waveney thought the crimson curtains were drawn and a bright fire burnt in both the fireplacesan unwonted extravagancein honour of christmas eve the circle of easychairs round the farthest fireplace looked snug and inviting thorold did not talk much during teatimehe left the conversation principally to his brother but he often looked at the little figure that occupied joannas place his fastidious eyes noticed the neat dainty movements and the changes of expression on the bright speaking face and the lovely dimple when waveney smiled or laughed a man could hardly be dull with such a companion he thought and then at some sudden suggestion some overwhelming possibility a dull flush rose to his temples and he went to the window to inspect the weather i am sorry to say that it is still raining miss ward he said quietly and i am afraid we are in for a wet night but i will get you a cab a cab interrupted waveney in a dismayed tone oh no thank you mr chaytor you must do nothing of the kind i am as strong as a lion and i never take coldat least scarcely ever and what does a little rain matter you are a stoic he returned somewhat amused at this but she seemed so horrified at his suggestion that he said no morebeing a man of deeds not words so when waveney took possession of an easychair and betty brought her her baby doll to admire she felt comfortably convinced that she would be allowed her own way but she had reckoned without her host waveney chatted happily to the child while tristram watched them with the lazy enjoyment of a tired man and she never wondered why mr chaytor was absent so long until he reentered the room in his ulster the cab is here miss ward he said coolly and you will find your things in my sisters room jemima says they are quite dry then waveney only flashed a look of reproach at him and walked meekly out of the room of course he was right she knew that and that the idea of the long lonely walk in the pelting rain was absurd in the highest degree but as waveney went upstairs she was not sure that she liked the quiet way in which mr chaytor asserted his will it made her feel like a little schoolgirl in the presence of a master he had not taken the trouble to argue the point with her or to prove to her that she had made a mistake but had just gone out and brought the cab and so waveney who in spite of her sweet temper was a trifle selfwilled and obstinate felt secretly aggrieved and even offended and she entered the parlour with so dignified an air that thorold who could read her face smiled to himself betty ran to her with a sorrowful exclamation oh must you go wavie dear she said dubiously why bet observed her uncle rather shocked at this familiarity arent you taking rather a liberty with your kind friend she told me her name returned bet in eager defence and she did say that i might call her what i liked i know it was wavie or something like it very like it indeed darling replied waveney kneeling down and putting her arms round the child and it is prettier than waveney and i shall always want you to call me so now goodnight my little betty and then as betty clung to her and kissed her thorold looked at them rather gravely i am ready now observed waveney resuming her stiff manner i suppose it will be no use telling you mr chaytor that i can very well go by myself no he returned looking at her with very keen bright eyes i am afraid your words would be wasted you see miss ward i have a conscience and my conscience tells me that i ought to see you safe in miss harfords hands but to this waveney vouchsafed no reply she jumped into the cab and settled herself in her corner and left mr chaytor to dispose of himself as he would and when he placed himself opposite to her she only looked out intently at the lighted shops even the rain could not quite damp the festivity the snowwhite turkeys and geese garlanded with holly made a brave show and the butchers shop was full of shabby customers waveneys soft heart yearned as usual over the babies and little children then she turned her head and met mr chaytors amused glanceit was so kind it spoke of such complete understanding that she felt a little ashamed of herself miss ward have you forgiven me yet for doing my duty like a man waveney struggled with a smile but she had not quite recovered herself so she said rather coldly i dont see that my forgiveness matters a bit is not that rather crushing he returned especially as it matters very much to me i wish you would be friendly enough to tell me the real cause of offence you could not reasonably expect that i should let you swim through thisthe rain beating an accompaniment to his words i would not have let my sister do ithis voice softening into involuntary tenderness never had she seemed so lovable to him even though her childish waywardness was making him smile it was not the cab i minded so much stammered waveney tingling with shame and confusion to her fingerends and glad of the darkness that hid her hot cheeks only you did it without telling mewaveney did not dare say what she really thought that he had managed her like a childand it makes me unhappy it does indeed mr chaytor to bring you out this dreadful night when you are so tired and have been hard at work all day i never felt less tired in my life and you are giving me great pleasure in allowing me to perform this little service for you then waveney blushed again but this time for pleasure for mr chaytors voice convinced her that he was speaking the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth now we have had our first and last little difference he went on cheerfully and shall be better friends than ever and there was no outward dissent to this only a mutinous sparkle in waveneys dark eyes showed a silent protest would it be their last difference she thought for she was a shrewd sensible little woman and had her own opinions on most things but at least she had the grace and honesty to own that on this occasion she had been in the wrong what a short drive it was after all almost before waveney had seen that they were at the top of the hill they were driving through the lodge gates althea came out into the hall to meet them in her heliotrope velveteen and lace ruff she looked more like queen bess than ever my dear child i have been so anxious about you but of course i hoped you had taken shelter thank you for bringing her home thorold will you come in or is your cab waiting we have our usual mulled wine and christmas cake which you ought to taste for the sake of the old lang syne may i give the cabman some poor old fellow he is so cold but it was a mere form of words he need not have asked the question on christmas eve not an errand boy or a carol singer left the red house without being regaled with christmas farecakes and ale as althea and doreen called it thorold carried out a great mug of hot spiced wine and a mighty wedge of cake to the driver then he took his by the hall fire as he said he was too wet and dirty for the library waveney found him there alone when she came downstairs fresh pensioners were claiming the sisters attention he looked warmed and refreshed and recommended her to follow his example see what a treat you have given me miss ward he said smiling there is no mulled wine like this anywhere the flavour brings back my dear old home to me do you mean the old manor house she asked softly yes he returned dreamily it is the season for old memories is it not at christmas and new years day the ghosts of the past stalk out of their dim recesses but they are dearly loved visitants and we do not fear them do you know what the germans call heimweh have you ever experienced it but he need not have asked for at the unexpected question the girls head drooped to hide her tears how could he know how could any one know how that brave young heart ached ceaselessly for her home and mollie mr chaytor was quite shocked at himself dear miss ward he said gently you must forgive me again you see but i spoke without thinking then waveney shook her head and looked at him with a touching little smile you have done nothingit is only i who am silly tonight but oh i am always so wanting father and mollie but i shall see them tomorrow mr chaytor i must go now but thank you so much for all your kindness and for bringing me home i am not ungrateful really and waveneys wet eyes looked so sad and beautiful as she raised them to his face that mr chaytor thought of them all through his drive home when waveney woke the next morning she found the rain had ceased but it was still too dark to discover anything further they drove to church for the early service and the warm lighted church with its christmas decorations and crowded with worshippers reminded her of the dearlyloved church where she and mollie had knelt side by side for so many years breakfast was ready for them on their return and they had the usual noisy welcome from fuss and fury but waveney was a little perplexed when althea told her with a smile that she must eat her breakfast as quickly as possible as they had plenty of business before them it is a comfort the rain has stopped she continued with an irrepressible shiver for we cannot possibly have the carriage out again until we drive to town how thankful i am that aunt sara gave me that furlined cloak last christmas she went on addressing her sister it keeps out the cold as nothing else does i feel as cosy as that robin does in his red waistcoat waveney ate her breakfast a little silently she was wondering why there was no greeting word from home perhaps the postman had not come have you finished waveney asked doreen a little abruptly byandbye if you have we may as well go to the library or we shall never get our parcels undone before it is time to start for church waveney opened her eyes rather widely at this but when she entered the room she stared in amazement the centretable seemed a mass of plants and brown paper parcels of every size and description were heaped on every available space to her surprise althea quietly drew back the curtain of cosy nook and motioned her to enter you can amuse yourself there for a little while she said brightly while doreen and i open our parcels you will see aunt sara has not forgotten you and then with a kindly nod she withdrew it was a pity that no interested observer saw the girls start and blush of delight for there just opposite her was a dress flung across a chair and a paper pinned on one sleeve waveney from her loving friend althea harford althea had pleased her own taste in the choice of that frock it was a dark sapphire blue velveteen of the same shade as the cloak and was perfectly plain except for a dainty little ruff of yellowish lace and nothing could have suited waveneys pale little face better she stood for a long time with folded hands in mute admiration of that marvellous garment she knew now why her white dress had disappeared so mysteriously for a day or two it wanted doing up nurse marks told her but when it had been returned waveney could see very little difference the poor little frock looked sadly frayed and shabby no wonder miss althea thought she needed a new one but the kindness and the generosity of the gift were beyond everything and there was a lump in waveneys throat as her fingers touched the soft pile of the velveteen doreens present was a box of handkerchiefs with waveneys initials prettily embroidered by one of the workers at the home and mrs mainwaring with characteristic kindness and good taste had contributed a beautiful little muff but waveneys pleasure reached its climax when her eyes discovered a neat little umbrella with a note from mollie attached to the ivory handle please do not think me extravagant darling it began because i really can afford to give myself a big treat this year the menucards have sold splendidly mr ingram says his sister has given him a commission for three more sets so i shall be quite rich i have bought myself a new jacket and hat and father says that he certainly means to get me a tweed dress for christmas so i shall be as smart as you he is only sending you gloves but i know you will like them and i have bought the umbrella out of my own earnings you cannot think how proud i am of that the poor old gamp you were using would not keep a sparrow dry it was so worn out and i could not bear to think of you getting wet through a happy christmas to you my darling and no more at present from your loving mollie noels present was wrapped up with the gloves it was only a small manuscript book neatly bound with blue ribbon and in noels flourishing schoolboy hand was written the further adventures of monsieur blackie by a humourist and dedicated with the authors compliments to old stormandstress ten minutes later when althea peeped through the curtain she found waveney still hugging her umbrella while she looked over the penandink sketches with eyes twinkling with amusement do you think it will fit she asked softly then the girl started to her feet her face crimson with emotion oh miss althea how am i to thank you she exclaimed you are too kind oh far too kind to me and then almost tearfully i have nothing to give you in return nothing i thought i saw a pretty penwiper among my parcels but i suppose i must have dreamt it and i had an impression that doreen showed me a needlebook oh but they were only trifles my dear no gift however small from one who loves us is a trifle and i shall value your present we have all we want dear child and the kindness of our friends almost embarrasses us when you come back i must show you the beautiful things some of the girls have made for me but there is no time to look at them now for the churchbells are ringing and then as they went upstairs waveney laden with her treasures the crowning touch was put to her days pleasure i am so glad you like your frock dear remarked althea it is certainly seasonable for winter evenings you will find a parcel in your room directed to mollie it contains a similar dress for her and the flash of joy in waveneys eyes certainly repaid her chapter xxvi a white vellum pocketbook and theres pansies thats for thoughtshamlet therell be a comforting fire therell be a welcome for somebody one in her neatest attire will look to the table for somebody swain it was in the gathering dusk of the afternoon when waveney found herself in the neighbourhood of cleveland terrace they had driven fast and yet to the eager girl the way had seemed strangely long as they approached the house althea shivered a little as though her furlined cloak had suddenly lost its robinlike cosiness the steely winters sky the raw dampness of the atmosphere the gloom of the half light which made all objects appear out of due proportion and gave them a hazy indistinctness made her feel depressed and uncomfortable as the carriage stopped the door was quickly opened though not by the footman and a familiar voice in the darkness said thank you miss harford a thousand times for bringing the child home waveney my darling a happy christmas to you run out of the cold dear it is beginning to snow but waveney kept her place i must say goodnight first father were you watching for me do you know you have not wished the dear ladies a happy christmas yet then altheas gentle melancholy voice interrupted her dear child there was no need to remind your father of an idle form i am quite sure we have his good wishes for the sake of the auld lang syne you are bareheaded mr ward do please go in and her slim gloved hand was stretched out to him everard bowed over it as he pressed it warmly you will always have my best wishes he said very gravely goodnight miss harford goodnight and thank you miss althea and then he swung open the gate and went up the little courtyard with waveney clinging to his arm althea looked after them with wistful eyes what a stream of light met them what did the narrow passage and steep ladderlike stairs matter or the frayed and dingy druggetting when that starlight glow of home radiance beamed so brightly and indeed when waveney felt mollies arms round her neck and her warm cheek pressed against hers her heart was comforted and at rest where are you taking me sweetheart she asked softly as mollie dragged her past the studio door you must come upstairs and take off your things first returned mollie panting from her exertions we shall have tea in the diningroom tonight because there are muffins and crumpets and i must see to them then mollie threw open the bedroom door and stood still in silent enjoyment to see waveneys start of surprise at the sight of a splendid fire burning in the grate oh mollie she said quite shocked at this extravagance have we ever had a fire here before except when we had the measles then mollie laughed and shook her head i daresay not but i was not going to let you sleep in this cold vault for three nights when you have been used to a lovely fire in your pansy room why wave you absurd child how grave you look father wont have to pay one penny for it i put two shillings into the housekeeping purse out of my own money and we will just have a beautiful fire every night and wont we enjoy ourselves it feels lovely returned waveney kneeling down on the rug for she was chilly from the long drive no dont light the gas dear the firelight is so pretty then mollie put down the matchbox reluctantly i wanted to show you something she returned in a low voice but perhaps if you make a blaze you will be able to see it oh what is that as waveney mutely held out a long brown paper parcel is that another present no please dont open it you must look at this one first and then mollie with outward gravity and much inward excitement laid a beautiful russian leather writingcase on the rug for waveneys inspection never had waveney seen such a case so dainty so complete so perfectly finished the initials m w were on everythingthe silver paperknife and penholders and on the tiny cardcase and inkstand and every card and sheet of paper was stamped with mollies address waveney was silent from excess of admiration and also from a strong feeling of emotion only a lover she thought could have planned all those pretty finishes and details surely surely mollies eyes must be opened now mollie dear i really dont know what to say she answered at last when the silence became embarrassing it is really too beautiful for any one but cinderella then a little conscious smile came to mollies lips and her cheeks wore their wildrose flush and yes certainly there was a new wistfulness in her eyes was it not splendid of mr ingram she said but her voice was not quite steady it was so kind that i could not help crying a little and then father laughed at me i cant understand father wave when i asked him if i ought to write and thank mr ingram he got quite red and said that i must know my own feelings best it was so odd of father to say that did mr ingram write to you mollie no returned mollie with her cheeks a still deeper rose there was only a slip of paper with monsieur blackies good wishes but wave he is not coming back for a long timehe told me so he said society had claims on him and that he had a houseparty impending and other engagements but i did not like to question him well then i suppose you had better writeonly just a short note mollie and pray pray do not be too grateful if he gives you presents it is to please himself as well as you but you do not know his address you silly child no returned mollie with a sigh that is one of his mysteries he calls himself a nebulous personage if you ever want to write to me he said the last time he came if your father breaks his leg for example or my friend the humourist plays any of his tricks and requires chastisement and the strong arm of the law you can ask my cousin althea to send on the letter for you is that not a funny roundabout way rather returned waveney drily feeling as though she were on the edge of a volcano i think mollie dear that under these circumstances it would be better not to write but just wait and thank mr ingram when he comes and though mollie looked a little disappointed at this decision she agreed with her usual loyalty to abide by it when the new dress had been duly admired and miss althea praised to waveneys entire satisfaction they went downstairs to begin their christmas merrymaking in earnest noel who was always the lord of misrule on these occasions had insisted with much severity on the usual programme being carried out so they had snapdragon in the dark diningroom after tea and mollie as usual burnt her fingers and then they went up to the studio and acted charades and dumb crambo to an appreciative audiencemr ward who occupied the front row and ann and mrs muggins who represented the pit laws miss aint it beautiful and likelife observed ann the heavyfooted for the twentieth time but everards eyes were a little misty if only dorothy could have seen them he thought and then his imagination flew off at a tangent to his old friend althea harford all the evening her soft melancholy voice had haunted him for the sake of auld lang syne she had said and her tone had been full of pathos she has never forgotten i think she is one of those women who never forget he thought but he sighed as he said it to waveney those three days were simply perfect and every hour brought its enjoyment on sunday afternoon a snowstorm kept them prisoners to the house and there was no evening church so they sang carols by the fire instead and ann sat on the stairs with mrs muggins on her lap and an old plaid shawl of her mothers to keep her warm and listened as devoutly as though she were in the vestibule of heaven which is my opinion miss waveney she observed afterwards as the sadducees and pharisees could not have sang more sweetly not with all their golden harps neither waveney looked puzzled for a moment but anns idiosyncrasies were too well known in the household and after a moment of silent reflection she said i see what you mean ann you were thinking of the cherubim and seraphim and it is a fine compliment you are paying us and then she went off to share the little joke with mollie and noel and the peals of laughter that reached anns ears somewhat perplexed that stolid maiden on monday they woke to a white world and then there was snow balling in the back garden and then a long walk down cheyne walk and across the bridge to battersea park and mollie went with them on her fathers arm and when she got tired which she did far too soon noel took her home grumbling at every step and waveney and her father went on it was everards greatest pleasure to walk with his girls but no companion suited him like waveney her light springy step hardly seemed to touch the groundand then she was so strong and active and nothing seemed to tire her mollies sad limp always made his heart ache as they stood looking at some floating ice in the river everard asked a little abruptly if mollie had written to mr ingram waveney shook her head the question rather surprised her why no father she replied slowly we do not know mr ingrams address so i persuaded mollie to wait until he calls well perhaps you are right returned mr ward doubtfully but waveney child i am getting a little bothered about things i like the fellow i like him better every time i see himhe has real grit in him and he is a gentleman but i never saw a girl courted after this fashion what do you mean father asked waveney a little timidly for she and mollie were not at all up to date and their shyness and reticence on this subject were quite oldfashioned why any child can see that ingram worships the ground mollie walks on returned mr ward with a touch of impatience in his voice when she looked at him with her big innocent eyes he stammered and changed colour more than once oh the man is in earnest i would take my oath of that it is mollies side of the question i want to know she ought not to encourage him by taking his presents unless she means to have him this was plain speaking but mr ward was getting desperate his motherless girls had no protector but himself it was pretty to see how waveney blushed on mollies account father dear she stammered i cant be quite sure but i think mollie is beginning to care a little for mr ingram she certainly misses him he is very keen and clever and i fancy that he understands her so well that he will not hurry things i meanexplaining herself with difficultythat he will not speak until he is certain that her heart is won that is my opinion too returned her father and then he looked at her with tender curiosity where did you gain your knowledge of men little girl but waveney had no answer ready for this question that night as they sat on the rug in the firelight like two blissful salamanders mollie said in a flurried and anxious voice wave darling i want to consult you about something and you must give me all your attention you know clearing her throat as though it were a little dry we have decided that i had better not write to mr ingram oh yes mollie we decided that long ago waveney spoke in a calm and judicial voice but mollie only grew more flurried but i must do something to please him she returned in quite a distressed tone think of all the pleasure he has given me wave i have got such a lovely idea in my head i have finished the menucards and i want to paint one of these white velum pocketbooks for mr ingrama spray of purple pansies would look so well on it and i will have it all ready for him when he comes next dont you think he would be pleased wave of course he would be pleased sweetheart he would carry it next to his heart and sleep with it under his pillow but this nonsense was received rather pettishly i wish you would be serious when a person asks advice returned mollie with a little frown you would not like any one to say those silly things to you then waveney was on her best behaviour at once and the naughty mischievous sparkle faded out of her eyes dont be cross mollie darling she said caressingly i do think your idea very pretty and i should think mr ingram will be very pleased he does admire your painting so why have you selected pansies i wonder then at this very simple question mollie looked a little confused they are his favourite flowers she almost whispered he says you can never have too much heartsease in this world and this answer fully satisfied waveney the next morning they started off to sloane street to purchase the pocketbook and mollie expended the last of her earnings and the moment waveney left her to return to erpingham she sat down to her little painting table and worked until the short winters afternoon closed in waveney did not see it until it was finished and then her admiration fully satisfied mollie it was a charming design and a pansy with a broken stalk dropping from the main cluster had a very graceful effect father likes it he says i have never painted anything better observed mollie with modest pride and waveney cordially endorsed this privately she thought the dainty pocketbook was more fit for some youthful bride mr ingram could not possibly use it she said to herself he will put it under a glass case or lock it up in a drawer and if mollie ever writes loveletters to him he will keep them in his pansybook and then she smiled to herself as she thought of his delight when mollie with many blushes and much incoherence should hand him the book she could almost see the flash of pleasure in his eyes but as her lively imagination pictured the little scene she was far from guessing under what different circumstances ingram would receive his pansybook chapter xxvii an idealist in love whatever we gain we gain by patience s teresa faith thou hast some crotchets in thy head now the merry wives of windsor about three weeks after christmas althea was sitting alone in her library the great room felt strangely empty that morning there was no curly head to be seen bending over the writing table in cosy nook no girl secretary to answer the silver chiming of altheas little bell waveney and doreen had gone up to town for a days shopping leaving althea to enjoy the rest that she so sorely needed the severe round of christmas feastings the lavish dispensing of cakes and ale would have tried a robust constitution and even doreen complained of unwonted fatigue but althea highly strung and sensitive had to pay the usual penalty for overexertion by one of her painful eye attacks which lasted for three or four days leaving her weak and depressed it is strange and sad how mind and body react on each other in these attacks a grey haze misty and impalpable seemed to veil altheas inner world and blot out her cheerfulness the free healthy current of her thoughts was checked by dimly discerned obstacles a chilling sense of selfdistrust of rashly undertaken work made her heart heavy it is brainsickness doreen would say to comfort her it will pass my dear yes it will pass returned althea with passive gentleness i know that as well as you do dorrie but for the time it masters me althea ill and althea well seem two different persons is it not humiliating dear to think we are at the mercy of our overwrought nerves a trifling ailment a little bodily discomfort and if we are at heavens very gate we drop to earth like the lark into our nest returned doreen with a smile you have chosen too cheerful a simile larks soar perpetually and they sing as they soar i think i am more like a blind mole at the present moment replied althea pushing up her shade a little that she might see her sisters face dorrie i am ashamed of myself i deserve any amount of scolding i try to count up my blessings to think of my girls happy faces but i am fast in my slough of despond and not all your efforts will pull me out very well then we must leave you there returned doreen composedly but she gave altheas hand a loving little squeeze as she said this her heart was full of tenderness and sympathy but she was too sensible to waste words fruitlessly these sick moods were purely physical and would yield she knew well to time and rest they were trials to be bornepart of altheas lifedisciplinethe cloud that checkered their home cheerfulness for these melancholy moods seemed to pervade the whole house althea felt much as usual that morning though she had not quite recovered her looks her face seemed longer and more sallow and there were tired lines round her eyes when a woman has passed her youth mental suffering leaves an indelible mark and althea looked old and worn that day and more like queen elizabeths wraith than ever i am very idle she was saying to herself but i feel that not one of the books that ever were written would interest me today i have no spirit or energy for travels history is too full of war and bloodshed and biography would weary me a novelwell no i think not i am not in the mood for other peoples lovestories i wish some one would write a novel about elderly people she went onmiddleaged prosaic people who have outlived their romance how soothing such a book would be i could almost write it myself there should be plenty of incident and very little moralising and it would be like one of those grey winter days when the sunlight is veiled in soft vapour and every window one passes is red with the firelight of home the fancy pleased her and she smiled at her own conceit but it faded in a moment when the doorbell rang a visitor at this time in the morning she thought and a little frown of annoyance gathered on her brow but it vanished when mitchell threw open the door and announced lord ralston why moritz she exclaimed and her voice was full of surprise and pleasure this is indeed a welcome sight how long is it since you last honoured our poor abode draw that chair up to the fire and give some account of yourself even gwen seems to have forgotten our existence since baby murdoch made his appearance ah you may well say so returned moritz with a dismal shake of his head gwen is incorrigible i give you my word althea that the beatitude of that young woman is so excessive and so fatuous that it resembles idiocy she fairly drivels with sentiment over that infant and he is as ugly and snubnosed a little chap as gwen was herself he has even got her freckles and she calls them beautyspots and lord ralstons voice expressed unmitigated disgust althea laughed i do not suppose that madam endorses these sentiments i should like to hear mrs comptons opinion of her grandson well she vows he is a fine child and he has got jacks eyes but all the same i heard her tell gwen that a plain baby often became a handsome man so we can make our own deductions from that murdoch has his good points she went on and he will improve and would you believe it that idiotic gwen became as red as a turkeycock there is no improvement wanted she said indignantly my precious baby is perfect he is beautiful in his mothers eyes whatever his cross old grandmother chooses to say and then she hugged the little chap and cried over him and all the time madam sat beaming on them both with her fine old face tremulous with happiness it is ruth and naomi over again finished moritz madam still finds fault with jack sometimes but never with gwen and the way gwen toadies her passes belief gwendoline is very happy certainly never was there a bettermatched couple than she and jack compton althea spoke in a tone of warm interest she had forgotten her distaste for other peoples lovestories at that moment and the thought of her young cousins happiness was pleasant to her dear gwen i am so fond of her i am glad that one man had the sense to fall in love with her in spite of her plain face but you know moritz that i always thought gwens ugliness quite charming yes but i could not have done it in jacks place returned moritz rather thoughtfully i am too great an admirer of beauty and then he changed the subject a little abruptly jack and gwen and their son and heir have been staying with me at brentwood i had a houseparty for christmas and the new year and i wanted gwen to play hostess it was an awful bore and i got pretty sick of it but they had both been lecturing me on the duties i owed to my fellowcreatures well i have played my lord frivol long enough and now i am plain mr ingram again what still masquerading isnt it time for you to unmask but he shook his head no not yet but there is method in my madness we have not quite completed our little comedy but i think the closing scene will be effective he shut his eyes as though to picture the scene and then opened them abruptly i have not been to cleveland terrace for an age in fact i only came up from brentwood this morning and on my way up here i passed doreen and miss ward oh then you knew i was alone to be sure i did that is why i appear in my true character i supposehis voice changing perceptiblythat miss mollie and her father and my friend the humourist are well but moritz did not look at althea as he put this question and so did not see the little smile on her lips they were quite well when waveney went home on sunday she said mollie was a little pale and tired but then she had been taking too long a walk she spent a night here on the evening of our girls entertainment it was quite amusing to see how they all admired her she was the may queen in one of the tableaux it was the prettiest thing imaginable i wish i had seen it and lord ralstons eyes were dark and bright if althea had not guessed his secret long ago she would have guessed it now with one of those sudden impulses which were natural to her she put her hand gently on his arm moritz she said in her sweet womanly way does gwen know have you made her your confidante just for a moment moritz drew himself up a little stifflyas though he resented the question but the kindness in altheas eyes disarmed him and perhaps his need of sympathy was too great there was no need to tell her he returned in a low voice she found it out for herself gwen is very acute about such things and she approves oh we have not come to that point yetspeaking in his old airy mannerbut she was very much interested and as good as gold she laughed at me a little for what she called my fantastic chivalry but all the same she seemed to like it but moritz why are you so afraid of appearing in your true colours i do not see that viscount ralston is a less interesting person than mr ingram perhaps not he returned drily but we all have our whims i am an idealist you must remember that and i have a wish to stand on my own merits as a man and not to make myself taller by posing on my pedestal of thirty thousand a year it may be a foolish whimsie but it is a harmless one and affords me plenty of innocent amusement althea smiled but she knew it was useless to pursue the argument moritz and gwendoline were both utterly unmanageable when they had a crotchet in their head they cared nothing about the worlds opinion and as for madam grundy or any other madam they had simply no regard for them already viscount ralston was considered a most eccentric person and sundry matrons had admonished their daughters on no account to contradict him he is a little odd certainly one of them remarked but i am told he is really clever and original and that sort of thing wears off after a time your father is very much taken with him so you may make yourself as agreeable as you like to lord ralston and when may i ask him to marry me returned the daughter to whom this machiavellian speech had been addressed for lady ginevra had plenty of spirit and was clever enough to read between the lines mother was terribly put out she informed her younger sister afterwards she lectured me for ten minutes on what she called my coarseness and vulgarity but as i told her i prefer vulgarity to hypocrisy you and father want me to marry viscount ralston i told her because he has brentwood hall and a fine house in town and thirty thousand a year and it does not matter one bit if i care for him or not if he holds out the sceptre to me i am to touch it but thank heavens jenny these are not the dark ages and though mother frowned and stamped her foot there was no get thee to a nunnery and lady ginevra laughed and went off to put on her habit for it was the hour when she and her father rode in the park althea had a word to say before she let the subject drop at the theatre you spoke of needing my help moritz i hope you will let me know when my assistance is wanted oh i was going to speak to you about that he returned quickly you see my dear cousin that there are circumstances in which a man is bound not to be selfish miss molliehow his voice always softened as he said the nameis so simple and childlike she knows so little of the world and her life has been so retired that i dare not hurry matters she must learn to know and trust me before i can venture to make my meaning plain yes i can understand that gwen quite agrees with me but all the same i thinkat least i hopethat monsieur blackies probation will soon be over but gwen and i have all our plans in readiness what do you say to a picnic party at brentwood about the middle of next month my dear moritz are you crazy really an idealist in love is a terrible being a picnic in the middle of february do you want the three grim sisters snow and hail and frost to be among your guests pshaw nonsense he replied impatiently there are lovely springlike days in february besides with the sort of picnic i mean weather will not signify you had better hear my programme first althea oh go on she returned in a resigned voice i will try to forget my commonsense while i listen to you but he only twirled his moustache triumphantly the party will be small and select just you and the two misses ward and gwen and myself and not noel in some surprise noel oh dear no my friend the humourist would be decidedly de trop he is too acute and wideawake a youth and monsieur blackie would be found out in a moment but i thought lord ralston was to be our host althea spoke in a puzzled tone then moritz patted her in a soothing manner keep calm i entreat you he said gently in the presence of great thoughts we should always keep calm lord ralston is my intimate friend please understand that we are like brothers he and i and it is for the corner of his picturegallery at brentwood that king canute was bought miss ward and her sister will be interested to see it again and as brentwood hall with its silent pool is a show placea picnic there will be the most natural thing in the world and the master is absent yes he is absentbut he may return at any moment and here there was a strange glow in moritzs eyes we must leave town early he went on briskly after a moments pauseand i think we could reach brentwood by midday gwen has promised to meet us at the hall and we shall have plenty of time to see the picturegallery and more of the rooms before luncheon i shall coach the servants carefully so there will be no contretemps after luncheon there will be the conservatories and the silent pool and then tea in the blue drawingroom it will be light until halfpast five so you may as well tell doreen not to expect you home until eight oh i forgot one important part of the programme gwen means to carry you off to kingsdene either before or after tea to see baby murdoch and madam she is staying with them at present it was evident from altheas amused look that the picnic at brentwood would meet with her approval and she was just about to give a cordial assent when mitchell entered to tell her that luncheon was ready and at the same time she handed her a telegram it is for miss ward maam she said and the boy is waiting then i suppose i had better open it returned althea there was some talk of their going to cleveland terrace to have tea with mollie if they finished their shopping in time perhaps this is to say that she is out or engaged and then althea opened the yellow envelope but her countenance changed as she read the telegram do not come was all it said mollie is illwill write it was from everard ward chapter xxviii but yet the pity of it the web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and ill togetheralls well that ends well for this relief much thankshamlet when althea had read the brief message she told mitchell very quietly that there was no answer required and that she might give the boy some refreshment and send him away and then as the maid left the room she handed the telegram to moritz it troubled her kind heart to see the pain in his eyes as he read it he was quite pale and his lips twitched under his moustache what does it mean he asked in rather a stifled voice i thought you said that she was well if she is ill why is her sister to be kept away you see what he says do not come yes i see returned althea very gravely it must be something sudden but i hope for poor dear waveneys sake that it is nothing infectious let me think for a momentone cannot grasp it at once this is wednesday and on sunday mollie was wellonly a little pale and tired and yes i remember she had a slight headache and so waveney persuaded her not to go to church a headache and pale and tired good heavens althea it is clear as daylight she was sickening for something moritzs tone was so tragical and he paced the room so restlessly that in spite of her very real anxiety althea could hardly repress a smile dear moritz she said gently there is no need to take such a gloomy view our pretty mollie is human and must be ill sometimes like other people perhaps it is a bad cold or influenza or it might even be measlesthey are very much about for moritzs unregenerate woman had been singularly captious since the new year and close muggy days had paved the way for all kinds of ailments to which flesh is heir there was a great deal of sickness at dereham and althea had been both wise and careful in refusing to allow waveney to go as usual amongst her pensioners of course it may be anything returned lord ralston impatientlyfor even his easy temper was not proof against the bitterness of his disappointmenthe had so hungered and thirsted poor fellow for a sight of mollies sweet face all these weeks he had been doing his duty nobly and now he had looked for his reward absence makes the heart grow fonder he had said to himself that very morning would this bud of love which he had been nurturing so tenderly have blossomed into a beauteous flower when they met again over and over again he had asked himself this question but mollie was ill and all hope of an immediate answer was over it may be anything he repeated but who is to look after her there is only her father and that halfwitted maidofallwork there used to be some friend who nursed them when they were ill but she is living somewhere in the country with an invalid lady we must get a nurse do you know where their doctor lives but althea shook her head no but we can find out moritz i think the best plan will be for me to go over to cleveland terrace and then i can tell waveney exactly how things are i will leave a line for doreen and beg her to say nothing until my return then a look of intense relief crossed moritzs face it is a good idea he said eagerly and i will go with you and althea made no objection to this it is a pity the carriage is out she said regretfully but george shall get us a cab now we will go and have some luncheon and then i will get ready but with both of them the meal was a pretence apprehension and worry deprived moritz of all appetite and althea was so nervous and fluttered at the idea of encountering everard in his own home that she could scarcely eat a morsel she rose as soon as possible and left moritz to finish his repast but he preferred pacing the room in spite of his vivacity and gaietedecoeur his jaunty airs and cheerfulness he was easily depressed any form of illness that attacked those he loved preyed on his mind when gwendolines little son was born he was so anxious and despondent that jack compton in spite of his own natural solicitude for his young wifes safety laughed at him and told him that he looked as melancholy as a gib cat the old chap was in the doldrums and no mistake he said to gwen afterwards i tell him i played the man twice as well as he but he is a good old sort too and then with awe and wonder the young father regarded the small and crumpled and exceedingly red morsel of humanity lying snugly within gwens arm as they drove up to cleveland terrace they saw an unmistakable doctors brougham before the door of number ten lord ralstons swarthy complexion turned rather livid at the sight but althea only remarked with composure that they had come just at the right time noel opened the door to them he had seen them from the window his face brightened perceptibly father has gone up with dr duncan he said but they will be coming down directly you had better come up into the studio there is a fire there and noel led the way althea glanced quickly round the room as she entered it was shabby there could be no doubt of that but there was an air of comfort about it and then she subsided wearily into a corner of the big cosylooking couch but moritz marched off to the inner room and stood with his back to them gazing at poor mollies little writingtable with an aching heart noel what is the matter with your sister asked althea in a low voice but noel could not tell her she had seemed queer and feverish the previous day he explained and his father had advised her remaining in bed she had had a bad night and her throat was painful and he had been forbidden to go near her this was dr duncans first visit they had sent for him in the morning but he had been unable to come until now it was evident that noel could not enlighten them much so althea forebore to question him further and waited silently until they heard footsteps descending the stairs but as they passed by the studio door althea heard the doctor say i will look in later and see what you have done about the nurse noel heard it too for he looked rather startled a nurse he muttered poor old pater that will bother him a bit and then everard came quickly into the room noel i want you he said rather sharply duncan says but here he stopped in sudden surprise as altheas tall figure rose from the couch mr ward she said quietly waveney was out so i opened your telegram and i have come to see if there is anything i can do for mollie my cousin lordi mean mr ingram has brought me then everard with rather a sad smile held out his hand to the young man you are both very kind he said simply but there is nothing you can do for the dear child mollie is very ill and dr duncan wishes her to have a good nurse at once i am going to send noel off to the institution he has given me the addressit is diphtheria and her throat is in a dreadful state and there is no time to be lost let me go returned moritz earnestly i will take a hansom and be there in no time mr ward i shall esteem it as a favour and a mark of true friendship if you will send me instead of noel but before everard could reply to this urgent request altheas gentle voice interposed mr ward please listen to me a moment i know what this illness meansi have had it myselfmollie will need two nurses there would be no one to take care of her by day while the nurse rests and any neglect would be an awful risk please let moritz go and settle the business there need only be one tonight but the daynurse must relieve her tomorrow morning let him have the address and noel can go with him and then you must let me go up and see mollie and then everard in a dazed fashion held out a folded piece of paper two nurses i shall be in the workhouse they heard him mutter but no one took any notice althea you are a trump whispered moritz as she followed him into the passage tell me anything she needs and i will get it two nursesshe shall have a dozen nurses if the doctor approves we will have a second opinion we will have the great throat doctor sir hindley richmond down but what more moritz would have said in that eager sibilant whisper was never known for althea gave him an impatient little push gogo there is no use in talking i shall not leave until the nurse arrives and then she went back into the studio she had forgotten her nervousness now her reluctance to enter everards house her face glowed with kindly womanly sympathy as she approached him i am so sorry for you she said gently and i am sorry for dear mollie too for it is such a painful complaint but with good nursing i hope she will soon be well is dr duncan a clever man oh yes i believe so returned mr ward dejectedly but his charges are very high miss harford i am afraid we must manage with one nurse i have not the means i am a poor man but althea turned a deaf ear to this it was far too early in the day to proffer help he must not be told yet that he had good friends who were only too thankful to be allowed to bear his burdens for mollies sake for waveneys sake and for poor moritzs sake there must be no indulgence of false and misplaced pride he must be managed adroitly and with finesse and female diplomacyno masculine blundering must effect this how did mollie catch it she asked to turn his thoughts from the question of expense but everard could not answer this question mollie had not seemed well since sunday he said she had been restless and irritable and complained of feeling ill she had been so feverish in the night that he thought it must be influenza and he had sent for dr duncan but early as it was he had already started on his rounds and had only just come he would pay another visit later in the evening althea listened to this in silence then she said rather gravely mr ward what are we to do about waveney it will break her heart to be kept from mollie and yet then he turned upon her almost fiercely and there was an excited gleam in his eyes i will not have it tell waveney that i forbid her to come near the house good heavens would she add to my troubles is it not enough to have one child ill then his eyes filled with tears and the hand he put on altheas arm shook a little dear miss harford be my friend in this keep waveney safe for me and something in his tone told althea that dearly as everard loved all his children this was the one who came closest to his heart do not fear she returned tenderly you can trust me and waveney loves you far too well to disobey you buthere she sighedit will certainly break her heart mollie is her other and her dearer self yes poor darling i know that but she must be brave tell her from me please that i will write twice a day if that will comfort her she shall know everything there shall be nothing hidden from her yes i will tell her returned althea sorrowfully and when my cousin returns we will arrange about noel he must not stop here then there was an unmistakable look of gratitude in everards eyes you think of everything he said in a broken voice i was troubling sadly about the poor lad now i am afraid i must leave you as mollie has no other nurse but he was both touched and surprised when althea rose too let me go with you she said quickly i am not the least afraid i had the complaint very badly myself before we left kitlands i fear we are both doing wrong returned everard hesitating your sister will be very angry with you but althea shook her head very decidedly at this and he was too bewildered and miserable to argue the point the sick room looked bare and comfortless to altheas eyes in spite of the bright fire burning cheerily in the grate the big iron bedstead with its old and obviously patched quilt the dark stained wood furniture and the narrow window seats with faded red cushions were hardly a fit shrine for mollies dainty beauty mollie lay uncomfortably on her pillows she looked flushed and ill and her beautiful eyes had a heavy distressed look in them she held out her hands rather eagerly to althea but the next moment she drew them back oh i forgot she said in a thick voice and it was evidently a great effort to speak you must not come near me dr duncan said so tell my darling wave that she must keep away if she loves me and ask her not to fret oh i cannot talk and here poor mollie flung herself back on the pillows and her hot restless fingers tried to put back the heavy masses of rough tangled hair how althea longed to brush it out and sponge the fevered face and hands but at her first hint everard frowned and looked anxious not for worlds he said decidedly the nurse will be here directly the institution is hardly a mile from here and ingram will take a hansom he spoke in a low voice but mollie heard him oh father is mr ingram here she whispered how sorry he will be to hear i am ill and then a sudden thought struck her and she beckoned to althea rather excitedly miss harford she said in her poor hoarse voice will you do something for me in that small righthand drawer behind you you will see a little parcel it is directed please give it to mr ingram from me althea secretly marvelled at this but held her peace when the dainty white parcel was in her hand she said gently yes dear mollie he shall have it directly he returns but now your father does not wish me to stay goodbye god bless you my child and altheas tone of faltering tenderness arrested everards attention it would not be safe i dare not let you do anything for her he said very softly as he opened the door i will stay with her until the nurse comes but please go down and rest and althea who was trembling with some strange emotion obeyed him without a word chapter xxix barmecides feast and a brown study control give sympathise these three must be learnt and practised selfcontrol charity and sympathy oriental saying althea was glad of a few minutes quiet to recover herself for she felt agitated and shaken the sight of that comfortless sickroom and everards worn face and haggard eyes oppressed and saddened her a perfect passion of pity for him and his motherless girls swept over her as she closed the door she had left the room in answer to a wistful pleading look from him her presence there evidently troubled him and he was unwilling for her to run any risk it was kind it was friendly of him she thought everard always had a good heart but at that moment her impulsive highly wrought nature only yearned to show her sympathy in action in spite of her sensitive nerves she was constitutionally brave and had no fear of any form of illness we shall only die when our time comes was a favourite saying of hers and neither she nor doreen shirked anything that met them in their daily path of duty mollie was very ill there was little doubt of that and she would probably be worse the sight of the sweet flushed face and the remembrance of the poor thick voice would haunt her she knew and there was waveneybut at this point the sound of a hansom driving up rapidly dispersed her gloomy thoughts and the next moment lord ralston entered the room we have got her he said triumphantlynurse helena the best and cleverest nurse in the institution and she will be here in ten minutes i saw the matron and there is another one coming at eleven tomorrow i shall go round to dr duncans house presently and have a talk with him we must have sir hindley richmond down i am determined on that why not wait for tomorrow returned althea quietly you are so impetuous moritz there is no need for you to see dr duncan tonight poor dear mollie is very illi have just seen her but good nursing and the proper remedies may do wonders wait until tomorrowit will be far better and tell me what has become of noel he is up in his room putting up his things i am going to take him round to eaton square directly i shall stay there myself for the next week or two and you really saw her althea is shedoes she look very bad moritzs anxiety was so intense he could hardly bring out the words she is evidently in great pain she returned slowly it is impossible to judge at this stage but she was able to speak to me moritz she asked me to give you this it was put away in a drawer and she told me where to find it and althea handed him the little white parcel for me are you sure it is for me he asked breathlessly but althea with a faint smile only pointed to the direction for in mollies sprawling handwriting was very lightly inscribed mr ingram with mollie wards good wishes nothing could be more correct or proper then why did lord ralstons eyes brighten so strangely and why did a sudden smile of tender amusement come to his lips because his keen scrutiny had detected something that althea had not perceivedtwo halfobliterated letters before the good lohe could make that out plainly with mollie wards lovethat was what she had meant to write until her maidenly scruples and perhaps some sudden selfconsciousness induced her to change the inscription moritz walked off into the inner room with his treasure would mollie guess how her lovers heart beat almost to suffocation as he looked at the white vellum book with its clustering pansies little darling he kept saying over and over to himself she must have known they were my favourite flowers and then he looked at the first page and saw his name prettily illuminated pansies thats for thoughts was the motto under it and one or two pansies were drooping loosely underneath it was a dainty remembrance mollie had evidently not spared either time or thought for her friend it was to be a token of her gratitude for all the pleasure monsieur blackie had given her and for all his lavish gifts but even mollie could not guess in the faintest degree the intense joy that pansy pocketbook gave ingram as he replaced it in its cover his eyes were dim and his honest heart was recording its vows if mollie lived her lifes happiness as far as human power could effect it should be his task and joy my own darling you are beginning to love me he thought and now and then there was a stab of pain through the young mans heart for how could he tell how long it would be before he saw the angel laughing out of mollies eyes again when he went back into the other room he found noel there the nurse had arrived and had gone up to see her patient and presently everard came down to them he seemed a little surprised when althea told him that noel was going to stay with her cousin moritz wants him and they will be company for each other she said it will be easier for him to go from there to st pauls byandbye and as this was reasonable mr ward offered no objection then at her suggestion he sat down and wrote a few tender urgent words to waveney althea took her leave after this she had made another fruitless attempt to dissuade moritz from going to dr duncan he was utterly unmanageable i mean to make a clean breast to him he said recklessly if he is a sensible man he wont want any explanation i shall tell him that mr ward has influential friends and that they wish a second opinion why good heavens altheaworking himself up to a pitch of nervous excitement how do we know what that poor child needs and that only money can buy and then althea with a vivid remembrance of that bare dingylooking room wisely held her peace as she drove off she wondered vaguely but without much interest how moritz was to keep up his masquerading at eaton square noel was a sharpwitted lad as he had himself said and there had been no opportunity of coaching the servants an old retainer of the family who had been the old viscounts butler took care of the house when it was not occupied and his wife and one or two maids kept a few rooms always in order moritz who was a thorough bohemian had a habit of running up to town for a night or two as the fancy seized him and he seldom announced his intention beforehand more than once mrs barham had been at her wits end to make his lordship comfortable but she soon got used to his odd ways and now when moritz arrived at his town house he was sure of finding his diningroom and library and a couple of bedrooms in firstrate order althea need not have wondered if she had listened to the brief conversation that took place between moritz and noel on their way to eaton square it was rather late for moritz like an obstinate man had had his way he had left noel in the cab and had seen the doctor alone though dr duncan was a sensible man and no toady he was much impressed by lord ralstons impetuous generosity he could not deny he said that there were many things that his patient required though he had forborne to name them as he knew mr ward had small means sir hindley richmond oh certainly he had no objection to meet him but there was no need for that at present he would keep it in mind and mr ward must be consulted and then after a little more talk and a promise on the doctors part to respect his confidence the interview ceased moritz felt a little happier when he jumped into the hansom again he thought dr duncan had spoken hopefully of the case and then as he looked at the list in his hand he foresaw a delightful mornings work before him to rush from shop to shop to pay the highest price possible for each article to order in fabulous quantities of the needed commodities would be purest joy to him if mollie recovered she would find herself stocked for a year or two with eaudecologne and other good things what an age you have been grumbled noel the poor lad was too cold and hungry and miserable to mind his manners wasnt the old chap in oh yes he was in replied ingram vaguely and then he pushed up the little trapdoor and told the man to drive to number fourteen eaton square i hope mrs barham will be able to give us something to eat he continued you see she does not expect us and there may be nothing in the house noels face grew rather long at this is it your house do you live there he asked curiously yes returned ingram it is my house but i am not often there i have another house in the country and then rather abruptly noel lad can you keep a secrethonour bright you know and all that sort of thing then noel looked up in his face a little suspiciously and there was a knowing twinkle in his eyes mums the word he said quickly but i know what you are going to say your name isnt ingram oh yes it is returned the other rather amused at this only i have another it is the family name my father was colonel ingram and until eighteen months ago i was plain mr ingram and now and there was growing excitement in noels voice well the only difference is an old cousin died and so i became viscount ralston why my boy with a little chuckling laugh i was as poor as a church mouse before thatpoorer than your father i painted bad pictures that would not sell and lived in a tin shanty hold harddont interrupt me for we shall be at my diggings directly i want you to understand that for the present at cleveland terrace and at the red house i am still mr ingram i have my reasons and some day you shall know them but i want you to promise that you will not betray me then noel feeling utterly bewildered and not a little mystified nodded an assent to this and the next moment they stopped before one of the big gloomylooking houses in eaton square a tall greyhaired old man admitted them i have taken you by surprise barham observed lord ralston carelessly and you see i have brought a friend yes my lord returned barham tranquilly and i am glad to say there is a fire in the library but there is something wrong with the diningroom chimney and the workmen have been there all right just pay the cabman and then lord ralston led the way to the library it was a large room and the firelight played fitfully over the carved oak furniture and red morocco chairs the next moment the soft electric light enabled noel to see his surroundings more plainly since his visit to the red house his views had been considerably enlarged and he at once told himself that this room beat miss harfords library hollow lord ralston left him for a few moments when he returned he said with something of his old whimsical dryness i have just been interviewing my worthy housekeeper and have left her metaphorically tearing her hair in the larder she tells me that there is literally nothing in the house so i suppose we may expect barmecides feast noel nodded he was well acquainted with the story of the barbers sixth brother and quite understood the allusion but the youthful pangs of hunger were so overmastering that he murmured something about breadandcheese and then coloured up to the roots of his hair fearing that he had taken a liberty oh mrs barham is a woman of resources she will do better for us than that was the indifferent reply but we must exercise our patience i will take you up to your room now and noel presently found himself ensconced in a most luxurious chamber with a bright fire and everything prepared for his comfort it is like the arabian nights muttered the lad when his host had left him to think of my cheekmonsieur blackie indeed and then noel sat on the edge of the chair and chuckled a viscount great scott lord ralston my word how the pater and old stormandstress will open their eyes to think that the wobbly one will be my lady some day and here noel gave a long low whistle proving that in spite of that vulgarity inherent in the english schoolboy the embryo barrister had his wits about him it does not take much eyesight to see a blank wallespecially when it is painted white and the sun shines he had observed once to waveney any fool can see that chap is dead nuts on molliewhich was forcible if a trifle coarse when noel found his way back with some difficulty to the library he saw a charming little dinnertable laid in readiness mrs barham evidently knew her business well the fish and cutlets and sweet omelette were all excellent and a wonderful dessert followed lord ralston was most kind and hospitable but he was hardly as good a companion as usual he seemed absent and was continually falling into a brown study when dinner was over and coffee had been brought he gave up all attempt to be sociable he even invited noel to help himself to a book and for the remainder of the evening lord ralston sat in silence with his eyes fixed on the beechlogs which were burning and sputtering so merrily it was nearly dinnertime at the red house when althea reached home doreen who was already dressed was waiting for her in the library waveney was still upstairs there was a short and hurried explanation on altheas part and a few ejaculations of pity from doreen then she followed her sister upstairs and sent peachy away it was one of their pretty sisterly ways to wait on each other occasionally and althea who was accustomed to this loving ministry took it calmly and as a matter of course doreen wanted to talk to her that was all i am so sorry you had such a wretched afternoon observed doreen affectionately poor dear you were hardly fit for it how was mr ward i am afraid he will be dreadfully anxious anxious i should think so from his looks i should say he had had no sleep do you know dorrie i have discovered something today dearly as everard loves all his children it is waveney who is the apple of his eye he loves her better than his pretty mollie oh no althea yes dear i am sure of it and i cannot say i am greatly surprised mollie is a dear sweet child but waveney is more human and spirituelle her nature has greater depth oh there is the gong please help me to arrange this ruff dorrie you must do all the talking at dinner waveney must have no hint of anything until we have finishedthere is the shopping and your purchases you must make the most of those so you went out after all was waveneys first remark when grace had been said and her voice was rather reproachful and you promised that you would have a days rest it hardly amounted to a promise i think returned althea with a forced smile one never knows what may turn up in the days work and i had to go out on an errand of charity well how have you enjoyed your shopping expedition and this question launched waveney at once into a lengthy description of all their purchases it was too late to think of going to cleveland terrace she finished regretfully so we had tea at fullers instead the cakes were delicious oh how i longed for mollie to be with us she does so love buying pretty things oh i forgot interposed doreen abruptly mrs craven was at marshall snellgroves buying things for augustas trousseau we had quite a long talk in the mantle department i have ordered a nice waterproof cloak althea it is harris tweed and your favourite grey and so on discussing the merits of each article purchased until dinner was over and with an unmistakable look of relief althea rose from the table chapter xxx suspense down thou climbing sorrow thy elements below king lear till now thy soul has been all glad and gay bid it awake and look at grief today adelaide anne procter as althea walked into the library she was aware that waveney was following her closely doreen had made some excuse and had gone off to her own room probably to write letters do you want me to read to you tonight asked waveney she looked wonderfully bright and animated this evening as she spoke she slipped her hand into altheas arm in a coaxing girlish way dear miss harford i am not a bit tired i feel as springy as possiblethis being a favourite word in the ward vocabulary to express latent and superfluous energy no my child not tonight returned althea gravely waveney dear i am afraid i have rather bad news for you you were out when the message came so i went over to cleveland terrace to inquire then a troubled almost a scared look came into the girls eyes a message she gasped did they send for me is any one illfather or but she did not finish the sentence as althea quietly handed her the telegram what does it mean she asked in a bewildered tone but her lips were trembling mollie ill but she is never ill except when we had the measles she has never been in bed a single day for years what is it why do you not tell me and waveney spoke in a tone of intense irritation i am waiting dear until you can listen to me returned her friend soothingly my cousin moritz was with me when the telegram camehere waveney startedand i thoughtwe both thoughtthat the best thing would be for me to go over to cleveland terrace moritz went with me we saw your father and i went up to mollie it is diphtheriano one knows how she has caught it she is ill and her throat is very painful but she could speak to me she sent her love and said that you must not think of coming to her then an incredulous smile crossed waveneys face mollie said that but of course she did not mean it the idea is too absurd if i were not so miserable i could laugh at it not go to my mollie when she is ill and in pain has father sent for dr duncan and have they given her a firethe room is so cold then interrupting herself with sudden impatience why do i stop to ask these questions when it is getting late oh miss harford you ought to have told me before dinner what does that matter but i will get ready now and if you will be kind enough to send for a cab i shall not be five minutes changing my frockfor even at the supreme moment some instinct told the girl that sapphire blue velveteen was not quite suitable for a sick room althea was quite shaken by waveneys impetuosity it was evident that her young companion had entirely forgotten her role her sole idea was that mollie was ill and that nothing else mattered she was actually halfway to the door when althea called her back in a tone that arrested even her attention waveney my poor child what are you doing did you not understand the telegram your father will not allow you to go homehe told me so himself and here is a note he has sent you then waveney without a word took the letter my precious child wrote everard we are in sad trouble our dear mollie is very ill but dr duncan tells me that it will not be safe for you to be with her and that he must have a properly trained nurseone is coming in directlyand then she will have every care and attention do not come unless i send for you it is enough to have one child ill and i will not have you here my little waveney i know i can trust you since you were a baby you have never given me a moments uneasinessyou have been my dear good child who has always obeyed my least wishes if you love me my darling you will be brave and calm miss harford will tell you everything she is a good kind creature and i feel you will be safe with her you shall know everything nothing shall be kept from youi promise you that faithfully your loving father when waveney had finished the letter there was despair in her eyes he is cruel every one is cruel she said in a choked unnatural voice and then with a dry sob oh why am i not lying there in her place do not say that dear child returned althea gently for then mollie would have to suffer and at this waveney winced where are you going althea spoke rather nervously for again the girl seemed about to leave her oh waveney surely you will not go against your fathers wishes but she need not have asked the question the loyal little soul would have died sooner than grieve that beloved parent no i cannot disobey father she said in a dull voice and her poor little face looked so white and rigid i am going to my own room now will you not stay and let me talk to you a little asked althea anxiously you are taking things too hardly dear mollie may be better tomorrow but she spoke to deaf ears no no please do not keep me i must be alone there is no use in talking how do you know how does any one know about things and waveney abruptly turned away altheas eyes looked very sad as the door closed behind her i knew it she said to herself i knew how she would suffer her nature is intense those who love much suffer much mollie and she seem to have only one heart between them it is not so with all twins but the next moment her dreary moralising was interrupted for waveney came hastily back and stood by her i did not bid you goodnight she said huskily i am afraid i was rude and abrupt but i did not mean it and you are so kind so kind then althea put her arms round the girl and kissed her tenderly my dear do not trouble about that i quite understand may i come to you presently i may be able to think of something to comfort you but waveney shook her head no please do not come there is no comfort for me while my mollie is ill and suffering and waveney drew her cold hands out of altheas detaining grasp it was sad to see how her step had suddenly lost its springiness to be alonethat was her one thought now as it is the instinct of all sorely wounded creatures in gods free world waveney never recalled that night of misery without a shudder the sudden shock quite prostrated her that mollie should be ill perhaps dangerously illfor every one knew that people died of diphtheria princess alice had and the butchers little daughter and one or two others that she and mollie knewthat mollie should be ill and that her only sister should not be allowed to nurse herthis was almost inconceivable to waveney it was this separation that seemed so unnatural and waveney chafed bitterly against her fathers restrictions after those first unguarded expressions she did not blame him in words but again and again in her heart she accused him of cruelty oh father how could you how could you she said over and over again that night it is not right it is not fair that you should torture me like this if i were only there i should not be so unnerved and frightened but everything is worse when one is kept away waveney was right from her own point of view she would have been her brave resolute little self at cleveland terrace and mollie would have had the tenderest and most cheery of nurses i should not have taken it i should have been careful and left the nurse to do things she said later on it was just fathers nervousness dr duncans opinion she treated with contempt it was part of a doctors duty to say these things more than once althea crept to the girls door but she could hear nothing once she turned the handle but the door was locked waveney who was still sitting huddled up in the easychair heard the soft retreating footsteps go down the passage again her fire had burnt out and she felt strangely chilled i may as well go to bed she thought drearily but it was long before the deadly cold left her limbs even when she slept her dreams troubled her and she woke the next morning to see althea standing beside her bed with a cup of hot coffee in one hand and in her other a yellow envelope will you drink this my dear doreen and i have had our breakfast but there is no need for you to hurry if you lie still nurse marks will bring you yours oh no i could not think of such a thing returned waveney quite shocked i am not ill i would rather get up please i am so sorry i have overslept myself but i was late and then she looked at the telegram wistfully is that for me miss harford no my dear it is for me moritz sent over to cleveland terrace quite early this morning you will see what he says miss ward not so well a bad night shall wire for richmond what does it mean returned waveney faintly and her head sank back on the pillow i dont understand it it means that you and mollie have a good friend returned althea sitting down beside her a very kind and generous friend moritz wants to help you all sir hindley richmond is the great throat doctor he is wonderfully clever and some of his cures are marvellous but his fees are immense and of course moritz knows that mr ward could not afford to have him so he is arranging it with dr duncan but we have no rightwe have no claim on mr ingram stammered waveney but he is doing it for mollies sake she said it quite simply in her own mind it had long been an assured fact that mr ingram was her sisters lover how could any one mistake such devotion yes he is doing it for mollies sake returned althea with equal frankness poor fellow he is very unhappy about her and his only comfort is to do her service and althea smiled a little as she thought of that tender and fantastic chivalry with which moritz was wooing his beautiful mollie i will get up now waveney observed restlessly mollie was not so well it would drive her frantic to lie still and think of that she would dress and go out miss althea was too kind to think of asking her to write and read she could not sit still she must have air and movement but though she said no word of this althea understood her perfectly we must leave her alone she said rather sadly to doreen her nerves are unhinged by the suspense and she is not used to trouble i shall drive down to cleveland terrace she continued on my way to aunt sara there may be some little thing mollie requires and waveney will be glad of news she spoke rather hurriedly as though she feared doreen might raise some objection but doreen who could read her sister like a book merely nodded assent so all the morning waveney wandered about the common like a little lost spirit until her limbs ached with weariness and after luncheon noel arrived mr ingram had sent him he said bringing out the words rather sheepishly they had been shopping all the morning tearing up and down regents street and bond street in a hansom and they had had luncheon at the army and navy stores then they had called at the door of number ten and noel had seen his father things were much the same and he sent his love and so on althea had already started when noel made his appearance so it was too late to prevent her fruitless journey to chelsea there was nothing mollie wanted noel declared bluntly and he chuckled as he thought of all the things ingram had ordered my word theres no mistake about his being a viscount he thought if he turned out to be a duke i should hardly be surprised waveney was very fond of her young brother but his society failed to give her comfort and noel on his side was so awed and depressed by her sad face and unusual silence that he could find little to say it was quite a relief when his visit was over and he had to return to eaton square but one word he did say as waveney followed him into the hall i say wave i suppose you will send your compliments or kind regards to mr ingramand here noel cleared his throat he is awfully cut up you know and all that oh yes you may give him my kind regards returned waveney in a listless tone then her conscience accused her of ingratitude yes certainly noel my kindest regards i know how good he has been he is actually going to have that great throat doctor down to see dear mollie i know that replied noel mysteriously i know a thing or two that would make you stare he is a good old sort he is as good as they make them and he deserves to turn up trumps and with this peculiar form of blessingwhich was nevertheless genuine in its waynoel adjusted his pincenez and marched off with his head in the air as usual when althea returned she had very little to add to this mollie was no better certainly and dr duncan was undoubtedly anxious about her but she had excellent nurses and sir hindley richmond was to come the next day there had been some hitch or difficulty and moritz had been much put out althea was in the dark about it for mr ward had volunteered no explanation sir hindley richmond is coming tomorrow was all he said mr ingram insists on it he wired for him today but there was some difficulty and ingram fussed awfully about it i am not allowed to put in a word he continued with a feeble attempt at a smile the doctor and nurses manage everything all sorts of things come to the house of course ingram sends them and if i remonstrate i am told that the doctor ordered them or that nurse helena wished for it althea was the bearer of another sad little missive from everard waveney carried it off to her own room she was still reading it with dry tearless eyes when the gong sounded do not lose heart my darling it finished it is always darkest before day we will pray to our heavenly father that our sweet mollie may be spared waveney was repeating this sentence over and over again as she sat at the dinnertable and althea seeing that she ate nothing told mitchell to fill her glass with burgundy you must take that my dear and some of this nice light roll if you make yourself ill it will only give additional trouble althea spoke with such quiet decision that waveney was compelled to obey as she sipped the wine a tinge of colour came into her lips but the bread was sadly crumbled on her plate as she rose from the table her knees trembled under her and she almost tottered as she followed althea last night about this time she had told her what a nightmare of horror these fourandtwenty hours had been no wonder she felt giddyno wonderbut here althea took possession of her with gentle force sit down waveney why you foolish child you have overwalked yourself and eaten nothing and of course you feel bad and before waveney could summon up sufficient energy to contradict this she found herself lying on the library couch with the softest of pillows under her head and a warm quilt over her doreen and i are going across to the porch house observed althea kissing her it is thursday evening but dear old nursie will look after you thank you but she need not trouble returned waveney drowsily i am quite well only tired every one was very kind she thought and miss althea how dear and good she was after all it was very comfortable to lie still the silence the firelight the soft warmth were so soothing why were the bees humming so beehives and libraries were surely incongruous and there were white lilies too nidnodding at each other and the writingtable had gone and there was a bed of pansies pansies thats for thoughts she said to herself for little as she knew it waveney was fast asleep chapter xxxi down by the river only upon some cross of pain and woe gods son may lie each soul redeemed from self and sin must have its calvary anon the porch house thursdays as they were called had become red letter days in thorold chaytors life ever since that wet christmas eve when he had partaken of cakes and ale in the hall at the red house he had looked forward to them with an intensity that had surprised himself little had he thought when he had generously given a few hours of his scanty leisure to help althea in her good work that such deep enjoyment would be the result and that he would actually count the hours until he could see a certain curly head bending over the book if only any one had guessed how his heart always leaped at the sight thorolds life until now had been laborious and joyless his home was utterly uncongenial to him he loved his sister but there was no real sympathy between them and as he would often say bitterly to himself joa cares more for trists little finger than for me and he was right joanna was one of those women whose shortsighted tenderness makes them lavish their best affection on some prodigal or black sheep perhaps the fault might lie a little with thorold his calm selfcontrolled nature was somewhat repressive few people understood him or guessed that underneath the quiet undemonstrative surface there was a warm passionate heart perhaps only althea knew it and even she was in error about him for she thought that his intellect dominated his heart but in this she was wrong thorold chaytor was a keenly ambitious man he loved his work for its own sake but he was also desirous of success as he knew well his feet were on the first rung of the ladder his literary work was already meeting with appreciation and now he held his first brief the first cold breakers had been passed and the bold swimmer had his head well above water poverty would soon be a thing of the past but even as he grasped this fact gratefully he was aware that fresh responsibilities fettered him tristram and betty were on his hands it would be long probably years before tristram would be able to provide a comfortable home for his child and when they quitted his roof he clearly foresaw that joanna would go with them nothing would part her from betty but for years to come how was he to marry would any girl care to enter that incongruous household would he wish to bring her he was a man who would want his wife to himself who must have all or none no one must interfere with his monopoly and then with a pang of proud sensitiveness he told himself that the thing was impossible nevertheless the porch house thursdays were his high days and festivals as he walked up the hill in the darkness some new strange feeling was throbbing at his heart a sudden yearning to know his fate it was no use to delude himself with sophistries or to cheat himself any longer the first moment he had looked into the depth of those wonderful eyes he knew that he loved waveney as such men only love once in their lives and he knew now too well that he must win her for his wife or for ever live solitary his mind was in a chaotic state this evening a subtle form of temptation was assailing him why should it be hopeless true he could not marry for years but what if he were to tell her that he loved her and ask her to wait for him as other women had waited he dallied with this thought a moment give me a little hope he would say to her it will strengthen my hands and i shall fight the battle of life more bravely let me feel that i am no longer lonely but even as the words crossed his lips he chid himself for his selfishness why should he bind down that bright young life and condemn her to years of wearisome waiting why should his burdens be laid on her young shoulders how could he know what the years would bring his health might fail and then in a mood of dogged hopelessness he let himself into the little gate that led to the tennisground and the porch house little did he guess as he passed the lighted window of the library that the objects of his thoughts lay there sleeping for sorrow but his first glance as he entered the recreation hall showed him that the chair by nora greenwell was empty and his face was graver and more impassive than ever as he took up his book but more than once that evening as he heard the latch lifted in the adjoining room he lifted his head and his wistful look was fixed on the opening door but no little figure in sapphire blue came lightly into the room as soon as his duties were over thorold crossed the room to althea where is miss ward he asked quietly and althea who knew he had personal interest in all his pupils took the question as a matter of course i thought you would have heard she said a little sadly the poor child is in great trouble and then she gave him a brief account of the last two days thorolds face paled a little he was extremely shocked her twin sisterthat beautiful girl i saw in old ranelagh gardens yes returned althea sorrowfully i really think mollie ward has the sweetest face i have ever seen oh i do not wonder that waveney loves her so she is suffering cruelly poor child but her father will not allow her to go home no of course not he returned so quickly that althea glanced at him he is right quite right diphtheria is terribly infectious she might be ill too good heavens no one in their sense would expose a girl to such a risk and thorold spoke in a low vehement tone of suppressed feeling but althea was too much engrossed with her own painful train of thoughts to notice his unusual emotion no you are right she replied they must be kept apart but thorold it makes my heart ache to see her poor child it is impossible for any one to comfort her i can do nothing with her then thorolds firm lips twitched a little i am sorry he said in a quick undertone more sorry than i can say will you tell her so please goodnight i must go home and work and then he went off hastily forgetting that it was his usual custom to help althea extinguish the lights and to walk down the dark garden with her but althea sad and preoccupied hardly noticed this desertion on thorolds part the evening had seemed a long one to her her thoughts were in poor mollies sick room down below a lonely anxious man sat by his solitary fire god comfort him she said to herself softly as she rose from her seat the next few days dragged heavily ondays so dim with fear and anguish that for many long years waveney never willingly alluded to that time when the mere mention of it drove the colour from her face even mollie suffering tortures patiently hardly suffered more than waveney sir hindley richmond had paid his visit but had spoken very guardedly about the case there were complications it was impossible to say a great deal depended upon nursing he would come againyes certainly if mr ingram wished it and then the great doctor drove off everard took the news to the red house perhaps he needed comfort himself and pined for a sight of his darling but waveneys changed looks and languid step filled him with dismay she came to him silently and as he took her in his arms a sob burst from his lips waveney you will break my heart have pity on your poor father i have but two daughters and mollie and here he could say no more waveney put her hands on his shoulders they were cold as ice and her eyes had the fixed heavy look of one who walks in her sleep father is mollie dying her voice was quite toneless everard started in horror my darling child nogod forbid that such sorrow should be ours but she is very ill and i am afraid sir hindley richmond thinks very gravely of the case there are complications but he will come again ingram insists on it they are nursing her splendidly everything depends on that but it may be doubted if waveney heard this father she said in the same dull voice i want you to make me a promise if there is no hope if sir hindley says so promise me that i shall see herbeforebeforeyou know what i mean oh waveney my little waveney for gods sake do not ask me that and everard shook with emotion but i do ask it and then her arms went round his neck in a sudden passion of pleading father i will be goodi will not go near or kiss her but her dear eyes must see meshe must know that i am there father if you love me you will not refuse and then with a choking sob poor everard gave reluctant consent very little more passed between them when everard said he must go waveney made no attempt to keep him for the first time in her life her fathers presence failed to comfort her and instinctively he realised this take care of yourself for my sake he said as he kissed and blessed her but she made no answer when he left her she paced up and down the room restlessly movementthat was her sole relief and bodily fatiguethat would make her sleep once she pressed her face against the window and looked out at the darkness mollie is dying she said to herself and perhaps the dear lord will let me die too and then she smiled at the thought and resumed her pacing to and fro in the firelight as everard stumbled out of the room althea opened the door of the library and beckoned to him she had no need to ask him any question one glance at his face was enough mr ward she said in her soft voice i cannot let you go like this sit down by the fire and i will give you a nice hot cup of coffee you always liked coffee better than tea i remember you are very good he returned in a hesitating voice but i am anxious to get back to my poor child dr duncan will be coming at six and ingram will be round for news oh i would not keep you for worlds replied althea gently but you must drink this first and there is no need to drink it standing and then with a halfsmile everard yielded the beautiful room the soft lamplight the quiet face and kindly ministering hands of his old friend gave him a sudden feeling of warmth and repose he felt like a tired child brought out of the cold and darkness as he drank his coffee the numb strained feeling gave way miss harford he said suddenly it makes me miserable to see waveney ah she returned quickly i was afraid you would say that but the poor child is not herself she is stunned with trouble when we talk to her she does not seem to hear what we say doreen spoke to her a little sharply today she went on she did it to rouse her but of course i told her that it would be useless when she had finished waveney merely looked at her and then went out of the room and doreen was so afraid she had hurt her that she followed her to say something kind waveney seemed quite astonished you have not hurt me oh no she said it is i who am rude for i did not hear half you said when i try to listen my head pains me and i get confused but i think nothing hurts me everard sighed what are we to do with her he asked in a despairing voice dear mr ward returned althea in her flutelike voice we can do nothing but love her and pray for her she and her dear mollie too are in gods handsnot ours try to trust them both to him and then everard looked gratefully in her face she is a sweet woman he said to himself as he walked towards the station i wonder why she has never married but no suspicion of the truth entered his mind moritz used to send noel up to the red house nearly every day but he never came himself he spent most of his time at number ten cleveland terrace everard took very kindly to his visits moritz turned up at all hours with all sorts of excuses he would send up messages to the nurses and very often would waylay nurse helena in the road outside nurse helena who had a kindly womanly nature would smile a little sadly as she walked on he does not know poor man that he has a rival she said to herself there is a monsieur blackie i have heard the name often but poor child what does it matter and here nurse helena shook her comely head for that day dear sweet mollie was at her worst and moritz was like a man distracted that afternoon thorold chaytor came home unusually early he was bringing his work with him joanna and betty were spending the day with a friend at richmond and tristram had promised to join them in the evening so he would have the house to himself it was nearly four oclock but down by the river there was still light the water had a cold steely gleam on it and the black hulls of the boats drawn up on shore looked hard and forbidding there was a touch of frost in the air and as thorold lingered for a moment on the bridge he was surprised to see a solitary figure on the towingpath the next moment he uttered an exclamation and then walked rapidly in the same direction his keen farsighted eyes had recognised the pedestrian waveneys restlessness had amounted almost to disease that day she simply could not sit still all the morning she had been wandering over the common with the little dogs running beside her and the moment luncheon was over she started off on an errand to the model lodginghouse her limbs ached with fatigue but a streak of red sunset casting a glow on the river attracted her irresistibly and though the light had long faded and the air was chill and damp she still paced up and down but she started and a sudden giddiness came over her as a deep voice accosted her miss ward is this wise or right have you no regard for your health and thorolds voice was unusually stern but even in that dim light the drawn pallor of her face frightened him could sickness and sorrow of heart have wrought this change in these few days perhaps i have walked too much she returned faintly i am so fond of walking and the river is so beautiful and there is nothing else to do and then a sudden impulse of selfpreservation made her catch at his arm i am so giddy she said in a tired little voice if i only could sit down a moment there is a seat near he returned quietly let me help you and then his strong arm almost lifted her off the ground the next moment she was on the bench but his arm was still around her she was not faint her eyes were wide open and fixed on the water but her strength had gone and as far as he could judge she seemed scarcely conscious of her surroundings she even submitted like a child when he drew her head against his shoulder do not try to speak it will pass and you will be better soon and then he felt her pulse the feeble beats spoke of utter exhaustion very likely she had eaten nothing all day there was only one thing to be done she must be warmed and fed and then he must take her home do you think you could walk a little now he asked when a few minutes had passed and the cold breeze from the river seemed to pierce through him it is not safe to sit any longer there is a frost tonight and we have only such a little way to go will you tryand i will help you oh yes why not returned waveney dreamily but it is not a little way to the red house is it and then she rose stiffly and if thorold had not held her she would have fallen why am i like this she panted i have never been weary before you have walked too far was his sole answer and you are numb with cold and then halfsupporting halfcarrying her in his mans strength they reached the bridge under the gaslight he saw she had revived a little and then he made her take his arm the town was lighted and there were plenty of passersby but happily there was not far to go more than once even in that short distance he was obliged to let her pause for a minute as he opened the little gate she pressed his arm feebly oh not here she said i must go home please do not make me go in pleaseplease mr chaytor my dear child can you not trust me was all his answer do not fear i mean to take you home and somehow his calm authoritative voice seemed to control her at once chapter xxxii i will never be faithless again nothing begins and nothing ends that is not paid with moan for we are born in others pain and perish in our own thompson he had a face like a benediction cervantes in spite of her terrible exhaustion waveney instinctively dreaded the surprised looks and curious questionings which she feared awaited her the idea of joannas pity and bettys welcoming caresses seemed alike repugnant and when thorold opened the parlour door she drew back as though afraid to enter but he gently led her in they are all out he said quietly but you can rest and get warm and then he drew up an easychair to the fire and placed her in it and brought her a footstool the next moment with careful hands he removed her hat and put a cushion under her head then he drew off her gloves and gently rubbed her benumbed fingers waveney submitted to it all passively the warmth and stillness soothed her in spite of herself when thorold left the room to speak to jemima she rested her weary head against the soft cushion and closed her eyes how kind he washow kind every one was and then all of a sudden great tears welled up in her eyes the little parlours with their drawn crimson curtains and bright fire seemed to fade from her sight she was sitting on a bench in old ranelagh gardens and mollie was beside her the sunlight was filtering through the limes the children were flitting to and fro like butterflies here he isthe noticeable man with large grey eyes she was saying and she could hear mollies sweet scornful laughter in reply dear miss ward please drink this it will warm you and do you good thorold spoke in a clear persuasive voice but as waveney opened her eyes the tears were rolling down her small white face why did you rouse me she said with a little sob i was dreaming and it was so lovely i was sitting with my mollie and we were laughing and talking together oh mollie mollie and here a fit of bitter weeping seemed to shake her from head to foot no power on earth could have hindered the flow of those tears for one moment thorold almost lost his calmness waveney my dear child hush he said hoarsely you will make yourself ill why are you so hopeless it is often darkest just before the dawn and then his hand rested for a moment lightly on her head how do you know that your sisters life may not be spared and then all these tears may have been needlessly shed child do not lose your faith god may be dealing mercifully with you and yours he spoke in a voice of intense feeling then he gently raised her from the cushions and held the cup to her lips you must drink this he said very quietly and gently and waveney checked her tears and obeyed him there you are better now he said in a tone of relief when the cup was empty yes she whispered thank you for being so good and patient i ought not to have troubled you so troubled returned thorold in a low suppressed voice when there is nothing on earth that i would not do for you my darling the last words were scarcely audible then he bit his lip and rose hastily what was he doing he had forgotten himself the sight of her tears the anguish in her beautiful eyes had utterly unnerved him for the moment he had been oblivious of everything but her suffering and his great love and words of tenderness had forced themselves to his lips good heavens what had he done and here he paced the room in agitation but a glance at the easychair reassured him poor child she was so dazed so confused that probably the words had not reached her ears if they hadand here he frowned and stared at the fire in perplexityif fool that he was he had betrayed himself and then in spite of his selfreproach a gleam of joy crossed his face what if she had understood him and knew without doubt that she was the darling of his heart but he would not trust himself to be alone with her any longer he sent for a cab and then went up to joannas room for an old furlined cloak that he knew hung in her wardrobe a few minutes later when he returned to the room the cloak was over his arm waveney was still in the same position lying back on the cushions with closed eyes and listless hands folded on her lap but at the sound of his step she struggled into a sitting posture have you come for me may i go now she asked in a weak little voice but he noticed that the colour had returned to her lips yes he said quietly the cab is here but you must let me wrap you in this cloak for it is bitterly cold outside and this room is so warm then she stood up without a word and allowed him to put it round her then still silently he drew her hand through his arm and led her slowly down the little courtyard for some minutes no word passed between them thorold pulled up the windows then he wrapped the old cloak a little closer round her and stooped to bring it under her feet as he did so she put out her hand to stop him oh pleaseplease do not trouble about me so she said in a distressed tone i am quite warm now you are so kind and i cannot even thank you then with a sudden impulse he took her hand and held it firmly do you know how you can thank me best he said very gently by taking better care of yourself in future waveney promise me that you will never act so recklessly again good heavens what would have become of you if i had not found you and even now then with an involuntary shudder he checked himself i was very wrong she returned humbly but i was so unhappy and i wanted to tire myself and somehow the river and the loneliness soothed me and then all at once i seemed to lose myself and you came i think the cold numbed me but i understand better now and i am sorry she spoke in broken little sentences and it was with difficulty that he could hear the words they were just entering the lodge gates at that moment and he leant forward in the darkness and lifted the cold little hand to his lips yes you were wrong he said tenderly as though he were speaking to a child but you will never be so foolish again you will take care of yourself for the sake of those who love you then he dropped her hand as a gleam of light from the open door streamed across the shrubbery and as the cab stopped he saw althea standing in the porch with a light fleecy wrap thrown over her head oh waveney she exclaimed in an anxious tone as thorold lifted the girl out where have you been then as she caught sight of waveneys face my dear child you look dreadful what has happened nothing has happened returned thorold impatiently miss ward is not well the cold has struck her please do not keep her standing here and unceremoniously putting althea aside he almost carried waveney across the hall take her to doreens room there is a nice fire there althea said quickly but she was too late for thorold had already opened the library door as he did so two people sitting by the fire rose hastily and looked at them the next moment waveney uttered a cry and freed herself from thorolds supporting arm father she exclaimed in a voice of terror you have comeyou have come to tell me then her breath failed her and she almost fell into everards arms my darling i have come to bring you good news he said pressing her almost convulsively to him oh such good news my waveney mollie is better the danger has passed and but here he stopped as waveneys head fell heavily on his shoulder you have told her too suddenly observed althea in an alarmed voice but thorold without a word took the girl from her fathers arms and laid her on a couch she has fainted he said briefly you had better bring some brandy and smellingsalts the sudden revulsion has been too much for her and then he helped althea apply the remedies while everard stood helplessly by too shocked and troubled to be of any use it seemed long before waveney opened her eyes she seemed rather confused at first as thorold put a glass to her lips she looked at him a little wildly is it another dream she whispered was not father here really then thorold smiled at her it was no dream he said quietly the good news is quite true mr ward will you take my place please then everard knelt down by her couch waveneys weak arms were round his neck in a moment father she said pressing her cheek against his tell it me again molliemy mollieis not going to die then everard in rather a tremulous voice repeated the good news there had been a change for the better early in the day but he had waited until the afternoon for the physicians verdict the danger that they dreaded was no longer imminent the disease had run its course everything depended now upon skilful nursing with care and watchfulness sir hindley hoped that mollie would in time recover her normal strength but in this insidious disease there was the danger of sudden collapse from exhaustionindeed there were other risks but everard did not mention this waveney listened with painful attention then her heavy eyes were fixed wistfully on her fathers face it is really true she murmured thank god oh thank god father dear may i see her now everard frowned anxiously he had dreaded this question but he had to be firm for the doctors orders were stringent no dear he said sorrowfully you must not see her yet it is for mollies sake as well as yours no one must see her the least excitement or agitation in her weak state might be fatal you must be patient my little waveney and i will promise you this that you shall be mollies first visitor and then waveney hid her face on his shoulder do not let her talk any more observed althea gently and then thorold came forward to take his leave as he pressed her hand waveney looked at him with a touching expression of gratitude in her dark eyes you were right she said in a low voice and i was wicked and faithless but i will never be faithless again but his sole answer was a smile so bright and reassuring that in her weakness it almost dazzled her as though some sudden sunbeam had flashed across her eyes fear nothing it seemed to say poor little tired child rest and be still and indeed before everard left the house an hour later the wornout girl was sleeping peacefully while althea with motherly eyes watched beside her it was late that night before althea retired to rest thorolds account had filled her with uneasiness his description made her shudder the dark solitary towingpath with the dense mist rising from the river the exhausted little creature trying to walk off her sorrow and restlessness no wonder that altheas kind heart ached with pity oh thorold she said and her eyes were full of tears how do we know what that poor child may have to suffer for her imprudence she may have rheumatic fever oh one cannot tell what may be the result of such madness then thorold shook his head with rather a sad smile you must not take such a gloomy view let us hope there will be no bad result i confess miss wards exhausted condition alarmed me at first it was distressing to see her and then there was so little one could do thorolds tone had a note of pain in it but althea looked at him with an affectionate smile dont undervalue yourself thorold in any emergency or trouble i know of no one who could give more efficient help so many kindhearted people spoil everything by their fussiness oh that is one for joa no no i was not thinking of poor joa with all her goodness she is the last person i should care to have near me in any sudden trouble perhaps it is unkind of me to say this but i know we think alike on this point and though thorold made no verbal response to this it was evident that he agreed with her when waveney woke the next morning she was conscious of aching limbs and unusual weariness and lassitude and it was almost with a feeling of relief that she heard althea say she must remain in bed you have been a naughty little child she said kissing her and doreen and i are excessively angry with you so we have agreed that you are to be punished by some hours of solitary confinement i am going to light your fire and then you are to eat your breakfast and go to sleep again waveney smiled quite happily at this she had no wish to dispute the point it was a luxury to lie still in her soft bed and watch the pleasant firelight until her drowsy eyelids closed again in spite of her weariness and aching limbs there was a fount of joy in her heart mollie is better mollie will get well those were the words she repeated over and over again and more than once her hands were folded and thank god came audibly from her lips at midday althea brought a note that moritz had sent by a boy messenger it was written to her but there was a message for waveney she read part of it aloud mollie had slept well and the improvement continued both doctor and nurses seemed satisfied if i had my way sir hindley should have a peerage wrote moritz he is worth all the other doctors put together and miss mollie would never have pulled through without him ill take my oath of that but althea kept the remainder of the letter to herself it was too strictly private and confidential even for doreens ears all day long in her waking intervals waveney was keeping one thought at bay deep down in her inner consciousness she was aware of some strange and secret joy which she dare not face but which seemed to distil some rare and precious aroma was it a dream she was continually asking herself but the answer to this perpetually eluded her all the events of the previous evening had resolved themselves into a sort of painful vision the dark sullen river her restless anguish those confused moments when giddy and sick she had sat on the bench with mr chaytor beside her the walk through the lighted streets and then the warmth and comfort of that friendly refuge it was not until late in the afternoon when the wintry dusk had closed in and the pansy room was bright with firelight that the power of consecutive thought and memory seemed to return to waveney when some sudden remembrance made her bury her face in the pillow what were those words that in spite of her weakness seemed stamped on her heart and brain trouble when there is nothing on earth that i would not do for you my darling no it was no dream she had actually heard them he had really said them would she ever forget his voice or the smile that had seemed to steal into her weary heart like a benediction then for a few blissful moments mollie was forgotten in the overwhelming consciousness that the man she most admired and revered who seemed so far above her in wisdom and intellect should stoop from his great height to care for her chapter xxxiii a quixotic resolution thine were the weak slight hands that might have taken this strong soul and bent its stubborn substance to thy soft intent watson for the first time in his life thorold chaytors conscience felt ill at ease and though his nature was by no means introspective or overscrupulous he tormented himself and suffered keen twinges of remorse for what he called his unpardonable want of selfcontrol thorolds sense of honour was exceptionally high in spite of his cold reserved manner he was extremely sensitive the thought that he had been overmastered and carried away by passion even though it had been momentary humiliated and shocked him in some of his ideas thorold was somewhat behind his generation and different from other men he held oldfashioned and somewhat obsolete views on the subject of love and his reverence for women savoured of the old days of chivalry in his hardworking life he had been brought little into contact with them he had no time for society an evening at the red house with his old friends althea and doreen was the only relaxation he had allowed himself but in spite of his selfrepression thorold chaytor was intensely human and like other men he yearned for the joys of wife and child man is not made to live alone he would say to himself drearily as he sat late at night by his solitary fireside and though no visionary the thought of some fair young face would haunt him persistently i wonder if i ever shall have a wife he would say to himself as he looked into the red glowing caverns before him i shall be hard to please i should like her to be a younger and prettier althea oh she is a noble creature althea she would have been a treasure to any man but i fancyi have always fanciedthat she gave away her heart to everard ward well who knows what may happen when i have earned my fortune and then he smiled a little bitterly as he opened his books again thorolds strong intense nature took nothing lightly if he loved it was with his whole heart and soul alas for him the small pale face and dark spirituelle eyes of his little undine were now all the world to him from the first he had recognised her sweetness and intelligence how he had longed to hold her to his heart and comfort her with the assurance of his great love how his nerves had thrilled with passionate tenderness as he ministered to her as though she were a little helpless child and all the time his heart had with mute reverence worshipped her i must not think of myself or my own happiness he said to himself as he walked down the hill in the darkness that night my days have been always joyless and what does a little more pain matter it is of her i am thinking god forbid that i should cloud her bright young life with any of my cares or perplexity my little waveney i would suffer a hundredfold more willingly than see you bearing my burdens poor thorold in his generous selfrenunciation he was making a grievous mistake though he little guessed it for womans nature was terra incognita to him generosity and selfabnegation are not solely masculine virtues and there are women to whom any form of selfsacrifice for the sake of a beloved object is simply joy and happiness who care nothing for waiting and poverty if they can only lean on some strong arm and be at rest but thorold was not wise enough to know this so he formed a singular resolution he would see waveney again he would watch her closely ah he loved her so dearly that he felt he could almost read her thoughts if she received him with her old frankness of manner if there were no trace of consciousness in look or tone he would know that his impulsive speech had not reached her ear and he would content himself with being more guarded for the future but if as some subtle instinct told him there should be some undefinable change in her some new veil of shyness he would be certain that she had heard him too well and in this case it was his full intention to make her understand in some way the difficulty of his position it is impossible for me to marry for a great many years i am too heavily handicapped some such words as these he would say and then he would leave her but not until he had apologized to her with all the humility of which he was capable and when he had arrived at this quixotic resolution thorold was more at peace they would not meet just yet for waveney was unable to leave her room for some days and spent most of her time as althea informed thorold when he came in one evening in sleeping like a baby and she looks like one observed doreen who had just come down from the pansy room i was watching her just now before she woke up and i never saw such a baby face i think it must be her short curly hair that gives one the impression i wonder why it has never grown long mollie ward has such lovely hair waveney told me once that it had never grown since some childish illness returned althea but that she did not mind it as it gave her so little trouble why thorold you are never going as he rose from his chair what nonsense you must stay to dinner you have not dined with us for an age not this evening he returned hurriedly or i should have to sit up all night working i am glad to hear that miss ward is better he continued rather formally but she seems very weak still i suppose you have had dr hilton oh no it was not necessary returned althea waveney is not really ill she is only worn out body and mind a few days rest and feeding up and plenty of nurse marks cosseting will soon put her to rights and now her mind is at rest about mollie she will soon be her cheerful little self again i hope so was thorolds sole answer and then seeing that he was in one of his grave silent moods althea did not press him to stayonly accompanied him to the door and bade him a friendly goodnight poor old thorold he does not look quite happy observed doreen as her sister reentered the room i wonder if he has anything on his mind and though althea made no reply to this the same thought had crossed her mind more than once when waveney heard that thorold had called to inquire after her the previous evening she merely observed that it was very kind but an hour or two later she insisted on dressing herself and making an attempt to go downstairs althea remonstrated at first but waveney was so bent on trying her strength that she thought it wiser to let her have her way and actually forbore to triumph when waveney with rather a piteous face subsided weakly on the couch perhaps i had better wait until to morrow she panted dressing has tired me so and then as althea brought her another pillow and covered her up snugly she continued in a weak voice jestingly i feel as though i had the corporals wooden legs instead of my own they do move so stiffly but then wooden legs dont ache never mind anything is better than the heartache and to this althea cordially agreed everard ward paid them another visit while waveney was still in her room when he came again he found her cosily established in the library and though looking still rather weak and pale in excellent spirits for every day the good news was verified and mollie made slow but steady progress to recovery only once had there been a return of anxiety when for one long halfhour mollies weakness was so great that nurse helena feared sudden collapse everard did not tell waveney this but he kept her well acquainted with every little detail of the sick roomwhat nourishment mollie took and how many hours she slept and even a speech or two repeated by her nurses once she sent her dear love to waveney and another time she asked if mr ingram ever came to the house and had looked both pleased and surprised when she heard he had been daily twice or three times a day would have been no exaggeration of the truth but nurse helena wisely kept this to herself for of all things she dreaded any agitation or excitement for her patient when waveney grew stronger she drove daily with one or other of the sisters and when the february sunshine tempted her she took short strolls over the common with fuss and fury one sunday afternoon when althea and doreen were occupied as usual waveney put on her hat and went out there had been rain the previous night and the garden paths were damp and at luncheon althea had recommended her to take a little walk in the direction of the golf links as it would be higher and dryer there do not go too far and tire yourself had been her parting words remember thursday as though waveney could have forgotten it for a moment for that day she was to see her dear mollie again it was a lovely afternoon the air was soft and balmy and full of the promise of spring and thrushes and blackbirds were singing for joy because the dark wintry days were over waveney could have sung with them out of very gratitude and happiness oh how sweet life was after all mollie was getting well andbut here waveney flushed and walked on more rapidly for there were certain thoughts that made her heart beat too quickly i am very faithless she was saying to herself as she came in sight of her favourite seat it was in a little hollow and in the summer the larches and willows made a pleasant shade there was a pond near where children loved to sail their little boats or throw sticks in the water for some excited dog in her letters to mollie she had called it her green parlour she would have rested there for a few minutes but she saw it was occupied by a gentleman so she walked on slowly the next moment however she heard her name pronounced and thorold chaytor stood beside her you are tired you wanted to sit down he said abruptly as they shook hands please come back and rest a moment it is so warm and sheltered in the hollow i was not really tired returned waveney nervously but she avoided looking at him as she spoke it is rather a favourite seat of mine and the view is so pretty yes i was admiring it just now replied thorold but you will sit down for five minutes will you not then waveney shy and confused accompanied him a little reluctantly across the grass but as thorold walked silently beside her under his quiet manner there raged a perfect tempest of conflicting feelings his sudden and unexpected appearance had taken waveney by surprise and her startled blush and confusion betrayed her agitation at the meeting her new timidity the faltering of her voice and her avoidance of his eyes all told the same tale to thorold she had understood and she was not indifferent to him a spasm of joy shot through thorolds heart at this thought then he remembered his resolution and crushed down his rising happiness i must think of her and not of myself he said to himself as he took the seat beside her i am glad to see you are so much better he began after a long pause that neither knew how to break but you are not quite strong yet your step has lost its old spring then he interrupted himself as though he feared to say so much but all that will pass yes it will pass she returned trying to speak naturally and looking at him for the first time the soft brilliancy of her eyes almost dazzled thorold he nearly forgot his resolution as he looked into their brown depths do you know mr chaytor that on thursday i am actually to see my mollie i am counting the hours and so is she and that makes you very happy he asked in a low voice oh yes so grateful and happy father has seen her of course and he says i must be prepared to find her very weak is it not a pity she has lost her lovely colour but nurse helena says it will come back she seems such a kind woman when i send little notes to mollie she answers them so nicely and gives all mollies messages waveney had forgotten her nervousness in this engrossing topic but thorolds answer was a little vague and you will never be faithless again no she returned flushing at this i will try to be more trustful in future and then more kindly mr chaytor you were so good to me that miserable evening i have so often wished to thank you and tell you that i am not unmindful of your great kindness then he checked her miss ward you owe me no gratitude any one would have done what i did it is your forgiveness i ought to ask for i am afraid that in my sympathy and pity i forgot myself he said this with such difficulty and in such a constrained tone that waveney looked at him in astonishment then as she saw his expression her head drooped a little i do not know what you mean she said under her breath i cannot explain myself he returned hurriedly would to heaven that i could but i think from your manner that you do not misunderstand me miss ward there is something i want to tell you about myself if you will pardon my egotism we are good friends i trust and if possible i want you to think well of me waveney listened silently to this but she bit her lip to conceal a smile was it likely that she of all persons would think ill of him i am unfortunately placed he continued all my life circumstances have been too strong for me other men can please themselves but i have never been free to choose my own path duties and responsibilities have crowded on me from mere boyhood fresh ones have come to me within the last few months then waveney understood that he was speaking of his brother and little bet and her attention became almost painful i can see no end of it all he went onand there was despair in his voice it must be yearsperhaps many yearsbefore i can think of marrying i ought to have remembered thisi ought not to have forgotten myself then he rose abruptly and his face was very pale miss ward you have been very good to listen to me so patiently but i must not keep you here any longer it will not be safe for you he was standing before her as he spoke but for a moment she made no reply only sat with bent head and her hands folded tightly together in her lap but as he stooped and put out his hand as though to help her to rise she suddenly looked up in his face thank you she said quite simply you need not fear that i should ever misunderstand one so good and kind and then she flushed up and rose quickly from the bench it is too late to go on now and miss harford will be expecting me please do not come any farther there is no need to spoil your walk give my love to your sister and little betdear little bet are you sure do you not wish me to accompany you he stammered but she shook her head with a semblance of gaiety oh no i shall be at the red house in five minutes goodbye goodbye waveney was in such a desperate hurry that she forgot to shake hands she almost ran down the little path between the furzebushes the thrushes and blackbirds had ceased their songs and the sunshine had faded from the landscape but in waveneys heart there was a strange new joy he loves me he loves me she was saying to herself though he will not tell me so for a long time oh how good he is how patient and selfsacrificing and then her eyes were dim as she remembered the suppressed pain in his voice i have never been free to choose my own path was that not true absolutely true and could any man have done his duty more nobly and yet this hero this king among men actually loved her and now waveneys eyes were full of tears chapter xxxiv i have wanted my old sweetheart our doubts and our fears we are leaving before us the future uprears where angels a rainbow are weaving of smiles and of tears helen marion burnside during waveneys indisposition everard ward had been constantly at the red house and these visits had been full of consolation to both father and daughter altheas kindly welcome and womanly gentleness had from the first put him at his ease both she and doreen had cordially pressed him to repeat his visits as they gave waveney so much pleasure once when the sisters were out and waveney was making tea for him in the library she asked him suddenly why mr ingram never called at the red house i do not think it is quite kind and cousinly she said rather seriously everard seemed a little embarrassed by the question why you see he replied in rather a hesitating way ingram is so fully engaged he is up at our place regularly every morning and evening he does not seem able to exist away from it mollie ought to consider herself a lucky little girl he continued thoughtfully for i never saw a man more deeply in love he is a fine fellowingramthe besthearted fellow i know and i only hopeand here he looked at waveney rather searchinglythat our dear mollie values him as he deserves i think mollie is beginning to care for him returned waveney at least i fancy so but of course one can only guess at her feelings you see he has given her so much pleasure and she has learnt to depend on him so much for companionship and sympathy that it would be strange if she were to harden her heart against him at last but fatherher voice deepening with emotiondo you think he is quite good enough for our sweet mollie he is very kind and amusingour dear little monsieur blackie but everard interrupted her abruptly pshaw what a ridiculous name i think it is quite time that you and noel dropped it monsieur blackie indeed absurd i cannot imagine why you have all taken such a liberty with him everard spoke in such a ruffled tone that waveney stared at him in surprise but father dear he likes it he is as proud of the name as possible in his little notes to us he always signs himself monsieur blackie and then she added rather wickedly you know dear the name does suit him so perfectly if he were tall and handsome and dignified we should have found him quite a different name but this explanation did not seem to please everard nonsense child he said quite sharply what do looks matter a good heart and a generous nature are worth far more some of the greatest men in the world were short of stature nelson and napoleonoh and many others but girls are so silly and sentimental they prefer some adonis six feet high with an empty purse and head waveney laughed merrily at this then a sudden thought came to her father she said rather gravely it is easy to see that mr ingram will have no difficulty with you and that you are his best friend has heand here she hesitated and flushedhas he spoken to you yet i mean has he told you that he loves mollie my little waveney that is not a fair question returned everard quickly but i suppose that there is no harm in telling you that i am most certainly in ingrams confidence now no more questions he has begged me to respect his secret yesrising from his seat and speaking with repressed excitementhe has my best wishes for his success now i must go dear child for i have promised to dine with him and noel when everard had gone waveney sat down by the fire the conversation had given her plenty of food for thought her father was in ingrams confidence it was evident that he fully approved of him as a prospective soninlawthat ingrams generosity and kindness of heart had won him over completely i like him she said to herself and i think i could get fond of him as a brother but in mollies placeand here waveney shook her head the vision of a grave strong face with keen thoughtful grey eyes seemed to rise before her a quiet cultured voice vibrated in her ears well mollie was welcome to her black prince to her there was only one man in the world and his name was thorold chaytor this little talk had taken place two or three days before her interview with thorold that sunday afternoon after that she thought less about mr ingram she was reading her own version of the old old story which most women read once in their lives and though the opening chapter was headed waiting and patience it was none the less sweet and engrossing to the reader there was something heroic to her in thorolds silence and selfrenunciation he is great because he has learnt to conquer himself she thought most men are dominated by their own passions and prefer inclination to duty and then like a true woman she reverenced him the more it was the longest week that waveney had ever passed and it seemed as though thursday would never come althea had promised to have luncheon with mrs mainwaring that day so she proposed to drive waveney over to cleveland terrace about noon she had already made her preparations for the interview by sending mollie the prettiest and daintiest blue dressinggown mollie who was still very weak had shed tears over the gift but nurse helena had only laughed at her and made her try it on everard was in the studio touching up a picture that one of his pupils had painted when waveney entered she was rather pale and breathless how shabby and bare the dear old room looked to her after her long absence and yet in spite of its dinginess how she loved it oh father how nice it is to be here again she said softly as she stood near him and everard smiled and patted her cheek ingram left those flowers for you he said pointing to a charming bouquet on mollies little paintingtable he was so sorry that he could not wait and see you but he had to meet an old friend at his club but before waveney could make any reply to this or look at her flowers a pleasantlooking woman in nurses garb entered she had a gentle face and kind eyes and waveney went up to her at once and took her hand you are my sisters nurse helena she said quickly thank you for all your care of mollie may i see her soon certainly will you come with me now miss ward heard the carriage stop and she sent me down to bring you up at once i need not caution you she continued as they went upstairs to be very quiet as my patient is still weak she is on the new couch that mr ingram sent for her use and i think you will say she looks very comfortable waveney was far too agitated to answer as nurse helena opened the door she heard mollies dear familiar voice say in weak accents wave darling is it really you and the next moment she was kneeling by the couch and she and mollie were clasped in each others arms and mollies thin white cheek was wetted by her sisters tears wave dear you must not cry so whispered mollie in a troubled voice i am better and nurse helena says that i get stronger every day then waveney ashamed of her want of selfcontrol and remembering the nurses injunction brushed away her tears and tried to smile i have wanted my old sweetheart so badly she faltered and with difficulty she repressed a sob in spite of her pallor mollie looked lovelier than everalmost too fragile and beautiful waveney thought with that faint flush of excitement on her wasted cheeks and the violet lines under the large eyes not more than i have wanted you darling returned mollie softly wave i want to see your dear face more clearly look nurse helena has put that seat close to me so that i can hold your hand and we can talk comfortably she is going to leave us alone for a quarter of an hour and i have promised to be good and not tire myself then as nurse helena closed the door oh wave it is almost worth all the pain and weariness to have such happiness as this it is almost too good to be true returned waveney tenderly dear mollie it has been such a dreadful time if i could only have borne the pain for you but to know you were suffering and that strangers were nursing you and i could do nothingnothing and a faint shudder crossed her as she remembered those days of anguish and suspense hush darling replied mollie but there were tears in her eyes we will not talk about that sad time now do you think i did not know what my waveney was feeling that night i was so bad and i thought that perhaps i should die i prayed that i might see you once more and that we might bid each other goodbye there dont fret for waveney was kneeling beside her again with her face hidden in the pillow i only want to tell you how good nurse helena was to me and how she comforted me i was very miserable the next day though i believe i was really better and when nurse helena asked me what was troubling me i told her it was because i was so wicked that i felt i could not be happy in heaven if my waveney were breaking her heart about me here and that with such feelings i was not fit to die and she said in such a comforting way but you are not going to heaven yet my child so you need not trouble your head about leaving your sister as for feeling wickedwell we are none of us angels but it is my belief that our heavenly father will not be angry with us for loving those he has given us to love oh she is such a sweet woman wave if you only knew her you would like her as much as i do nurse miriam was very kind too but she is not as nice as nurse helena i love her already for being so good to my darling returned waveney and then she tried to smile mollie dear there is some one else to whom we owe gratitude then a swift undefinable change passed over mollies face i know whom you mean she returned in a low voice and father has told me how good he has been it was mr ingram who sent sir hindley down and he made him come three times nurse helena says his fees are tremendous and that he is the greatest throat doctor in the world and then he is paying for the nurses i found that out the other day and every day something comesgame and wine and fruit and flowers and yesterday this lovely couch oh wave somehow it oppresses me to think of it all for how is one to repay such kindness we will think about that dear when you are stronger oh we shall have so much to talk about and to plan so you must make haste and get well for i cannot do without my sweetheart any longer then mollie smiled well satisfied oh dear how nice it will be she said in rather a tired voice do you know wave miss althea sent me a message by father the other day she has promised to spare you to me whenever i want you and when i go to the sea you are to come too this was news to waveney i have heard nothing about it are you quite sure she asked doubtfully quite sure returned mollie decidedly but it was only settled last night hemr ingram i meanand here mollie spoke rather hurriedly and nervously was talking to father he said change of air was necessary after such an illness and that the doctor wished it and that i should never get strong without it and then father gave in and it was decided that i should go as soon as possible and that you and nurse helena were to come too oh there she comes as the nurse opened the door but i am sure our quarter of an hour is not up yet it is just twenty minutes observed nurse helena composedly just five minutes too long i can see by your face miss ward will you bid your sister goodbye please i should like her to be quiet for a little before her dinner yes you must go wave observed mollie with ready submission but you are to have dinner with father before you go back and i am to see you again on sunday and then the sisters kissed each other silently but as waveney turned on the threshold for a last look mollie waved her hand oh it has been so nice she said feebly and i am so happy but almost before waveney was downstairs mollie was asleep well observed everard with a questioning smile have you talked mollie into a fever i am afraid we did talk rather too much returned waveney penitently for mollie looked very tired when i left but father how weak and thin she is i could not help fretting when i saw her but she looks sweeter than ever dear thing and miss altheas blue dressinggown is lovely she was quite a picture with that indian silk rug over her feet and all those beautiful flowers beside her ingram again returned everard with a groan do you know he is actually going to eastbourne next week to take lodgings for her and nurse helena and nothing i can say will stop him mollie says i am to go too observed waveney anxiously yes dear miss harford proposed that and i think she is right in saying that you need a change too you are looking thin and pale my child oh i am very well she replied hastily and then ann the heavyfooted came up to tell them that dinner was ready after that as waveney was too restless to stay in the house they went out for a walk and strolled in old ranelagh gardens and then down the lime walk and along the embankment to cheyne walk and then as it was growing dusk they walked on quickly to sloane square and everard put her in the train goodbye until sunday father dear were her last words as the train moved off but that night before waveney fell asleep happily in her pansy room nurse helenas homely words recurred to her well we are none of us angels but it is my belief that our heavenly father will not be angry with us for loving those he has given us to love thank god for that she murmured and that it is no sin that i love my mollie so intensely and in the dying firelight waveney folded her little hands together and with a grateful heart said her te deum chapter xxxv what am i to say so we grew together like to a double cherry seeming parted and yet a union in partition two lovely berries moulded on one stem shakespeare although march set in fierce and blustering as a lion it might have been as mild as any lamb to waveney for when one is young and the blood courses freely in the veins even a nipping east wind and grey skies are not the intolerable hardships that older people feel them especially when a wellspring of joy is bubbling up in the heart mollie was getting wellthat was the keynote of waveneys happiness and though althea shivered and looked depressed as she gazed out at the uninviting prospect and even doreen shrugged her shoulders and made uncomplimentary remarks on the weather waveney only laughed and looked provokingly cheerful i dont mind the long walk one bit she returned in answer to a pitying observation from althea i shall walk as fast as possible and keep myself warm and as for the dust dont you know the old saying that a peck of march dust is worth a kings ransom but althea smiled a little sadly as waveney ran out of the room to put on her hat and jacket how happy the child is she said with an involuntary sigh after all dorrie when one is growing old it is pleasant to have a bright young creature about the house dont you remember when aunt sara first suggested that i should have a companion that you looked rather blank and said that our old cosy life would be quite spoiled althea spoke in rather a depressed voice and doreen looked at her anxiously yes i remember she replied quietly the idea quite worried me i was almost cross with aunt sara for mentioning it but i am glad now that waveney came to us she continued thoughtfully she is a dear little thing and one cant help loving her and then you have found her such a comfort indeed i have was altheas reply she is such a bright intelligent little soul and she has so much tact and sympathy i am afraid i almost begrudge her to mollie especially as but here she checked herself you are not feeling quite well dear observed her sister affectionately i hope your eyes are not troubling you but althea shook her head not particularly no dont fuss dorrie there is nothing really the matter only the east wind is my enemy how is one to feel happy without sunshine and warmth do you remember that march we spent in the riviera and those orange groves and the bed of neapolitan violets under our window how delicious it was but ally dear remonstrated doreen why do you speak in that regretful voice you know aunt sara wanted you to spend the winter with her at mentone but you refused at once of course i refused returned althea indignantly do you think i was going to leave you alone all the winter besides there was my work what would have become of my porch house thursdays and my classes and library teas oh no dorrie what is the use of putting ones hand to the plough and looking back work has its responsibilities as long as my strength lasts i want to do my own little bit as well and as perfectly as i can and then mitchell came in for the coachmans orders and althea went off to read the letters in the library waveney spent half her time at cleveland terrace as mollie grew stronger she yearned incessantly for her sisters companionship and as althea once remarked to everard it seemed useless and cruel to keep them apart and everard fully concurred in this opinion but you are very good to spare my little waveney to us so much he said gratefully and we ought not to take advantage of your kindness the child was here three or four times last week i am afraid she is neglecting all her duties for mollie but though althea was too truthful to deny this she assured him that she was perfectly willing to spare her young companion i dont think i ever saw two sisters so devoted to each other she continued it is really beautiful to see their love for each other it has always been the same returned everard in a moved voice even when they were mere babies mollie would refuse to touch her cake unless waveney had half dorothy had to put them to sleep in the same cot or mollie would have cried half the night it was the prettiest sight she used to tell me and then he broke up rather abruptly i am an old fool about my girls he said with a little laugh but you see i have had to be mother as well as father for so many years but althea made no answer to this she only bade him goodbye very kindly it was the first time he had mentioned his wife to her dorothy how his voice had softened as he mentioned the beloved name that morning when waveney made her little speech about a peck of march dust she found a delightful surprise awaiting her at cleveland terrace her father was not at home she knew well it was his day at norwood so she went hastily past the studio door without peeping in as usual but the next moment she saw nurse helena on the threshold beckoning her will you come in here for a minute miss ward she said rather mysteriously and waveney with some surprise retraced her steps and then as she followed her in a little cry of delight broke from her for there was mollie pillowed up cosily on the old couch and smiling at her in the most triumphant way oh you darling exclaimed waveney in perfect ecstasy at the sight do you mean that you have actually walked downstairs yes and all by myself too returned mollie proudly but do you know wave i have been grumbling dreadfully grumps is not a bit comfortable and she pinched the old moreen cushions rather pettishly but nurse helena promises that i shall have my lovely new couch down tomorrow it will stand quite well in that corner between the window and fireplace and i shall be able to see any one who comes to the gate it is so stupid only to lie and look at the fire of course it is you poor dear but you will soon be watching the waves breaking on the beach so cheer up sweetheart but it was evident that mollie was not listening something else was occupying her thoughts her fingers played absently with waveneys curly hair as she knelt beside her then she drew a note from under her pillow nurse helena brought me this on my breakfasttray she said flushing a little as she spoke but i have not answered it yet i want you to tell me what i ought to do then waveney who had recognized ingrams handwriting read it somewhat eagerly my dear miss mollie was all it saiddo you think you are well enough to see an old friend i need not tell you what pleasure it will give me if you will allow me to come you shall choose your own day and hourany time from cockcrow to midnight will be equally convenient to yours most sincerely monsieur blackie short and sweet observed waveney smiling at the superscription but mollie was in no mood for trifling what am i to say she asked anxiously and her eyes looked bright with excitement my darling that is for you to decide are you sure that you are quite strong enough to see mr ingram shall we ask nurse helena what she thinks about it i have asked her replied mollie and she said that if i did not stay up too long or tire myself with talking that probably i should be well enough to see a visitor the day after tomorrow well dear shall i write and tell him so shall i ask him to come in the morning or the afternoon oh the afternoon please but waveneyand here mollie seemed on the verge of tearsof course i want to see mr ingram but yet i do dread it so what am i to say to him and how am i to thank him for all he has done i feel quite overwhelmed by it all and then as mollie was still very weak one or two tears rolled down her cheeks but waveney kissed them away oh you silly child she said tenderly fancy crying just because a kind friend wants to come and see you why it will do you all the good in the world there is no one so amusing as monsieur blackie take my advice mollie dear be as kind to him as you like but dont trouble your poor little head about making him grateful speeches wait until you are stronger you may depend upon it she continued that the black prince has simply been pleasing himself quite as much as he has you i expect generosity is just an amiable vice of hisa sort of craze dont you know he likes playing minor providence in other peoples lives it makes him feel warm and comfortable but mollie was quite indignant at this you are very clever she said rather petulantly but you talk great nonsense sometimes an amiable vice indeed i should like father to hear that why the other night he said quite seriously that mr ingram had been a perfect godsend to us all and waveneyand here mollies voice grew plaintivei do feel as though i owe my life to him for if it had not been for sir hindley and nurse helena and nurse miriam i should never have got wellfor father had no money and what could we have done and here mollie broke off with a sob darling do you think i dont know all that returned waveney vexed with herself for her attempt at a joke i would not undervalue mr ingrams kindness for the world he has been our benefactoryours and mine and fathers and noels as for myself i could grovel in the dust at his feet out of sheer gratitude for all his goodness to my mollie what i meant to say was this mr ingram does not want our thanks we are his friends and he just loves to help us so be as nice to him as you like sweetheart but dont embarrass him with grateful speeches for you would certainly cry over themand then he will get into a panic and ring violently for nurse helena and then mollie laughed and after that they talked with their old cheerfulness indeed waveney was quite wild with spirits for althea had told her that morning that she would give her a months holiday when mollie went to eastbourne it so happened that waveney had promised to spend an hour at the hospital with corporal marks on the very afternoon that was fixed for mr ingrams visit the old man was depressed and ailing jonadab has never got over the sergeants loss as his sister used to say and she reminded mollie of this it just fits in nicely she observed for you see two is company and threes none and i should have been dreadfully in the way but i shall be back in time to make tea for mr ingram and we will have a cosy little time together now i must go dear for i promised miss althea that i would not be late so goodbye until the day after tomorrow i wish it were tomorrow whispered mollie feverishly i do so hate waiting for anything like that i shall just think about it and what i am to say until i get quite nervous there dont talk about it any more and mollie who looked flushed and tired pushed her gently away waveney had promised to have luncheon with her father before she went to the hospital and when wednesday came she went up to the studio to have a peep at the invalid why mollie she exclaimed as she entered the room it is quite a transformation scene and indeed the shabby old studio looked wonderfully bright and cosy the round table had been moved to the other side of the room and mollies pretty couch and a low table that ingram had sent for her use were placed between the fireplace and window and a bowl of neapolitan violets was beside her there were flowers everywhere and as for mollieoh you dear thing how sweet you look remarked waveney with a hug and indeed mollie had never looked more lovely nurse helena had fastened two little pink rosebuds in the lace at her throat and their soft delicate tint just matched mollies cheeks she had a tiny gold vinaigrette in her hand which she showed waveney it came this morning with the flowers she said rather shyly waveney looked at it silently m w was engraved on it is it not beautiful wave but i wishi wish he had not sent it when luncheon was over everard walked with waveney to the door of the hospital he had a tiring afternoons work before him by tacit consent neither of them spoke much of ingrams visit i hope it will not tire mollie too much was all waveney said and once everard hazarded the observation that ingram was sure to be punctual chapter xxxvi see the conquering hero comes that man that hath a tongue i say is no man if with his tongue he cannot win a woman two gentlemen of verona love looks not with the eyes but with the mind and therefore is wingd cupid painted blind a midsummer nights dream as moritz drove to cleveland terrace he carefully rehearsed his part as he had already rehearsed it a dozen times before i am going to see your sister this afternoon he had said to noel at breakfast that morning miss mollie i mean have you any message for her no only my love and that sort of thing returned noel coolly as he cut himself another slice of bread and then contrary to his custom for he was one of the most talkative and sociable of men ingram relapsed into silence feels a bit grumpy i fancy thought noel with a suppressed grin if i ever have a young woman i wonder if i should feel in that way why the poor old chap has had hardly any breakfast and noel shook his head solemnly and adjusted his pincenez and then helped himself liberally to the cold game pie ingrams knowledge of invalids and sickrooms was purely rudimentary he had a theory that sick people must be treated like children they must be coaxed amused and made as cheerful as possible there must be no agitation no bringing forward of exciting or perplexing topics no undue warmth of expression and feeling i must be perfectly cool and quiet ingram said to himself as he came in sight of the house i must not let her see what i have gone through all this time monsieur blackie must take no libertieshe must be just kind and friendly but as the brougham stopped ingram looked a little pale although he put on his usual sprightly air as he went up the courtyard pride must have its fall says the old proverb and perhaps ingram who was an idealist relied a little too much on his theories and good intentions as noel would have said he was too cocksure of himself anyhow when ann of the heavy foot ushered him up to the old studio where he and everard ward had passed so many hours of misery and suspense and he saw mollies sweet face flushing and paling with shy pleasure ingram found himself unable to say a word for the sudden choking sensation in his throat he could only stand there like a fool holding the thin little hand that mollie had silently held out to him wont you sit down observed mollie faintly but her lips trembled as she spoke for ingrams dumb emotion almost frightened her it was so unlike her dear old friend monsieur blackie to stand there without a word of kindly greeting mollies flowerlike face grew painfully suffused do please sit down she faltered with a growing sense of discomfort and helplessness ingram did as he was bid but he did not relinquish her hand mollie he said and his eyes were dim with a mans trouble and the passionate tenderness that he was trying bravely to repress was so evident in his voice and manner that even mollie innocent and guileless as she was thrilled in every nerve perhaps i had better go away he stammered i shall tire you agitate you if i stay i must not say what i think and by heaven i cannot talk platitudes when you have come back from the very valley of the shadow of death mollie shall i gofor i cannot answer for myself if i remain why should you go returned mollie piteously i thought it would be so nice to see you and i wanted so to thank you you have done so much for me waveney told me that you would not like to be thanked but indeed indeed i am grateful grateful to me returned ingram indignantly and he dropped her hand mollie do you wish to pain me that you say such things to me gratitude when i would willingly give you everything i possess unsay those words my darling he pleaded passionately dont you know that i love you better than anything in the world oh mollie dearest if i had lost you i think i should have mourned for you all my life ingram was certainly not acting up to his theory monsieur blackie had utterly forgotten his role he had promised himself to keep perfectly cool and collected to be kind and friendly and to avoid all emotion or excitement but before ten minutes had passed he was pouring out his pentup feelings oh mollie dear mollie he went on in a broken voicefor mollie shaken and agitated had hidden her face in her handsall this time i have been trying to win you i want you to be my sweet wife to give me the right to watch over you all my life darling do you think you can care for poor monsieur blackie a little i do care sobbed mollie how can i help it when you have been so good to me i thinkbut mollie whispered this with her soft cheek pressed against his shoulder as he knelt beside heri think i have cared for you all this time and perhaps that moments ecstasy fully repaid moritz for all the pain of the last few weeks moritz behaved very well on the whole when the first few minutes of beatitude were over mollies pale cheeks and tearful eyes reminded him that she was an invalid and he forbore to overwhelm her with his delight and gratitude he sat beside her talking quietly while mollie lay back on her pillows in languid happiness listening to her lover he was telling her how proud he was of his sobriquet and that no other name would ever be so dear to him as monsieur blackie i hope you will always call me by that name mollie darling to you i would always be monsieur blackie but moritz is so much prettier she objected and monsieur blackie would be so long for daily use and then ingram hastened to explain in his eager way that he had not meant that of course his wifehow mollie blushed at thatmust call him moritz but he never intended to lose his dear old title wave often calls you the black prince returned mollie with a low laugh oh dear how wonderful it all seems do you knowvery shylyi never imagined that any one would ever care for me because of my lameness are you sure that you do not really mind it and here mollies voice grew anxious and even sad i am so awkward and clumsy you know noel often calls me the wobbly one noel will never call you that again returned ingram quite sternly i gave him a good lecture the other day why mollie dearest you are simply perfect in my eyes i am afraid to tell you how lovely and dear i think you the wonder is that you could ever bring yourself to care for me for as gwen says i am about as ugly as they make em continued ingram in his quaint way and then mollie laughed again though there were tears in her eyes of sheer joy and gratitude mollie was very humble on the subject of her own merits she had no conception how ingram worshipped her sweetness and beauty his crowning triumph had been that monsieur blackie and not viscount ralston had won her love gwen may laugh at me and call me a fool he thought but her sarcasm and smart speech will not trouble me in the least i have played my little game and got my innings and the loveliest and dearest prize in the world is mine and then he fell to musing blissfully on the surprise in store for his sweetheart what would mollie say when he showed her her future home what would she think of brentwood hall and the silent pool and the big conservatory that gwen had called their wintergarden and the long picturegallery where in an obscure corner king canute hung as large as life moritz smiled happily to himself as he thought of the family diamonds over which gwen had gloated and which he had vainly entreated her to wear jack would not like it gwen had answered gravely they are for the future lady ralston not for me how glad he was now that gwens unworldliness and good sense had been proof against the temptation for in those days how was he to know that a certain sweet mollie ward would steal away his heart when mollie asked him a little curiously why he was smiling moritz returned without a moments hesitation that he was merely thanking heaven that she was not rich in worldly goods mollie opened her eyes rather widely at this i mean dear that i shall so love to give you all you want he said tenderly butbut you are not really rich are you asked mollie of course i know you are not poor because of all the lovely things you have given me andand but here mollie stopped she had not the courage to mention sir hindleys fees no i am not poor returned ingram quietly i have had a nice little property left me by a relative we shall be very comfortable dear and when you are my wife you will not have to bother your poor little head with making ends meet for once he had discovered mollie shedding tears over her battered little housekeeping book because she had exceeded the weeks allowance it was only sevenandsixpence or some such paltry sum but mollie was covered with shame at her own carelessness and ingram who was even in those early days head over ears in love longed to take her in his arms and kiss the tears away yes i think we shall be very comfortable darling went on ingram somewhat hypocritically as he remembered with secret glee his thirty thousand a year then as even his inexperienced eyes detected signs of exhaustion in mollies increasing paleness he somewhat quickly dropped the subject mollie was not merely tired she was dazed with the wonderful new happiness that had come to her in spite of her love of pretty things her little girlish vanities and harmless ambitions she was far too simpleminded to be really worldly if moritz in the old approved fairytale fashion had suddenly filled her lap with diamonds and emeralds they would only have dazzled mollies tired eyes later on perhaps these baubles and adjuncts of rank and wealth would gratify and delight her but at this present moment she would have regarded them with indifference it was the man moritz ingram whom she wanted it was monsieur blackie with all his quaintness his oddities and eccentricities his oldworld chivalry and true manly tenderness whom mollie loved and honoured mollie with all her simplicity and childliness had been wiser than most women in going straight to the root of the matter it was nothing to her that her chosen lover was short of staturea small dark man with a sallow skin and closelycropped hair that would have done credit to a convict mollie saw nothing but the kind dear eyes and pleasant smile and she would not have exchanged him for any adonis though he stood six feet in his stockings moritzs conscience was uneasy more than once he had made an effort to go but mollies soft little hand had kept him a willing prisoner waveney will be here directly she said she has promised to make tea for us and at that very moment waveney entered the room the lamp had not been lighted and only the firelight threw a flickering uncertain glow over the two faces before her but something in mr ingrams attitude in the very atmosphere of the warm flowerscented room made waveneys heart beat with quick sympathetic throbs oh what is it she said stumbling a little in her haste but as she put out her hands to save herself ingram caught them in his own my little samaritan he said affectionately do you know i am going to be your brother will you wish me joy dear and then in his airy foreign fashion moritz lifted her hand to his lips my brother gasped waveney well she had expected it but all the same she felt a little giddy mollies prince had come as she knew he would and would carry mollie away darling come here and mollie stretched out her arms almost piteously wave why do you stand there as though you were turned to stone dont you want me to be happy she whispered as waveney at this appeal knelt down beside her oh mollie returned poor waveney i know that i ought to be glad and i am glad butwith a sob that would not be kept backbutbut i have lost my old sweetheart never returned mollie energetically and her arms were round her sisters neck as she spoke wave dear you must not say such things nothing nothing can ever come between us or make our love less kiss me darling she went on and promise me that you will never say that again and then as waveney stooped over her she whispered in her ear after all i have found out the best way of thanking him perhaps it was as well that nurse helena made her appearance at that moment with the lamp and so broke up the agitated little group waveney got up feeling rather guilty when nurse helena commented somewhat severely on mollies flushed and tired face there has been too much talking she said in her quiet authoritative voice miss mollie must have her tea and go upstairs and rest and then she regarded ingram rather suspiciously nevertheless when she went out of the room there was an amused twinkle in the nurses grey eyes when ann brought up the teatray waveney was assiduous in her attentions to mollie and her fiance she chatted to ingram in her old frank way mollie was to rest and listen to them she was to enjoy her tea and the delicate tongue sandwiches that nurse helena had cut so carefully but nurse helena was right and there must be no more talking and then she amused them both by retailing to them the corporals odd speeches directly tea was over ingram took his leave before nurse helena turns me out he observed with a laugh waveney who waited for him outside was somewhat taken aback at the length of the farewell parting is such sweet sorrow she said to herself but she sighed as she said it waveney who was bitten with the same disease was certainly not disposed to be hypercritical on the behaviour of the lovers she had a few words with mollie before nurse came to claim her charge oh wave i cannot understand it mollie exclaimed and her eyes looked bright and excited fancy my being engaged before you i who never expected to have a lover of my own dearest you must love him for my sake he is so good oh there is no one like him and mollie seemed almost appalled at the magnitude of her bliss waveney had promised to wait for her father he was to put her into the train and althea had directed her to take a cab from dereham station straight to the red house everard was somewhat later than usual and they had only a little while together he listened to the wonderful news with the air of a man who had fully expected it i knew ingram would steal a march on us he said rubbing his hands together i told him to wait until the child was stronger and i thought he agreed to this but you can never depend on a man when he is in love and so mollie really cares for him went on everard in a pleased voice well she is a sensible girl and does me credit as for ingram he is a capital fellow a soninlaw after my own heart went on everard with a smile that perplexed waveney it was so mysterious and yet so full of amusement chapter xxxvii a devout lover a man he seems of cheerful yesterdays and confident tomorrows wordsworth i do perceive here a divided duty othello when waveney broke the news of mollies engagement to her friends at the red house the sisters only looked at each other with a meaning smile so that is the end of the comedy observed althea in an amused voice alls well that ends well eh dorrie of course we all knew how it would end that evening at the theatre to be sure we did returned doreen complacently nothing ever ruffled her placidity if people chose to be engaged or married it was their affair not hers doreen never envied them never drew unfavourable comparisons between her friends matrimonial bliss and her own single blessedness she had walked contentedly in maiden meditation fancy free all these years i was cut out for an old maid she would say sometimes laughingly to her sister the role just suits me you are different she once added looking rather wistfully at althea as she spoke yes replied althea frankly you and i are different people dorrie you are the happiest and most contented woman i know buta little patheticallyi have not had all my good things and though she said no more doreen understood her it is very odd to think that that pretty little mollie ward is to be a connection of ours went on doreen when waveney had bidden them goodnight waveneys heart was so full that she yearned to be alone in her pansy room and think over the days excitement mollie will be our cousin and as althea assented to this with a smile she continued i wonder what gwen will think of her new sisterinlaw my dear dorrie i think i can answer that given will be charmed with her you know how much gwen thinks of beauty and where will you find a sweeter face than mollies then she is such a dear little unsophisticated thing ah gwen will lose her heart to her you may depend on that upon my word she went on i think moritz has not chosen so badly after all indeed for an idealist he has done very well for himself and i shall write and congratulate him most cordially mollie will make a most fascinating little viscountess she will have much to learn of course but she will be no fainthearted lady of burleigh sinking weakly under the burden of an honour into which she was not born finished althea with a little laugh and then as the old grandfathers clock in the hall struck ten doreen rang the bell for prayers althea did more than write her letter of congratulation she drove down all the way to cleveland terrace a day or two afterwards to see mollie and wish her joy and she was so kind and sympathetic she praised moritz and said so many nice things about him that mollie was ready to worship her for her tact and gentleness mollies pretty bloom was returning to her cheeks and on her left hand there was a splendid halfhoop of diamonds she showed her ring to althea with a childs shy eagerness it is far too beautiful she said proudly but he did not buy it for meit belonged to that old relative who left him the property oh indeed returned althea with polite interest but there was an amused gleam in her eyes of course the ring had belonged to old lady ralston who had been a beauty and an heiress and whose diamonds had been the envy of all the dowagers at the county ball and then moritz had come in and interrupted them he was evidently taken aback at the sight of his cousin althea but her cordial welcome and her warm congratulations soon restored his equanimity and he was soon chatting to her and mollie in his old lighthearted fashion mollie was to go down to eastbourne the following week and the two girls were to be chaperoned by nurse helena mollie was recovering her strength so fast that nurse helenas office was likely to be a sinecure but when althea pointed this out very gently to moritz he put his foot down very decidedly of course mollie was getting better he said with the air of an autocrat and the seabreezes would soon set her up but how could his cousin althea imagine that two girls could be alone at a place like eastbourne the very idea shocked him as mr ward could not leave town except from saturday to monday he had insisted that nurse helena should be put in charge i shall run down myself every few days he finished and i suppose one has to study the proprieties then althea very wisely held her peace moritz went to the station to see them off the girls were in high spirits and mollie who knew that she would see him again before many days were over could hardly summon up gravity enough to bid him goodbye it was moritz who looked melancholy london was a howling wilderness to him without his darling he had sent noel back to keep house with his father and he meant to go down to brentwood hall and seek consolation with gwen and her boy gwen would give him all the sympathy he demanded she was as romantic and unconventional as he was gwen dearly liked a lover she would listen patiently to all his discourse on mollies perfections and she would help him with the decorations and the refurnishing of the rooms that were to be got ready for his young wife moritz who had been such a patient wooer was now in hot haste to clinch his bargain mollie startled and protesting had been carried away by his masterful eloquence and had signed away her freedom they were to be married in the middle of august and to spend their honeymoon at his shooting box in the highlands the moorland air would be good for mollie he said and they and the grouse would have it to themselves i dont hold with rushing about from place to place on ones wedding trip he observed to altheafor he had his theories on this subject also when jack and gwen were married they went off to the austrian tyrol and heaven knows where besides but i know a thing or two better than that the hut is a cosy little place and there are some comfortable rooms in it i will send down murdochhe is a highlander and a handy fellow too and his wife is a capable womanto make things shipshape for a lady we will have a few days in edinburgh first and show mollie holyrood and arthurs seat and she shall feast her eyes on the shops in princes streetfor moritz remembered with loverlike accuracy mollies girlish penchant for shopwindows moritz could be practical on occasion and he somewhat astonished althea when he took her into his confidence by his thoughtfulness for his young fiancees comfort it was to his cousin althea that moritz entrusted the formidable but delightful task of ordering the trousseau gwen was too far from london to undertake such an onerous business he had already talked the matter over with mr ward and had wrung from him a reluctant consent even everards pride and independence could not resist moritzs urgent entreaties that a trousseau befitting mollies future rank should be provided at his expense but before this could be done mollie must see her future home and be made aware of her splendid position and for this purpose it was arranged that when the month at eastbourne was over she should pay a visit to the red house and then moritzs longdeferred picnic to brentwood should take place althea had her own little plans which she did not impart to moritz although she had already talked them over with waveney you know my dear child she had said seriously to her the evening before waveney started for eastbourne i have been thinking a great deal of you and mollie and i have made up my mind to part with my dear little companion what can you mean asked waveney in a startled voice but she flushed uneasily i know i have been very little use to you lately and that i have neglected my duties shamefully but i was going to speak to you about that i want you to give me less moneyindeedindeed as althea looked extremely amused at this i am quite serious i have not earned my salary and i cannot take itit would not be honest and here waveney drew up her slight figure and looked very resolute why waveney my dear child remonstrated althea surely you are not going to disappoint me after all these months i thought we were such good friends you and i and that we understood each other thoroughly and as the girl looked at her in dumb questioning she continued affectionately dear friends do not differ for a trifle or stand on their dignity what are a few pounds more or less compared to all you and mollie have done for me how do you mean dear miss althea asked waveney quite taken aback at this i have done little enough i know and as for mollie you have brought fresh interests into my life returned althea quietly you have given me two more human beings to serve and love yes she continued but her voice was not quite steady i am very fond of you and your pretty mollie and it adds to my happiness to feel that i am any help or comfort to either of you comfort what should i have done without you replied waveney with emotion my own mother could hardly have been kinder and more patient then althea flushed slightly well then you will be a good child and let me finish what i have to say and then in her clear sensible way she explained her views about the future when mollie married waveney would have to leave them it was impossible for her father and noel to do without her and waveney who had not taken this into consideration felt a sudden thrill of pain at the idea of leaving the red house as this was the case went on althea she and doreen both agreed that it would be cruel to part her and mollie during the few months that remained to them mollie was coming to the red house for some weeks to do her shopping but when she went back to cleveland terrace waveney must go with her that is why i say that you and i must part my child finished althea gently i shall miss my bright companion sadlyso sadly indeed that i never mean to have another but waveney your father has the first claim to your services i dare not deprive him of your society when mollie has gone there we will not talk any more as she saw that waveneys eyes were full of tears think over what i have said when you are at eastbourne and take mollie into your confidence i know she will say that i am right and indeed when waveney consulted her mollie who was a very sensible little person fully endorsed queen besss opinion of course i could not do without you darling she remarked with decision moritzshe always said his name so prettily and shylywould not like me to be alone and as for father and noel they would be too uncomfortable with only that stupid ann to look after them and then waveney owned with a sigh that she and miss althea were right waveney took herself to task severely for her reluctance at leaving the red house was she guilty of loving the fleshpots of egypt was her home to be less to her because mollie would not be there waveney cried shame to herself because the thought of anns clumsiness fretted her while the meagre housekeeping and all the pretty economies that had been mollies share and were now to be shifted to her shoulders filled her with a sore distaste and loathing she had grown to love the red house and every room in it the luxury the comfort the perfection of the trained service the homelike atmosphere the cultured society of the two sisters and their wide work and sympathies all appealed strongly to waveneys nature her life in the red house had been a liberal education how much she had learnt there and then the porch house thursdaysbut at this point in her reflections waveney checked herself abruptly too well she knew where the sting lay and why the pain of leaving erpingham would be so sharp and continuous only there could she enjoy the society of mr chaytor and she knew well that at cleveland terrace her thursdays would be blank and sad wave dear exclaimed mollie on that first evening as they were together in their comfortable sittingroom looking out on the parade and the sea while nurse helena was busy in the room above unpacking their boxes isnt this one of our dreams come true that you and i should be at the seaside together it was your dream not mine mollie returned waveney in a teasing voice you were the dreamer in the old days i was far more prosaic and matteroffact and then she settled herself more comfortably against mollies couch there was your kitlands dream you know and a hundred others oh never mind kitlands replied mollie with a touch of impatience in her voice that was a dear dream but of course it was too big and grand ever to come true but how often we used to make believe that we were going to the seaside dont you remember wave the little bowwindow parlour over the tinmans in high street that we were to take and the seabreezes that would meet us as we turned the corner and how we were always to have shrimps for tea and then mollie laughed with glee but this is much better isnt it dear and she looked at the big cosy room that ingram had selected for their use they were like a pair of happy children that evening mollie had insisted that she and waveney should share the big front bedroom and she was so wideawake and excited that she would have talked half the night only waveney sternly refused to be cajoled nurse helena has begged us not to talk she said and i feel i am on my honour no mollie i will not be coaxed i am a woman of my word and i gave nurse helena my promise there shall be no pale cheeks for the black prince to see on saturday go to sleep like a good child and then mollie consented to be silent it was a happy month and nothing occurred to mar their enjoyment they spent delightful mornings on the beach or parade in the afternoon while mollie had her siesta waveney and nurse helena wrote their letters or enjoyed the books with which ingram had provided them after tea when the evenings were fine and warm they drove into the country coming back to an early supper moritz always came down from saturday to monday and put up at the hotel close by once he brought mr ward with him and another time it was noel and then indeed mollies happiness was complete only one thing troubled mollie as the days went on in spite of her high spirits waveney was not quite herself she had silent fits at times she was absent and distraite and did not always hear what mollie said to her and more than once as they sat in the moonlight looking at the silvery path across the dark sea mollie had heard a suppressed sigh there is something on her mind something she is keeping to herself thought mollie anxiously and we have never never had a secret from each other it is not like my own wave to hide anything from me and i shall tell her so and indeed mollie was so tearful and pleading so pertinacious in her questions and so quick and clever in her surmises that before they returned to the red house waveneys poor little secrether unfinished storywas in mollies keeping mollie was full of tender sympathy she cried bitterly over waveneys description of that meeting by the river she quaked and shiveredwas hot and cold by turns with excitement of course he cares for you darling she said putting her arms round her sisters neck how can he help it oh it will all come right she continued cheerfully one day you will be as happy as we are what a pity he is so poor and proud men are so blind it would be so much nicer to be engaged and waitoh any number of years went on mollie with womanly philosophy but to this waveney made no answer perhaps in her secret heart she was glad mollie knew never in their lives had they had a thought unshared by the other but when mollie was alone she made a naughty little mouche how can she care for that plain oldlooking man she said to herself why i should be frightened to speak to him he looks so grave waveney is a hundred times too good for him a noticeable man with large grey eyes is not to my taste went on mollie with a blissful remembrance of her own dear monsieur blackie chapter xxxviii mollies prince and while now she wonders blindly nor the meaning can divine proudly turns he round and kindly all of this is thine and mine the lord of burleigh it is all arranged about the picnic exclaimed mollie in a joyous voice as she entered their bedroom where waveney was busy packing her own and mollies things it was the last day before their return to town moritz had come down unexpectedly the previous evening and had paid his usual morning visit he had gone back to the hotel to write his letters and had promised to join them on the parade later on what picnic observed waveney absently she was at that moment regarding with great satisfaction the new spring dresses that had just come from the dressmakers they had been bought with her own money and the pretty hats and smart boots and gloves had all been provided from her quarters salary and although mollie had at first refused to allow waveney to spend her money on her she was soon persuaded that any shabbiness on the part of his young fiancee would be distressing to mr ingrams feelings you know he likes people to be nicely dressed waveney had remarked rather severely so please dont be foolish mollie surelyin a pathetic voiceyou wont begrudge me this last chance of buying clothes for my sweetheart and what could mollie do after that except hug her silently in token of yielding what picnic returned mollie indignantly why our longpromised visit to brentwood hall of course to see dear old king canute in the picture moritz says he has arranged everything with miss althea i am to have a days rest at the red house and on thursday we are to go but miss althea is always engaged on thursday objected waveney she has her porch house evening oh yes i know retorted mollieshe was fairly glowing with excitement and happinessbut miss althea says she doesnt mind being absent for once we are to drive down to waterloo and moritz will meet us there and it is only an hours journey by train moritz says that his sister has promised to join us at luncheon i was just a wee bit frightened when he said that but he assured me that she would not be the least formidable she is very tall waveney and very plainat least strangers think her so and she always calls herself ugly but he was sure i should soon love her gwen is the dearest girl in the world he went on and jack just worships her jack compton is her husband you know oh wave i do hope she will like me of course she will like you returned waveney with comfortable decision i would not give a fig for mrs gwen if she had the bad taste not to admire my mollie well i hope it will be a fine day for moritzs picnic and then we can wear our new dresses but mollie dear are we really to have luncheon at brentwood hall i thought moritz said his friend was away and that only servants were there yes but he says he and lord ralston are such close friends that he has carte blanche to do as he likes he is viscount ralston and he is very rich moritz says he has over thirty thousand a year he seems to have very grand friends went on molly rather thoughtfully i am afraid they will look down on me a poor little lame cinderella but waveney scouted this idea with energy mollie was well born and well educated no one could look down on her moritz would not have to blush for her even if his friends were dukes as well as viscounts mollie must hold her own and not be too humble on the subject of her own merits it was quite evident that moritz thought her the dearest and sweetest thing in the world and she ought to be satisfied with that and then mollie cheered up and forgot her fears and they packed happily until it was time to go out when the eventful day arrived mollie woke waveney at an unconscionably early hour to inform her that the weather was simply perfect and that they might wear their new dresses without fear of a shower it was one of those typical may days when nature puts on her daintiest and fairest apparel when the fresh young green of the foliage seems to feast and rest the eyes the air was sweet with lilac and may and the tender blue of the sky was unstained by a single cloud when mollie came downstairs in her pretty grey dress with a little spray of pink may at her throat althea thought that she matched the day itself mollie has quite recovered her looks she said to doreen the dear child is a great beauty and gwen will be charmed with her and indeed as they drove through there were many admiring glances cast at the pretty blushing face moritz was at the station to meet them he had a white flower in his buttonhole and looked jubilant and excited perhaps he was a trifle fussy in his attentions mollie must take his arm he said the station was so crowded and there were a lot of rough people about poor mollie felt a little nervous and conscious it was difficult to adapt her slow lurching walk to monsieur blackies quick springy tread moritz might be as tender over her infirmity as a mother over some cripple child but mollie who was only human could have wept over her own awkwardness perhaps her limping gait had never given her more acute pain than now when ingram was trying so carefully and labouriously to adapt his step to hers mollies cheeks were burning by the time they reached their compartment but when moritz sat down beside her with a fond look and word she forgot her uneasiness and was her own happy self again the journey was a short one when they reached brentwood moritz hurried his party through the little country station before the stationmaster had an opportunity of accosting him an open barouche with a fine pair of bays was awaiting them when waveney admired them moritz remarked rather complacently that ralston was a good judge of horseflesh and then he asked mollie how she would like to drive herself in a low ponycarriage with a pair of creamcoloured ponies and mollie thinking that he was joking clapped her hands gleefully how delicious that would be she returned but it is very naughty of you to tantalise me in this fashion oh what a dear old village she went on and moritz the people seem to know you for moritz was lifting his hat every instant in response to some greeting oh they are always civil to people who are staying at the hall returned ingram evasively but at that moment he met altheas amused glance very well done my lord she said under her breath and then she shook her head at him they were just turning in at some open gates and before them was a shady avenue at the end some more gates of finely wrought flemish work admitted them to the sunny gardens and terrace while before them stood the grand old hall with its grey walls and quaint gables and oriel windows embowered in ivy and creepers it is a lovely old place murmured althea but mollie and waveney were speechless with admiration to their eyes it looked like an enchanted palace surrounded by shimmering green lawns the great door was wide open as though to receive them but there was no sign of human life when the carriage had driven away moritz took mollies hand and led her across the wide hall with its pillars and grand oak carvings its mighty fireplace and walls covered with curious weapons with here and there a stags antlers or the head of a grinning leopard they only paused for a moment to admire the great stone staircase that was broad enough for a dozen men to walk abreast one of the ralstons in a mad frolic had once ridden his gallant grey up to the very top of the staircase i am going to show you everything observed ingram as they walked down the softly carpeted corridor we call this the zoo he continued for if you look at the pictures mollie you will see they are mostly of animals there are some good proof engravings of landseer and the sculpture is rather fine but the most beautiful groups are in the picturegallery upstairs the fifth viscount ralston was a connoisseur of art and spent a good deal of his income in pictures and sculpture it was he who brought the flemish gates from belgium they are considered very fine and are always pointed out to visitors mollie began to feel a little breathless she wanted to linger in every room but moritz who had his work cut out for him hurried her on they went through the big diningroom which was large enough for a banquetinghall and into a smaller one where the table was already laid for luncheon and then into the library and morningroom when mollie asked with naive curiosity if there were no drawingroom moritz laughed and told her to wait these are ralstons private quarters he said ushering her into a cosy sittingroom fitted up for a gentlemans use but when mollie would have investigated with girlish curiosity the mass of papers on the writing table he quietly took her arm and marched her into the billiardroom adjoining ralston would not like us to look at his papers he said gravely he is an untidy fellow and his writingtable is always in confusion is lord ralston married asked mollie presently as they went slowly up the stone staircase althea who overheard her was obliged to pause she was shaking with suppressed mirth but waveney was far too busily engaged in admiring a painted window to notice her merriment ingram was quite equal to the occasion he is not married yet dear he returned quickly but he does not expect to be a bachelor much longer shall i show you the rooms that he has chosen for his future wife or shall we go to the picturegallery but mollies excitement was too great for fatigue and she at once decided to see lady ralstons rooms to mollies inexperienced eyes they were grand enough for the queen she was almost indignant when moritz explained that the boudoir and dressingroom were to be refurnished it was shameful extravagance she repeated more than once what did it matter if the furniture was a little old fashioned mollie was quite eloquent on the subject as she stood in the wide bay window of the boudoir it was a charming window mollie looked straight down the avenue to the great bronze gates the rooks were cawing in the elms some tame pheasants were pluming themselves on the lawn below and a wickedlooking jackdaw was strutting up and down the terrace the beds were full of spring flowers oh how perfect it all is sighed mollie and then she said in quite a decided tone i do think it will be wicked for lord ralston to refurnish this room there gwen do you hear that exclaimed moritz and mollie turned hastily round a tall young lady was standing in the doorway watching her she was quite young but mollie thought she had never seen any one so tall and certainly it was her opinion that first moment that mrs john compton was the plainest person she had ever seen mollie who was a great admirer of beauty felt a sort of shock at the sight of gwens frank ugliness her small greenishblue eyes crinkling up with amusement the bluntness of her features and her wide mouth gave mollie a pang she had yet to find out her redeeming pointsher beautiful figure the rich brown hair and pleasantly modulated voice moritz is this my dear new sister asked gwen with a smile so bright and warm that it quite transfigured her plain face and then with frank kindness she put her arms round mollie and kissed her mollie you must be very good to me she went on and now there were tears in her eyes moritz is my only brother and we have been everything to each other have we not old boy and gwen pinched his ear playfully and then greeted waveney and her cousin althea in the warmest fashion there was a little hubbub of talking and laughter and then moritz drew mollies arm through his and led her away probably gwen had had her orders for instead of following them she made room for waveney on the wide windowseat there is something moritz wishes me to tell you she said quietly and that he is telling your sister now however important moritzs communication might be it had to be deferred until mollie had exhausted her whole vocabulary of admiring terms at the sight of the noble gallery it was a drawingroom and ballroom as well as a picturegallery three great fireplaces with their cosy environment of luxurious lounges and easychairs gave warmth to the whole room and on the other side were windows with deep recesses every one forming separate cosy nooks in one was a low teatable and a circle of easychairs another was fitted with an inlaid writingtable and cabinet a third contained only a low velvet divan it was in this last recess that moritz at last contrived to detain molly dear mollie he said gently but firmly there will be plenty of time to look at the pictures and sculpture after luncheon but i want you to listen to me a moment i have to ask your forgiveness for a little deception moritzs face was so grave that mollie regarded him with astonishment my forgiveness are you joking moritz no darling i am quite serious i have brought you here under false pretences but i will tell you all about it byandby dearest this is your future home it is here that you and i are to spend our lives together moritz ingram and viscount ralston are one and the same person mollies face grew white the little hand he held trembled with emotion oh no not really she gasped yes really my sweet one but i cannot have you look so pale and frightened then as mollie glanced shyly at him he caught her suddenly to his breast my little blessing he whispered you loved your old friend monsieur blackie but you will not tell me now i hope that ralston is to be less dear to you no no stammered mollie but i cannot understand oh moritz why did you do it i will tell you dear he returned quietly you know at one time gwen and i were very poor we lived in a pokey little house that we called the tin shanty you shall see it some day and i think you will own that ten cleveland terrace is a mansion compared with it we were almost at the end of our tether when the death of a cousin made me viscount ralston and master of brentwood hall and thirty thousand a year oh moritz and mollie shivered and hid her face i was a lucky fellow was i not dear and i was truly thankful for my good things i was always very sociable and fond of the society of my fellowcreatures and when gwen married i led rather a gay life but after a time i got disgusted mothers with marriageable daughters made a dead set at me before the season was over i could have had my pick of half a dozen beauties viscount ralston with his thirty thousand a year was considered a desirable parti mollie dear it fairly sickened me you know i was an idealist and i never could make up my mind to move in the ordinary groove like other people and i registered a mental vow that unless i was loved for myself i would never marry when i first met my little samaritan i had no wish to disclose my title but it was a mere freak at first to remain incognito untiluntil i saw you my darling oh mollie do you remember that day and how i heard you singing and discovered cinderella sitting on the hearth shall i tell you a secret dear when i left the house that day i said to myself i will move heaven and earth to win that girl for my wife oh moritz did you really yes love and then and there i decided to be mr ingram i had no difficulty in preserving my incognito i bound over my cousins to secrecy it was only your illness that complicated matters i found then that it was necessary to take your father and noel into confidence but you and waveney were to be kept in ignorance gwen is telling her at this present moment but now mollie i have finished my confession and i only want to hear from your lips that monsieur blackie is forgiven there is nothing to forgive she faltered i think i am glad that i did not know but oh moritz there is one thing that makes me sorry and now there was a painful flush on mollies cheek you know what i mean i wish for your sake that i was not lame my poor little darling he returned compassionately but i think i love you all the more for your helplessness thank heaven my wife will never have occasion to tire herself the creamcoloured ponies are in the stable mollie and when we are married i mean to give you ridinglessons and then for very joy and gratitude mollie burst into a flood of happy tears oh it is too much too much she sobbed i do not deserve such happiness moritz you must teach me everything i want to be worthy of this lovely home and you and then shyly but with exquisite grace she lifted the kind hand to her lips chapter xxxix everard yields the point down on your knees and thank heaven fasting for a good mans love as you like it he does it with a better grace but i do it more natural twelfth night it is given to few favored mortals to know such hours or moments of intense happiness that their cup of bliss seems wellnigh overflowing but such a moment had come to moritz ingram and mollie when gwendoline came to summon them to luncheon two such radiant faces beamed on her that she smiled back at them with joyous sympathy come here and congratulate me gwen exclaimed her brother mollie has forgiven me for my little ruse she knows an idealist must have plenty of scope and that everything is fair in love or war and as mollie did not contradict this audacious statement gwendoline let it pass without rebuke moritz she is just perfect she whispered as mollie left them and went down the gallery in search of waveney oh i know as they watched the pretty girlish figure with its awkward lurching gait it is a pity the dear child is so lame but she is like a little stray angel for loveliness there she has found her sister we must leave them for a few minutes together mollie discovered waveney standing in one of the window recesses looking down on the terrace at the sound of footsteps she turned round well mollie she said trying to smile but her lip quivered so the prince has come after all and my sweetheart is to be a great lady are you glad wave asked mollie with a loving hug really and truly glad then waveneys dark eyes filled suddenly with tears glad that my mollie should have this beautiful home and all these fine things my darling what a question dont you know that i love you better than myself i could cry with joy to think that there will be no more dull anxious days in store for you no worrying over anns stupidity and no fretting because sixpence would not go as far as a shilling then as mollie laughed and kissed her i wonder what the black prince would have said if he had seen that poor little housekeeping book drenched with tears dont waveplease dont remind me of my silliness oh dear how unhappy i used to be and nowand here mollie gazed with delighted eyes down the splendid galleryto think that i shall ever be mistress of this it is just like a wonderful fairy story for none of our castles in the airnot even kitlandscame up to this of course not returned waveney energetically only cinderella could compare with it and then in a teasing voice your ladyship will not need to glue your face against shopwindows any more you will have diamonds and pearls of your own yes and a ponycarriage with creamcoloured ponies exclaimed mollie joyously and wave just think moritz is going to give me ridinglessons oh his kindness and generosity are beyond words darling you must love him for his goodness to your poor little mollie and wave remember all this will make no difference i think i care for it so much because i shall be able to help you and father they were interrupted at this moment moritz carried off mollie and gwen proposed that they should follow for while moritz has been dramatising she observed you two poor things have been starving and waveney could not deny that she was excessively hungry the old greyhaired butler was in his place when they entered the diningroom moritz stopped to speak to him tell mrs wharton that i shall bring miss ward to see her this afternoon he said and then they took their places both the girls were a little subdued by the unwonted magnificence of their environment but they struggled gallantly against the feeling as mollie ate her chicken and sipped her champagne she wondered how soon she would get used to be waited upon by two tall footmen and how she would feel when she was first addressed as my lady i hope i shall not laugh she observed to waveney afterwards waveney was wondering why she had never noticed that moritz had rather an aristocratic look their old friend monsieur blackie had always had good manners but now that he was in his own house and at his own table she was struck by his wellbred air and perfect ease he looks like a viscount she said to herself and yet he is perfectly his old self mollie was wiser than all of us for she found out that he was worthy of her love and then waveney fell into a reverie over her strawberries her thoughts had strayed to a certain dull narrow house in dereham thorold chaytors grave face and intellectual brow seemed to rise before her if she had his love she would not envy mollie her rank and riches she would envy no one even now she had her secret happiness for the words she had heard that sorrowful night were for ever stamped on her memory trouble when there is nothing on earth that i would not do for you my darling how then could she doubt that she was beloved when luncheon was over moritz took mollie to the housekeepers room and introduced her to mrs wharton gwen accompanied them and then they went back to the picturegallery and mollie and waveney feasted their eyes on the pictures and sculpture it was pretty to see the girls when they recognised poor old king canute mollie actually kissed the canvas you dear old thing she said apostrophising it wretched daub as it was crude in colouring and defective in execution moritz proudly termed it the gem of the gallery it helped me to win my mollie he said to gwen who was regarding it dubiously i painted many a worse picture when we were at the tin shanty eh gwen and her assent to this was so emphatic that moritz felt decidedly snubbed but he rose to the occasion nobly mr ward has not quite worked out his subject he went on but his idea is good and i shall always venerate it as the failure of a brave man a gallery of failures would that not be a happy thought althea suppose you and i start a hospital refuge or whatever you like to call it for diseased works of art we would buy them cheaply at halfprice and the poor things should live out their time and here moritz looked round the company for approval how about the survival of the fittest asked his sister scornfully oh that will be all right he returned easily besides we should have no very fit specimens in a gallery of failures they would be in all stages of disease but just think my dear what an encouragement it would be to the artists if my failure is remunerative the poor beggars would say to themselves i must just try again and do better next time you are very absurd moritz but gwen looked decidedly amused and mollie privately thought it a clever idea when they had finished inspecting all the treasures in the gallery gwen summoned them to tea the teatable was in the prettiest of the alcoves which was large enough to hold seven or eight people after this they went down to the gardens and through a small firwood to the silent pool here the carriage was to meet them mollie and waveney were enchanted with the silent pool the still green pool surrounded by the dark firs the beauty the stillness and the solemnity of the spot inspired them with awe to althea it was a favourite and wellremembered place she had visited it more than once in the old viscounts time for it had never been closed to the public that still pool with its dark hidden depths reminded her of her own life with its calm surface and troubled undercurrent there are so many lives like that she thought as she looked back at the solemn scene and then she followed the others down the winding path to the little inn which was known as the brentwood arms here gwendoline bade them an affectionate farewell and then they drove off to the station it has been the most wonderful day that i have ever spent in my life exclaimed molly a little breathlessly it has been a happy day to me returned moritz in a low tone there can only be one day more perfect and that will be our wedding day mollie when they reached waterloo althea refused to allow moritz to accompany them to the red house mollie was tired and overexcited and must rest he was to come to them the following evening to meet mr ward and thorold there was to be a sort of friendly reunion it was noels birthday too but there must be no more excitement for the present and althea was so firm and inexorable that moritz had to yield i think we are all tired observed waveney but it has been a lovely day and then in spite of altheas advice to rest and be quiet she and mollie discussed their delightful picnic only as they drove down high street and passed a certain house waveney became a little silent the blinds were up and the lamp was lighted waveney distinctly saw a tall figure standing by the window althea evidently recognized it too thorold has come back early from the porch house she said and then she spoke on quite a different subject to mollie the next few weeks were busy ones at the red house there were long mornings of shopping and endless interviews with dressmakers and milliners and the allimportant business of the trousseau occupied the three ladies from morning to night mollie took a childlike pleasure in it all prosperity did not spoil her she was still the same simple lighthearted mollie of old and the one drawback to her perfect happiness was the thought that waveney could not have it too i wish i could give you half my trousseau she said quite piteously but waveney only laughed at her dont be a simpleton mollie she returned why you foolish child there are actually tears in your eyes dont you know that all these fine thingsthese satins and silks and laceswould be most incongruous in my position what could i do with them at cleveland terrace but you will be at brentwood half your time retorted mollie moritz says he could not have the heart to separate us and he is so fond of you wave yes dear but all the same i must not expect to be as smart as your ladyship and then mollie made a face at her moritz had not forgotten his little samaritan and althea had her orders besides the beautiful bridesmaids dress a tailormade tweed and two pretty evening frocks were provided for waveney and then indeed mollie was content there was so much to do that it was not until the beginning of july that waveney and mollie went back to cleveland terrace to spend the last few weeks with their father and noel the wedding was to be from the red house and it was already arranged that they were to return a week before the marriage all this time moritz had haunted his cousins house morning noon and night and had refused to consider himself in the way every few days everard dined there and now and then thorold was invited to meet him everard was now quite at home at the red house almost insensibly he had relapsed into the old intimacy with doreen and althea he forgot he was only a poor drudge of a drawingmaster he forgot his shabby dresscoat and pitiful little economies brighter days were in store for him his little mollie was to be the wife of a nobleman and waveney was coming back to him to be the light of his home and there was little doubt in his mind that noel would distinguish himself and pass his examination i feel better days are coming he said once to althea she was his old friend and confidant he would often speak to her of his childrens future and her gentle sympathy never failed him it was altheas advice that he sought when moritz told his future fatherinlaw that he intended to allow him an income everard who was as proud as he was poor was sorely perturbed in his mind when he heard this what am i to do he said in a vexed voice when he found himself alone with althea that evening they were all in the garden togetheringram and thorold chaytor and joanna as well as moritz they had broken up in little groups and everard and althea had strolled down a side path behind the porch house i wish you would give me your advice he went on for i am in a terrible fix ralston is the most generous fellow i ever met he wants me to give up my teaching and accept an income from him the fact is continued everard rather bitterly he is unwilling that his fatherinlaw should be only a poor devil of a drawingmaster it is just his pride confound him but as i tell him i have my pride too i am afraid i hurt his feelings though he was too kind to tell me so moritz is very sensitive returned althea in spite of eccentricities he is very softhearted his generosity amounts to a vice he is never happy unless he is giving oh that is all very well replied everard in rather a huffy voice but if i do not choose to be indebted to my soninlaw surely my feelings must be considered as well as his true my dear friend but althea smiled as she spoke but it seems to me if i may speak frankly that your pride is at fault here moritz wishes to be a son to you he will be your mollies husband he has more than he can spendevery year he is likely to grow richer for as you know they have found coal on the welsh property he and mollie will be rolling in money and here she hesitated and mollies father will be out at elbows why do you not finish your sentence miss harford no i should not have put it that way returned althea but i think it will be rather hard on moritz and doubly hard on mollie if you refuse the gift that their filial love offers you mollie knows how you loathe teaching it is the crown of her happiness that her marriage will enable her to help you and waveney moritz intends to give her a magnificent allowance for her own private use and directly they were engaged he informed her that he intended to settle an income on her father mr ward you cannot be proud with your own children why not accept your soninlaws kindness i am sure you will not repent it and then everard yielded mollie and waveney were overjoyed when they heard that altheas counsel had prevailed and moritz was excessively pleased he was even disposed to encroach a little on his privileges only althea begged him to be cautious you and moritz must bide your time she said one day to the little brideelect you have both gained a victory and you must be content with that for the present your father told waveney the other day that nothing would induce him to leave cleveland terrace your mother died there she continued in a low voice and i suppose that is why he is attached to the house yes but it is such a dingy dull little place returned mollie sadly and moritz meant to buy such a pretty house and furnish it so beautifully but i suppose we shall have to wait indeed you must but cheer up mollie new carpets and curtains and light tasteful papers will soon transform number ten cleveland terrace into a charming abodeindeed i do not believe you will recognise it and ann is to be sent away you are sure of that miss althea yes and two good servants are to replace her waveney will have no trouble with her housekeeping now i hear moritzs voice and you know his lordship objects to be kept waiting and at this hint mollie blushed beautifully and ran away chapter xl the veiled prophet we are neer like angels till our passions diethomas dekker a heart to resolve a head to contrive and a hand to execute edward gibbon the evening before waveney and mollie returned to cleveland terrace there was a family gathering at the red house everard ward and his son and lord ralston dined there waveney had secretly hoped that mr chaytor would have been invited but althea who was not aware of the girls secret had said more than once that no outsiders were to be admitted and waveney vainly tried to hide her depression in spite of homesickness and longings for the society of her twin sister she had been very happy at the red house her affection for althea only had deepened with time and the thought that she was no longer to minister to her comfort filled her with profound sadness dereham and erpingham had grown very dear to her and the idea of separation from her kind friends made her heart heavy you will often be with us althea said trying to cheer her do you think doreen and i mean to lose sight of you no my dear no once loved is always loved that is the harford motto and most certainly you are not losing your friends no but it will not be the same returned waveney sadly but the real cause of her depression was not the parting from her beloved queen bess if she could only say goodbye to her other friend if she could see him again and have some look and word to treasure up in her memory on the last porch house thursday he had hardly spoken to her it almost seemed as though he had avoided her and certainly there had been no farewell most likely he would expect to see her on the following thursday and then althea would tell him that she was gone waveney tried to console herself with the thought that she would see him at the wedding for both he and his sister were to be among the guests but when one is in love even five weeks absence seems like an eternity in prospect and thorolds silent influence and unspoken affection was already dominating waveneys entire nature it was a sultry july day and althea had proposed to doreen that ices and dessert should be served in the verandah of the porch house overlooking the tennis lawn and when dinner was over she led the way to the garden when they came in sight of the verandah lord ralston expressed his approval with his usual frankness but everard looked at althea rather meaningly it reminds me of kitlands he said in a low voice dont you remember you often had dessert on the terrace and althea smiled assent dorrie and i are very fond of these al fresco meals she observed i think in summer we should like to have them all in the open air and then as they seated themselves in the comfortable hammock chairs doreen came across the grass with some letters in her hand she had intercepted the postman on his way to the house they are mostly for me she said looking at the addresses one from aunt sara and another from laura cameron and mrs bells account yours will keep althea it is only a businesslooking document from mr duncan correspondence with ones family lawyer is not particularly interesting added doreen briskly is old andrew duncan still in existence asked lord ralston casually as he handed an ice to mollie everard looked up quickly andrew duncan son of number twentyone lincolns inn i did not know he was your lawyer miss harford but noel suddenly broke in why that is our duncan father he exclaimed rather excitedly the veiled prophet is his client you know that reminds me he went on with a glance at his sisters i am going to beard the old lion in his den one of these days the veiled prophet shall be unmasked as sure as my name is noel ward noel is speaking of the unknown benefactor who is so generously educating him explained everard the silly children always speak of him as the veiled prophet but here he stopped suddenly as though he were shot he had been addressing althea who was sitting near him but at his first word her pale face had become suddenly suffused with a painful flush which deepened every moment that scorching blush seemed burnt into her very soul as she sat with downcast eyes unable to say a word will any one have any strawberries asked doreen hastily altheas confusion filled her with compunction and she was anxious to atone for her carelessness she handed some to everard as she spoke but he waved them aside with some impatience good heavens was it you althea he asked in a tone of dismay then noel sprang from his chair it is miss harford he said loudly by jove this is a surprise and the boys face grew suddenly red all these years we have been talking of the veiled prophet and it never entered into our heads that it was a prophetess my friend the humourist has evidently hit it observed moritz airily but he was looking keenly at althea other people can play comedies he said to himself and then he twirled his moustache until it was perfectly ferociouslooking and fell into a reverie poor althea tried to speak tried to rise from her chair but two pairs of white arms kept her a prisoner waveney and mollie were kneeling beside her dear dearest miss althea was it really you asked waveney and the tears were running down her face and mollie was covering her hand with kisses how could we guess that you were noels unknown friend hold your tongue old stormandstress interrupted noel with boyish abruptness a fellow cant edge in a word with you women it is for me to thank miss harford it is for meoh confound it all and here noel to everybodys surprise and his own too suddenly bolted let me go to him pleaded althea gently she had not said one word or lifted her eyes to everards face as she passed him her dress almost brushing against him he made no attempt to detain her doreen followed her and then moritz joined the agitated little group my cousin is a good woman he said with solemnity as though he had just discovered the fact she has noble purposes and has the courage to follow them out i admire especially the finesse and cleverness with which she has elaborated and carried out her beneficent scheme it might almost be compared in its grandeur of conception and its marvellous diplomacy with another drama of human life in which i have played a part and here moritz looked at his young fiancee and his humour changed come and take a turn with me mollie darling he whispered in the girls ear and then waveney and her father were left alone no one ever knew what passed between althea and noel in the porch house but for the rest of the evening noel was unusually grave and thoughtful but as althea was about to return to the verandah where the lad had already betaken himself she came upon everard he was standing alone in the porch and was evidently waiting for her it was now late and the moon had risen and everards face was illuminated by the white light at the sight of him altheas assumed calmness vanished but she tried to speak in the old friendly way were you looking for me mr ward she asked hurriedly are they all in the verandah still yes he returned curtly but i have come to ask you a question althea why have you done this why have you heaped these coals of fire upon my head poor althea the avalanche had fallen and she had nothing more to fear never again as she told herself would she live through such a moment of humiliation and shame the purity of her motives and the absence of all selfseeking and consciousness would make it easy to defend herself mr ward she said in her sweet pathetic voice we are old friends and to me the claims and responsibilities of friendship are very real and sacred when your trouble came when you lost your dear wife i heard from a mutual friend that you were struggling in deep waters and that in spite of hard work you found it difficult to make ends meet that is true returned everard but please let me tell you everything she pleaded this mutual friend often spoke to me of your twin girls but one day he mentioned noel he is a bright little lad he said and very sharp and intelligent but ward frets sadly about his education he has no means of sending him to a good school and he is very down about it poor fellow those were his very words i never forgot them i know from your own lips what a bright happy boyhood yours had been you had told me so many stories of your eton days and it seemed to me so grievous that your son should be robbed of his rightful advantages you forget that it was his father who was to blame for that returned everard with emotion my children must reap what their father sowed when i married dorothy we made up our minds to renounce the good things of this life oh i know the name of your informant althea it was carstairs he was a good fellow and he was in love with my dorothy but when i carried her off he never turned against me i remember that evening and how low i was in my mind about the poor boy but there i am interrupting you and you have not finished there is not much to say replied althea gently mr carstairs account troubled me greatly i wanted to help you but i knew and doreen knew too that any offers of assistance would have been indignantly refused we harfords are obstinate folk mr ward and we love to get our own way and then and there i concocted my little scheme and my good mr duncan helped me to carry it out but for doreens unlucky speech the veiled prophetess would have remained veiled and then she tried to laugh but the tears were in her eyes everard dear old friend you are not angry with me and she stretched out her hand to him angry returned everard vehemently one might as soon quarrel with ones guardian angel for heaven knows you have been an angel of goodness to me and mine no i have only been your friend returned althea a little sadly but now it is your turn to be generous and do me a little favour will you let me finish my work noel is a dear boy and i have grown to love him he and i understand each other perfectly it was always my intention to send him to oxford mr ward you will not refuse me this pleasure but everard shook his head we will talk about that later on when noel has got his scholarship and something in his tone warned althea to say no more she would bide her time she said to herself and then after a few more grateful words from everard she made some excuse and returned to the house but for some time everard did not follow her he lighted his cigarette and paced up and down the garden path coals of fire indeed they were scorching him at this very moment long years ago he had wronged this woman and she knew it he had inflicted on her the most deadly wound that a man can inflict he had won her heart and then in his fickleness he had left her and now in her sweet nobility althea had rendered him good for evil secretly and unsuspected she had befriended him and his but even now he little guessed the extent of her benevolence and that in the home for workers many of his pictures had found a place althea had kept her secret well good god he said almost with a groan why are men so weak and women so faithful i can never repay her goodness and then he thought of his dead wife dorothy had been the love of his youth she was the mother of his children he had never ceased to regret her loss and he had always told himself that no other could take her place in his way he had been faithful too but he knew now when it was too late that he had built his happiness on the wrecked hopes of another womans heart the next day the girls returned to cleveland terrace althea had driven them to the door and then she left them everard was out but as they stood in the old studio hand in hand mollies bright face clouded i never thought it was quite so shabby she said rather dejectedly how bare and comfortless it looks probably waveney had thought the same but she played the hypocrite gallantly nonsense mollie she returned energetically we are just spoiled and demoralized by all the comforts of the red house we will unpack our boxes and then we will put the room in order moritz has sent in a cartload of flowers and it will be such fun arranging them and then mollie cheered up but she had no idea as waveney chattered and bustled about that her head was as heavy as lead it was thursday and that evening mr chaytor would look for her but the place by nora greenwell would be vacant after the first day things were better lord ralston paid them daily visits and althea and doreen drove over constantly from the red house everard was generally absent he had not yet given up his drawing classes but the summer vacation would set him free waveney and mollie contrived to amuse themselves they sat in old ranelagh gardens with their work and books moritz often followed them there sometimes when mr ward had a leisure afternoon he would organise some pleasuretrip once he drove them down to richmond and they had dinner at the star and garter and one sultry july day they went by train to cookham and spent the afternoon in the quarry woods indeed moritz was never happy unless he was contriving some new pleasure for his darling the wedding was fixed for the tenth of august and on the third mollie and waveney returned to the red house the trousseau was complete but there were finishing touches that needed mollies presence when she tried on her weddingdress and althea had flung over her head the magnificent brussels lace veil that was one of lord ralstons presents she and doreen exchanged looks of admiration she is almost too lovely althea said afterwards and then she is so unconscious of her great beauty i know i am pretty she once said to me and i am so glad for moritzs sake i think i must tell gwen that chapter xli the true story of lady betty man is his own star and the soul that can render an honest and a perfect man commands all light all influence all fate nothing to him falls early or too late our acts our angels are or good or ill our fatal shadows that walk by us still john fetcher they laugh that win othello two or three days before the wedding there was another gathering at the red house gwendoline and her husband were staying with lord ralston and doreen suggested that the chaytors and everard ward should be invited to meet them althea made no objection only when her sister proposed dessert in the verandah she gently but decidedly put her veto upon it there are too many we had better remain in the diningroom she replied with heightened colour and doreen who with all her bluntness had plenty of tact said no more every one accepted but at the last moment joanna excused herself on the plea of indisposition but tristram chaytor accompanied his brother waveney and mollie were dressed alike that evening in soft ivorycoloured silk only mollies spray of flowers were pink and waveney wore dark red carnations thorold who sat by her at dinner noticed a diamond bangle on her arm waveney saw him looking at it it is a present from lord ralston she said i am to be mollies bridesmaid you know was it not good of him i never had anything so lovely in my life before thorold murmured some response then he addressed his next neighbour waveney was dangerously attractive that evening her dark eyes were bright with excitement and pleasure and in her white dress she looked more like undine than ever the conversation during dinner turned upon long engagements it was gwendoline who started the subject a friend of hers who had been engaged for eight years had been married that very morning gwendoline brought down on herself a chorus of animadversion and censure from the gentlemen for saying that she rather approved of long engagements and a warm discussion followed the gentlemen took one side of the argument and the ladies the other but gwen stuck tenaciously to her opinion waiting never hurts any one she said oracularly dont you remember lady betty ingram moritz lady betty was an ancestress of ours she continued she lived when farmer george was king and she was faithful to her love for more than twenty years fiveandtwenty years was it not gwen and then as most of the party begged to hear the story gwendoline narrated it in her own charming way lady betty had been for some time one of queen charlottes ladiesinwaiting but court life was not to her taste she was lively by nature and she disliked all the etiquette and restraint and she pined to be back with her parents in the old home but before she left the court she made the acquaintance of a certain sir bever willoughbyat least he was only bever willoughby then the son of an impoverished baronet and heir to heavily mortgaged estates lady betty was no beauty but she was considered fascinating by most people she was very witty and she danced beautifully and handsome bever willoughby lost his heart to her when he saw her walk through the minuet for she pointed her toe so prettily and curtsied with such exquisite grace that willoughby was not proof against her charms one evening when they were at ranelagh and lady betty looked more bewitching than ever in her little quilted satin hood willoughby suddenly addressed her in an agitated voice my lady betty he said the court is not the place for a poor man you have robbed me of my peace of mind but no lady however fair shall rob me of my honour i am going to win my laurels tomorrow i sail for america fare you welland god bless youdear lady betty and then he bowed to her with his hand on his heart and for fourandtwenty years she never saw his face again though she heard of him often it was then that lady betty returned to the old hall and there she lived a quiet life cherishing her aged parents and busy with her stillroom and herbgarden after the fashion of those days she had many lovers but she never married for as she once told her mother she had never met any one to compare with sir bever willoughby he was a goodly youth she said and when i looked on his countenance i bethought me of young david playing his harp among his sheep but he had one fault and it has spoiled both our liveshe was too proud to owe his fortune to the woman he loved lady betty was in her comely middle age when she next saw bever willoughby she had grown rather stout but people said she was handsomer than she had been in her youth she was dancing a minuet in the picturegallery at brentwood hall when a tall soldierlylooking man with his arm in a sling attracted her notice when their eyes met lady betty blushed like a girl but sir bever turned very pale when a week or two later sir bever asked her to marry him lady betty looked him full in the face there is an old proverb sir bever she said that tells us that some things are better late than never and methinks this wooing of yours is somewhat tardy say not so dear lady betty he returned passionately for though i rode away without telling my love i have had no wife or child but have been your true lover at heart all these years then lady betty dropped him a low curtsy but he saw the sparkle of tears in her eyes you have not been more faithful than another she replied you are a brave soldier sir bever but you had no right to break a womans heart as mine was broken that evening at ranelagh but she married him pleaded mollie rather piteously as gwendoline paused for a moment oh yes she married him and they were very happy but sir bever only lived ten years as he lay dying he expressed his regret that their wedded bliss had been so brief dear heart returned lady betty your mannish foolish pride kept my husband from me for nigh upon twentyfive years but we will make up for it hereafter and then she fell on his breast weeping death cannot part true hearts she cried and thou wilt be my own sir bever in heaven and here gwen caught her breath for jack was looking at her and actually mollie silly little mollie was crying it is a lovely story gwen observed althea and then she rose from the table a little later when the gentlemen had had their coffee they all went out on the terrace and waveney found herself pacing the garden paths with mr chaytor they talked on indifferent subjectsthe beauty of the evening and the charm of a wellkept garden and then they paused to listen to a nightingale in the shrubbery presently they sat down in the verandah at the porch house and watched the other couples passing to and fro below lord ralston and mollie gwen and jack compton and doreen and tristram the other three althea and mr ward and noel had seated themselves on a bench outside the library window the moon was rising behind the elms waveneys eyes were fixed on it when thorold suddenly broke the silence what did you think of the true story of lady betty he asked there was something inexplicable in his tone i thought it beautiful she returned though i did not cry over it as mollie did they were both so faithful but lady betty was braver than sir bever what do you mean remonstrated her companion surely it was better for him to ride away without telling his love you do not agree with melooking in her face you think sir bever was wrong to be afraid of his poverty yes i think he was wrong faltered waveney i agree with lady betty that he had sacrificed their youth to no purpose you see he gave her no chance of setting things right he just rode away and left her to bear her life as well as she could you are severe returned thorold eagerly you do not make an allowance for a mans pride that will not stoop to take everything from a woman i grant you the story was pretty and that mrs john compton told it well she has a charming voice and manner oh yes and she is so nice mollie is quite fond of her already i do not wonder at it but miss ward i want to convince you that you ladies are not the only ones who set us an example of faithfulness men may be proverbially fickle but there are exceptions to the rule oh yes of course it is difficult to judge in some cases there was a friend of mine here thorold hesitated and glanced at the girls averted face something in her attitudethe shy droop of the head the hands clasped so tightly on her white gownexcited him and quickened his pulses there was a tremor in his voice as he went on my friend was deeply in love with a girl she was very young he was much older and weighted with many cares and responsibilities and he was pooroh far too poor to take a wife again he paused but waveney made no comment only her hands were clasped more nervously he did not exactly ride away as sir bever did he went on but he made up his mind that the most honourable course would be to lock up the secret of his love in his own breast and not burden that bright young life with his troubles nowith strange emphasishe loved her too well for that dear miss ward surely you will own that my friend was right waveney would have given worlds not to answer her little pale face grew rigid with suppressed emotion though she never raised her eyes she was conscious that he was watching her keenly his strong will seemed to compel her to speak my friend was right was he not he repeated slowly and as though he were weighing each syllable no she returned abruptly he was wrong he was as mistaken as sir bever and then she grew crimson oh if she could only escape if she could bring this conversation to an end she was tingling from head to foot with sheer nervousness so i begin to think myself returned thorold coolly and then his voice deepened with sudden tenderness waveney my dear one tell me the truth would you wait for me gwendoline always boasted that she had made the match for you know jack she would say if i had not told that story about lady betty mr chaytor would never have mustered up courage to speak to waveney that night and they might have been pining for each other for years after all it had come about quite naturally perhaps thorold had read something in waveneys eyes as she listened to that old lovestory that made him change his purpose of silence but he never repented it we may have to wait for years he said to her when the first agitation of their great joy had calmed a little but waveney only gave him one of her radiant smiles faithfulness has not gone out with powder and patches she said in her quaint way i would rather wait through a lifetime knowing without doubt that you loved me than have to exist through years of chilling silence and in his heart thorold agreed with her everard ward gave his consent very willingly when thorold in rather an embarrassed voice told him that he feared they could not be married for perhaps four or five years he received the news with profound satisfaction chaytor is a soninlaw after my own heart he said to althea he will not rob me of my little girl for the next five years my dear fellow i am delighted to hear it i said to him but he looked at me rather reproachfully i hope they will not have to wait quite so long returned althea gravely but everard would not endorse this lord ralston had robbed him of his mollie and he could not spare his little waveney perhaps althea was the most astonished at the news thorold and waveney had kept their secret so well that she had never guessed it but when her first surprise was over she rejoiced heartily in their happiness thorold has grown years younger since his engagement she said one day to joanna he is not half so grave and sober now and joanna assented to this i am getting very fond of waveney she replied tristram likes her and so does betty but joanna spoke without enthusiasm her brothers choice had greatly surprised her and privately she thought his engagement to a penniless girl was an act of pure folly if he had only married a girl with money she would say to tristram sometimes but althea who had not outlived romance approved thoroughly of the engagement she saw that waveney entirely satisfied thoroldthat she was the light of his eyes and the desire of his heart my lonely days are over he once said to her and it was true waveneys bright intelligence enabled her to take interest in all his work and he could share all his thoughts with her when mollie and lord ralston plighted their vows in the old church at erpingham thorold was making silent vows in his heart and looking at a little white figure with worshipping eyes and waveney was repeating her te deum oh mollie i dont think you are happier than i am she whispered when they were alone together for a moment but mollie looked just a trifle dubious thorold was very nice and clever and she meant to be quite fond of him but he could not be compared to her moritz oh wave do you know what i heard as we came out of church just now she said merrily somebody near me said the lame bride is a real beauty and they say she is a ladyship now and then mollie laughed gleefully and gave her satin train a little fling wasnt it funny but i dont think moritz quite liked it and waveand now mollies dimples were in full playsomehow i could not feel quite grave when colonel treherne called me lady ralston chapter xlii wooed and married and a mir heres my hand fer and mine with my heart in it the tempest theres a divinity that shapes our ends rough hew them how we will hamlet it was arranged that waveney was to remain at the red house while painting and papering were being carried on at number ten cleveland terrace ann the heavyfooted was dismissed with a months wages and mrs muggins accompanied her a competent caretaker was put in charge and althea had already engaged two capable maids to come in when the work of renovation was complete it was the first time doreen and althea had ever spent august in town but mrs mainwarings sudden illness had detained them and as soon as she was fit to travel they had promised to stay with her at whitby while waveney remained with her friends everard ward and his son went down to a farmhouse in yorkshire that lord ralston had recommended where they would have excellent accommodation at a very moderate price and very good fishing it was the first real holiday that everard had enjoyed for years and noel wrote ridiculously illustrated epistles retailing sundry ludicrous adventures his revered parent as he informed waveney was becoming fatter and more plebeian every day and here there was a spirited penandink sketch of everard in a huge straw hat fishing on a boulder with a briarwood pipe in his mouth and several small fishes winking at him as they frisked harmlessly by caught nothing since friday week was written underneath the picture in spite of her happiness waveney could not reconcile herself to mollies absence the parting had tried them both no one forgot the brides tearstained face as lord ralston lifted her into the carriage oh do take care of my wave were her last words to althea as they drove away waveney shed many a tear in her pansy room but she cheered up when mollies first letter came and after that she wrote almost daily she was very happy she said and moritz was so good to her but of course it was strange being without her wave it was such a lovely place and the cottage was so cosy they were out all day fishing or wandering over the purple moors sometimes moritz had a days shooting with the keeper and then she and donald the gamekeepers son drove down with the luncheon they had dinner at eightquite a grand dinner and donald waited on them i have given up pinching myself hard to be sure that i am not dreaming she wrote once but for all that i am leading a storybook existence oh i am so happy darling i can hardly say my prayers without crying for sheer thankfulness my dear moritz spoils me so dreadfully he says he hates me to be out of his sight for a moment and if i were to believe half he says i should be as conceited as possible it is just his blarney i tell him and then he pretends to be affronted dont you believe her my dear wrote a masculine hand she is a perfect darling and the sweetest little wife in the world when it comes to pinching oneself i can hardly believe i am that lucky and muchtobeenvied fellow your affectionate brotherinlaw monsieur blackie when althea showed waveney the improvements she and doreen had effected in number ten cleveland terrace the girl could hardly believe her eyes new papers and carpets and curtains had quite transformed the dingy old house the stairs were covered with crimson felt and the studio and the bare ugly room where the sisters had slept looked perfectly charming a little money and a good deal of taste do wonders observed althea in a matteroffact tone but waveney wasnt so sure about the money moritz had evidently given his cousins carte blanche and though there was very little new furniture in the studio the fresh cretonne and floweringplants gave it an air of finish and refinement it was a pleasant life they led there never since his wifes death had everard been so content and happy mollies brilliant marriage gave him great satisfaction and he had no fear of losing his little waveney for many a year to come he was set free from the drudgery he hated and he and waveney were always together thorold spent his sundays with them and he came one evening in the week beside they had made this rule at the beginning and he never infringed on it every fortnight or so they dined at the red house and althea often had tea with them when she drove into town she and everard had resumed their old friendliness neither of them had forgotten that scene in the verandah of the porch house but by mutual consent the subject of noels education had been dropped for a time at the beginning of october the newly married pair returned to town and spent a week at eaton square and mollie and waveney were together every day why mollie i declare you have grown an inch taller were everards first words to her and privately he thought that young lady ralston was even handsomer than mollie ward had been both he and waveney agreed that happiness and prosperity had not spoilt their darling she was the same simple lighthearted creature thinking as little of herself and rejoicing over her pretty things as a child might have done perhaps there was a little veil of shyness and reserve when she spoke of her husband moritz was evidently perfect in her eyes but only to waveney did she dwell on his good qualities people do not know him she said oncethey think him eccentric but it is just his way of talking he is so true wave gwen says that she is sure that he has never told a lie in his life and he is so unselfish he is always wanting to make people happy when he was so poor he would deprive himself of a meal if a beggar looked hungry and now he is always planning some generous gift or other he lends his shooting lodge to poor artists or curates oh i cannot tell you half of the things he does he calls me his little blessing but i feel i can never never repay his goodness and here such an exquisite blush tinged mollies cheeks that it was a pity lord ralston did not see it mollie was naturally anxious to see her beautiful home and the lovely rooms that moritz had refurnished for her but her regret was so great at leaving waveney that lord ralston who could refuse nothing to his sweet moll suggested that she should pay them a visit in november he had already arranged that the whole ward family were to keep their christmas at brentwood hall but there was no reason why waveney should not spend a week or two with them in november it was impossible to refuse so tempting an invitation and when waveney reached brentwood mollie and the creamcoloured ponies were at the station mollie was in a perfect glow of pride and satisfaction as she drove waveney through the village waveneys first act after unpacking was to find the portrait of lady betty in the picturegallery mollie pointed it out to her lady betty simpered down on them from the faded canvas she had a round face and powdered hair drawn up under a lace cap and one slim hand held a bunch of roses her yellow brocade looked as stiff as buckram and her white arms were veiled with rich lace lady betty ingram in her twentyfifth year was written in the catalogue never had mollie or waveney spent such a christmas as they spent that year at brentwood hall thorold chaytor was with them lord ralston kept christmas in the old style there were mummers and carolsingers on christmas eve and cakes and ale ad libitum in the housekeepers room the john comptons came over from kingsdene and the day after christmas day there was a ball for the servants and on new years eve there was a festive gathering to which people came ten miles round and there was dancing in the picturegallery madam compton was there looking queenly in black velvet and point lace and she and jack were delighted when after supper gwen danced a minuet with her brother gwen was looking her best that evening she wore a creamcoloured satin gown cut somewhat quaintly and her beautiful neck and arms were bare of ornament as gwen moved down the picturegallery mollie vowed that not even the renowned lady betty could have curtsied with such grace oh how beautifully she dances whispered mollie and jack heard her and beamed with delight when the clock struck twelve they all joined hands and lord ralston made them a little speech then the band struck up and they all sang for auld lang syne mollie sat enthroned like a little queen all the time the dancing went on the diamonds she wore were hardly brighter than her eyes once when her husband said a little sadly how he wished his sweet moll could dance too mollies lip quivered for a moment then she said bravely it does not matter dear it is so nice to have you helping me and looking after me nevertheless her eyes looked a little wistfully after him and waveney when they waltzed together the spring days found waveney at cleveland terrace again moritz meant to bring his wife to eaton square for a part of the season and then she and mollie would go to exhibitions and concerts and to the opera together early in may waveney was sitting in the studio one afternoon finishing a long letter to mollie when thorold suddenly entered the room waveney gave a little cry of delight when she saw him oh thorold how delightful she exclaimed as he took her in his arms have you come to spend the evening yes if you will have me waveney i have some news to tell you good news i can see by your face and then she asked wickedly is joanna going to be married no my dear no one is going to be married but you and i byandbye but it is capital news for all that tristram has been offered a good berth at liverpool and as joanna cannot bring herself to part with betty she is going to keep house for them oh thorold how splendid and waveneys eyes sparkled with pleasure she was overjoyed at the idea that he was free at last no one knew better than she how uncongenial his home had been to him solitude would be infinitely preferable to the small carking cares and frets of his daily life joannas peculiar temperament created an unrestful atmosphere round her tristram who was of a blunter and more obtuse nature was less alive to the discomfort joa was always a poor puling thing he would say but she was very good to his betty and he was rather relieved than otherwise when joanna entreated tearfully to accompany them thorold does not want me and betty does she pleaded joa has a little money of her own went on thorold so i think they will be fairly comfortable the change of scene will be good for her they are to leave dereham at the end of july that will be nearly three months hence returned waveney musingly she was fingering thorolds coatsleeve rather absently as she spoke it was one of her pretty caressing ways with him he watched the little hand for a moment as it smoothed the rough cloth so gently then he took possession of it dearest he said very quietly once long ago i was ready to ride away without telling my love like sir bever but my good angel stopped me but i find that i have not lady bettys patience and long waiting would be irksome to me and then he looked at her very wistfully waveney i want to ask you a question when my sister leaves me do you see any reason why we should not be married it was evident that waveney was extremely startled and that thorolds proposition took her quite by surprise she grew a little pale i thought you could not afford to marry for years she returned shyly so i thought he replied with a smile you see darling when we were first engaged my sister was dependent on me and at that time tristram earned very little virtually i had to keep him and betty but all that will be changed now we should have to be careful and live quietly for some years to come but i am not afraid of the future my work is increasing as you know i have had to take better chambers and our last case was so successful that i am likely to have another good brief tell me the truth my little undine shall you be afraid to trust yourself to my keeping afraid need he have asked such a question the dark eyes looked at him with reproachful sweetness do you think i should fear anything with you she answered but thorold are you sure you really wish it but thorolds reply was so conclusive and satisfying that waveney yielded everard ward had been reading his paper in old ranelagh gardens that afternoon the pleasant may sunshine had warmed and cheered him and he whistled like a boy as he let himself into the house with his latchkey but his cheerfulness soon vanished when he learned the purport of thorolds visit he was deceived betrayed by the very man whom he declared would be a soninlaw after his own heart he was to be robbed of his little girl what a fool he had been to trust the word of a lover his knowledge of the world might have told him that they were all wolves in sheeps clothing five years engagement this is what he had promised the archtraitor and now he was coolly proposing that they should be married in august everard nearly talked himself hoarse in his effort to point out the extreme imprudence of the whole proceeding in his opinion he said it was utterly rash foolhardy and a gross tempting of providence all his life he had been an example of the sad result of an impecunious marriage his son had been indebted to charity for education and his daughters had been without advantages everard waxed quite eloquent over his theme but thorold refused to be intimidated he demolished all everards arguments with the ease and facility of a skilful lawyer and waveney was on his side everard had no chance from the beginning they were both against him and at last he had to throw down his arms even althea took their part and so did mollie but he yielded with a very bad grace and though he tried to hide it from waveney he was sore at heart for many a day waveneys feelings were very mixed her sorrow at leaving her father somewhat damped her happiness but mollie comforted her of course it is hard for father she said one day when waveney was lunching at eaton square he hates parting with his children dont you remember how low he was on my wedding day but he soon cheered up it will be all right wave so dont worry when you are once married he will make the best of it moritz says he must leave cleveland terrace and take a nice flat somewhere near you and when noel is at oxford he can divide his time between us and this view of the case was very consoling to waveney mollie was in the seventh heaven of delight just then she was to provide the trousseau out of her own pinmoney and this thought gave her so much pleasure that lord ralston declared she even laughed in her sleep but lord ralstons wedding present almost overwhelmed the young couple he bought a house for them at kensington and furnished it from basement to garret when he placed the title deeds in waveneys hands she was speechless with surprise and joy but moritz refused to be thanked mollies sister was his he said in his airy fashion and it was his business to see that she was properly housed chaytor is a good fellow he went on and i respect him highly and am proud to be connected with him i shall stand your friend and his as long as you both deserve it and look hereand here lord ralston glanced at mollies delighted faceif you and chaytor would like to do your honeymooning at the hut you are welcome to it and when waveney repeated this to thorold he said that it was far too good an offer to be refused ralston is the prince of good fellows he went on his generosity is as large as his purse you will love those scotch moors waveney i have not been in the highlands for years it will be grand to see the heather and the grouse again after all everard ward never had his flat neither did he stay long at number ten cleveland terrace another and far different fate was in store for him about three months after waveneys marriage he went one afternoon to the red house he had only just returned from brentwood hall where he had made the acquaintance of his first grandson and as usual he wished to talk over the visit with his old friend althea for they were very dear friends now and next to his own daughters he valued her womanly advice and sympathy in summer the door of the red house always stood open and he went in as usual unannounced no one responded to his tap at the library door and as he entered he thought for a moment the room was empty the blinds were down and the darkness rather bewildered him coming out of the sunshine but the next moment he caught sight of a grey figure in the shadow of the curtain althea was leaning back in her easychair there was a green shade over her eyes and her face was pale everard who had never seen her before in one of her attacks was much shocked you are ill he said taking her hand in spite of the warmth of the day it felt cold and limp then he looked round the room where is doreen surely she has not left you alone doreen is at the home returned althea in a weak voice there is a committee meeting please sit down and talk to me i want to forget myself no i am not ill the attack has passed off only i am stupid and dull dull everard felt strangely oppressed the darkness altheas pale face full of traces of suffering the disguising shade that hid the sweet eyes the pathos and helplessness and utter weariness so evident in the whole figurefilled him with pity was this what she had to bearshe who helped others whose whole life was devoted to good works who had been a guardian angel to him and his everard felt a sudden impulse that seemed to impel him in spite of himself he got up from his seat and stood beside her then as she moved restlessly as though disturbed by his action he dropped on one knee althea my dear he said huskily we are neither of us young and we have both known trouble but if you would have it so i should like to devote the rest of my life to you to wait on you and to comfort you was she dreaming althea pushed up her shade a little wildly but the gravity of his face left no doubt of his meaning i cannot i dare not accept it she returned and she trembled all over it is far too great a sacrifice it is no sacrifice at all was everards answer it is i who am unworthy of your goodness and the proud humility of his tone struck to her very heart i have loved you all my life she said to him later on everard it shall be as you wish it will make me very happy to be your wife i know how good you will be to me doreen was rather troubled when althea told her the news their peaceful dual life was over she thought but when she looked at her sisters radiant face she chid herself for her selfishness but she soon became reconciled to the change when everard took up his abode at the red house he became her chief adviser and helper he brought his masculine intellect and energy to bear on all their philanthropic schemes and my brotherinlaw says this or suggests that was for ever on doreens lips there was no doubt of altheas happiness she and everard were always together altheas sweet large nature was never exacting she knew that he would never love her as he had loved dorothy but this thought gave her no pain how could she complain that anything was wanting when his thoughtful tenderness was so unceasing when he never cared to be away from her it rests me to be near you he would say and indeed there was the truest friendship between them waveney and mollie were devoted to their beloved queen bess but our boy as althea always called noel was the pride of his stepmothers heart and so when her youth had passed that faithful soul reaped its harvest of joy thus the whirligig of time brings in its revenges but altheas noble revenge had been much patience and much love the end by john strange winter mrs
