is perfectly charming they both looked so comfortable and contented doctor luttrells first patient chapter i at the corner house seek not that the things which happen should happen as you wishepictetus there is an old adage worn almost threadbare with continual use when poverty looks in at the door love flies out at the window and doubtless there is an element of truth in the saying nevertheless though there were lines of care on marcus luttrells face and in the strong sunlight the seams of his wifes black gown looked a little shiny there was still peace and the patience of a great and enduring affection in the corner house at galvaston terrace when the brass plate glittering with newness had been first affixed to the door marcus luttrells heart had been sanguine with hope and he had brought his young fiancee to see it the small narrow house with its dark square entry its double parlours communicating with foldingdoors and the corner room that would do for a surgery had seemed to them both a most desirable abode olivia who prided herself on being unusually practical pointed out its numerous advantages with great satisfaction the side entrance in harbut street for instance and the front room where patients would be interviewed and which had a window in galvaston terrace it is so conspicuous marcus she said with legitimate pride in her voice no one can overlook it it is worth paying a few pounds more rent instead of being jammed in between two terrace houses harbut street is ever so much nicer than galvaston terrace and the houses are larger and it is so convenient having those shops opposite olivia was disposed to see everything in couleur de rose but to most people galvaston terrace would have appeared woefully dingy two or three of the houses had cards in the sittingroom windows with desirable apartments for a single gentleman affixed thereon and at the farther end a french dressmaker eked out a slender income the terrace had by no means a prosperous look a little fresh paint and cleaner blinds would have been improvements nevertheless people lived out harmless lives there and on the whole were tolerably contented with their lot when marcus luttrell made that fatal mistake of marrying in haste and repenting at leisure things had not looked so badly with him he had bought his partnership and had a little money in hand and olivia had had sufficient for her modest trousseau how could either of them have suspected that the partnership was a deceit and a fraudthat old dr slade had let marcus in for a rotten concernthat no paying patients would crowd the small diningroomand that two years of professional profits would be represented in shillings now and then when he was tired and discouraged dr luttrell would accuse himself of rashness and folly in no measured terms your aunt madge is right olive he would say we have been a couple of fools but i was the biggest what business had i to tempt providence in this way i do believe when a man is in love he loses his judgment look at the life to which my selfishness has condemned you you will be an old woman before your time with the effort to make a sixpence go as far as a shilling and there is dot and here the young doctor sighed and frowned but olivia who had plenty of spirit refused to be depressed you took me from such a luxurious home did you not marcus she would say with a genial laugh a hardworking daily governess leads such an enjoyable life and it was so exhilarating and refreshing to sit in ones lodgings of an evening with no one to care if one were tired and dull yes dear old boy of course i was ever so much happier without you and dot to worry me and somehow at these cheering words the harassed frown on marcuss brow relaxed had he been so wrong after all how could he know that old slade would prove a rogue and a humbug it would have been wiser to wait a little but then human nature is liable to make mistakes and in spite of it all they had been so happy olive was such a splendid companion she had brains as well as heart yes he had been a fool but he knew that under like circumstances many a man would have done the same he remembered the events that had led to their hasty marriage olivia had not long lost her mother the widows annuity had died with her and olivia who had only her salary as a daily governess in a large family had just moved into humbler lodgings he had gone round with some flowers and a book that he thought would interest her and as she came forward to greet him he could see her eyes were red and swollen what is it dear he had asked kindly and then the poor girl had utterly broken down oh marcus what shall i do she said when her sobs would allow her to speak i cannot bear it it is all so dull and miserable i am missing mother and i am so tired and the children have been so cross all day and olivia whose nerves were on edge with the strain of grief and worry looked so pallid and woebegone that marcus had been filled with consternation never had he seen his sweetheart in such distress and then it was that the suggestion came to him why should they both be lonely olivia could marry him and do her work as well and there need be no more dull evenings for either of them you will trust me to make you as happy as i can dearest he said tenderly as he pleaded for an early marriage and as olivia listened to him the sad burden seemed lifted from her heart are you quite sure we ought to do this marcus she had asked a little dubiously for in spite of her youth she had plenty of good sense and then marcus had been very ready with his arguments a doctor ought to be a married man his house was too large for a bachelor and needed a mistress what was the use of olivia paying for lodgings when he wanted a wife to make him comfortable and if she liked she could still go on with her teaching it was this last proviso that overcame olivias objections if she could keep her situation she would be no expense to marcus her salary was good and until paying patients came she could subscribe towards the housekeeping it was just one of those arrangements that look so promising and plausible until fairly tried but before many months had passed there was a hitchsomething out of gear in the daily machinery it was a dry summer and brompton is not exactly a bracing place olivia began to flag a little the long hours of teaching the hurried walks to and fro tried her vigorous young frame the little maids who followed each other in quick succession were all equally inefficient and unreliable marcus began to complain that such illcooked tasteless meals would in time impair their digestion the marthas and annes and sallies who clumped heavily about the corner house with smudges on their round faces and bare red arms had never heard of the school of cookery at south kensington olivia fagged and weary looked ready to cry when she saw the blackened steak and unwholesome chips set before marcus not one man in a thousand she thought would have borne it all so patiently then one hot oppressive evening the climax came olivia who had never fainted in her life found herself to her great astonishment lying on the little couch by the open window with her face very wet and marcus looking at her with grave professional eyes that night he spoke very plainly there must be no more teaching olivia was simply killing herself and he refused to sanction such madness any longer in future he must be the only breadwinner until patients were obliging enough to send for him they must just live on their little capital olivia must stay at home and see after things and take care of herself or he would not answer for the consequences you have your husband to consider he said in a masterful tone but how absurdly boyish he looked as he stood on the rug tossing back a loose wave of fair hair from his forehead people always thought dr luttrell younger than he was in reality he was eightandtwenty and olivia was six years younger she was rather taller than her husband and had a slim erect figure she had no claims to beauty her features were too irregular but her clear honest eyes and sweet smile and a certain effective dimple redeemed her from plainness and the soft brown hair waving naturally over the temples had a sunny gleam in it when baby dot made her appearancedorothy maud luttrell as she was inscribed in the registerthe young parents forgot their anxieties for a time in their joy in watching their firstborn marcus left his books to devote himself to nursing his pale wife back to health and as olivia lay on the couch with her baby near her and feasted on the delicacies that aunt madges thoughtfulness had provided or listened to marcus as he read to her it seemed to her as though the cup of her blessing were full oh marcus how happy we are she would whisper and marcus would stifle a sigh bravely illustration oh marcus how happy we are alas he knew the little capital was dwindling sadlyrent and taxes bread and cheese and even the modest wages of a second martha were draining his purse too heavily he had plenty of poor patients but no one but the french dressmaker had yet sent for the late dr slades partner it was then that those careworn lines came to the young doctors brow it was bitterly hard for marcus loved his profession and had studied hard the poor people whom he attended were devoted to him he allus tells a body the truth said old widow bates i do hate a fellow who truckles and minces his words like that sparks do you suppose jem arkwright would have let his leg be cut off in that lamblike manner if it had been benjamin sparks to do it i was down at their place and i heard when dr luttrell said now my man you must just make up your mind and be quick about it will you be a brave chap and part with this poor useless limb or will you leave your poor wife to bring up six fatherless children i am telling you the truth jem if you will not consent to part with your leg there is no chance for you laws sakes you would have thought he was a greyheaded old fellow to hear him it kind of made one jump to see his young beardless face but there he was good to jem arkwright that he was polly cant say enough for him she fairly cries if one mentions his name i should have been jems widow but for dr luttrell she said one day why before he came in jem was lying there vowing that he had sooner die than part with his leg it was the thought of the little uns that broke him my jem always had a feeling heart and other folks although they had not widow batess garrulous tongue were ready enough to sing the doctors praises when dot was a year old and able to pull herself up by the help of her mothers hand things were no better at the corner house olivia had even consulted her aunt madge about the advisability of sending martha away and doing the work of the house herself martha is the best girl we have had yet she said marcus owned that yesterday she is rough but her ways are nicer than annes or sallys and she keeps herself clean but then aunt madge she has such a good appetite and one cannot stint growing girls i should keep her a little longer was aunt madges reply to this it will only take the heart out of marcus knowing that you have to scrub and blacklead stoves and he is discouraged enough already when dot is able to run about you may be able to dispense with marthas services and olivia returned a reluctant assent to this but her conscience was not quite satisfied even aunt madge she thought hardly knew how bad things really were mrs broderick was a chronic invalid and never went beyond the two rooms that made her little world most people would have considered it a dull narrow life and one hardly worth living but the invalid would have contradicted this madge broderick had learned the secret of contentment she had lived through great troublesthe loss of the husband she had idolised and her only little child since then acute suffering that the doctors had been unable to relieve had wasted her strength nevertheless there was a peaceful atmosphere in the sunshiny room where she lay hour after hour reading and working with her faithful companion zoe beside her zoe was a beautiful brownandwhite spaniel with eyes that were almost human in their soft beseechingness and mrs broderick often lamented that she could not eulogise his doggish virtues as mrs browning had immortalised her flush olivia was devoted to her aunt madge they had a mutual admiration for each others character and her sisters child was dear to mrs brodericks heart and perhaps the saddest hours she ever spent now were passed in thinking over the young couples future i was wrong she would say to herself with a painful contraction of the brow i said too little at the time to discourage their marriage if i had been firm and reasoned with the child she would have listened to me livy is always so manageable but i was a romantic old goose and then she was in love poor dear and nowoh it breaks ones heart to see their young anxious faces i know so well what marcus feels he is ready to go out into the roads and break stones if he can only keep a roof over his wifes head and there were tears in madge brodericks eyes as she took up her work chapter ii the mysterious stranger i at least will do my dutycaesar young mrs luttrell stood at the window one november afternoon buttoning her gloves in an absent and perfunctory manner as she looked out at the slushy road and greasy pavement there was a crinkle on her smooth broad forehead and an uneasy expression in her eyesas though some troublesome thought had obtruded itselfpresently the crinkle deepened and widened into a frown and she walked impatiently to the fireplace where a black uninviting fire smouldered in a cheerless sort of way and took up the poker in rather an aggressive manner then shook her head as she glanced at the halfempty coalscuttle she was cold and the clinging damp peculiar to november made her shiver but a cheery blaze would be too great a selfindulgence left to itself the fire would last until teatimeshe would be back in plenty of time for marcuss late teahe should have a warm clear fire to welcome him and a plate of smoking french toast because it was so economical and only took half the amount of butter it had been a favourite delicacy in her nursery days and the revival had given her great solace yes he should have his tea first and then she would bring in the vexed subject for argument in spite of aunt madges wellmeant advice it was a foregone conclusion in olivias mind that martha must go of course it was a pity she liked the girl she was so willing and goodtempered and her round childish face was always well washed and free from smudges and she was so good to dot caring for her as if she were a baby sister of her own nevertheless stern in her youthful integrity olivia had already decided that marthas hours at the corner house were numbered and then there was the stuff for dots new winter pelisse marcus would give her the few shillings without a murmur she was sure of that but he would sigh furtively as he counted out the coins whatever deprivations they might be called upon to endure their little one must be warmly clad she must do without her new pair of gloves that was all and here olivia looked disconsolately at her worn fingertips she could ink the seams and use her old muff and no one would notice what was the use of buying new gloves when her hands would soon be as red and rough as marthas olivia was just a little vain of her hands they were not small but the long slender fingers with almondshaped nails were full of character and marcus had often praised them for his sake she would try to take care of them but blackleading stoves and washing dots little garments would not help to beautify them of course it was nonsense to care about such trifles she must be strongminded and live above such sublunary things marcus would only honour her the more for her selfforgetfulness and labours of love here the pucker vanished from olivias brow and a sweet earnest look came to her face the next moment her attention was distracted a tall old man in a greatcoat with a furlined collar passed the window he was a little bent and walked feebly leaning on a goldheaded stick olivia watched him until he was out of sight for some occult reason not comprehensible even to her she felt interested in the old man although she had never spoken to him but he looked old and ill and lonely three decided claims on olivias bountiful and sympathetic nature she knew his namemr gaythornehe was a neighbour of theirs and he lived at galvaston house the dulllooking red brick house with two stone lions on the gateposts olivia had amused her husband more than once with imaginary stories about their neighbour he was a misera reclusea misanthropehe had a wife in a lunatic asylumhe had known some great trouble that had embittered his life he had made a vow never to let a human being cross his threshold he was a roman catholic priest in disguise an agnostic a nihilist there was no end to olivias quaint surmises but she could only be certain of two factsthat the mysterious mr gaythorne was methodical by nature and whatever might be the weather always took his exercise at the same hour and also that only tradespeople entered the lionguarded portals of galvaston house olivia had only once come face to face with him she was hurrying along one afternoon when in turning a corner she almost ran against him and pulled herself up with a confused word of apology a suppressed grunt answered her a singular old face with bright deeplysunken eyes and a white peaked beard and moustache seemed to rise stiffly from the furlined collar then the old mans hand touched his slouched hat mechanically and he walked on it was that night that olivia was convinced that mr gaythorne was a nihilist and an agnostic and hinted darkly at the storage of dynamite and infernal machines in the cellars of galvaston house my dear child you might write a novel had been her husbands remark on this your imagination is really immense but in spite of sarcasm and gibes on marcuss part olivia chose to indulge in these harmless fancies she had always enjoyed making up stories about her neighbours and it did no one any harm when mr gaythorne was out of sight she went to the kitchen to take a last look at dot who was slumbering peacefully in her cot the kitchen was the warmest place and martha could clean her knives and wash her plates and keep an eye on her martha gave her usual broad grin when her mistress entered the little handmaid adored her master and mistress and dot during her rare holiday she always entertained her mother and brothers and sisters with wonderful descriptions of her mistresss cleverness and miss babys ways martha had eleven brothers and sisters and the house in somers row was not a luxurious abode her mother took in washing and eleven brothers and sisters of all ages and of every variety of snubnose made any sort of privacy impossible nevertheless on her previous holiday as martha or patty as they called her at home sat in her best blue merino frock with her youngest sister on her lap and a paperbag of sugarsticks for distribution to the family there were few happier girls to be found anywhere and i have brought you halfapound of really good tea mother observed martha proudly i knew what a treat that would be to you and father you are a good girl patty returned her mother winking away the moisture in her eyes as she went on with her ironing amabel dont you be trampling on pattys best dress theres a good little lass well as i was saying patty only the children do interrupt so there joe and ben just take your sugarsticks and be off to play i think i have found a nice little place for susan she is to sleep at home but will have all her meals and halfacrown a week and the lady will teach her everything that is pretty fair for a beginning and as father says the money will just find her in shoeleather and aprons fathers looking out for a place for joe now i wish susan could have a place like mine mother returned martha proudly they are real gentlefolks that is what they are will you be so good as to clean my boots martha or thank you martha when i dry the paper of a morning oh it is like play living at the corner house and as for that darling miss baby but here words failed martha it could not be denied that olivia was unusually depressed that afternoon fog and damp always had this effect on her her nature needed sunshine and crisp bracing air there was no buoyancy and elasticity in her tread when people looked at her as they often did for her pliant slim figure rather attracted notice she thought they were only commenting on her old black hat and jacket only one article of her dress satisfied her her boots were neat and strong marcus had found her one wet day warming her feet at the fire and had gone off to examine her boots without a word olivia had flushed up and looked uncomfortable when he came back with the boots in his hand do you want to be laid up with bronchitis or congestion of the lungs he asked rather sadly as he showed her the thin worn soles do you think that will make things easier for me livy the next day he had taken her himself to the bootmakers and had had her fitted with a serviceable stout pair somehow in spite of her pleasure in the boots and marcuss thoughtfulness she had felt rather like a scolded child her unusual pessimism had a moments distraction for as she passed the printshop at the corner of harbut street she saw her mysterious old gentleman standing still on the pavement fixedly regarding a small oilpainting olivia had a good view of the lean cadaverous face and peaked white beard the heavy grey eyebrows seemed to beetle over the dark sunken eyes after all he looks more like a spaniard than a russian she thought and again her theory of the roman catholic priest came into her mind if i could only see him without his hat i should know if he had a tonsure and then with youthful curiosity she looked to see what picture had interested him it was a small painting of the prodigal son but was evidently by no amateur the face of both father and son were admirably portrayed the strong syrian faces were mellowed by the ruddy gleams of sunset a tame kid was gambolling behind them and two women were grinding corn with the millstone between them on the flat white roof of the house another woman had just laid aside her distaff in a hurry the fathers arms with their gold bracelets were clasping the gaunt sharp shoulders of the starving youth olivia knew the picture well marcus had been very much struck with it it was good work he said the syrian faces were perfect types and he had made olivia notice the strong resemblance between father and son that is the mother i suppose had been her comment she has just caught sight of them there is a puzzled look in her eyes as she lays aside her distaff as though she is not quite sure that that wildlooking figure in sheepskin is her own longlost son it must be a grand thing to be an artist was marcuss reply to this goddard i do not know the name the picture is cheap too only pounds but i would wager any money that it was painted in syria olivia stole a second glance at the old man but he never moved then she shivered and walked faster it was bitterly cold a miserable afternoon for marcus who was visiting his poor patients in the squalid back streets and slums that fringed brompton mayfield villas were about ten minutes walk from galvaston terrace the villas had verandahs and long narrow gardens but most of them had lodgings to let mrs broderick and her maid occupied the first floor at number six the drawingroom and back bedroom belonged to the invalid and deborah had a tiny room close by her mistress the other room had been converted into a kitchen none of the rooms were large but they were wellfurnished and thoroughly comfortable during her husbands lifetime mrs broderick had been comfortably off and had had a good housethe carved bookcases turkeycarpet and deep easychairs and a few proofengravings handsomely framed all spoke of better days when olivias foot sounded on the stairs a tall hardfeatured woman came out of the kitchen i knew it was you she said come in my mistress is just wearying for you she never sleeps in daylight and it is illreading and working in the fading light i will soon have the tea ready i have been baking some scones olivia sniffed the warm perfume delightedly she was hungry oh so hungry although two hours had not elapsed since dinnertime and debs scones with sweet fresh country butter was ambrosial food dont let deb keep you with her chatter come ben my woman as my poor fergus would have said the voice was peculiarly youthful and melodious the timbre exquisite in modulation and volume but the face belonged to a woman aged more by pain and trouble than years madge broderick had never been a handsome woman her nose was too long and her skin too sallow for beauty but her bright eyes and a certain gracefulness of figure and her beautiful voice had been her charms fergus broderick a rough scotchman with a tongue as uncouth as his native dales had fallen in love with her at their first meeting he had been invited to dine at the house of the senior partner in whose employ he was and as the awkward bashful young scotchman entered the firelit room a clear laugh from amongst a group of girls gathered round the hearth penetrated like music to his ear parting is such sweet sorrow said the voice with much pathos that i could say goodbye until the morrow those are your sentiments katie are they not hush madge here is mr broderick waiting for us to speak to him and the daughter of the house rose with a laugh to greet him when the lamps were lighted fergus broderick had scanned all the girlish faces with furtive eagerness he had felt a shock of disappointment when the owner of the exquisite voice had revealed her identity madges long nose and sallow skin were no beauties certainly nevertheless before the evening was over fergus broderick knew he had found his mate and for eight blissful years madge dwelt in her womans kingdom and gathered more roses than thorns her first trouble had been the loss of her boy he had succumbed to some childish ailment her husbands deaththe result of an accidenthad followed a few months later the strain of the long nursing and excessive grief had broken down madge brodericks strength the seeds of an unsuspected disease latent in her system now showed itself and for some two or three years her sufferings both mental and physical would have killed most women then came alleviation and the lull that resembles peace the pain was no longer so acute the disease had reached a stage when there would be days and even weeks of tolerable comfort then madge courageously set herself to make the most of her life with a courage that was almost heroic she divided and subdivided the hours of each dayso many duties so many hours of recreation she had her charity work her fancy work her heavy and light reading books and flowers were her luxuries the newest books the sweetest flowers were always to be found on the table beside her couch madge often said laughingly that she lived in a world of her own but i have very good society she would add the best and wisest of all ages give me their company this morning i was listening to platos dialogues and this afternoon sir edwin arnold was entertaining me at the maple club in tokio this eveningwell please do not think me frivolous but affairs at rome and a certain prince saracinesca claim my attention a good novel puts me in a better humour and disposes me to sleep you know she would finish brightly that i always read aloud to fergus in the evening we were going through a course of thackeraywe were in the middle of philip on his way through the world when the accident happened after that he could only bear a few verses or a psalm chapter iii aunt madge it is more delightful and more honourable to give than receiveepicurus most people thought it a strange thing that mrs broderick spoke so constantly of her husband mrs tolman the vicars wife who was a frequent visitor had been scandalised more than once and had expressed herself rather strongly on the subject to her husband i know you think very highly of poor mrs broderick stephen and so do i she remarked one day very few women would bear things in that quiet uncomplaining way and the amount of work she gets through is astonishing but that perpetual dragging in of her husbands name seems to me such bad taste upon my word isabella i cannot say that i agree with you and the vicar straightened himself on the rug in his favourite attitude he was a heavy ponderous man with an expression of shrewd good sense on his face that won peoples confidence i wish other women were as faithful to their husbands memory that flighty little mrs martin for example my dear stephen what an absurd idea fancy talking of lydia martin every one knows she is making a dead set at mr germaine although poor jack martin has hardly been dead a year she is mrs brodericks exact opposite please do not misunderstand me in this tiresome way and here mrs tolman frowned slightly it is the manner in which mrs broderick speaks of her husband that offends my tastes in my opinioncompressing her lips as she spokeour departed dear ones are sacred and should not be mentioned in a secular manner at the word secular there was a twinkle in the vicars eyes though he held his peace and to tell the truth mrs tolman had been unable to find the expression she needed but with mrs broderick it is fergus here and fergus there just as though he were alive and in the next room and she was expecting him in every moment sometimes in the twilight it makes me quite creepy to hear her speaking in that sprightly voice just as though she were making believe that he heard her poor soul was the vicars answer to this but he was used to keeping his thoughts to himselfhe and mrs broderick understood each other perfectly she had not a firmer friend in the world unless it was her kind physician dr randolph poor soul he repeated when his wife in silent dudgeon had retired from the room it is not likely that isabella would understand her mrs broderick is the bravest and the brightest woman i know and yet the furnace was heated sevenfold for her make believe that he is alive why he has never been dead to her it is her vivid faith and her vivid imagination that has helped her to live all these years instead of lying there a crushed wreck for people to patronise and pity and here again there was a wicked little twinkle in the vicars eyes did he not know his isabella and how good she was to those who would allow her to advise and lecture them mrs broderick has just laughed and put her foot down that is why isabella is always complaining of her they have not exactly hit it off and here the vicar laughed softly as he sat down to consider his sermon aunt madge how cosy you look exclaimed olivia as she stood on the threshold of the warm firelit room and then a swift transition of thought carried her back to the dismal little diningroom at galvaston terrace with its black smouldering fire and the damp clinging to the windowpanes and an involuntary shiver crossed her as she knelt down beside her aunts couch my dear livy you are a perfect iceberg exclaimed mrs broderick no you shall not kiss me again until you are warmer sit down in that easychair close to the fire where i can see you and take that handscreen for the good of your complexionnow deb bring the teathings like a good soul for mrs luttrell has made a poor dinner how could you guess that aunt madge are you a witch or a magician asked olivia in her astonished voice it was pure guesswork on mrs brodericks part but as usual her keen wits had grazed the truth olivia who had a healthy girlish appetite had risen from the midday meal almost as hungry as when she had sat down the dish of hashed mutton had been small and if olivia had eaten her share martha would have fared badly a convenient flowerpot a gift from aunt madge had prevented marcus from seeing his wifes plate olivia who had dined off potatoes and gravy was already faint from exhaustion as usual she confessed the truth it was my fault aunt madge she said basking like a blissful salamander in the warm glow i ought to have known the meat would not go round properly but happily marcus did not notice or else there would have been a fuss he and martha dined properly and i mean to enjoy my tea but mrs brodericks only answer was to ring her handbell deb boil two of those nice newlaid eggs that mrs broughton sent me mrs luttrell has had no dinner if the scones are ready we will have tea at once and as deborah nodded and vanished she shook her head a little sadly olive dear it wont pay you are not the sort of person who can safely starve i thought there was something wrong about you when you came in you had a peaky underfed look oh i thought so as the tears rose to olivias eyes now i am not going to say another word until you have had your tea look at zoe she thinks you are in trouble about something and wants to lick your face is not the sympathy of a dumb creature touching they dont understand what is wrong but they see plainly that their human friend is unhappy come to me zoe and i will explain matters it is not much of a trouble olive is not really miserable she is only cold and hungry and weak and wants petting and cosseting i think i am rather unhappy aunt madge returned olivia in a sad voice things are getting worse and marcus looks so careworn he was talking in his sleep last night we have so little money leftonly just enough for six months rent and the coals and ever so little for housekeeping and no patients come and now i have made up my mind to tell him tonight that martha must go my dear olivia we talked that over a few weeks ago and we decided then that you had better keep her yes aunt madge i know but indeed indeed we cannot afford her foodthese growing girls must be properly fed and the amount of bread and butter she eats would astonish deb and here olivia heaved a harassed sigh well well we will talk it over againand then deb brought in the teathings and the scones and the newlaid eggs and as mrs broderick sipped her tea it did her kind heart good to see how her niece enjoyed the good things before her there now you feel ever so much better she said when the meal was finished now we can talk comfortably i have been thinking over what you have said and i suppose you are right from your point of view and that if you cannot afford marthas food she must go but i have been thinking of marcus he is at the turningpoint of his career everything depends on his making a practice when patients send for him and they will send for him byandby do you think it will look well for his wife to open the door to them but aunt madge olive you were always a good honest little girl and you have grown up an honest woman you want to do your duty and slave for marcus and dot and you have begun nobly by starving yourself until you are on the verge of an hysterical attack but we must think of marcus martha must not go at least not until the winter is over i have been saving a few pounds for your christmas present i meant you to have had a new dress and jacket and a few other little things you needed but if you like to pay marthas wages with it until easter you can please yourselfonly take it and say no morewhat crying again what nonsense as though i may not give my own niece a little present it is the goodness and the kindness returned olivia with a low sob aunt madge why are you so good to me you have saved all this and you have so little to spareas though i do not know what a small income you really have it is a very respectable income and my dear fergus worked hard to make it i never professed to be a rich woman but i have everything i want if people would only cut their coat by their cloth as fergus used to say there would be less distress in the world well my wants are few i have no milliners bills here there was a gleam of fun in the invalids eyes no smart bonnets or fashionable mantles needed at this establishment only just a cosy teagown now and then when the old one is too shabby come olive are you not going to count your money and then olivia emptied the contents of the little purse on her lap well as the slim fingers sorted the gold and silver will there be enough for marthas wages until easter yes indeed aunt madge and there will be some over i can buy the stuff for babys winter pelisse without troubling marcus and do you know knitting her brows in careful calculation i do believe that with a little contrivance and management i can get some new trimming for my sunday hat and a pair of chevrette gloves good chevrette gloves are dear but they wear splendidly and a pair would last me most of the winteryes her eyes brightening i am sure i could do it it does fret marcus so to see me shabby mrs broderick nodded in a sympathising wayshe knew the joy of these small economies and contrivances the little purse of savings had not been gathered together without some selfdenial but as she saw the lovely rainbow smile on olivias face she felt that she had her reward this is my redletter day she said quaintly it is always a redletter day when i can really help someone i have my blackletter days when i can do nothing special when it is all noughts and crosses in my diary i have had my christmas treat beforehand and i shall be quite happy till bedtime thinking about dots pelisse and the new hattrimming bythebye what colour is the pelisse to be blue baby is so fair and blue suits her best i think i shall get some cottonbacked velvet just to trim iti must not dream of fur how would miniver look round the cape and neck i have two or three yards in very good condition deb picked it off my wadded satin mantle years ago i was keeping it for some special occasion if you buy a really good cashmere and trim it with my old miniver dot will have a grand pelisse and then mrs broderick hunted in her keybasket for a certain key and instructed her niece to unlock a drawer in her wardrobe it was growing late by this time and olivia was obliged to take her leave marcus had promised to be back by seven and it was six oclock now but as she walked briskly through the quiet streets she felt as lighthearted as a child what a happy evening she and marcus would spend there would be no need now to tell him about martha or to beg him to give her the few shillings for dots pelisse he should have a nice tea aunt madge had made her take a couple of the newlaid eggs and a pot of debs delicious marmalade home with her and she knew how marcus would enjoy the little treat dear aunt madge how i love her i think she is the very best woman in the world but here olivia gave a surprised start she had reached the printshop at the corner of harbut street and in the strong glare of the gaslamp she distinctly saw the tall bent form of her mysterious neighbour he was coming out of the shop and walking stiffly and with difficulty in the direction of his house she had never known him out so late before his afternoon walk was always timed for him to be back by four she glanced at the shop window but there was no picture of the prodigal son to be seen had he bought it was this the reason why he was out so late olivia felt a little anxious as she noticed how feebly he walked the greasy pavements were rather slippery and galvaston terrace was not a welllighted thoroughfare perhaps it was nonsense but she would not enter her house until she had seen him safely across the road and within the lionguarded portals it was just kindly womanly instinct but all her life long olivia was glad that she had yielded to that impulse she was still standing upon the step and the old man was nearly across the road when she saw him slip a piece of orangepeel on the curb had escaped him in the darkness and he had put his foot on the slippery substance olivia gave a quick exclamation as she saw him try to recover his balance and then fall forward rather heavily no one was passing just then and happily the road was clear of vehicles olivia ran across and picked up his stick then she took him by the arm and helped him to rise i trust you have not hurt yourself she said anxiously please do not be afraid of leaning on me i am very strong ah as the old man uttered a groan you have injured yourself in some way the curb is rather steep just here it is my ankle but i must get home somehow you are very good madam if you will allow me to take your arm i think i can manage those few yards i live there pointing to the grim doorway yes i know mr gaythorne of galvaston house we are neighbours of yours and i have seen you come out of the house frequently shall i ring the bell for you and perhapshesitating a little as though she were taking a libertyyou will allow me to go as far as the halldoor with you but to her alarm the old man suddenly stood still it was pitchy dark under the overhanging trees and only a faint gleam from a large bow window showed her the length of the gardenpath that they would have to traverse i can do no more he said faintly i believe i have broken my ankle mrs crampton and the maids must find some way of getting me in perhaps madam you will be so good as to explain the matter to them i see the door is open and olivia at once left him and went up to the house your master has met with a slight accident she said to the astonished maid he has fallen and hurt his foot and it is quite impossible for him to walk up to the house he mentioned mrs crampton perhaps you will ask her what is to be done and the girl a goodnatured buxom country lass at once ran off olivia stood patiently for a few minutes the hall with its handsome rugs and blazing fire looked delightfully inviting a lean old hound stretched on a tiger skin turned its head and then rose stiffly and came towards her as its slender nose touched her dress she saw the poor thing was blind the next moment a cheerfullooking greyhaired woman hurried towards her followed by two maids what is it that phoebe tells me maam mr gaythorne has met with an accident times out of number i have begged and prayed him not to go out alone but he was not to be persuaded he is down there by the gate the trees hide him returned olivia hastily i think it would be best to take an armchair if you think we could carry him in he is in dreadful pain and cannot walk a step farther phoebe tell cook to light the lantern and then you two girls bring one of the study chairsthe lantern first mind now maam perhaps we had better find my master and the lasses will follow us there are four of us and mr gaythorne is not so very heavy and we will have him on the library couch in no time chapter iv dr luttrells first patient sudden the worst turns the best to the bravebrowning olivia felt as if she were dreaming as she followed the little procession down the dark gardenpath once she pinched her wrist slightly to assure herself that she was awake mrs crampton held the lantern and the cook and the two maids carried the armchair with jolting uneven footsteps that brought a suppressed groan to mr gaythornes lips as they lifted him on the couch he looked so white that olivia thought he was going to faint and begged the housekeeper to give him some wine he was evidently in severe pain it would be better not to touch the foot until the doctor comes she observed and then mrs crampton looked perplexed my master does not hold with doctors maam i dont remember one ever crossing the threshold since poor miriam had typhoid fever the foot is swelling already and it will be a job to get the boot off ah i thought soas mr gaythorne winced and motioned her awayhe will be afraid of one touching it my husband lives just oppositethe corner house with the red lamp in harbut street he is a doctor and very clever and i am nearly sure that he is in just now olivia spoke a little breathlessly and anxiously then she bent over the old man if mrs crampton does not know of another doctor would you mind one of the maids running across the road for dr luttrell you are suffering so much and your foot ought to be treated at once it is impossible for any one to know if it be only a sprain until the boot is removed you fell so heavily that perhaps a small bone might be broken yessendsend returned the invalid irritably clear the room crampton you know that i hate to have a parcel of women round methere is no need for you to go madamwith an attempt at civility as olivia was about to withdraw at this plain speaking give the lady a chair phoebe but olivia who had excellent tact only smiled pleasantly and shook her head i think it will be best for me to send the doctor across there is nothing that i can do for you until he comes she took the old mans hand as she spoke and pressed it gently i am so sorry to leave you in such pain but i hope you will soon be relieved perhaps you will not mind my inquiring another day but a stranger is only in the way tonight olivias soft wellmodulated voice was so full of kindly sympathy that mr gaythorne opened his weary eyes again thank you was all he said but he watched her keenly as she crossed the long room olivia walked so quickly that she was almost out of breath when she reached her own door the diningroom looked cold and comfortless martha was on her knees before the fireplace trying to revive the blackened embers with the help of the kitchen bellows and dr luttrell with a tired face and puckered brow was watching the proceedings somewhat impatiently a tallow candle was guttering uncomfortably on the table is the fire out oh marcus i am so sorry but martha and i will soon put things to rights will you go across to galvaston house at once pleaseand here olivias voice was full of suppressed excitement mr gaythorne has slipped against the curb and hurt his foot he is in great pain i have been helping him and then i said i would send you i have left the gate open so you can just go up to the door marcus listened to these details with an astonished face then he caught up his black bag and nodded acquiescence the tired frown left his face and he moved away with his quiet professional step olivia watched him from the doorstep as she closed the door after him she could have clapped her hands with sheer delight and excitement it was her doing that marcus had his first patient those foolish maids would never have thought of sending for him dot was awake and singing to herself in her usual chuckling fashion in the firelight but olivia had no time to play with her pet the bellows are no good martha she said quickly you must just fetch a bundle of sticks and a newspaper and relay the fire while i kindle the lamp and set the table for tea the room feels like a vault there is a good fire in the kitchen maam if you want to make toast observed martha rising reluctantly from her knees i have been ironing miss babys pinnys olivia who was drawing the heavy curtain across the window was relieved to hear this in another quarter of an hour the little room wore a more cheerful aspect the sticks crackled and blazed lustily the greenshaded lamp diffused a mellow light the teatray was set and the plate of french toast was frizzling gently on a brass trivet at the sound of her masters footstep martha had orders to fill up the teapot and boil the eggs after this olivia played with dot and undressed her and then brought her in to say goodnight to her father but she waxed sleepy long before he let himself in with his latchkey marcus paused on the threshold a moment as though something struck him olivias face looked fair and sweet as she sat in her low chair with the sleepy child in her arms she put back her head with a soft questioning smile as he bent down to kiss her face dot is nearly asleep but i had not the heart to put her in her cot until you had seen her tea is quite ready and martha is boiling some newlaid eggs aunt madge has sent you too a pot of her homemade marmalade because she knows how fond you are of it sit down and begin i shall not be a moment and olivias voice was so full of suppressed excitement that marcus laughed as he drew his chair to the table he was tired and hungry but he no longer felt impatient and depressed now tell me everything she exclaimed when she came back what have you done was the foot very bad will you have to go to galvaston house again rather returned marcus it is a pretty bad sprain i can tell you why i should not be surprised if mr gaythorne is laid up for the next two or three weeks he is not in good condition and the shaking and fright have upset him he will want good nursing and plenty of attention as i told his housekeeper i am going again early in the morning and was he civil to you mrs crampton says he hates doctors and olivias tone was a trifle anxious well he was a bit grumpy at first but i had my work to do and took no notice but when i had helped him upstairs and put him comfortable for the night he waxed a shade more gracious and thanked me quite civilly i fancy he is a character and has lived so long alone that he has grown morose and unsociable that blind hound of his followed us upstairs and would not leave him did you notice him livy yes and is it not a nice house marcus that library is a beautiful room all those hundreds of wellbound books and the massive oak furniture i had not time to notice things but i could not help feeling how deliciously soft and warm the carpets felt to ones feet and then those lovely rugs and skins in the hall his bedroom was just as luxurious mr gaythorne is evidently a rich man though he keeps no carriage mrs crampton told me so he is very fond of flowers there is a sort of conservatory on the first floor full of beautiful plants and an alcove where he can sit and enjoy them i could not help stopping a moment to admire them but mrs crampton did not invite me to go in you may depend upon it the old gentleman is a strict martinet and rules his household with a rod of iron mrs crampton seems a good creature but he spoke pretty sharply to her once or twice but he was in such pain marcus yes my dear i know that oh bythebye he sent his compliments to you i am greatly indebted to mrs luttrell and i trust that i shall soon have an opportunity of thanking her properly for her kind helpfulness there livy now we shall hear no more of the nihilist or the roman priest dr luttrell was in spirits it was easy to see that the first patient the first brief the first bookaye and the first love what a halo remains round them our firstfruits may be immature unripe but to us they have a goodly flavour a subtle sweet aroma of their own all through his successful life dr luttrell will look back to this evening as the turningpoint of his career when he stood cold and tired watching marthas bellows and his wifes voice with a triumphant ring in it had called to him from the threshold marcuss first piece of good luck had so absorbed them that it was some time before olivia remembered to tell him about aunt madges present marcus forgot to go on with his tea when he saw the little heap of coins in his wifes hand marthas wages dots pelisse and even the gloves and new hattrimming were all duly canvassed when marcus said abruptly aunt madge is a trump his glistening eyes were eloquent enough they had so much to discuss that it was nearly bedtime before he offered to go on with the book he was reading aloud but after all they were neither in the mood for other peoples stories in youth life is so interesting no chapters of past memories no wide experiences are so beguiling and absorbing oh we lived then how often we hear that phrase as the old man looks back over a long life to the time when lads love filled his days with sunshine when marcus lay awake that night there was no deadly coldness at his heart no lurking demon of despondency waiting for the small dark hours to assail him on the contrary hope with seraph wings fanned him blissfully marcus luttrell was young but he was no coward for two years he had waited patiently until the tide should turn wait till the clouds roll by he used to say cheerily but only his wife guessed how he was really losing heart as day after day and month after month passed and no paying patients presented themselves at the corner house at galvaston terrace olivia was at the window the following morning with dot in her arms as dr luttrell with his shabby black bag crossed the road he looked back once and dot kissed her dimpled hand to him olivia who admired her husband with all her honest girlish heart watched eagerly until the slight wellbuilt figure passed between the stone lions if he were only a little olderlooking she thought regretfully but his smooth face and fair hair gave him a boyish look it was absurd of course but she could settle to nothing until he came back but marcus who had a bad accident case on his mind was in too great a hurry to satisfy his wifes curiosity the foot was going on as well as he expected but mr gaythorne was unable to leave his bed he was going again in the evening and now he must be off to the model lodginghouse to see if the poor fellow had pulled through the night olivia had planned out her morning she had her marketing to do and her purchases to make then it was only right to go round and tell aunt madge of the wonderful piece of good fortune that had befallen them mrs broderick was unfeignedly pleased still olive she remarked with commendable prudence one swallow does not make a summer no aunt madge of course not but as marcus says one patient brings others galvaston house is a big place and when the neighbours see him going in and out it will be a sort of testimonial besides i shall quote debs favourite proverb every mickle makes a muckle now i really must go for i want to cut out dots pelisse and the dinner olive are you sure it will go round today then olivia laughed in a shamefaced way yes indeed i have been dreadfully extravagant and we are going to have steaks and chips because it is marcuss favourite dish and martha does it so well there is a whole pound of steak and just a little over i saw it cut myself and it was such good weight and hesitating a little there are currant dumplings too comethis is feasting indeed but aunt madge smiled a little sadly when she found herself alone does olive half realise how happy she is she said to herself she is a rich woman in spite of all her poverty and cares when one has youth and love and health and a good conscience every day is a feast and a delight one day marcus will drive in his carriage and pair he is a clever fellow and there is real grit in him and people will find it out they always do and olive will wear silk dresses and get stout with prosperity and good living but i doubt if she will be quite as happy as she is todaycutting out dots pelisse and enjoying her daydreams and very probably mrs broderick was right marcus was more communicative that evening when he returned from his second visit to galvaston house mr gaythorne was not exactly an ideal patient he had a will and a temper of his own and already his opinion clashed with his doctors marcus had laid great stress on perfect rest he wished his patient to remain in bed for the next two or three days but mr gaythorne perversely refused to do anything of the kind he would put on his dressinggown and lie on the couch he hated bed in the daytimeit made him nervous and spoilt his nights sleep i shall have to give in to him went on marcus a little irritably if i were in good practice i should just throw up the case my good sir i should say if you will not follow my directions it will be useless for me to prescribe for you my professional reputation is at stake and i cannot stand by and see you retard your cure cant you fancy me saying it livyand marcus tossed back his wave of hair in his old boyish way yes dear but people will soon find out what a splendid doctor you are and so that poor glazier in the models will recover you think yes i hope so the chances are in his favour poor chap it was hard lines crashing through the roof of that conservatory if i had not been on the spot he would have bled to death before they could have got him to a hospital you might go and see them livy they are decent people she is a pleasant hardworking young woman and they have two little children and the place is as clean as possible i told mr gaythorne about them just to amuse him but he only grunted and looked bored bytheway you are right in one of your surmiseshe has bought your favourite picture of the prodigal son it was on a chair beside his bed and he consulted me as to where he could have it hung i was going to suggest over the mantelpiece but then i saw there was a large picture there with a silk curtain over it that must be his wifes picture marcus how nice of him to have curtains over it very nice if we could be sure that mr gaythorne has been married and had a wife he returned a little dryly but i should not be surprised to find that he was an old bachelor he is far too fussy and precise for a widower but my dear child we are getting into very gossiping ways and i must really get on with that book aunt madge lent us and then olivia consented to hold her tongue and let him read aloud to her as usual chapter v a visit to galvaston house he who knows how to speak knows also when to speakplutarch the next morning as olivia sat at work with dot on the rug at her feet playing with a limp furry monkey over which she was gurgling and cooing like a baby dove dr luttrell entered the room there was a pleased look on his face olive he said look what mr gaythorne has given me for poor jack travers and he held a fivepound note before his wifes eyes dont you think we owe him a handsome apology for calling him a miser it does not do to judge by appearances in this world mr gaythorne is eccentric and a trifle cantankerous but he is not stingy illustration olive look what mr gaythorne has given me jack travers is that the poor man in the models oh marcus how splendid of him to give all that it will be quite a fortune to the poor things yes it will pay their rent until travers gets about again he is not going to die this journey was it not liberal of the old fellow but if you had only seen the way he gave it to me as though he were ashamed of the whole thing that is for the man you told me about last night he said in quite a grumpy voice and he had hardly seemed as though he had listened yesterday and he would not let me thank him he turned testy at once bythebye livy he wants you to go and see him you have evidently won his heart my dear if mrs luttrell has half an hours leisure i shall be pleased to see her those were his very words i hope you told him that it would be rather difficult to find leisure with all my numerous engagements returned olivia saucily but that i would do my best for him how many callers have we had since we were married marcus let me see the vicar and mrs tolman oh and one day mrs tolman brought a friend i remember how excited i was that afternoon and that horrid little sarah jane had her sleeves rolled up to her elbows when she opened the door and i dared not offer them tea because i knew she would never have had boiling water oh yes continued olivia merrily i will look over my visiting list and see how i am to squeeze in a call at galvaston house what hour do you think would suit him best marcus then dr luttrell who had been much amused by his wifes drollery gravely considered the point about three oclock i should say i think he wants to show you his flowers he is going to have his couch wheeled into the conservatory or his winter garden as he calls it why should you not go across this afternoon now i must be off to the models and as olivia took up her work again there was a soft flush on her cheek and a happy look in her eyes as she listened to his light springing tread dear marcus she said to herself how pleased he is about this it has done him good already oh how i hope mr gaythorne will take a fancy to him he is rich and liberal i am sure of that he will pay marcus well and perhaps before long someone else will send for him what dot my sweet must i love jacko too as dot laid her treasure on her mothers lap when olivia rang at the bell of galvaston house that afternoon the same rosycheeked maid admitted her if you will step into the library a minute maam she observed i will tell mrs crampton and olivia was left alone in the beautiful room she remembered so well a bright fire burned cheerily on the hearth and the blind hound lay on the rug he came up to olivia and thrust his slender nose into her hand in a friendly fashion it was in this room that mr gaythorne evidently passed his days the tables bore signs of his numerous occupations one table seemed loaded with books of reference a pile of neatly written manuscripts were on the escritoire portfolios of engravings and a microscope on a pedestal stand occupied one corner and a small inner room seemed full of cabinets and cases of stuffed birds and butterflies mr gaythorne was evidently a collector and a man of culture the volumes in the carved oak bookcases were mostly bound in russian calf olivia had only time to read a few titles when mrs crampton appeared her comely face had a pleased smile on it mr gaythorne will be extremely obliged if you will step upstairs and see him maam she said civilly he has been wheeled into the conservatory my master thinks a deal of his flowersbooks and flowersthey are his main amusements when his cough keeps him from going out oh you must come too eros of course as the hound followed them closely galvaston house had been built in rather an unusual fashion a conservatory had been thrown out at the back of the first floor landing and ran along one side of the house forming a sort of verandah to the lower rooms as mrs crampton opened the glass door the warm fragrant air met them deliciously at the farther end mr gaythorne lay on a couch under a tall palm with an oriental quilt thrown over him his dark crimson dressinggown and black velvet cap gave him a picturesque appearance with his white peaked beard and moustache and his dark sunken eyes he would have passed for a venetian doge the mass of brilliant bloom and the warm flowerscented air made olivia slightly giddy this is very kind of you mrs luttrell observed mr gaythorne in a slow precise voice as she stooped over him and took his hand crampton bring a chair for the lady i have been wanting to thank you for your kind assistance that unlucky evening i told the doctor so and he has been good enough to give you my message indeed i did very little returned olivia in her mellow voice you seemed so feeble that i could not help watching you cross the road and then you slipped and i felt you had hurt yourself i fear from what my husband tells me that it will be some little time before you will be able to get out again so he says and he threatens me with crutches returned the old man grimly but as i seldom cross the threshold in winter i need not trouble myself about that are you fond of flowers mrs luttrell as olivias eyes wandered to the splendid exotics round her crampton shall cut you some presently my library and my winter garden form my entire world now and you live among all these lovely things observed olivia almost in a tone of awe oh if only aunt madge could see these flowers she spoke impulsively without considering her words and blushed a little when she saw mr gaythorne lift his eyebrows cynically i was only thinking of my aunt mrs broderick she said apologetically she is such a sad invalid she has never been out once since uncle fergus died and that is ever so many years ago and she suffers such dreadful pain sometimes the doctors say her complaint is incurable and she is not at all old she lives all alone with her maid and never goes beyond her two rooms and yet no one hears her complain mrs broderick must be a wonderful person she beats job returned mr gaythorne with a cynical curl of his lip but olivia was too much engrossed with her subject to notice it oh she is wonderful she returned earnestly i never met any one like her she is the bravest woman i know even the vicar says so dont you love pluck mr gaythorne so few people are plucky in that sense aunt madge has lost everything she cares forhusband and child and health but she bears it all so beautifully and makes the best of things i could not help thinking of her when i saw all those lovely flowers she simply dotes on flowers there are always some on her little table flowers and books those are her sole pleasures what on earth made you hold forth on aunt madges virtues you absurd child was marcuss comment when olivia repeated this portion of her conversation fancy entertaining mr gaythorne with an account of your relationsand olivia blushed guiltily it does sound odd if you put it in that way marcus she returned but when i saw all those beautiful flowers aunt madge just jumped into my head and i always do speak out my thoughts so but i could see he was interested he said little sharp sneering things at first but afterwards he questioned me a good deal oh we got on splendidly he began asking me about ourselves and if you had much of a practice oh he said it quite nicely as marcus dropped the loaf he was cutting and frowned anxiously he was quite gentlemanly and only hinted at things but i understood him of course and you told him i suppose that he was my first patient in an annoyed tone you may as well own it livy you are honest enough even for that and there was no denying that marcuss voice was decidedly sarcastic with all her virtues olivia never did know when to hold her tongue oh marcus dear how could i help it replied olivia nervously of course i had to tell him that we were just beginners and how dr slade had deceived us that there was no redress as he was dead but i told him too how hard you worked among the poor he did not say much i dont think he is a great talker but he stroked that funny beard of his and nodded his head then when mrs crampton came up he told her to bring coffee and he made me stay and pour it out for him there was such a lovely chased coffeepot and creamjug and such delicious cakes and when i said at last that i must go he thanked me quite pleasantly it is long since i have been so well amused and i hope you will come and see me again yes he said that marcus so i am sure he did not mind my frankness but oh dear he quite forgot to tell mrs crampton to cut me some flowers you need not expect any flowers now returned her husband impatiently you have done for yourself and me too i expect a beginner you said livy and you a sensible woman when i go this evening i have no doubt i shall be civilly told that a second opinion will be desirable my dear girl dont you know that a modest reticence a judicious silence is sometimes the safest policy a professional beggar may whine and show his sores but a needy doctor out at elbows must wear a good appearance but olivia who was on the verge of tears from sheer vexation at her own impulsiveness did not seek to defend herself if she had imperilled marcuss professional reputation by her carelessness she felt she should never hold up her head again but marcus who was tired and a little out of humour was not disposed to comfort her he had had a worrying day among his poor patients the one bright spot had been his visit to the models when jack travers had sobbed and broken down in the attempt to speak his gratitude and now just as they were getting on so well olivias want of tact and that terribly honest tongue of hers had spoilt everything was it likelywas it within the bounds of possibilitythat a man of the worlda rich man toowould be content with the services of an unknown practitioner if he put himself in mr gaythornes place he knew that he should be disposed to request dr bevan to call it was not only a sprained ankle mr gaythorne was an ailing man and needed medical care marcus who was clever and quickwitted had already formed a pretty correct diagnosis of the case there is mental as well as physical trouble he had said to himself the previous evening and with professional reticence he had kept this opinion to himself but he was already deeply interested in his patient so much was at stake and their fortunes were at so low an ebb that marcus might be pardoned for his unusual touchiness yet when he left the room without further remark olivias heart sank within her why could i not have held my tongue she thought with tardy repentance what could have induced me to talk so much but mr gaythorne really seemed interested and somehow he encouraged me to go on if he had appeared bored or tired i should have stopped at once but he seemed so curious about aunt madge he even asked if she had a good doctor oh dear surely that is not marcus going out as the street door opened and now there were actual tears in olivias eyes in all the two years of their happy married life they had never had more than a momentary misunderstanding if a hasty word had been uttered by one of them the other had always an eager protest or a smooth answer ready when olivia had been impatient and captious marcus had only laughed and coaxed her into good humour again and even when he had indulged in a few sarcastic speeches olivias soft voice and ready acquiescence had avoided friction marcus often told her that they were a model couple and had earned the dunmow flitch over and over again but in reality their mutual respect and thorough understanding of each others salient points had conduced to this harmony that marcus should leave the house therefore without speaking to her alarmed olivia excessively she must have vexed him indeed if he could do such a thing as that and here one or two bright drops ran down on the blue pelisse she was actually crying like a scolded child when two or three minutes later the parlourdoor opened and marcus entered his face wore a queer expression and in each hand he held an exquisite bunch of hothouse flowers their perfume reached olivia before he laid them before her there olive he said i take back my words then as he caught sight of her tearstained face oh you foolish little woman you absurd child but his hand rested affectionately on her soft brown hair as she put back her head against him oh marcus i could not help crying to think i had vexed you so somehow it is the one thing i cannot bear to think my foolish tongue should have harmed you i was in an awful funk certainly returned marcus frankly but i never meant to bother you like that cheer up livy i daresay it is all right and i know you will be a model of discretion for the future arent you going to look at your flowers and then olivia did permit herself to be consoled think of his cutting all those lovely flowers for me she cried ecstatically is he not an old dear marcus but why two bouquets knitting her brows in a puzzled fashion you had better open that folded slip of paper suggested her husband sensibly it may explain matters and olivia took his advice mrs luttrell with mr gaythornes compliments was pencilled in a shaky hand and on the second slip almost illegibly for mrs luttrells aunt oh marcus how sweet of him and olivia looked almost lovely in her excitement and marcus agreed that he was a good old sort if you are going to write a note of thanks you must just hurry up as it is nearly time for me to go across and then olivia put the flowers in water and got out her writingcase chapter vi i remind you of someone the fire in the flint shows not till it be strucktimon of athens although marcus had other visits to pay and would not be back until quite late olivia sat up for him on pretence of finishing dots pelisse but to her disappointment he had very little to tell her on his return mr gaythorne had been tired and out of spirits and he had had no inducement to prolong his visit he had not read olivias note only placed it beside him perhaps he was a shade more civil than usual observed marcus dryly but his manners certainly want mending could you not illuminate that motto livy manners makyth man and we would frame it and give it him as a christmas present but olivia could not be induced to see the joke mr gaythorne was still an old dear and the perfume of his flowers was sweet to her marcus would have wondered if he had intercepted one of the searching glances that were reading him so acutely those deepset melancholy eyes could pierce like a gimlet sometimes a vivid blue light seemed to dart from them when master has one of his awful looks on i dare not face him phoebe would say and mrs crampton conscious as she was of rectitude and the claim of long and faithful service felt there were limitations to her intercourse with her master once and once only had she ventured on a tabooed subject and had retired from the room with her comely face quite pale with fear i thought he would have struck me she said to her confidante the middleaged housemaid or that he would have had a fit i should have one myself if i ever tried it on again but i never will rebecca i will take my oath of that master has an awful temper when he is drove wrong returned rebecca primly i dont wonder at mr alwyn myself i dont hold with keeping too tight a hand over a young man it fairly throttles all the goodness out of them he was none so bad that he would not have done better if only he had had a word of encouragement instead of all those flouts and jibes those are exactly my sentiments becky returned mrs crampton wiping her eyes with her snowyfrilled apron and having a boy of my own bless him i am a pretty fair judge tom was a pickle before he went to sea but neither his poor father nor me ever cast it at him he ran away and took the queens shilling though it nigh broke our hearts well he is a sergeant now and polly makes him a good wife and alls well that ends well but i must be looking after masters supper and mrs crampton bustled away to her duties olivia took her flowers round to aunt madge as soon as her household duties were done in the morning mrs broderick who had had a sleepless night of pain looked more worn and languid than usual but she brightened up at the sight of the flowers and poked her long nose into the heart of a rose with an air of rapt enjoyment but the next moment she frowned livy she said severely i am extremely angry how dare you be guilty of such extravagance even if it be my birthday dont i know what these exquisite flowers must have cost then olivias face fell a little oh aunt madge i had no idea it was your birthday and i have brought you nothing nothing at all do let me explain and then mrs broderick listened with much interest to olivias recital the flowers are even sweeter than i thought them she said presently and her face flushed a little i thought the day would be so blank and that i should just lie here missing fergus he always made such a fuss on my birthdays they were redletter days to him and now this friendly message has come to me give me my writingcase livy i must scrawl a few lines to your old gentleman and she refused to dictate the note to olivia my dear sir she wrote do you know what you have done you have given a poor invalid a very happy day your beautiful flowers have come to me like a lovely message of sympathy and goodwill from an unknown friend if you were ever sad and lonely if life has not always been easy to you it will sweeten your solitary hours to know that you have given enjoyment to a crippled sufferer today is my birthday the fortysixth milestone on my lifes journey during a long wakeful night of pain i have been counting up past blessings and the new day seemed a blank to me and then your flowers came and i thanked god and took courage dear sir i remain yours gratefully margaret broderick widow that was one of aunt madges fads one of her harmless little peculiarities to sign herself in that fashion there is so much in the word widow she would say if it were not for seeming odd or making people smile i would always sign myself ferguss widow instead of my proper name but nothing could induce her to send even a note without that curious signature olivia could not quite get over her grievance of forgetting aunt madges birthday it was so horrid of me she said with a long face but anyhow i will come to tea no dear not today returned mrs broderick quietly tomorrow deb and i will be delighted to welcome you and deb shall bake some shortbread and scones marcus might come too it is long since i saw him but why not today dear aunt madge persisted olivia rather curiously fergus and i always spent the day alone together and i keep up the custom still returned mrs broderick in a dreamy voice he never gave me his present until the evening and it was always such a grand surprise his last present to me was that revolving booktable how splendid i thought it and what a comfort it has been to me all these years dont look so serious livy i dont mean to be dull i never am but i like to fancy that on my birthday i have fergus near me still and nothing that olivia could say would shake her resolution olivia hesitated to repeat her visit to galvaston house and when she consulted marcus he advised her to wait a little we must not be too pushing i daresay one of these days mr gaythorne will send you another message he is rather ailing and out of sorts just now and inclined to bristle up at a word but though marcus laughed in this way he had not found his berth an easy one mr gaythorne was often irritable and the least contradictioneven the assertion of an opinionwould ruffle him once when marcus had proposed discontinuing his evening visits mr gaythorne had appeared quite affronted if i can afford to pay for medical advice i suppose i may be allowed to have it he had returned testily of course if your time is too valuable but marcus flushing at the covert sneer answered in his quick straightforward way i wish it were more valuable but as i have no wish to pick your pocket i thought it would be only honest to tell you that the evening visit is no longer necessary very well then we will regard it in the light of a luxury returned mr gaythorne a little less grimly bythebye dr luttrell i want to ask you if you will kindly let me have your account at the end of the month monthly payments are my rule if it will not inconvenience you marcus assured him he was quite ready to meet his wishes olivia who had few amusements often thought longingly of that beautiful winter garden and wished to revisit it she had described it so vividly and graphically to aunt madge that mrs broderick declared she could picture it exactly she was never weary of hearing her nieces description i feel as though my world were enlarged and that i had got a new friend she said one day and olivia was amused to hear that the faded flowers had been carefully pressed she was much delighted then when one raw foggy november morning marcus brought her a message mr gaythorne felt himself better and would be very pleased if mrs luttrell would give him an hour that afternoon her visit was a very pleasant one the yellow fog outside had been extremely depressing but as she stepped into the hall the whole house seemed brightly illuminated mr gaythorne who was on crutches met her at the head of the staircase he had discarded his dressinggown and wore a black velvet coat that became him still better the conservatory lighted up by lamps cunningly concealed among the foliage looked more like fairyland than ever and the deep easychairs with their crimson cushions were deliciously inviting her admiration seemed to gratify mr gaythorne and as he pointed out his favourite flowers and descanted on their habits and peculiar beauties olivia listened with such intelligent interest and asked such sensible and pertinent questions that he was drawn insensibly into giving her a botanical lesson they were so engrossed with their subject that it was almost an effort to break off when coffee was brought mrs crampton had sent up a profusion of dainty cakes and as olivia drank her coffee and feasted on the various delicacies the one drawback to her pleasure was that marcus was not there to share it at this present moment he was in some slum or other supplementing the labours of the overworked parish doctor how surprised dr luttrell would have been if he could have seen the transformation in his patients appearancethe lean cadaverous face had lost its fretful look the melancholy dark eyes had grown bright and vivid the slow precise voice had waxed animated and even eloquent as he discoursed learnedly on his floral treasures flowers butterflies and birds were his great hobbies and his magnificent collections had been gathered from all parts of the world he had been a great traveller in his early manhood i have been everywhere and seen everything he said once towards the end of the afternoon olivia had been much touched by a little incident she had asked him a question about a curious cactus if you will come with me my dear he had answered i could show you a better specimenand then a dull red had risen to his forehead excuse me mrs luttrell i forgot whom i was addressingandandyou but here he checked himself oh do finish your sentence she said in her bright persuasive voice you were going to say that i remind you of someoneand as he met her kind friendly glance his shy stiffness relaxed yes he said simply and a great sadness came into his eyes you remind me of my daughter that first evening when you spoke to me you reminded me of her then and you have lost her oh i am so sorry does it pain you to speak of her i should so like to know her name her name was olivia he returned slowly but we always called her olive she was born at beyrout under the syrian sun and in the land of grey olivetrees how strange what a curious coincidence returned young mrs luttrell softly that is my name too and marcus often calls me olive and i remind you of her yes olive spoke in just that brisk cheerful manner she was so full of life and energy she died of fever at romewe were staying there she was only twoandtwenty and she was to have been married that summer her poor mother never got over the shock before the autumn she had followed her oh how sadhow dreadfully sad observed olivia with tears in her eyes what a tragedy to live through and her poor lover too oh yes arbuthnot he was bitterly cut up he is a judge now and has a good wife but i doubt if he has ever forgotten olive she was no beauty but she had a way with her stayi will show you her picture poor man no wonder he looks melancholy thought olivia as he slowly hobbled away on his crutches how strange that i should remind him of her and that she should be olive too but when mr gaythorne returned and placed a beautiful miniature before her she could see no resemblance to herself in the dark sweet face of olive gaythorne no she was not beautiful but there was something wonderfully attractive and winning in her expression the eyes deepset like her fathers had a frank soft look your only childand you lost her murmured olivia sympathetically my only daughter corrected mr gaythorne in a tone so peculiar that olivia raised her eyes and then she felt a little frightened there was a curious pallor on mr gaythornes face which made it look like old ivory and his bushy eyebrows were drawn closely together it is a sweet facea dear face returned olivia hurriedly she was a little nervous over her mistake it is kind of you to show me this and i like to think her name was olive and then she closed the case reverently and put it back in his hands i must go now she said it has been such a lovely time and you have taught me so much will you send for me again when you want to see me i think that is best it would be such a pity for me to disturb you when you felt tired or disinclined for visitors you are my only visitor returned mr gaythorne in his old grim manner the vicars wifewhat is the womans nameforced her way in one day but i do not think her reception pleased her the vicar himself is an honest man i have given him a hint that he will be welcome if he comes alone but no bustling prying vicaress for me oh poor mrs tolman well she is a little officious as marcus calls her and i know she often sets aunt madges nerves on edge oh by the way i intend to send mrs broderick some more flowers will it be a trouble to you to take them or shall one of the lasses carry them straight to her house oh no please let me have the pleasure of taking them if you had only seen aunt madges delight she wrote me a pretty sort of note returned mr gaythorne but tell her not to do that again gratitude is for favours to come you may remind her of that does she always sign her name in that fashionmargaret broderick widow yes always it is one of aunt madges whimsies but you will never get her to alter it does not sound badly but it is certainly unique how would it answer if one were to follow her example john alwyn gaythorne widower and here mr gaythorne gave a short sardonic laugh marcus oh marcus exclaimed olivia coming into the room in her breezy fashion i have so much to tell you mr gaythorne is a widowerand he has lost his only daughter and her name was olivia and that is why he has taken to me because i remind him of her butchecking herself as she caught sight of her husbands faceyou have something to tell me too only that they sent for me from fairfax lodge that is that ivycovered house next to galvaston house a child taken suddenly with croup i have been there most of the afternoon then olivia clapped her hands with a little exclamation of delight marcuss tone had been quite cool and matteroffact but there was a glint of satisfaction in his eyes the tide had turned at last chapter vii blowing bubbles how pleasant it is to be acquainted with new and clever thingsaristophanes marcus certainly carried his head a little higher than usual that evening as for olivia she trod on air as she sat at her needlework later on waiting until marcus returned from his second visit to galvaston house her thoughts were busy about the future marcus would soon have a large practice it was all very well for aunt madge to be sententious and say that one swallow does not make a spring but already the second harbinger of good luck had put in an appearance there was no fear of parting with martha now before long olivia was building magnificent castles the house next door to galvaston house was to let it had a garden and a small conservatory and marcus had once remarked that it was just the house for a medical man the receptionrooms were good and there was a capital stable supposing we were ever rich enough to take kempton lodge she said to herself marcus threw back his head and indulged in a hearty laugh when he heard where his wifes imagination had landed her kempton lodgemy dear childwhy do you not suggest princes gate or belgravia my own thoughts had not gone further than a new greatcoat this winter i am afraid my old one is getting a little seedy and at this remark olivias airily constructed fabric dissolved into nothingness to blow bubbles is an enchanting pastime even with grownup children the big brightcoloured bubbles soar into the air and look so beautiful before they burst one is gone but another takes its place just as rainbowtinted and gorgeous there are people who blow endless bubbles until their lifes end who cannot be induced to discontinue the harmless pursuit life is so hard and dreary they say the wheels of drudgery are for ever turning and grinding let us sit in the sun a little and float our fairy balls what if they are dreams and never come to anything the dreams and the sunlight have made us happy there is plenty of time in which to do our work marcus laughed at his wifes fancies but he never crushed them ruthlessly poor little livy he thought why should she not build her air castles if they make her happy and perhaps after all who knows but marcus did not finish his sentence even to himself but the next day when he went to maybrick villas to fetch his wife home he had a good deal to say about his new patients i am in luck he said as he stood warming himself before the fire while the two women watched him i thought of course when they sent for me that it was because i was the nearest doctor and that perhaps their own medical man was engagedin an imminent case like that it is impossible to waitbut no it was nothing of the kind mrs stanwell told me herselfshe is such a nice little person livythat they have only been a few months at fairfax lodge and that before that they had lived in yorkshire being strangers in the place they were sadly perplexed on the subject of doctors until the nurse told her mistress that she had seen me going in and out of galvaston house and this decided mrs stanwell to send for me as i was able to do the child good they are ridiculously grateful i am likely to have another patient there mrs stanwell has an aunt living with her and she is ailing i have only taken a hasty diagnosis of the case but i am going again tomorrow i am half afraid the poor old lady is in a bad way it is a long lane that has no turning marcus observed aunt madge there you must take olive away she has been wearying the past halfhour to get back to dot but as they left her alone in the firelight she said to herself dear things how happy they look at their age life is so dreadfully exciting i believe myself marcus will get on he is really clever and never spares himself but i doubt if livy or i will ever be so interested in anyone as we are in marcuss first patient olivia would have indorsed this sentiment readily before long mr gaythorne became an important factor in her daily life the friendship between them ripened rapidly olivia kept to her resolution of never going to galvaston house unless she were specially invited but every three or four days a message from the old man reached her olivia whose only dissipation had been a weekly tea with aunt madge and a biannual call at the vicarage with or without tea according to mrs tolmans mood found these afternoons at galvaston house very stimulating at first she was sorry when mr gaythorne gave up sitting in the winter garden and ensconced himself in the library but she soon changed her opinion when he began to show her his curiosities and rare prints he had so much to tell her about the birds and butterflies in the museum as he called the inner room that the hours flew past as she listened to him and it was always with real regret that she took her leave when the time came for her to go home aunt madge and marcus find me so much more interesting ever since you have taken me in hand she said once i try and repeat all you tell me but of course i forget half very often marcus helps me to rememberhe has read so much on these subjects you see perhaps it was this artless speech that led to mr gaythorne showing marcus a case of curious insects and dr luttrell had been so fascinated so utterly engrossed that the old man much flattered had cordially invited him into the museum marcus who had still much time on his hands often spent a pleasant hour or two with his patient mr gaythorne lent him books and gave him choice brands of cigars olivia was highly delighted at these evident marks of favour but it troubled her that mr gaythorne never liked them to come together olivia was always invited pointedly when marcuss visit had been paid and now and then he would ask dr luttrell to have a chat with him after dinner once when olivia had ventured to hint her disapproval of this he had answered with unwonted irritability i like to take my pleasures singly mrs luttrell i am sorry if i keep you from your husband i am a selfish old misanthrope i am afraid but olivia alarmed by this decided acerbity hastened to assure him that her remark had meant nothing it is so natural of me to want marcus to share my pleasure she said so sweetly that mr gaythorne was mollified even marcus noticed a decided improvement in his patients manner he was less irritable and contradictory and was evidently grateful for the relief he had derived from his doctors treatment the bare civility with which he had at first tolerated marcus soon changed into greater cordiality dr luttrells intelligence could appreciate mr gaythornes culture and learning before long they were on the best of terms but it was olivia who was the prime favourite when olivias face appeared on the threshold mr gaythornes eyes brightened under their rugged brows and his voice insensibly softened to her and her only he showed his real self he has a strange complex nature she said once to her husband he is very reserved there are some things of which he never speaks he has not once mentioned his son i should not have known he had one only i saw the name of alwyn gaythorne in a book i thought your first name was john i said rather heedlessly so it is john alwyn he returned that book belonged to my son but his voice was so constrained that i did not venture to say more depend upon it there is a mystery there marcus perhaps alwyn the younger is a nihilist returned marcus in a teasing voice probably he is at portland at the present moment undergoing his sentence no wonder poor mr gaythorne is such a recluse but olivia refused to be entertained by this badinage i am quite in earnest she returned with a grave air so you need not trouble yourself to be ridiculous marcus why should he talk so much of his daughter and never mention his only son according to you he is almost as silent on the subject of his wife oh that is different she answered hastily he once said to me that he could never bear even to hear her name mentioned that it upset him so i was a happy man as long as she lived he said so sadly but it was all up with me when i lost her she was a peacemaker she always kept things smooth her name was olivia too poor old boy was marcuss irrelevant remark at this yes he is a strange mixture went on olivia thoughtfully he has an affectionate nature but he is hard too he could be terribly hard i am sure of that and then see how good he is to those poor traverses and to aunt madge could anyone be more generous and yet he is not liberal by nature that very day that he sent mrs crampton to the models with all those good thingsjellies and beeftea and chicken and actually two bottles of port winehe was as angry as possible with phoebe because she had broken his medicine glass mrs crampton had orders to deduct the price of the glass from her wages i always do that he said to me it teaches them to be careful but poor phoebe cried about it afterwards i call it real mean of master phoebe had said it is the first thing that ever i broke in this house and it was all through eros getting between my feet it is not the few pence i mind for we have good wages paid down on the day but i call it shabby of master to be down on a poor servantgirl like that his servants dont seem to love him went on olivia they serve him well because it is their interest to do so but even mrs crampton who has been with him twenty years does not dare to contradict him anyhow he is liberal to us returned marcus patting his waistcoat pocket for he had that morning received his first cheque marcuss first act had been to go to the coal merchant and order in a ton of excellent coal then he had gone home and told his wife in a peremptory tone to put on her hat and jacket i am going to take you to harvey and phelps to get a new dress and jacket he said severely i am not going to put up with that rusty old serge any longer and olivia had remonstrated in vain against such extravagance it was all very well to blow bubbles and furnish kempton lodge from garret to basement but when it came to spending marcuss first cheque marcus dear she said imploringly my old dress is quite tidy i put new braid round it yesterday and i would so much rather you got a new greatcoat even aunt madge noticed that your present one was dreadfully shabby of course i shall get a new coat too returned dr luttrell coolly then at the thought of this lavishness olivia was stricken dumb marcus made his purchases with great discretion the grey tweed and warm jacket to match suited olivias tall supple figure perfectlyhe had a momentary debate with himself before he ventured on a modest black straw hat with velvet trimmings but in the end the order was given oh marcus how could you exclaimed olivia who was at fever point by this time hold your tongue livy returned marcus goodhumouredly i mean my wife to be welldressed for once in her life now i must go to the tailors for that greatcoat there wont be much of mr gaythornes cheque left by the time i get home we shall want the balance for christmas groceries olivia groaned in spirit over marcuss recklessness but she could not bear to damp his enjoyment she unburdened her mind to mrs broderick the next day dont you think it would have been wiser to have put it by for a rainy day she said anxiously but aunt madge did not seem quite to share this opinion my dear she said shrewdly i think marcus knows what he is about it would never do for him to go to those good houses in a shabby greatcoat a little outlay is sometimes a good investment oh yes but i was thinking of the dress and jacket and that hat aunt madge ah well we must forgive marcus that extravagance it hurt his pride to see you calling at galvaston house in that old serge dress he is not really improvident livy you have enough in hand for present necessities and there will be something coming in next month oh dear yes and do you know aunt madge they have sent for marcus to attend the lodger at number seventeen he is a musicteacher and very respectable and can afford to pay his doctor so that is swallow number three then i am sure you can wear your new dress with an easy conscience and then olivias last scruples vanished olivia looked so distinguished in her grey tweed that marcus made her blush by telling her that she had never looked so handsome mr gaythorne gave her an odd penetrating glance when she entered the library i hardly knew you mrs luttrell he said dryly and then his manner changed and softened that was her favourite colour he said olive was always a grey bird she liked soft subdued tints she was a bit of a puritan i often told her so i am glad you like my new dress returned olivia simply my husband chose it for me he has such good taste you need not tell me that mrs luttrell and again olivia blushed like a girl at the implied compliment mr gaythorne was looking over a portfolio of watercolour paintings olivia had not yet seen them and she was full of outspoken admiration as mr gaythorne placed one after another before her they are all the work of a young artist who died at rome he said i bought them of his widow they are very well done he had great promise poor fellow if he had lived he would have done good work these were merely potboilers as he called themlittle things he painted on the spur of the moment to me they are perfectly beautiful returned olivia those two are so lovely that i could not choose between them please let me look at them a little longer mr gaythorne i want to tell aunt madge about them and olivia who was always charmingly natural in her movements propped her chin on her hands and looked long and earnestly at the pictures their beauty lay in the soft rich colouring and a certain suggestiveness in the subject one was a little grey church on a hillside the church was ruinous and out of repair the churchyard full of weeds and thistles a storm had just broken and an old shepherd in a ragged smock had taken refuge in the porch his roughlooking dog at his feet the bowed figure and knotted hands and the peaceful look in the wrinkled face were wonderfully striking the patient eyes turned upwards were gazing at the rainbow tis a love token i reckon were the words written underneath the sketch olivia could almost hear them through the parted lips ruins and thistles and weeds and a broken storm and beyond them the message of peace written on the bright tints of the rainbow for one simple heart to read aunt madge would understand that she said to herself she would like that picture best but this is just as beautiful to my mind the second sketch was equally suggestive it was a cornfield with poppies growing in it under the hedge in the cool shade lay a brown baby asleep a dish tied up in a blue handkerchief and a stone bottle lay beside the infant an old terrier kept watch over them both keeping watch and ward was the title of this picture it was certainly very well painted a breeze seemed rippling through the corn in the nook where the child lay there were festoons of honeysuckle and dogroses and long sprays of travellers joy the stumpy grey terrier sitting erect at his post of duty was full of significance and individuality the mother was evidently among the reapers in the far distance one would never be tired of looking at that cornfield observed olivia and though mr gaythorne smiled at her enthusiasm he would not spoil her enjoyment by pointing out to her one or two defects that he had already noticed byandby he called her to pour out the coffeemr gaythorne never indulged in afternoon tea this is not much like christmas weather he said looking out at the cold mizzling rain the forecasts promise a change however i suppose i must not ask if you dislike christmas it would not be a fair question at your age no indeed i love it dearly i have only had one sad christmasthe year dear mother diedit is my birthday too that makes it doubly festive i am so glad i was born on such a beautiful day that is why my second name is noel and you hold high festival on it well we cannot do much marcus and i always go to the early service that is how we begin the day and then he always has some little present on the breakfast table it is the one day in the year we always dine with aunt madge she is such an invalid you see that very little tires her but on christmas day we first dine with her quietly and have an early tea then come home we are generally back by six oclock and have a long evening by ourselves do you spend christmas day quite alone mr gaythorne yes quite alone he returned gloomily but i have plenty of ghosts to visit me and his face twitched and he stooped over the pictures as he spoke chapter viii tis a love token i reckon it is in men as in soilswhere sometimes there is a vein of gold which the owner knows not ofdean swift marcus i have an idea olivia had been sitting for some time in a brown study staring into the red caverns where the yellow fireelves were beating out their rainbow gold on their glowing hissing anvils it was in the gloaming and the little sittingroom was warm and cosy dot was on her mothers lap toasting her pink toes gleefully and chuckling over them in baby fashion and marcus who had finished his days work had left off trying to read by the light of the flickering flame and was indulging in a furtive doze he roused up when olivias clear voice broke the silence marcus do you hear me i have such a nice plan is it a riddle he returned lazily i give it up then he contemplated his small daughter with much satisfaction i wonder none of you advanced women have ever turned your attention to babylanguage he observed presently we are studying the apevocabulary you know dot has got quite a little language of her own as far as i can make out each sentence is finished off with a gurgledoe something between the gobble gobble of a turkey and the coo of the ringdove i suppose it all means something means something and olivia kissed the little rings of curly hair with passionate fondness of course my girlie means something i understand her as well as possible she is scolding the fire because it has burnt her dear little toes look she is showing them to me naughty fire to burn my baby and thereupon followed one of those maternal and infantine duets which appear such hopeless jargon to the masculine mind to marcus it had a lulling effect his eyes began to blink drowsily again but olivia who had passed a solitary day was not disposed for silence you are not a bit curious about my plan dear she said presently i have been thinking so much of that sad sad speech of mr gaythornes yesterday i cannot bear to think of him alone all christmas day with only the ghosts of happier years to haunt him there is no need for him to be alone returned marcus coolly he could invite us to supper why dont you propose it livy you seem to say anything that comes into your head a good bowl of steaming punch would drive all the grey and black spirits away i would undertake to amuse him but olivia only looked at him rebukingly marcus it is so tiresome that you will always joke when i want to be serious now do give me a straightforward answer if you can shall you have any visits to pay on christmas day my dear child how can you expect me to answer in that offhand way and without consulting my visiting list well if you must know as olivia uttered an impatient exclamation i shall have to go up to the models after tea to see that poor woman who was confined yesterday the baby is not likely to live and then i shall look in on travers i dont suppose i shall be out more than an hour oh that will do nicely returned his wife in a satisfied tone marcus do you know i have made up my mind to pay mr gaythorne a surprise visit on christmas evening we are always back by six and i know he does not dine until halfpast seven do you think i dare venture you see i have never been without an invitation yet and you actually mean to beard the lion in his den and douglas in his hall spouted marcus and then in his ordinary voice well you might try it if you like but i should not be surprised if you got snubbed christmas ghosts have a ghastly effect and rub a man up the wrong way oh i will take my chance of that returned olivia cheerfully now i will put dot to bed and leave you to finish your nap in peace thank goodness was on the tip of marcuss tongue but he refrained and only curled himself up afresh in his easychair he had sat up late over his books the previous night wasting lampoil and coals as his wife had remarked rather severely and the cold air with a touch of frost in it had made him sleepy olivia had been bristling all day like a blissful porcupine with little plans and surprises first she had actually saved out of aunt madges christmas gift enough money to buy marcus another of thackerays novels last christmas she had given him the newcomes and this year she had fixed on esmond marcus was devoted to thackeray and thirsted for a complete set of his works but at present only vanity fair and the newcomes were on his modest bookshelves neither the husband nor wife thought it right to spend even those few shillings on the purchase of books when they could make use of the free library the new copy of esmond looked decidedly inviting with its clean uncut pages and then there was really a handsome workbag for aunt madge fashioned by olivias skilful fingers out of a yard of cretonne olivia had already received her christmas presents and had nothing to expect her new outfit and dots pelisse and marthas wages were all birthday and christmas gifts nevertheless when marcus came on christmas eve to hang up their scanty store of holly he was met by his wifes excited face oh marcus she exclaimed i thought you would never come home there is such a hamper from galvaston house and i am waiting for you to open it and oh do you know dear aunt madge has sent us some of her delicious mince pies and a christmas cake she is a good old soul returned marcus fervently bythebye olive could not we have supper earlier for this sharp airand it is freezing hard let me tell youhas made me as hungry as a hunter and as olivia conceded this point graciously he was induced to follow her to the small kitchen where martha all smiles and excitement awaited them martha had her best dress on for she was going round to her mothers presently with her little store of christmas gifts a red knitted shawl for her mother and half a pound of tea a comforter for her father and some warm cuffs for the boys and gingerbreadnuts and some oranges for the children to which olivia had added a bag of mixed sweets marthas round eyes widened with amazement when the hamper was opened and a plump turkey and a fine york ham came to view there were also half a dozen bottles of old portwine for dr luttrell with mr gaythornes compliments and a box of candied fruit and a jar of preserved ginger for his wife oh marcus is not this kind olivias voice was almost awestruck her acquaintance with turkeys had hitherto been strictly limited to a partial view of their limp bodies as they dangled above her in the poulterers shops now her little larder would be filled to overflowing shall i step across and thank him while you put those things away suggested marcus and as olivia agreed to this he caught up his hat and vanished when everything was safely stowed away and martha had been made supremely happy by the gift of two mince pies for her mother and had trotted off red in the face with excitement olivia busied herself in getting the supper ready the unsightly remains of a cold shoulder of mutton had been transformed into tempting rissoles olivia always treated her husband to a hot supper on christmas eve potatoes cooked in their coats and a couple of deborahs mince pies finished off the menu to which marcus did ample justice afterwards he hung up their holly and then olivia fetched her workbasket and marcus went on with the novel that he was reading aloud and both of them looked at the clock in amazement when marthas modest ring told them the evening was over when marcus put on his new greatcoat the next morning he shrugged his shoulders as he opened the frontdoor instead of the frost he had expected the icy coldness of the air and the heavy aspect of the wintry sky were premonitory signs of a snowstorm it is hardly fit for you to go out he said as olivia joined him but she only smiled at him her vigorous young strength was proof against the cold we must hurry marcus she said briskly or we shall be late and i want to enjoy my christmas service for she had already arranged to take care of dot during the morning while martha went to church marcus had his rounds and would fetch her in time for the early dinner at maybrick villas the quiet service in the warm welllighted church was very soothing and refreshing as olivia knelt beside her husband her heart swelled with thankfulness for countless blessings i have not deserved to be so happy she said to herself as she thought of her two treasures martha had breakfast ready for them on their return and olivia hurried upstairs to take off her hat she was just stepping into the diningroom when marcus caught hold of her and blindfolded her playfully no you are not to look yet he said teasingly there is a surprise in store for you but as he took his hands from her eyes she uttered a little cry of ecstasy on the breakfasttable propped up with books was a small framed picture the very cornfield with the brown baby asleep under the hedge and the old terrier guarding it that she had so admired a card with mr gaythornes compliments and christmas greeting was beside it what do you think of your friend now livy but olivia seemed to have no answer ready her lips trembled and the tears gathered in her bright eyes marcus who was almost as pleased as she was patted her on the shoulder kindly and bade her pour out the coffee but for a long time olivia could not be induced to go on with her breakfast if only i could take it to show aunt madge she said at last but marcus negatived this at once the picture was heavy and the damp cold air might injure it that was a happy morning to olivia as she played with dot and then sang her to sleep when marcus came home he told her to wrap up as warmly as possible the damp quite gets into ones bones he said and even olivia owned that it was disagreeably cold aunt madge received them with her usual kind welcome but she looked at her niece with a queer expression livy she said i feel as though i were living in the days of aladdin and his wonderful lamp i had to pinch myself this morning to be sure i was not dreaming what do you think our dear old magician has done now and as she pointed to the table beside her olivia saw the picture of the ruined church and the old shepherd in his tattered smock tis a love token i reckon repeated aunt madge but her voice was not quite steady as for olivia the tears were fairly running down her face dear aunt madge i do love him for this what do you think he has sent me the picture of the cornfield that i described to you and such a hamper of good things yes and a brace of pheasants have come to me livy do you know what that picture means to me i have just been feasting my eyes on it all the morning i mean to get an easel and stand it at the foot of my couch with that indian scarf of mine just draped over it wont it cheer me up on one of my bad days when i cant read or work and even thinking is too hard for my poor head tis a love token i reckon i shall just say that to myself marcus i shall have to pay that visit observed olivia desperately oh dear if only we could do something in return for him dont laugh at me you tiresome boy it is all very well for you you are doing him a good turn every day that is why it is so grand to be a doctor but aunt madge and i want to have our share too take off your hat livy interrupted aunt madge for i hear deb dishing up the dinner and marcus looks blue in the face with cold and hunger and at this reminder olivia hurried mrs broderick always gave them the same dinner a roast fowl and a piece of boiled ham with plum pudding and mince pies to follow but deborahs cookery always gave it a different and most delicious flavour when dinner was over they sat by the fire and roasted chestnuts and talked softly to each other while aunt madge dozed she roused up when deb brought in the teathings and chatted in her old bright way but marcuss professional eyes detected lassitude and in spite of her entreaties took his wife away rather earlier than usual livy observed aunt madge as her niece stooped over her to kiss her i have not been able to write a note of thanks to mr gaythorne yet but will you tell him that i have not had such a christmas gift as that since my husband left me and that i have been praying for him off and on all day that he may have his hearts desirethere tell him that and then she sank back wearily on her pillows chapter ix the christmas guest this life of ours is a wild aeolian harp of many a joyous strain but under them all there runs a loud perpetual wail as of souls in painlongfellow olivia felt a little nervous as she sent in her name by phoebe the girl had looked at her dubiously i am not sure whether master will see you maam she said he never sees anyone on christmas day and mrs crampton says he is but poorly nevertheless at olivias request she had taken the message after a brief delay she returned her master would see mrs luttrell but olivias heart beat a little quickly as she entered the library for the first time she was not sure of her welcome the grand old room looked unusually gloomy the tall standard lamps were unlighted and only the blazing fire and a small green readinglamp made a spot of brightness deep shadows lurked in the corners and the heavy bookcases and window recesses only seemed to add to the gloom mr gaythorne sat in his great ebony chairwith its crimson cushions his face looked more cadaverous and sunken than usual the fine features looked as if they were carved in old ivory they were so fixed and rigid as he held out his hand to olivia there was no smile of welcome on his facethe melancholy deepset eyes were sombre and piercing illustration mr gaythorne sat in his great ebony chair this is indeed a surprise mrs luttrell i hope you will not think it an intrusion she returned a little breathlessly i wanted so much to see you and give you aunt madges message somehow i could not bear to think that we were so happy and that you were sitting alone and feeling sad are you vexed with me for coming she continued in her winning way i can see you are not a bit pleased to see me my dear mrs luttrell he said in his harsh grating voice it is one of my bad days and nothing on earth would yield me pleasure i gave you warning did i not you are visiting a haunted man the christmas ghosts have been holding high revel this evening one of them has been pointing and gibing at me for ever so long you are reaping what you have sown that was what it said why do you grumble at your harvestthere is no ripening without sunshine young hearts must be won by love and not severity it is your own fault your own obstinacy your own blindnessthat is what it has been saying over and over again he shivered slightly as he said this and held out his thin hands to the blaze he had not asked her to sit down but olivia drew a small chair forward and seated herself do not listen to them any longer she said gently you are ill and sad and so everything looks black and hopelesslet me talk to you instead i want to tell you how we have spent our day olivia had a charming voice as she went on with her simple narrative the muscles of mr gaythornes face insensibly relaxed hesitation nervousness a touch of selfconsciousness even would have repelled him but her gentleness and childlike directness seemed to soothe him in spite of himself and as she repeated mrs brodericks message though he shrugged his shoulders and muttered pshaw she could see that he was gratified and even his remarkthat mrs broderick must be a very emotional persondid not daunt her if aunt madge is emotional i am too she said softly do you know what i said when i saw that picture of the old shepherd looking at the rainbow i love him for this and dear mr gaythorne i meant it tut nonsense but as olivia took his hand and held it in her firm grasp there was a sudden moisture in the old mans eyes no one has loved me since my two olives left me he muttered if only one had been spared to me only one but i am left here alone with my sorrow and remorse you are not really alone she returned soothingly why do you speak as if your wife and daughter had ceased to love you do you imagine for one moment that they forget you it would do you good to talk to aunt madge she has such wonderful ideas about all that some peoplepeople like mrs tolman our vicars wifelaugh at her and call her fanciful but to me she is so real why should it not be true she went on with gathering excitement nothing that is good can die love is eternal and it is only pain and grief and sin that can come to an end that is what aunt madge says and she does more than say it she lives it of course she misses her husband dreadfullythey were everything to each otherbut he never seems dead like other womens husbands if you know what i mean by that she seems to keep step with him somehow and think his thoughts i have heard her say once that it is just as though a high wall separated them i cannot see him or hear him but i know he is just the other side of the wall only he has all the sunshine and i have to grope alone in the shadows oh she is right there i know what it is to grope among shadows my dear young lady laying his hand heavily on her arm mrs broderick must be a wonderful woman and i hope to see her some day and i am not above caring for a good womans prayers but our cases are not exactly similar i daresay not returned olivia hesitatingly no indeedand mr gaythornes heavy eyebrows drew togetherlook here mrs luttrell what sort of comfort do you suppose a man can have in thinking of his wife when he knows he has acted contrary to her desires when he has failed to carry out even the wishes expressed on her deathbed what would you say to that man i would say that he must be very unhappy and that no doubt circumstances were too hard for him perhaps he did his best but it is not always possible for dying people to judge rightly they may make mistakes no it was i who made all the mistakes and there was such anguish in the old mans eyes as he said this that olivia almost started but god help me if it were to come over again i should do the same mrs luttrell you do not know me it is my whim to be generous now and then i like to give and it costs me nothing but i am a hard domineering man when people oppose and anger me i can be relentless it is not easy for me to forgive even when the offender is my own flesh and blood and i am no hypocrite i must speak the truth at all costs and yet we expect our father to forgive us returned olivia almost to herself but mr gaythorne heard her and a strange expression crossed his face that is what she always saidmy olive but it never seemed to make any difference to me ah well it is no use talking some spirits refuse to be laid but this is poor entertainment my dear and on your birthday too please do not say that i should love to stay but i must not it is late now and marcus will be waiting for me and olivia rose as she spoke and now before i go may i ring for the lamps to be lighted there is something uncanny in this darkness and the fire is getting hollow too well well do as you like was the abrupt answer i am going to have my dinner here tonight it is warmer and so olivia had her way as she bade him goodnight he said a little wistfully you can come tomorrow afternoon if you like i have those views of venice and florence to show you i had an old florentine palace for six months the year before my little olive died that was our last happy year of course i will come she replied smiling at him but as she left the room she sighed had she really exorcised those evil spirits or would they return again with tenfold force remorse that was the word he used this was the cankerworm that was robbing him of peace it is not easy for me to forgive even if the offender is my own flesh and blood how sad it was to hear him say that i think after all i did him some little good she thought as she groped her way cautiously through the dark shrubbery that hard rigid look had quite disappeared before i left i have a feeling somehow that one day he will open his heart to me and tell me his trouble every now and then he drops a word or two perhaps this evening if i had not been so hurried he would have spoken out olivias warm heart was full of pity for the lonely man sitting beside his desolate hearth but she was young and as the heavy gate closed after her and she hurried across the road a sudden vision of her own bright little parlour with marcus waiting for her rose blissfully before her marcus would have returned long ago and would be wondering at her delay she knew what he was doingcutting the pages of esmond for their evening reading how charmed he had been with her gift although he had pretended to be angry at her extravagance a few particles of snow powdered her as she rang the bell marcus answered it himself livy my dear child he said quickly what an age you have been come into the kitchen a moment i want to speak to you and martha is upstairs no not there catching hold of her arm as she absently turned the handle of the parlour door i said the kitchen oh marcus what is it in an alarmed voice as she suddenly perceived his grave preoccupied look there is something wrongwith baby but his smile reassured her nothing is wrong i am only a little perplexed dots all right and the house is not on fire and martha is enjoying her usual health but we have got a christmas guest thats all marcus what can you mean when we know no one here is it one of your old hospital friends and why may i not go in and see him so you shall but i must explain matters first i have a poor fellow in there whom i picked up off a doorstep at first i thought he was drunk and i meant to call a policeman but i very soon found out my mistake the poor wretch had fainted from cold and exhaustion he was simply starving oh how dreadful exclaimed olivia much shocked at this have you given him some food but why is he not here instead of in the sittingroom martha has a capital fire yes she has been making him some tea and luckily there was some cold bacon he has had nothing but a penny roll and some coffee since yesterday morning another night of exposure and want would have killed him i took him into the parlour because the couch was handy but directly he spoke i saw he was a gentlemanat least an educated man but his clothes are threadbare he has parted with his waistcoat for food now you know why i brought you in here to save you a shock but marcus what are we to do with him ah that is what puzzles me i have fed and warmed him and could give him money for a nights lodging but he is not fit to move when he tried to sit up just now he nearly fell back from exhaustion i should say from the look of him that he has been ill perhaps in some hospital and has not got up his strength and he is quite young toonot more than fiveandtwenty i should say may i go and look at him first and then we will think what is to be done yes dear that will be best but livy i really cannot wait just now all this has hindered me so that i have not been to the traverses i shall not be longnot more than half an hour olivia looked rather troubled at this but it was no use making a fuss marcus must do his work but her vision of a cosy evening was sadly marred instead of listening to esmond she had to interview a strange man directly marcus had gone she went into the sittingroom the couch had been drawn near the fire and marcuss easy chair was pushed back and there in the warmth and firelight with an old plaid thrown over him the forlorn wanderer lay sleeping as placidly as a child olivia trod on tiptoe as she crossed the room and stood beside the couch and studied him attentively marcus was right of course he was a gentleman in spite of his emaciated appearance and poor threadbare garments this was evident the features were wellcut and refined the wasted hands bore no signs of manual labour and the filbert nails were carefully attended some poor prodigal fallen to low estate lay before her and yet he looked so boyish and innocent in his sleep that olivias heart grew very pitiful over him turn him out in the winters cold and on christmas night too when all the merciful angels were moving betwixt heaven and earth when the bond of brotherhood that linked human beings together was drawn closer and the rich mans gift and the widows mite were paid into the same treasury of love it was impossible how soundly he was sleeping poor fellow lulled by the very fulness of comfort his sick hunger appeased and his bones no longer aching with cold a fair moustache covered his mouth but olivia who prided herself on reading character soon decided that the chin and lower part of the face showed signs of weakness but as the thought passed through her mind a pair of deep blue eyes opened full on her face and gazed at her in bewilderment where am i he said feebly oh i remember i fainted on a doorstep and some good samaritan carried me in then in the same weak voice forgive me madam but i am afraid to rise lie stillplease lie still until my husband comes back returned olivia a little nervously how ill he lookedthe eyes looked preternaturally large in the wasted face it is sad to see anyone in such distress she continued gently and on christmas night too yes i am down on my luck returned the stranger but even in his feebleness he spoke a little recklessly i was always murad the unlucky it would have been all over with me in a few hours if the doctor had not found me i was just at the end of my tetherbut here a hard cough seemed to tear him to pieces lie still and try to sleep again returned olivia hurriedly then she went out of the room and summoned martha when marcus returned and went in search of her he found her airing some sheets at the kitchen fire marcus she said martha has been lighting a fire in that little empty room where the iron bedstead is there are the mattress and the two blankets aunt madge lent me when i was ill i am going to make up a bed there for tonight you think we ought to keep him then returned her husband looking at her questioningly to be sure i hardly know how we are to turn him out but if he falls ill on our hands eh livy if he be very ill you would have to take him to a hospital she returned quickly we have not got the cruise of oil remember and as aunt madge says we must be just before we are generousbut he has such a terrible cough marcus oh that is from cold and exhaustion and as i told you before he has evidently recovered from some severe illness probably pleurisy or pneumonia well livy i think you are about right we must do our best for the poor beggar now and then one must help lame dogs over stiles and marcus whose bump of benevolence was largely developed and who believed in practical religion was sincerely grateful that his wife had fallen in with his views i think you were sent to him to help him returned olivia softly inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren oh marcus you know how that finishes and marcus smiled back at her as he left the room chapter x a gentlemanly tramp tis not enough to help the feeble up but to support him aftertimon of athens when olivia had finished her preparations she summoned marcus upstairs and with an air of housewifely pride showed him all the arrangements she had made in his bachelor days dr luttrell had been in the habit of picking up all sorts of miscellaneous articles at sales that he thought might be useful some day and though olivia had often laughed at his purchases and called them old lumber they had often proved serviceable the strip of faded carpet and shabby little shut up washstand intended for the surgery and a couple of chairs had been put into the empty room and though it looked bare enough to marcuss eyes and in spite of the bright little fire terribly chilly it would doubtless be a haven of refuge to their miserable guest he says it is just heaven observed marcus when he came downstairs to his wife the night before last poor beggar he was in the casual ward and last night he had a few hours in some refuge fancy the casual ward for a gentlemans son he said to me so bitterly and there was actually a barrister there too and we fraternised it is just as i thought livy he was discharged from the hospital about three weeks ago and has been roughing it ever since did you ask him his name marcus yes and he hesitated i dont believe robert barton is his real name the way he gave it looked a bit shady he is a goodlooking fellow and i cant think he is vicious but he is one of those weak fellows who get led away if we are to help him he must tell us more about himself olivia found her hands full the next day when marcus went up to see barton he found him flushed and feverish and complained of aching in his limbs it is only a bad chill he said when olivia looked grave at this report but unless we take care of him well for a day or two it will be pneumonia or congestion of the lungs i shall be pretty busy for the next two or three hours and am afraid i must leave him to you and martha dont let him talk and keep the fire up that room is still like an icehouse are you sure you dont mind the bother livy and though olivia was too truthful to answer in the negative she promised to do her best for marcuss protege robert barton looked more to advantage lying in bed in dr luttrells old red striped blazer than he had done in his threadbare shabby clothes the previous night indeed olivia quite started when she saw him he was certainly what marcus called him a goodlooking fellow the dark blue eyes were beautiful and full of expression he flushed as olivia asked him kindly how he felt i feel pretty bad he returned and the doctor says i must lie here i used not to think much of the story of the good samaritan but i believe in it now oh if you knew what it was to feel clean linen about me again my husband says you are not to talk replied olivia gently so i must carry out his orders there is some medicine you are to take and byandby i shall bring you some hot broth if only your cough were easier you would be able to sleep but perhaps the drops will do you good thanks awfully if you will put them down by me i will take them but please please do not trouble about me i am not worth it i never was worth anything he sighed and there were tears in his eyes but olivia took no notice she put things straight and then went about her business on her next visit she found him sleeping but as she put down the cup of hot broth beside him he half woke mother he said in a hoarse voice i never did it i swear to you on my honour i was never as bad as that ask olive she believes in me she knows i could not be such a low cad mr barton i have brought you your broth will you please take it before it gets cold and olivias clear voice roused robert barton effectually i was dreaming he said looking at her rather confusedly i thought i was at medhurst in the old library oh what a fool i am and there was almost a despairing look in his eyes you are weak or you would not dream so and yet it must be natural to dream about your own people i am so glad you have someone belonging to you last night we were afraid that you were quite friendless then she stopped as she remembered marcuss injunctions no i am not friendless he returned raising himself with difficulty and coughing as he spoke even the prodigal son had relatives you knowa father and an elder brother but he was better off than i for he knew where to find thembut here such a terrible fit of coughing came on that olivia forbade him to say another word you shall tell us all about it when you are better she said kindly perhaps who knows we may be able to help you find your friends we are poor people ourselves my husband is only just beginning to make a practice so there is not much that we can do then as she stooped over him and wiped his brow she was almost startled by the sweetness of the smile that crossed the young mans face not much he reiterated but olivia shook her head at him to inculcate silence and carried away the empty cup when marcus came home at dinnertime she proposed sending a note across to galvaston house to tell mr gaythorne that she could not leave home that afternoon but to her surprise dr luttrell objected to this you know how crotchety mr gaythorne is he said quickly and it will never do to disappoint him he might be a bit touchy barton will be all right and i shall be in myself the greater part of the afternoon and then olivias scruples vanished she felt marcus had been wise when she entered the library mr gaythorne was evidently expecting her he had a large portfolio open before him as he held out his hand to her without risingfor he had still great difficulty in movingthere was a brighter look on his face we must make the most of the daylight he said and the next moment olivia found herself in venice the views were so beautiful and mr gaythornes descriptions so interesting that as usual the time passed quickly it was not until they were drinking their coffee in the pleasant firelight that olivia found an opportunity of narrating her husbands strange adventure of the previous evening mr gaythorne listened with his usual air of half contemptuous amusement but before she came to the end of the recital he turned upon her quickly do you mean that the tramp is actually in your house at this moment he asked indignantly oh please dont call him that he is a gentleman he speaks in quite an educated manner and his ways are so refined marcus saw that at once pooh nonsense my dear mrs luttrell a gentlemanly tramp is the worst kind it is generally drink and profligacy that have dragged them down you will be robbed or burnt in your beds olivia could not conceal her amusement a vivid remembrance of the flushed weary young face of the wanderer rose before her it was so boyishlooking with the fair hair and golden brown moustache i am sure he does not drink she returned trying vainly to suppress a smile but this contradiction did not please mr gaythorne how can you know anything about it he asked testily from your own account he has told you nothing except that he has been in a hospital and a casual wardthey have plenty of cases of delirium tremens in both places good heavens and i thought dr luttrell was a sensible man this is the way he takes care of his wife and child harbouring a frozenout tramp dear mr gaythorne returned olivia pleadingly just put yourself in my husbands place marcus found the poor young fellow on a doorstep in harbut road not a dozen yards from his own door being a doctor he saw at once that he must be warmed and fed or life would be endangered and christmas night of all nights how could he forbear in sheer humanity to take in the poor creature and then when he found how weak he was how was he to turn him out into the streets again he might have sent for a cab and had him driven to a hospital nomarcus said it was no case for a hospital at least at present they would not have admitted him indeedindeed he could not have done otherwisei told him so at once what is the use of going to church and saying ones prayers if one shrinks from such a clear duty as that why we should never dare to read st james again and why not may i ask because we should have set our faces against his teaching oh you know what i mean mr gaythorne and olivia repeated the text reverently if a brother or sister be naked and in lack of daily food and one of you say unto them go in peace be ye clothed and fed and yet you give them not those things needful for the body what doth it profit marcus does not only profess his religion ohfinished olivia with sparkling eyesi did feel so proud of my husband last night wellwell if you choose to be quixotic it is your own affair not mine but mr gaythorne spoke with less irritation now shall we go on with the portfolio or do you want to go back to your gentlemanly tramp then olivia begged to finish the pictures i have nearly half an hour before dots bedtime she said cheerfully and then i must go and so harmony was restored when the halfhour had passed olivia took her leave but before she reached the door mr gaythorne called her back and thrust something into her hand that will help you to provide for your tramp he said hurriedly and prevent him from eating you out of house and home mind you repay yourself before you lay out any for him do you suppose in a cynical tone that your husbands income will bear the expense of such an inmate as that and olivia to her intense astonishment found the two crumpled bits of paper in her hand were fivepound notes oh there is no need for this she said in distress have you forgotten the turkey and all those good things aunt madge sent us but mr gaythorne waved her away nonsense he said crossly do you suppose a trifle like that matters to me why i am not spending half my income if you want any more you can just let me know but if you take my advice you will get rid of that fellow as soon as possible marcus smiled when olivia showed him the money put it away for the present he said it will buy barton some warm clothes we can afford to give him his bit and sup for a few days he is stone broke as they call it and a few pounds may be just what he requires and put him on his feet again when mrs broderick heard of the strange guest at no galvaston terrace she was deeply interested and warmly commended marcuss philanthropy i wonder she said thoughtfully after a few minutes silence whether any of ferguss things would fit him you know what a foolish body i have been livy to keep them all this time and it gives deb so much trouble to preserve them from moth but there we all have our crazes i have been meaning to part with them for a long time and this seems a good opportunity it does seem such a pity to touch that money it would set him up to have a few pounds in hand olivia could not deny this and in her secret heart she thought aunt madge could not do better with her dead husbands things it will be a real act of charity she said frankly oh aunt madge if you could only see his clothes they are so worn and threadbare and when martha washed his shirt and socks she almost cried over the holes and then his boots say no more my child it shall be done and at once and mrs brodericks mouth looked unusually firm the very next day marcus carried a big parcel upstairs and opened it before robert bartons astonished eyes mrs broderick who did nothing grudgingly had put up all she thought requisitea warm suit and a great coat a pair of boots some coloured flannel shirts and warm underclothing it has upset him a bit marcus said when he reentered the parlour he is still so weak you see he fairly broke down when i showed him the things he is very grateful bythebye livy sitting down beside her as he spoke he has been telling me more about himself tonight not much certainly he does not seem to like speaking of himself but he gave me a brief outline he has relations only he has not seen them for some years it appeared he quarrelled with them or got wrong somehow in fact he owned he had been a bit wild and then things went from bad to worse with him and he had a run of illluck it seems he is an artist and rather fond of his profession but he hurt his hand and bloodpoisoning came on and for some time he was afraid he would lose his right arm for months he could paint no pictures and so all his little capital was swallowed up but why did he not write to his people marcus and make it up with them so he did but his letters never got answered and he got sick of it at last when he was pretty nearly at the end of his tether he came back to england i think he said he was in paris then or was it beyrout well never mind he went straight to his old home but to his horror the house was shut up and to let and the caretaker told him that no one had lived there for years and that she believed the party who had owned it was abroad he could get nothing more than that out of her he put up at a little wayside inn that night meaning to make inquiries in the neighbourhood but the next day he fell ill and after a bit they took him to the hospital and since then he drifted up to london hoping to see his fathers old lawyer and glean intelligence from him but he found he was dead his fixed intention was to go down again to the place and see the vicar and prosecute his inquiries in person but illluck pursued him he was robbed in some wretched lodging and soon found himself in actual want but i mean if i die for it to get to medhurst somehow he said to me i could have found someone to identify me there not that we had been there long for my people mostly lived abroad but there must be some friends who could tell me about them it is a queer story altogether and yet not a wholly improbable one but there is a mystery somewhere livy and i am sure of one thing that his name is not barton i hinted as much but he only flushed up and said nothing chapter xi the nightbell rings a bad beginning leads to a bad endinglivy the next few days passed quietly dr luttrell professed himself perfectly satisfied with his patients progress in spite of his delicate aspect and the terrible hardships he had experienced robert barton proved that he had a fair amount of recuperative power perhaps his youth was in his favour and it was soon evident that he had a naturally sanguine temperament his nature was singularly illbalanced he was always in extremeseither in the depths of depression or else unaccountably excited olivia would sometimes find him crouching over the fire with his head between his hands in a state of morose misery and at other times she would hear him whistling a few bars from some opera in quite a lighthearted way if you do not mind olive i think that barton had better come down tomorrow afternoon marcus observed one evening he will get on all the faster and as olivia made no objection to this the matter was settled marcus secretly wondered how robert barton could take things quite so coolly perhaps it might be partly owing to his enfeebled state but he certainly did not seem to trouble himself much about the future i feel as if i should pull through now he said once i only wanted a helping hand to lift me out of the slough of despond when i am a bit stronger doctor i must paint a potboiler or two and marcus had quietly assented to this i have made up my mind what i must do livy continued dr luttrell later on that same evening when he had arranged that his patient should come downstairs you know that nice mrs randall in the models well she has a lodger but she expects that he will leave her in a week or so as he has work at a distance i might take the room for barton it is a clean tidy little place and mrs randall is a motherly sort of woman and will look after him oh what a good idea marcus yes it came into my head when i was leaving the models yesterday and i had half a mind to go back and ask the price of the room but i was in such a hurry i would pay her a month in advance and we would use some of mr gaythornes money in buying him what he wants for his painting i have no idea what sort of an artist he is but it seems the only thing he can do oh how pleased he will be poor fellow exclaimed olivia but surely he is not well enough to leave us just now and in this weather for a hard frost had set in not for another week perhaps but we must not let him think himself a fixture here we have had him ten days already marcus had not repented of his philanthropy he was too highly principled for that but though he would not have confessed it to his wife for worlds he was a little alarmed at the responsibility so suddenly thrown on him barton seemed such a happygolucky casual sort of person the gentlemanly tramp was not a bad name for him he was not quite open either in dr luttrells opinion he ought by this time to have confided in them fully he is a bit shifty and hazy about things he said to himself and i shall be glad when livy and i have the house to ourselves ten days repeated olivia thoughtfully is it so long as that marcus how time flies when one is busy do you know dear i have such an odd feeling sometimes i feel as though that poor fellow was sent to us for some special purpose that we had a sort of mission towards him it is not that i want him for of course his being here makes so much work for martha but all the same i do not wish you to lose sight of him my dear child returned marcus rather impatiently am i likely to lose sight of him when i am at the models at least three times a week no but we can see him so much better under our own roof she replied quietly we must not get tired of him too soon yes you are tired dear laying her hand affectionately on his do you think i do not know that although you are so good about it and never grumble but it will be trying to us both when he comes downstairs yes and one hardly knows how to treat him returned marcus feeling it a relief to utter his thoughts he is clever and refined and i suppose we must allow that he is a gentleman but it is impossible somehow to trust him or to feel at ones ease with him there is something that fascinates and yet repels one i know what you mean replied olivia thoughtfully but somehow i like him in spite of everything marcus what a blessing it is to think that i went to galvaston house this afternoon and so i shall be free tomorrow for olivias sunny nature always looked on the bright side of things that night a wonderful thing happened the nightbell rang that sound so dreaded by the hardworked doctor was like a triumphal reveille in marcuss ears and robert bartons muttered poor devil as he turned on his pillow would not have been endorsed olivia indeed had been alarmed for a moment by the unaccustomed sound and thought drowsily that the house must be on fire but she was soon wide awake and hushing dot go to sleep girlie it is only someone come to see dada she said rocking her little one dot had been startled and was cross in consequence and it was sometime before she could be pacified the next minute marcus came back fully dressed i must go round to brunswick place he said hurriedly dont expect me back till you see me and then she heard him running downstairs he expects to be detained so i suppose some poor baby is to enter this wintry world she thought as she composed herself to sleep but she little guessed the terribly hard work that was before marcus it was early morning and martha had already crept softly past her door in her stocking feet as she would have said so as not to wake miss baby before dr luttrell let himself in with his latchkey he looked sadly jaded but utterly refused to lie down and have a nap i will have my tub and some breakfast instead he observed they gave me some hot coffee a couple of hours ago my word it is freezing hard still tell martha to give us a goodsized rasher of ham is the poor thing all right asked olivia presently when they were seated at their breakfast with dot crawling between them then for the moment dr luttrell looked puzzled what poor thingoh with a laugh i see what you mean now but it was nothing of that sort i have not had such a business since my hospital days he went on poor livy you would not have slept so comfortably if you had known it was a case of delirium tremens an elderly man too and his poor daughter was frightened out of her wits but she behaved splendidly you women have pluck i must tell you that she actually helped me when the manservant was afraid to come near his master oh marcus he might have hurt you and olivia turned paleperhaps it is as well that doctors wives know so little about their husbands experiences oh we had plenty of that sort of business at barts he returned coolly but i shall have to get him a nurse i must see after one at once or poor miss williams will be worn out will you give me another cup of tea livy are they new people too marcus like the stanwells but dr luttrell shook his head no they have lived in the place for years but mr williams quarrelled with dr bevan and his daughter dared not send for him and as i was the nearest medical man the servant came to me it was just a fluke thats all is there only one daughter marcus well my dear it was not likely that i questioned miss williams about her family but i imagine she is the only daughter poor girl i felt sorry for her there have been plenty of briers besetting her path i should say as the poet writes so feelingly she has had more kicks than halfpence and as usual when marcus began to joke olivia took the hint and left off questioning him the little parlour looked a haven of comfort to robert bartons eyes as he entered it that afternoon leaning on dr luttrells arm olivia was sitting at needlework as usual with dot playing at her feet and sprawling on the rug in exact imitation of jet the black kitten she rose at once with a bright welcoming smile and arranged the cushions in the easychair i daresay you are glad to be down again she said kindly as barton sank back in them rather heavily but you must be careful you are far from strong yet thanks i am tolerably fit but the weak shaking hand rather contradicted this oh what a pretty child i should like to make a sketch of her will you come to me little one and robert bartons smile was so winning that dot crawled to him at once and hauled herself up by the help of one finger olivia gave her husband a quick glance which he quite understood there cannot be much harm in him if he likes children this was what her look meant and even marcus was touched and surprised when he saw his little daughter put up her round face to be kissed and then make playful dabs at him what a darling she israther like you mrs luttrell but she has a look of the doctor too i have always been fond of children they are never afraid of me and this speech completely won the young mothers heart he is really very distinguishedlooking she said to herself as she watched him playing with dot he is dreadfully thin and of course uncle ferguss clothes are too big for him but no one could help seeing that he is a gentleman they began to talk presently in quite a friendly way and after a time olivia said quite simply your name is not really robert barton is it she had blurted this out almost without thinking well no he returned reddening a little but i have been calling myself by that name for the last month or two it was handy and his face twitched i did not care to carry my fathers name into the places i have been obliged to frequent lately you have a father then mr barton in an interested tone oh yes and a mother and a sister though i have heard nothing of them for half a dozen years oh not so long as that surely and then olivia looked at him with kindly gravity why you could only have been a boy when you left home i am older than you think mrs luttrelli shall soon be eightandtwentybut i was young enough certainly when they shunted me off confession may be good for the soul he went on with a reckless laugh but it is not particularly pleasant as i told your husband i quarrelled with my people it was my own fault in a great measure but i do not mean to take all the blame if they had treated me differently things would not have come to this but this is all ancient history if a man sows thistles he must expect a harvest of the same i have had my evil things certainly and perhaps i deserved them and you wish now that you had acted differently then such a look of intense pain crossed robert bartons face that olivia was quite startled i would give my right hand if those months could be blotted out he said vehemently you know the proverb mrs luttrellgive a dog a bad name and hang himwell they were for hanging me i mean figuratively so i took the bit between my teeth and bolted it seems to me mr barton she said thoughtfully that your one chance to retrieve the past is to find out your own people i supposehesitating a littlethat they are in a position to help you most certainly they are we lived mostly abroad but always in good style the house we had at medhurst was only taken on lease for a short time it was my fathers fancy never to stay long in one place he was fond of travelling when i am strong enough to brave the weather i will go down to medhurst and hunt up an acquaintance or two there must be someone who knew him but the doctor will not give me leave yet did my husband say anything to you about the future asked olivia tentatively then robert bartons face that had grown suddenly old and haggard brightened up he told me some old gentleman a friend of yours had been awfully kind and that he would be able to take a room for me for a month and get me some canvas and colours if i only had my tools i could take a sketch of your little girl at once just as she is now with the kitten i could call it playfellows just a small thing you know but it would be sure to take i do not paint badly although i have not made my mark yet but i have sold two or three small pictures besides potboilers i could begin tomorrow if only i had my easel and palette and his tone was so eager that olivia promised to consult her husband and if he approved to go herself for the necessary things when marcus came in he told them at once that he had been round to the models the room will be vacant next tuesday barton he said briskly and i have settled with mrs randall that you will take it for a month it is a poor place of course but in my opinion it is not so bare as your present diggings and it is very clean and comfortable so you may be sure of board and lodging for a month you will have to be careful you know he went on as long as this weather lasts you must not think of moving about the country just yet or you will be laid up again and then olivia chimed in and after a little consultation it was arranged that olivia should go to the pictureshop at the corner of harbut street the next morning robert barton made a list of things required he was in such good spirits all teatime and told such amusing stories of his life in paris that even marcus tired as he was was much entertained he is really a wellinformed fellow he observed when barton had retired i am not so sure that we shall find him in the way after all he told us that story about the artists model in quite a racy fashion he seems to be up to date in his notions i am a bit curious to find out if he can paint or if it is only tall talk but he certainly seems bent on it now i must turn in for i am dead beat oh bythebye livy i told miss williams that you would go round and see her tomorrow afternoon it would really be a charity as olivia seemed very much astonished at this the poor girl is so lonely she has no brothers and sisters and as far as i can find out no friends either no friends marcusand they live in one of those nice houses in brunswick place and keep a manservant oh i daresay they have a few acquaintances returned dr luttrell with a yawn most likely it has been impossible for her to have friends when i proposed sending you to cheer her up she looked quite grateful poor soul you will like her olive she is just your sort no nonsense about her plenty of feeling but nothing hysterical marcus observed olivia slipping her hand through his arm and speaking very deliberately do you not think we had better have those cards printed our visiting acquaintance is so much increased and then marcus laughed and turned down the lamp chapter xii greta for i am the only one of my friends that i can rely onappolodamus olivia set out in good spirits to pay her call the next afternoon it was a clear frosty day sunless and excessively cold but olivia felt a certain exhilaration in the ring of the horses hoofs on the hard road and the brisk exercise brought such a glow to her face that more than one passerby looked at her approvingly there are no cosmetiques so beneficial as good health happiness and an easy conscience olivia who had never been handsome looked so fresh and comely that many a languid beauty might have envied her brunswick place was considered rather a desirable spot it was quiet and retired and the houses were wellbuilt and substantial looking they were chiefly inhabited by solicitors in good practice and retired army men who had private means of their own the very air was redolent of respectability and prosperity no one with a small income would have thought of settling down in brunswick place the manservant who admitted olivia ushered her into a large handsomely furnished drawingroom with a conservatory opening out of it and the next moment miss williams joined her to her great surprise olivia recognised her at once she was the tall girl in brown that she had so often noticed in church who was always alone and who looked so sad yes it was the same tiredlooking young face she was certain of it i am sure i have often seen you she said as they shook hands and miss williams smiled i was just thinking the same of you you attend st matthews do you not i have seen you with dr luttrell please sit downno not that chair come a little closer to the fire it is so bitterly cold and here she shivered a little i do not mind the cold as much as some people replied olivia sturdily i am very strong and take plenty of exercise perhaps you have not been out it is so difficult to keep warm indoors no i have not been out returned miss williams and then she looked at olivia it is very kind of you to come and see memrs luttrell she spoke slowly almost deliberately but her voice was pleasant in her light tweed she looked even taller than olivia had thought her and very thin in spite of her pale complexion and want of animation miss williams had some claims to good looks she had soft grey eyes with remarkably long lashes and the coils of fair hair set off a finely shaped head my husband thought that you seemed rather lonely returned olivia in her usual straightforward fashion then a faint colour rose to miss williamss face yes it was so kind of him to propose it and i was very grateful i suppose he told you that i had no friendsno one i mean that i could ask to come in and sit with me a little i know the nextdoor people slightly we call at intervals and they have invited me to a party but i have never got beyond that it has been difficult for me to make friends i am rather shyand here she broke off rather awkwardly i think i know what you mean replied olivia when one is in trouble one wants real friends not chance acquaintances and if one has not made them just sothat is precisely my case circumstances have been to blame for i think i am sociable by nature dr luttrell was very quick he understood at once and he said it was not good for me to be so much alone oh he was such a comfort to me even the first moment he did not seem like a stranger i felt before halfanhour was over that i could trust him implicitly and when he suggested yesterday that you should come and cheer me up i said yes at once i was very glad to come replied olivia quickly like yourself i have no friends here with the exception of another patient of my husbands an old gentleman who lives opposite to us so i hope you will let me be of some use to you you know after a moments hesitation dr luttrell is not one to talk about his patients but he told me a little about your trouble so i imagined and of course it makes it easier for me and here miss williamss lips trembled slightly you could not help me or be any comfort without knowing a little oh mrs luttrell is it not dreadful my poor father and such a good father too he is just killing himself i know that and you are all alone yes since my mother died things were bad enough then but they have been worse since she used to be able to influence him and keep him straight but he will not listen to me have you had this to bear long and olivia looked at her pityingly what a life for a young sensitive girl for some years ever since dacre my brother died it was a boating accident and they brought him home quite dead we thought it was the shock but dr bevan who attended him then told us that it was due also to hereditary disease we dared not send for dr bevan the other night though he understood him so thoroughly and was so kind my father had quarrelled with him but dr luttrell saw him yesterday and they had a long talk my husband always speaks so highly of dr bevan yes and i liked him so much he was such a comfort to me when poor mother died and i shall always be grateful to him but i dared not run the risk of exciting my father he is a little better today dr luttrell says so but of course he is coming again tonight we have a good nurse so things are more hopeful but i shall have to get rid of our man he is no use dr luttrell says i must have someone older and more reliable who can help in an emergency roberts is far too young to be any real good olivia listened and assented she was quickwitted enough to see that it would be better to let miss williams talk and unburden herself a little the girl in spite of a naturally shy temperament seemed ready to open her heart to her perhaps olivias winning personality had already won her human nature is so strangely constitutedthe laws of attraction and repulsion are so unaccountable some natures seem magnetic they attract and draw us almost without our own volition with others we make no way months and years of intercourse will not bind us more closely we are not on the same plane olivias sympathetic manner the pitying kindness in her eyes appealed strongly to greta williams the lonely girlisolated by the worst curse that can affect humanitygrievous hereditary vicethe innocent scapegoat of anothers sin alas how many homes even in our favoured land are desolated as well as desecrated from this one cause what piteous waste of sweet young life crushed under unnatural burdens the sin of england we saythe shameful curse of diseased selfindulgence greta williams seemed patient by nature though it was a relief to talk openly to another woman she did not complain in spite of her fathers faults he was evidently very dear to her it is a diseasea madness she said once but it would never do to have young people here one could not be sure and for his sake it is better not and in these few words there lay a world of tragedy to love and yet not to be sure that the object of our love will not disgrace us what misery to a refined and sensitive nature to have to blush and grow pale from very shame and terror to stretch out a helping hand to some dear one who has sunk too low to reach it ah only one the allmerciful can rightly gauge the anguish of such a sorrow no wonder greta williams looked so worn and pale and that her eyes had grown sad he is worse than he has ever been she whispered presently dr luttrell does not tell me but i know he was alarmed for him that night he has been so much better lately she went on with a little sob in her throat i had felt almost comfortable not quite comfortable you know because it never really lasted but he liked me to read to him and we played chess but nowher voice dropped into wearinessi shall never feel quite easy again olivia had long ago outstayed an ordinary conventional visit but marcus had sent her for a purpose she was to try and cheer and if possible comfort this poor girl so when greta rang for tea she simply stayed on and towards the end of her visit she thought her young hostess looked a shade brighter you will come and see me she said when she rose to take leave but miss williams hesitated will you forgive me if i do not return your call just now i simply dare not leave the house you understand do you not mrs luttrell but if you would be so very kind as to come again most certainly i will come again did you think that i should not but dear miss williams you must not shut yourself up too closely or your health will suffer but greta only smiled faintly at this i shall tell dr luttrell that you have done me good she said pressing olivias hand how strange it seemsthere is no cure for such a trouble as mine and yet telling you about it has seemed to make it more bearable oh please come again soonvery soon and of course olivia readily promised this it was rather a disappointment on her return to find marcus had been in for tea and had gone out again robert barton who was reading by the fire said that he would not be back for an hour or two have you had a pleasant afternoon mrs luttrell he asked putting down his book and trying to stifle a yawn but though olivia replied in the affirmative she did not vouchsafe any information about her visit when marcus returned two hours later he found their guest had betaken himself to bed and olivia was able to give him a graphic account of her afternoon i am very much interested in miss williams she observed presently fancy her turning out to be the very tall girl in brown at st matthews did your ears burn just now livy observed marcus mischievously i am glad to find someone appreciates my wife properly you seem to have got on like a house on fire well you will be doing good work there she said you were rather alarmed about her father that first night did she i never said so he returned dryly in some cases it is best to reserve ones opinion but of course at mr williamss age it is a grave matter then he drew his chair closer to the fire lifes an awful muddle livy as that man said in hard times fancy the loneliness of a young creature like that why she cannot be more than two or threeandtwenty and her lawful protector drinking himself to death olivia shuddered her own young life had been anxious and hardworking but compared with greta williams it had been strewn with roses could any parents have been more honoured than hers had been and then had she not always had aunt madges wise counsel and sympathy to aid her and lastly had not the sunshine of a happy love glorified it but miss williams apparently had none of these things not more than others i deserve but god has given me more she thought with a swelling heart as she made her thanksgiving that night in spite of outside weather there was plenty of life and movement in the corner house at galvaston terrace the next day mr barton began his sketch of dot and he soon became so absorbed in it that he seemed to forget his weakness and lassitude olivia watched the progress of the picture with intense delight and carried a favourable report of it on her next visit to galvaston house it is a striking likeness of my little girl she said even my husband who is not easy to please in such matters allows that he owned yesterday that mr barton is certainly a good artist and understands his business i like to watch him he looks so happy when he is painting as though he has forgotten all his troubles he is staying with us a day or two longer on account of the picture but he will certainly leave us on thursday mr gaythorne did not answer he seemed to be considering something at last he said rather abruptly yes dr luttrell has been telling me what a clever fellow he seems and i think i shall get him to do a little job for me that picture i bought at stangroves wants touching up it has been injured i knew that when i bought it but it was so slight that it did not matter and i meant to get it put to rights if i send it over tomorrow or the next day do you think mr barton will undertake the job it will only take him an hour or two he will gladly do so i am sure of that is it the picture that my husband admired so much yes the prodigal son i bought it that day i sprained my ankle very well mrs luttrell it shall be sent to your house chapter xiii fresh complications it is best to be cautious and avoid extremesplutarch greta williamss pathetic little speech come soon very soon please rather haunted olivia and she very speedily found an excuse for repeating her visit this time she was welcomed so warmly and miss williams seemed so unfeignedly pleased to see her that she felt she had done the right thing and after that she went frequently to brunswick place circumstances certainly favoured the rapid growth of their intimacy greta who had caught a severe cold was obliged to remain closely confined to the house and dr luttrell who was sincerely sorry for the lonely girl encouraged his wife to go as often as possible she has not a soul belonging to her at least in england he said once though she has relations in new zealand uncles and aunts and cousins there is a colony of williamses in christchurch the worst of it is people seemed to have left off calling her father made himself so disagreeable it is hard lines for her poor girl i believe mrs tolman looks her up occasionally then olivia at the mention of the vicars wife made a naughty little face miss williams rather dreads her visits she replied she calls her an eastwindy sort of person and i know what she means mrs tolman is an excellent woman but she rubs one up the wrong way i always feel bristly all over after one of her parochial visits and i know aunt madge feels the same when the vicar is with her he seems to tone her down somehow but the very swing of her gown as she enters the room and the way she sits down as though she were taking possession of ones chair irritates my nerves but though marcus laughed he did not contradict this the new friendship gave olivia a great deal of pleasure since her schooldays she had never enjoyed the society of anyone of her own age the hardworking young governess had had scant leisure for cementing intimacies it had always been a wonder to her how marcus had managed his courting and she often told him so she had met him at the house of one of her pupils and it being a wet day he had offered his umbrella and walked back with her to her lodgings she had a vague idea that he had detained her for such a long time talking on the doorstep that her mother had come down and invited him to wait until the rain was over but marcus always repudiated this and declared that she had talked so fast that he found it impossible to get away but after this he and her mother had seemed to play into each others hands perhaps under other circumstances olivia would hardly have found miss williams so attractive and interesting for though amiable and affectionate she was by no means clever her accomplishments consisted in a tolerable knowledge of french and italian picked up abroad but she had no decided tastes she read little knew nothing of music and her chief pleasure seemed the care of her flowers and her beautiful needlework for some french nuns had taught her embroidery and lacemaking olivia who was intellectual and well read and who thought deeply on most subjects had soon reached the limits of gretas knowledge but happily there is culture of the heart as well as of the head greta had plenty of sweet womanly virtues she was patient by nature and capable of much longsuffering and endurance her affections were warm and deep but she had hitherto found no fitting scope for them the sad grey eyes told their own story her youthful bloom had been wasted amid sterile surroundings greta williams had one of those strong womanly characters that are meant to be the prop of weaker natures that are veritable towers of strength in hours of adversity it was for this that olivia grew to love her when she knew her better she is so patient she said once when she was discussing her with mrs broderick she has so much staying power and then she never quite loses her faith in anyone however hopeless they seem even marcus has said more than once that her pluck is wonderful but of course it wears her out you must bring her to see me livy returned aunt madge we will have a little tea party and deb shall distinguish herself but greta only smiled faintly when olivia repeated this some day perhaps she said quietly and then her eyes had suddenly filled with tears oh mrs luttrell we have had such a dreadful time nurse only left him a minute and he managed to get to the brandy it must have been robertss fault that the cellarette was unlocked but ever since he has seemed quite mad we were obliged to send for dr luttrell and then at the thought of the grim shadows brooding over that unhappy home olivias little plans seemed out of place mr gaythorne kept his promise and before robert barton left them the picture was sent to the corner house mr barton who had just finished his sketch of dot and the kitten had that moment invited olivia to look at it i may touch it up a bit more but i suppose it will do now he said in a tone of complacency do it is beautifulit is perfectly charming oh if we were only rich enough to buy it for ourselves but looking at him severely you know what my husband said this morning mr barton that he would not allow me to accept it as a gift you are to take it round to that picture dealers in harbut street and see if they will not give you a fair price for it and then you must set about something bigger for the royal academy and though robert barton shook his head in a melancholy dissenting fashion he knew that dr luttrell had been right illustration it is beautifulit is perfectly charming i should have liked you to have it he said with a sigh but i suppose beggars ought not to be generous if i only get on i will paint dot again and then martha had come in with the picture there is no light now i shall have to wait till tomorrow but of course your old gentleman knows that robert barton always spoke of him as the old gentleman but when olivia had first mentioned his name he had seemed a little startled and had questioned her about him he lives alone he said presently it is rather an uncommon name there were some gaythornes in londona firm of solicitorsperhaps it is one of those they make plenty of money sometimes and then the subject had dropped olivia who had promised to spend an hour or two with mr gaythorne that evening looked at the clock and then folded up her work but as she put it away a sudden quick exclamation from robert barton made her look at him he was staring at the picture why it is my own work he said with a flush of pleasure the picture i painted at beyrout and that i sold for a mere song of course the fellow cheated me he was a mean sort of chap but it is not so bad after all and whats thisgoddard well of all the cads he has put his own name to it but i swear i painted it abdul and his son hassan were my models oh i see by your face that you like it mrs luttrell i dont think myself that i ever did anything better isnt it carlyle that says genius is the capacity for taking infinite pains well i took lots of pains with that picture i meant to get it into the royal academy but illluck obliged me to sell it you painted that picture of the prodigal son exclaimed olivia excitedly oh yes i painted it all right it was a nasty trick of goddards putting his name to it look that was abduls wife the one with the distaff the other two were two women i saw sitting under a palmtree one evening well your old gentleman has sent it to the right person to touch it up it shall be done tomorrow before i go olivia was so full of this wonderful piece of intelligence that she could hardly wait until phoebe had closed the library door oh mr gaythorne she exclaimed what do you think your beautiful picture of the prodigal son is mr bartons work goddard is only the name of the man who bought it yes as mr gaythorne looked very much astonished at this you will not call him the gentlemanly tramp any longer now that he is a real artist look here mrs luttrell he said abruptly i dont believe all this you are being gulled goddard painted that picture not barton i hate imposition i daresay the fellow can paint in a pretty amateurish sort of way and he will be able to do my job but i am not going to swallow this without proof tell him to bring the picture back himself and you can come too if you like if he has been imposing on your credulity i shall very soon detect him but olivia was indignant at this of course he shall bring back the picture if you wish it she said a little stiffly and i shall ask him to bring the sketch of dot too and then you will see for yourself how well he paints but he is no impostor i am certain of that but as usual mr gaythorne only held obstinately to his opinion my dear young lady he said irritably you have hardly enough experience to judge in a case like this if mr barton really painted that picture which i deny for goddard painted it he is a worse scamp than i thought him what business had he to be starving on a doorstep or supping off dry bread and thin cocoa in a casual ward my dear we old fellows know the world better than that robert barton is a black sheep and not all your charity can wash him white mr gaythorne was evidently in one of his obstinate moods and olivia thought it prudent to say no more on this subject robert barton would be able to vindicate himself without difficulty when mr gaythorne saw the sketch of dot and the kitten he would be more lenient in his judgment of the young artist during the remainder of her visit she chatted to him cheerfully about a book he had lent her but just before she took her leave she unfortunately broached the subject of her new friend at the mention of her name mr gaythorne started and changed color greta williams he observed with a sharp almost displeased intonation in his voice that is not a common name and she lives in brunswick place yes they have been living there for some years but before that they were in the country but to her surprise mr gaythorne interrupted her impatiently yes yes you said that before go on with what you were telling me about her father he is a dipsomaniac you say and then olivia proceeded with her story is it not sad for the poor girl she observed when she had finished but mr gaythorne made no reply he was sitting in a stooping attitude over the fire and seemed lost in thought his first remark took olivia by surprise have you ever mentioned my name to miss williams he asked with one of his keen searching looks you are very frank mrs luttrell i daresay you have dropped a word or two about me but olivia shook her head i am quite sure that i have not done so i have only seen miss williams four or five times and we have only talked about her own troubles andoh yes a little about mr barton no i am certain that your name has never been mentioned that is well he returned slowly perhaps you will be good enough for the future to leave me out of your conversations when you go to brunswick place the fact is mrs luttrell he went on slowly the williamses were old neighbours of ours and greta and my olive were dear friends but they left the neighbourhood long before we did i never liked mr williams he had a knack of quarrelling with all his friends and we soon came to loggerheads he made himself obnoxious in many ways and i declared i would never enter his house again i am sorry to hear we are such close neighbours what a pity observed olivia regretfully and poor miss williams is so nice oh i have no fault to find with her he returned in a softer voice she was a good creature and my olive was very fond of her at one time she was always in our house and she and alwynlet me see what was i saying interrupting himself with a frown of vexation no there is no harm in the girl and i shall always wish her well for my little olives sake but it would be painful for us both to meet he stopped sighed heavily and then shading his eyes sat for some minutes without speaking olivia rose at last her visit had not been a pleasant one the subjects of conversation had been unlucky she was vexed with herself and yet it was no fault of hers for once mr gaythorne did not try to detain her but there was no want of cordiality in his manner as he bid her goodbye i shall see you tomorrow he said you had better come early as the afternoons are so short but before she had closed the door he seemed again lost in thought that evening robert barton was in high spirits and talked in a most sanguine manner of his future he would set about a picture for the royal academy at once he had his subject ready a group in the casual ward that had greatly impressed him he had sketched it roughly with an old battered leadpencil he had picked up he discussed it with animation all teatime it is just the sort of thing to take the fancy of the public he said i shall take pains with it and work it up patches and all it will be sure to sell and marcus applauded this resolution during the rest of the evening robert barton was excellent company he told storiespathetic stories and comical ones until olivia put down her work to listen and marcuss laugh had more than once brought martha out of the kitchen but towards the end of the evening when olivia brought him a cup of hot cocoa his gaiety suddenly vanished and he looked at her a little sadly tomorrow evening i shall be missing my kind nurse and hostess he said gently and shall be wishing myself back in this cosy parlour and then he added abruptly look here mrs luttrell i am not much of a hand at making pretty speeches but if ever i can do a good turn for you and the doctor i shall be proud and happy to do it he is very grateful marcus observed olivia as she lingered a moment by her husbands side there were tears in his eyes as he said that poor fellow i cannot help liking him there is something debonnaire and boyish about him in spite of all he has been through and certainly he has been very amusing this evening but with a little caressing touch how nice it will be when we are alone again and marcus smiled assent chapter xiv an eventful day forget not thy sins that thou mayest sorrow and repentpetrarch when olivia woke the next morning she was conscious of a curious feeling an indefinable presentiment that she could not put into words how i wish the day were over she said to herself and the thought of her visit to galvaston house and mr gaythornes sharp cynical speeches quite oppressed her i hope he will be civil to mr barton she observed later on to her husband mr barton is very proud and touchy and he will not submit to a course of crossexamination from a stranger i am quite dreading the afternoon but marcus only laughed at her fears barton can hold his own was his reply he is a bit peppery but he is not such a fool as to quarrel with his bread and butter he knows mr gaythorne is a connoisseur and he will put up with a few sarcastic speeches in the hope of future profits mr gaythorne could make him extremely useful he hinted as much to me this morning there are some pictures he wants rehung and one or two that need cleaning and varnishing barton has only got to prove without doubt that he and not goddard painted that picture and then they will get on all right you must just hold your tongue livy and leave them to fight it out and olivia resolved to abide by this prudent advice robert barton worked hard most of the morning and then as the sun shone brightly he went out for a stroll before the early dinner he came back looking so pale and tired that olivia scolded him for taking too long a walk i have not been far he returned sitting down in rather a weary manner and it was so warm and pleasant in the sunshine that i thought it would do me good then he gave a short laugh and said abruptly the fact is something has bowled me overi have seen a ghost then olivia who was clearing the table for the early dinner stared at him oh of course i am only speaking figuratively he went on i suppose it was really flesh and blood that i saw but no ghost could have been more startling i wonderspeaking as though to himselfif my sight deceived me but it was certainly a singular likeness if i had only had the courage to stop and speak but when i recollected myself the opportunity had gonea passing omnibus hindered meand then i was too late did you think it was someone you knew yes very curtlya friend of my happier days but he seemed disinclined to say more he was so silent and moody all dinnertime that dr luttrell looked at him in surprise more than once i suppose you will go straight to your lodgings from galvaston house he said presently it will never do for you to be out late barton and robert barton assented to this i shall just fetch my bag and one or two things i do not suppose we shall be long and then he rose from the table and began putting up his brushes and then took up a book which he read upside down until olivia was ready to accompany him as they crossed the road she said to him gently i am sorry to see that you are a little out of spirits and i am afraid this visit may be rather tryingan elderly invalid has all sorts of fads and cranksbut i hope you will be patient then robert barton smiled pleasantly oh yes i am quite prepared to be regarded as a fraud but i shall soon prove that goddard is the cheat in this case and then they rang the bell and phoebe telling them that her master was still in the diningroom ushered them into the library please tell mr gaythorne we are in no hurry observed olivia vexed that they had come so early but robert barton with one quick glance round the beautiful room busied himself with placing the pictures in the best possible light there he said stepping back with a complacent smile i think your old gentleman will own that the same artist painted those two pictures when he sees them side by side but as he spoke the sound of footsteps made him look towards the open door as he did so olivia saw him suddenly recoil and turn deadly white at the sight of mr gaythorne standing rigid and motionless on the threshold a stifled voice cried alwyn good heavens it is alwynand the next moment the heavy crutchhandled stick fell from the old mans trembling hand with a sudden crash at the sound robert barton shivered and shrank back against the easel olivia picked it up and tried to place it in mr gaythornes hand again but he never noticed her his eyes were fixed with a look of agonised intensity on the white face of the young artist it is alwyn he said again in the same suppressed voice and yet he does not speak or look at me and at the anguish in his tone the young man raised his head father i was not prepared for this he stammered what am i to say to you and then without advancing a step he looked round him wildly father what does this meanam i dreamingwhere are my mother and olive then a low moan of intense pain broke from mr gaythornes lips he does not know oh this is too dreadful mrs luttrell he looked at her almost appealingly as though his strength were gone and then she put her arm round him and guided him gently to a chair sit quiet for a moment she whispered you are not fit for this and as she wiped the cold perspiration from his forehead his ashen look terrified her dear mr gaythorne try to compose yourself shall i ring for mrs cramptonperhaps she would know what to do but he shook his head vehemently no noonly give me time ah look therefor the blind hound that had just come into the room was now whining and fawning upon robert barton in the most excited way eros knows him alwyntrying to raise his voice but it was strangely feeblecome nearer to me when i told you you were never to see my face again that you were no son of mine i was labouring under a grievous mistake i know now who forged that chequei have known it for years no with all your faults you never did that and as he said this mr gaythorne put out a shaking hand to his son but the young man did not take it there was a fierce angry light in his blue eyes and a contemptuous smile on his lips i am glad you have done me this tardy justice sir he said in a firmer tone and that i have heard from your own lips that i am no criminal when we parted i remember you threatened me with penal servitude no i have not disgraced your name to that extent i have starved and nearly died of cold on a doorstep but i have kept my hands clean alwyn exclaimed mr gaythorne piteously i was too hard i will confess that all these years i have been longing to atone and the sorrow and remorse have made me an old man before my time there was much to forgivemuch that you made me bear surely you cannot deny that no sir i will not deny that i was a sad scapegrace but you never took the right way to keep me straight but for my mother and olive i should have run away long before fatherand here there was a frightened look in his eyeswhere are they why are you alone then as mr gaythorne raised his hand with a solemn gesture the young man laid his head down on the mantelpiece and his whole frame shook with convulsive sobs dead oh noimpossible my own mother who always believed in me and my little olive he gasped out more than once mr alwyn observed olivia putting her hand on his shoulder but the tears were running down her face as she spoke your father cannot bear much more i am afraid he is ill but even as she spoke mr gaythorne who had risen from his chair rather stiffly suddenly fell on the rug at his sons feet the next moment the pealing of the bell brought mrs crampton and the frightened servants to the room they found mrs luttrell and the stranger kneeling by the side of the prostrate form but as the housekeeper caught sight of the young artists face she uttered a sudden cry it is mr alwyn she said and the joy of seeing him has killed my master but olivia hushed her send for dr luttrell she said we must do nothing till he comes mr alwynfor the unfortunate young man seemed on the verge of faintingi do not think he is dead it is some sort of attack we must do the best we can for him without moving him until my husband comes but to her intense relief marcus entered a moment afterwards one quick glance at the young artists agitated face gave dr luttrell a vague clue to the mystery but he was soon too deeply engrossed with his patient to think of anything else under his directions a temporary bed was made in the library and the invalid was undressed and laid on it mrs crampton who was a capable nurse carried out the doctors instructions and olivia made herself useful after the first few minutes alwyn had left the room unable to endure the sight any longer an hour or two passed then dr luttrell rose from his seat beside his patient and beckoned his wife from the room livy he said as they stood together by the hall fire i feel a little more sanguine now there is partial consciousness but everything depends on keeping him quiet i shall remain with him tonight and mrs crampton will be with me i want you to tell me what brought on this attack from all your faces i can see something has happened barton looked as if he would have a stroke too oh where is he marcus i have not seen him for more than an hour ah you may well think that something has happened i never was present at such a scene mr barton is his son alwyn they recognised each other in a moment poor mr gaythorne accused himself of harshness and made a sort of apology but mr alwyn looked so angry and contemptuous and would not shake hands and then he asked after his mother and sisterthey are dead you know and then oh he broke down and sobbed so dreadfully that it quite upset me i am sure the poor old man was trying to get to him when he suddenly fell down at his feet and mr alwyn screamed out thinking he was dead yes i see poor little livy what a sad scene but you behaved very well now as there is nothing more you can do suppose you take bartoni mean gaythorneback with you we cant let him go to the models now and it would not be safe to have him here give him some food and talk to him mrs crampton will look after my comforts i will run across later on and tell you how he is and then olivia reluctantly obeyed him marcus was right and she would not venture to contradict his orders but how she longed to stay and share his watch good child he said kissing her you are a splendid doctors wife no fuss and no arguing and this little bit of praise went far to console her promise me that you will take care of yourself and i will do my best for mr alwyn she said nestling up to him for a moment and then the doorbell rang and phoebe with rather a scared face went to the door is dr luttrell here asked a clear voice that they both recognised as greta williamss and then she caught sight of them and stepped into the hall they told me you were here so i ventured to come across she said in a low tone as marcus looked at her anxiously oh there is nothing wrong only nurse forgot to ask you something and as it was a fine evening i said i would call i am coming round later on i am sorry you have had your walk for nothing returned marcus and then they went apart and talked together for a few minutes then marcus went back to his patient and greta joined olivia who was sitting on the oaken settee by the blazing fire she was tired out with the strain of the last two hours and felt in need of a little rest before she went in search of alwyn sit down greta she whispered how strange you should have come to this house but then everything is strange today but here she stopped confusedly as she remembered mr gaythornes injunction why is it strange asked greta innocently there is someone seriously ill here is there not but your servant did not tell me the name how pale and tired you look mrs luttrell i suppose it is some friend of yours who is ill she glanced at olivia questioningly but she only nodded in answer yes it was a sudden attacki think it must have been a stroke oh greta what is itfor miss williams had suddenly risen from her seat with a startled exclamation and was gazing with wide frightened eyes and parted lips into the shadowy corner behind her the next moment robert barton came forward into the firelight with his pale face and fair dishevelled hair he looked almost like a ghost of himself but greta with a little cry held out her hand to him alwyn it is you but how you startled me why did you stand there in that silent ghostly fashion but as he only looked at her in a dazed way and made no answer she turned to olivia mrs luttrell she said piteously what does it all mean why does he not speak to me and we are such old friends is he ill he looks dreadful i should hardly have known himand yetand yetit must be alwyn yes i am alwyn returned the young man in a hollow voice but you must not touch me greta i am not worthy to take your hand i have killed my father chapter xv they were both to blame it befits a son to be dutiful to his fatherplautus as alwyn uttered these despairing words greta shrank back in alarm but olivia with a reassuring smile put her hand gently on his arm do not talk so wildly mr alwyn she said soothingly you are frightening poor miss williams how can you have killed your father when he is not dead my husband has only just left me he seems hopeful about him he thinks consciousness is returning but he must have perfect quiet even our voices may disturb himthat is why i must beg you to come back with me at once you are not deceiving me mrs luttrell returned alwyn suspiciously you are sure that he is not dead quite sure she returned quietly and then again greta put out her hand you will come with us will you not alwyn she said with sisterly tenderness there is so much that i have to hear and that you must tell me and we must not talk here to think that we should have met like this by accidentif there be such a thing as accident in this life of ours but no it was providence that brought me to this house and as olivia followed them down the dark shrubbery she could hear her quiet tones still talking as though to a younger brother olivia was too tired to do more than wonder vaguely as she listened the sight of her own little parlour and marthas sturdy figure arranging the teatable gave her a pleasant revulsion of feeling when martha whispered confidentially as she brought in the lamp the seedcake is nicely baked hadnt i better bring it in maam olivia gave a little hysterical laugh after all that tragedy it was so odd to think of freshly baked cakes yes yes and make the tea quickly she said waving off the little handmaiden impatiently and martha somewhat affronted and vaguely alarmed retreated to the kitchen whats come over the mistress she said to herself i have never known her so huffy but olivia with difficulty recovering her calmness busied herself in ministering to her guests mr alwyn she said gently you must rest on that couchyou are just worn out but a cup of tea will do you good greta you must stop and have some too do you know this is the first time you have entered this house dot is asleep i am going up to see her now would you like to come toofor she guessed intuitively that the girl was longing to question herand greta with a grateful look followed her at once olivia kissed the sleeping child with her usual tenderness how she longed to lie down beside dot and sleep off her overpowering weariness but the days work was not over greta who had only just glanced at the little one put her arms suddenly round olivia and drew her down beside her mrs luttrell she said breathlessly tell me what it all means what has happened to alwyn and what makes him talk so strangely do you know for one moment i believed him in the old time they often quarrelledbut of course it is paralysis and then olivia told her all that had occurred that afternoon greta listened with painful attention then her eyes filled with tears and he never knew that his mother and olive were dead she observed oh mrs luttrell how sadhow terribly sad it all is no wonder he looked bewildered poor fellow it must have been such an awful shock to hear that and then to see his poor father fall at his feet yes and he had been ill too think of all the hardships he has been through and greta shivered as olivia said this how little i thought she said that when you were telling me about the poor young artist that dr luttrell had found on the doorstep on christmas night that it was alwyn gaythorne my old playmate and friend then she added with a sigh what would his poor mother have said she and olive almost worshipped that boy we ought not to leave him too long alone observed olivia wearily i promised my husband that i would look after him we must coax him to take some food and then he must go to bed he is very weak still and all this has exhausted him and as greta evidently shared her anxiety they went back to the parlour they found alwyn pacing the room restlessly he stopped and looked relieved as greta entered i was afraid you had gone he said abruptly do you know you passed me in the street this morning you had that thing ontouching her sealskin mantlebut you were not looking at me i thought it was a ghost and then i tried to follow you but some vehicles got in my way and then you disappeared i wish i had seen you she said softly and then alwyn resumed his restless walk it was with difficulty that olivia could induce him to come to the table and then he could not eat his eyes looked feverishly bright and his cough made greta glance at him anxiously when tea was over olivia left the room for a little alwyn had utterly refused to go to bed until he had seen dr luttrell he was evidently tormented by remorse for his hardness to his father and olivia thought that he might unburden himself more freely to his old friend and she was right on her return she found them talking together and the strained hunted look had left alwyns eyes gretas were swollen with weeping but there was a smile on her lips alwyn has been telling me his troubles she said simply and i could not help crying over them he has suffered so and i felt so sorry for him if only we had not gone abroad but when we came back the grange was empty and no one knew what had become of alwyn he had quarrelled with his father and it was supposed he had enlisted and gone to india and he had talked so often of doing this that i thought it was probably the truth now i must go but i shall come again tomorrow and then she smiled at him and rose from her seat he has talked it all out and it has done him good she observed as she and olivia lingered a moment in the passage but if his father dies alwyn will never get over it oh he is much to blame she went on he has been very wild very imprudent utterly mad and reckless but his poor father was to blame too a highspirited lad like alwyn would not be kept in leadingstrings mr gaythorne was far too strict with himhis own mother said soand yet in his way he loved him how often poor olive would cry about it to me dear dear olive how i loved her and i was very fond of mrs gaythorne too she was so sweet and motherly she always called us her big and her little daughter i was so much taller than olive but thereinterrupting herselfif i begin talking about the old days at the grange i shall never finish but you will come tomorrow yes indeed how could i keep away do you know that for years alwyn and i were just like brother and sisteri dont believe he cared much more for olive than he did for me i think i understood him better than she didhis mother always said so well goodnight dear mrs luttrell i shall come tomorrow as early as i can when olivia went back to the parlour she found alwyn lying back in his chair looking utterly spent and exhausted i believe i shall have to take your advice and go to bed he said all this has taken the starch out of me and i feel dead beatand he looked so ill that olivia half thought of sending for her husband fortunately he came in half an hour later and went up at once to alwyns room he was some time with him and then he came down and told olivia that she had better fill a hotwater bottle and heat some flannel it is a sort of nervous attack he explained and his teeth are chattering with cold and he is shaking as though he were in an ague fit but i am going to mix him a composing draught and he will soon quiet down i have brought him a favourable report of mr gaythorne but he is too weak to be cheered by it this will have done him no end of harm we shall have him in bed for the next day or two olivia gave a tired sigh but she would not add to marcuss burdens by selfish complaints of her own fatigue she would have taken the eiderdown off her own bed but marcus preferred borrowing a couple of blankets from mrs crampton in a few minutes he returned again laden with warm things that the housekeeper had sent for her young masters use and soothed by the unaccustomed comfort and the powerful narcotic alwyn sank into an exhausted sleep it was eleven oclock before olivia could lay her own head on her pillow as dot nestled to her with a sleepy cry the young mother breathed her nightly thanksgiving for her two blessings and then knew no more until martha came to pull up her blinds in the morning when marcus came across for his breakfast he seemed in excellent spirits he had had three or four hours rest and in his opinion the stroke was a slight one mr gaythorne had regained consciousness and though the right arm and his speech were certainly affected he believed that it was only temporary mischief of course one knows at his age that it is the danger signal he went on but i hope with care that his life may be prolonged for years i shall get dr bevan to look at him as i do not care for such undivided responsibility and perhaps it will be well to have a nurse for a week or two mrs crampton is not as young as she was and it is a pity to knock her up as the day wore on there were still more cheering reports mr gaythorne had said a few words almost distinctlyat least dr luttrell had understood him where is alwyn he was quite sure those were his words but he had seemed quite satisfied when marcus told him he was with his wife and had not spoken again olivia had hoped for a talk with aunt madge for it was quite three days since she had been round to mayfield villas but she found it impossible to leave the house alwyn needed a great deal of attention he was very low and depressed marcus had given orders that he was to have frequent nourishment and as mrs crampton had sent phoebe across with a store of good thingssoup and jelly and grapesthere were no demands on olivias simple larder a readycooked pheasant would be sent for his dinner and anything else that he could fancy mrs crampton says that she knows her master would approve so i suppose we need not be too scrupulous observed marcus but at that moment the surgery bell rang dr luttrells services were required at number seventeen and with an expressive look at his wife marcus took up his hat and hastened out olivia had expected greta quite early but she did not make her appearance until late in the afternoon she had been detained she saidnurse had asked her to take her place for a couple of hours and then she looked anxiously at olivia i am afraid alwyn is ill she observed but olivia assured her that it was only a temporary breakdown we have such good news of mr gaythorne that he cannot fail to be cheered but of course he is fretting about the loss of his mother and sister it was such a shock you see and as my husband says we must give him time to pull himself together but you do not look very well yourself greta you are terribly pale oh that is nothing she returned i suppose i was too much excited for i could not sleep for hours i seemed to be living through my old life again they were such happy days mrs luttrell ones existence was not meagre and colourless then i wish you would tell me a little about it all observed olivia as she ensconced greta in the most comfortable chair you cannot imagine how it interests me and then miss williams smiled oh you are so sympatheticthat is your great charm but indeed i love to dwell on that part of my life you know the gaythornes lived at medlicott grange it was a quaint picturesque old house covered with ivy and with a lovely garden there was a limewalk that was delicious on hot summer afternoons i can smell the limes now mr gaythorne who had been abroad a great many years had taken a fancy to the place and half thought of buying it but he changed his mind later we lived at the lodge a much smaller house looking over the village green it was rather an inconvenient house full of small rooms all opening out of each other and long rambling passages but dear mother and i were very fond of it we liked the threecornered little drawingroom with its baywindow where we could sit and work and watch the old men in their grey smocks having a palaver under the big elm in the centre of the green mrs luttrellinterrupting herselfdo you know ivy dene lodge is to let now i saw the advertisement in the standard now i should love to live there again if anything happened to poor father i know i should go back there it is the only place i ever called home dont you love a village green with geese waddling over it and a big pond where little barelegged urchins are always sailing their boats and then the church and the lichgate and the vicarage smothered in creepers why greta what a charming description you quite make me long to see it but it is not as charming as it really is even strangers allow that medlicott is a pretty village it is true that ivy dene has not much of a gardenjust a little patch of lawn and a mulberry tree and a flowerbed or two but as i spent most of my time in the grange garden that did not matter dear mother was always so unselfish she would never let me stay at home with her she thought it good for me to be with young people of my own age and so olive and alwyn and i were always together olive was my friend but i always looked upon alwyn as a dear younger brother he is not really much youngeronly a few monthsbut i was always a little older than my age he must have been very handsome observed olivia and greta coloured slightly yes all the gaythornes were handsome mr gaythorne himself was a fine statelylooking man only a little foreign and unusual in his dress i was always a little afraid of him and i never approved of the way he treated alwyn he had been overindulged and petted in his boyhood but later on his father thwarted him unnecessarily he was always calling him to account for some foolish imprudence and though his mother and olive shielded him as much as possible there were often sad scenes at the grange mr gaythorne had set his heart on alwyns reading for the bar he thought he had sufficient money and influence to warrant the hope that his only son might eventually enter parliament but alwyn had already secretly determined to be an artist he detested his law studies and could not be induced to work and spoilt all his fathers plans as i told you last night finished greta they were both to blame but at the time i could not help taking alwyns part he was not good to his father and often lost his temper and said disrespectful things but mr gaythorne had no right to be so tyrannical when my mother died father would not hear of our living at ivy dene he said he hated the place and we went to america for a year or two and there i heard of olives death olive had told me in her letters of alwyns disappearance there has been an awful scene she wrote poor dear mother has been so ill father thinks that alwyn has done something very wrong but of course neither mother nor i believe it for a moment though it cannot be denied that appearances are terribly against him forgive me dearest greta if i do not enlarge on this painful subject we do not know what has become of alwyn but we think he has enlisted this was the last letter i received from olive before many months had passed she died at rome and her mother did not long survive her chapter xvi busy days rely upon it the spiritual life is not knowing or learning but doing we only know so far as we can do we learn to do by doing and we learn to know by doing what we do truly rightly in the way of duty that and only that we arerev frederick robertson when alwyn heard that greta was downstairs he brightened perceptibly she is a dear creature he said except in looks she has not changed a bit she used to be rather a pretty girlinterestinglooking that was the word for greta but she is very graceful still will you give my love to her mrs luttrell i shall hope to see her tomorrow or the next day and then he turned wearily on his pillow as though talking were too great an effort the following afternoon greta came earlier but as she was unable to stay long olivia found an opportunity of going round to mayfield villas it was just in the gloamingaunt madges rest hour as she called itand there was unmistakable gladness in her voice when olivias tall figure appeared on the threshold welcome welcome little stranger she said merrily do you know livy that you have played truant for four whole days i was just thinking of sending deb round this evening to know if anything were the matter oh i see as her bright penetrating glance read her nieces face you have something wonderful to tell me draw up your chair and i will be as quiet as a mouse i am a splendid listener as my dear fergus used to say something wonderful repeated olivia breathlessly why aunt madge i feel as though i were in the third volume of a sensational novel what do you think robert barton whom marcus found starving on a doorstep is mr gaythornes longlost son alwyn it was evident that mrs broderick was intensely surprised for she quite flushed up with excitement go on tell me everything from the beginning i will not interrupt she said quickly and olivia nothing loath gave a graphic account of the afternoon at galvaston house is it not grand aunt madge she finished but mrs brodericks voice was not so steady as usual as she answered so the blessing has come to him and he will have his hearts desire but there is a heavy load laid on him too poor stricken man oh livy we must just pray for him until he is able to pray for himself his brain is really much clearer today returned olivia he spoke quite sensibly to marcus only his speech is a little affected he asked why his son had left the house and then marcus told him that he was weak and needed rest and that i was taking care of him crampton will see that he has all he requires he said and mrs crampton came over of her own accord last night do you know aunt madge i felt so ashamed of her seeing him in that bare little room and i tried to explain to her that it was only a sort of disused lumber room but she soon made plenty of suggestions for his comfort she has sent a pair of thick curtains for the window and a big rug that nearly covers the floor and a softer mattress and another pillow and now the room looks so cosy marcus quite stared when he went up this morning it was quite touching to see mr alwyn with her he actually kissed her and called her his dear old goody i find she has lived with them ever since they were quite children i think she was olives nurse and the fuss she made over him calling him her poor illused lamb it almost made me cry to hear her poor fellow he has certainly had his fill of husks yes indeed but mrs crampton is determined to kill the fatted calf now the things she sends over would feed half a dozen prodigal sonsgame and soups and jellies and fruit she says her master has given her carte blanche and that the doctor has laid a great stress on nourishment so of course we can say nothing well livy your life is not exactly stagnant just now no indeed but oh there is one thing i forgot to tell you marcus has another patientthat is number five actually the surgery bell rang twice yesterday mrs broderick clapped her hands then she said in a teasing voice are you not glad that you kept martha and olivia laughed why aunt madge she said in an amused tone marcus actually proposed this morning that we should get an older and more capable servant but i told him i would rather work twice as hard than part with martha she is such a good willing little soul of course as long as mr alwyn keeps his room we shall have plenty of running about and dot is cutting some more teeth and is rather fretful so our hands are full but the only thing that troubles me is that i see so little of marcus he is out most of the evening either at galvaston house or in brunswick place alas things are no better there and if this influenza epidemic comes on as the doctors predict he will have a busy spring no doubt but as we have only to live one day at a time we will not trouble our heads about that well you have given me food enough for some days i shall send deb round tomorrow evening to inquire after the invalids but you must not come again until you are more at leisure teething troubles and the care of a sick man are enough for any woman dear aunt madge exclaimed olivia affectionately if i could only be as unselfish as you i do believe you never think of yourself at all nonsense returned mrs broderick i am an old bundle of selfishness well i shall be thinking of those two poor things my heart aches for that young man but i pity his father too i was reading about the deaf man with an impediment in his speech this morning it is the lesson for today you know and i could not help pondering for some time on those words jesus took him apart from the multitude just as though quiet and stillness were needed for the healing i think that is the lesson that sickness teaches us the poor sufferer is led apart to wait for the word of healing sometimes he waits long but the time has not been lost lord it is good for us to be here i think some of us will say that when our painful sojourning at the mount of suffering is over yes it is good for us to have drunk of his cup without complaining aunt madges eyes had a dreamy look in them the beautiful voice vibrated in olives ear like music but as she stooped to kiss her somewhat awed by her unusual solemnity the old kind smile returned to her lips goodbye livy darling my love and congratulations to marcus olivia was putting a good face on things but marcus oppressed with the heavy responsibility of three serious cases hardly knew how hard she worked from morning to night dot feverish and fretful was always wanting to be in her mothers arms martha with all her willingness was too young and inexperienced to be a very efficient help so although olivia always wore a bright expression when marcus came in for his meals and chatted to him in her old cheerful way she was often too weary to sleep it was a relief therefore when alwyn was able to leave his room and lie on the couch downstairs gretas afternoon visits were then a real boon she could leave them together while she went out and did her business olivias healthy robust constitution always needed fresh air and regular exercise confinement to the house tried her and the small rooms and low ceilings at no galvaston terrace were certainly rather cramping half an hours brisk walk always refreshed her and acted like a tonic she would look in at mayfield villas for ten minutes and give her report of the invalids and then come back to tea looking so fresh and invigorated that alwyn once told her that she was as good as a whiff of moorland air alwyn was slow in recovering from that terrible shock his nerves had suffered severely and at times his restlessness and depression were sad to see if he could only be reconciled to his father greta would sigh but the thought of another interview seems to terrify him he is so painfully morbid she went on and distrusts himself he is afraid of saying and doing the wrong thing somehow he seems to have lost all faith in his fathers love i long for his forgiveness i know that i have been a bad son he said yesterday but he will never believe in my penitence oh it is dreadful the way he talks and works himself up marcus says it is a good deal owing to nervous exhaustion returned olivia but he is very sorry for him mr gaythorne has begged more than once to see him he is evidently craving for a sight of him but marcus dare not bring them together yet mr gaythorne is only just able to sit up and he is very weak and then while mr alwyn is in this nervous state he is hardly to be trusted yes we must be patient i suppose i have perfect faith in dr luttrells opinion and then her manner changed and she said mournfully do you know how badly he thinks of father he is afraid he will never leave his bed again yes i know and dr bevan agrees with him poor greta i am so sorry for you and she laid her hand affectionately on her shoulder yes but i dare not murmur returned the girl in a low voice it would be more merciful to let him die than linger on in suffering andwith a little burst of feelingthe disease that is killing him has not been brought on by his own fault oh the gratitude i felt when dr luttrell said that it has been latent in the system and that only lately dr bevan suspected it but oh dear mrs luttrell do not wish him to live no one who cared for him could wish it poor child yes i know marcus explained things to me he is quite himself went on greta drying her eyes and so dear and affectionate but it hurt me so to hear him asking my pardon for the life he had led me i have not deserved such a good daughter he said over and over again since your poor mother died you have been my one blessing dear greta you will let these words comfort you oh yes i was repeating them in my dreams all night when he was talking to me i felt that i had got the old father back what do you think mrs luttrell he actually asked me if i should go on living at brunswick place when he was gone and then it came into my head to tell him about ivydene and he was so interested i am sure he was pleased when i told him that i should like to go back there he actually wanted me to write to the lawyer about it but when he saw how shocked i was at the idea he said perhaps we had better wait a little olivia thought over this conversation when greta left her her heart ached for the lonely girl when marcus came in a few minutes later he seemed struck with her unusual gravity is there anything wrong livy he asked you seem in the doldrums and as she smiled and shook her head he continued cheerfully i am glad to hear it do you know i have actually a free evening until ten i feel as though i was a schoolboy again and had an unexpected holiday in my opinion only busy people know how to enjoy a holiday properly and i am really to have you to myself for three whole hours and olivias face beamed with delight as marcus drew his chair to the fire and took up the longneglected book gretas troubles went into the background oh dont read just now she said imploringly let us talk a little first marcus is it very naughty of me but once or twice during the last few days when you have been too busy to stay with me or to play with dot i have thought that even prosperity will have its limitations that being a successful doctor means that i shall see far too little of you then marcus drew back his head with one of his boyish laughs oh livy what a child you are have you just found out that how delightfully illogical a woman can be it stands to reason that i cannot be in two places at once oh of course your patients will want you and i am not really grumbling do you suppose that i shall not be proud of your success i was only trying to tell you that in spite of all our difficulties and little petty troubles i have been perfectly happy especially on saturday evenings when you totted up your little red book and the balance was always on the wrong side i have seen you pull an uncommonly long face on those occasions i am not quite sure about the perfect happiness then then as olivia looked reproachfully at him his teasing manner changed dear olive he said tenderly i am not really laughing at you i understand quite well what you mean i am not such an old married man that i cannot appreciate a compliment like that when my wife tells me with her own lips that my society can sweeten even poverty and hardship you are quite right love prosperity will have its limitations these pleasant evening hours will often have to be sacrificed but in all professions we must take the rough with the smooth we must just put our shoulder to the wheel you and i and doe the nexte thinge eh livy oh yes she answered eagerly and yours is such a grand work i have always been so thankful you are a doctor when i was quite young i used to tell mother that i wanted to marry a clergyman but i think a doctor comes next oh marcus did you ever read whittiers verses on this subject greta brought me his poems and read them to me i think i know the last two verses by heart beside the unveiled mysteries of life and death go stand with guarded lips and reverent eyes and pure of heart and hand the good physician liveth yet thy friend and guide to be the healer by gennesaret shall walk thy rounds with thee and as olivia repeated the lines in a voice tremulous with deep feeling dr luttrells firm lips unbent with a moved expression that is beautiful he said i think those words ought to be illuminated and hung up in every doctors waitingroom the healer by gennesaret shall walk thy rounds with thee chapter xvii prodigal sons but by all thy natures weakness hidden faults and follies known be thou in rebuking evil conscious of thy ownwhittier it was some few weeks before mr gaythorne was allowed to see any one and then olivia was his first visitor to her great surprise he had asked for her i think i can trust you marcus said to her but there was a trace of anxiety in his manner that did not escape her you must talk to him of course but you must be very careful not to agitate him he wants all his strength for tomorrow for on the following day father and son were to meet again olivia felt a little nervous marcuss professional gravity frightened her do you not think it would be better for me to wait a day or two she asked it is very nice of him to want to see me but it seems to me that mr alwyn ought to be his first visitor but although marcus agreed with her he said that mr gaythorne had expressed such a strong wish to see her first that he dared not refuse him he was never fond of contradiction he returned and we should only excite him if we opposed his wish although he is quite himself little things irritate him dont make yourself nervous beforehand you will say the right thing when the time comes for saying it and though olivia could not be sure of this she felt that it was sensible advice but when the moment came and she saw how shrunken and aged the invalid looked and heard the slight hesitation in his speech as he held out his hands to her with a pathetic smile olivias warm womanly nature was not at fault for she bent over him and kissed his cheek as a daughter might have done dear mr gaythorne she said earnestly if you knew how thankful we all are that you are better thank you thank you he said with a faint flush of pleasure you speak kindly and as though you meant it sit down my dear we must have a little talk together you and i if i ever get my boy back if the breach between us is ever healed it will be owing to you and dr luttrell oh please do not say that we were only the means under providence yes yes with a touch of impatiencei am not forgetting that in some ways i am a civilised heathen but i have never omitted my prayers thank god he loveth best who prayeth best who said that mrs luttrell perhaps i never prayed enough or my boy would not have wandered so far ah well do you remember how hard i was on you for sheltering tramps and now i can only say god bless you for your divine charity olivias eyes glistened but she only pressed his hand in acknowledgment of this and tomorrow you are to see him she said softly yes tomorrow he repeated slowly that is why i must not talk much today but i wanted to thank you for bringing alwyn and to tell you how grateful i am to you both i am an old man he continued old in sorrows more than in years for with jacob i can truly say that few and evil have been my years oh mrs luttrell my dear take warning by me you have a little one of your own and perhap in future years you may have sons growing up beside you never for one instant let anything come between you and them he paused for a moment and then went on when alwyn was a little child i simply worshipped him his own mother begged me with tears in her eyes not to set my heart so much on him he was delicate and i knew what she meant that she feared whether we should rear him and i remember as she said this that i struck my hand passionately against his little cot if that boy dies i shall never hold up my head again how well i remember that speech oh my dear the time came when i wished that i had no son when the sharpness of the serpents tooth entered my very vitals god grant that you and dr luttrell may never have to blush for a sons misdoings dear friend remember you are not to agitate yourself no no i will take care but i think it does me good to talk a little the steam must have vent you know and i have kept silence for so many years all these weeks they have kept my boy from me but they were right his voice trembling with weakness i could not have borne it neither could alwyn ah how changed and ill he looked dear mr gaythorne returned olivia beseechingly indeed i must go away now unless you will consent to rest and let me read to you a little well well do as you like he replied closing his eyes you all tyrannise over the sick man but perhaps i am a bit tired and then olivia found a book and soon had the satisfaction of seeing him sink into a peaceful sleep what a grand face it looked with its fine chiselled features and grey peaked beard lying against the dark red cushions alwyn would never be such a handsome man as his father olivia thought there was power and intellect on the broad forehead the thin lips and obstinate chin were hidden under the drooping grey moustache olivia sat by him for some time and then softly left the room when marcus had paid his evening visit he was able to assure her that her little visit had done his patient no harm mr gaythorne had stipulated that he should see his son alone but dr luttrell who was keenly alive to the danger of any strong excitement had decided to remain in the house during the interview alwyn seemed so unnerved and miserable that it was impossible to do more than give him a word of warning say as little as possible gaythorne he had observed as they walked across together if you take my advice you will just let bygones be bygones dont be more emotional than you can help remember how ill he has been very little excites him and though alwyn only nodded in answer to this marcus was sure that he understood him but as he stood by the hall fire caressing eros he could not help feeling very anxious they are neither of them to be trusted he thought and he determined that if the talk were too prolonged he would make some excuse to go in and interrupt them then he raised his head uneasily and listened as the sound of a mans stifled sobs reached his ear it was what he had feared that alwyn weak and unstrung would break down utterly and the next moment dr luttrell had opened the door of the library neither of them perceived him as he stood for a moment watching them with keen professional eyes alwyn was kneeling with his face hidden on his fathers knees and mr gaythornes clasped hands were resting on his head my boy we must both say it he whispered forgive us our trespasses as we forgive thembut marcus heard no more he closed the door again softlythe scene was too sacrednot even to his dearer selfhis wifedid he ever speak of what he had seen the prodigal had eaten his fill of husks and had returned to his fathers roof and his fathers love but in this case the father had also sinned for surely undue severity and exacting hardness and failure of sympathy are sins to be bitterly repented no one can gather grapes of thorns or glean corn from a harvest of tares and no parent who has first unwisely indulged his son and then ruled him with a rod of iron can well claim the glad obedience of a free son if alwyn gaythorne trammelled and embittered by his fathers tyranny had dashed recklessly down the path that leads to destruction his father had first driven him to the verge of frenzy young limbs will not always adjust themselves to the procrustean bed alwyn who had inherited his fathers strong will refused to bear the yoke of his despotism i would rather starve and have room to breathe he had once said to greta there is no room here another halfhour passed before dr luttrell ventured into the room again he found mr gaythorne leaning back in his chair looking very white and exhausted but with a peaceful expression on his face alwyn had just left his side and was standing by the window with a miniature in his hand dr luttrell observed the old man feebly as he gave him some restorative my son will stay with me tonight and then alwyn flushed as he met the doctors eyes he wishes it very much and perhaps it will be better he said in a low voice will you explain how it is to mrs luttrell i will see her tomorrow very well but there must be no more talking tonight if you will go into the next room i will see you presently and alwyn nodded it is all right happiness never kills observed mr gaythorne and for the matter of that grief either we must just bide our time then with a flash of strong feeling in the deeplyset eyes he held out his hand to the young doctor god bless you luttrell he says you have been like a brother to him and as for your wife he has no words for her goodness may heaven repay you both for what you have done for me and my boy when marcus returned home he found greta sitting with his wife they both looked at him anxiously mr gaythorne will not part with his son he informed them mrs crampton is getting a room ready for him so your labours will be lightened livy she looks tired does she not miss williams though she will not confess it well it has all passed off well mr gaythorne is very much exhausted but nurse is getting him to bed and i have told alwyn to rest i left mrs crampton fussing round him so he will be all right and then olivia smiled as though she were satisfied but more than once that evening she observed to marcus how quiet the house seemed without their guest do you know i quite miss him she said i suppose one always get attached to any one for whom one takes trouble he was the sort of person who was always wanting something you could never forget him for a moment i wonder what martha will say when i tell her he is gone away for good he gave her plenty to do but i expect she will be sorry to lose him and olivia was right martha burst out crying in quite a lamentable manner oh maam she sobbed and he was such a kind young gentleman i am sorry that i am that he wont live with us no more and he painted miss baby and the kitten so beautiful too and he thought such a deal of you and master but though olivia smiled at marthas lugubrious speeches she could not help being rather sorry herself alwyn was not a perfect character by any means but somehow he had such nice ways with himlittle caressing ways that go to a womans heart his nature was affectionate and emotional and all his troubles had not hardened him even marcus had observed more than once lately that he could not help liking the fellow he was not cut out for a black sheep he said once and the character does not suit him he has the makings of a good man only he has let himself drift so terribly well he has pulled himself up in time he could not have roughed it much longer when olivia returned from her next visit to galvaston house she went straight to marcus i just felt i must come and tell you all about it she said in her enthusiastic manner i have had such a happy afternoon mr alwyn was reading to his father when i went in and they both looked so comfortable and contented they made me stay and pour out their coffee for them at first mr alwyn wanted to leave us he declared that two was company and three none and that he was only in the way but of course i would not hear of that and i was so glad to see him too illustration they both looked so comfortable and contented he is his fathers right hand already and does all sorts of things for him it is so lovely to see them together when he went out of the room for a moment mr gaythorne told me that he could scarcely realise sometimes that it was alwyn he has just olives ways had been mr gaythornes words i could almost fancy it was my little olive near me if he were only stronger i should not have a wish ungratified but i cannot help troubling about his cough dr luttrell thinks a sea voyage would do him good but i do not know how i am to bring myself to part with him oh bythebye did alwyn tell you that greta williams is coming to see us she was my olives friend so of course she will be welcome and then in rather a meaning voice i rather think she is alwyns friend too olivia made no answer to this remark but more than once lately she had noticed that greta and alwyn seemed very much engrossed with each other and she was almost sure that marcus had noticed it too surely greta would never consent to marry him she thought with her sad experience she would never venture to link her life with a man whom she could not wholly respect gretas nature was a noble one she had lofty aims and a high sense of duty in spite of her gentleness she had plenty of firmness and backbone it was one thing to be sorry for her old friend and playmate and to show him a sisters tenderness but quite another to give herself to him and more than once olivia had felt uneasy but delicacy had led her to keep her thoughts to herself i do hope she would not carry selfsacrifice to such a length as that said the young wife to herself alwyn may be lovable but he would never satisfy a girl like greta a woman ought to be able to look up to her husband as i look up to my dear marcus and not be always trying to drag him up to her level i do want greta to be married when her father dies she will be so utterly alone but i cannot reconcile myself to her marrying alwyn gaythorne for one thing his health is so unsatisfactory that his wife would never be easy about him eyen marcus owned the other day that he feared he would never be fit for much but there is no use in trying to manage other peoples lives as aunt madge says it takes all our strength and cleverness to manage our own a meddler is always a muddler how well i remember her saying that we did not make the world and we cannot rule the world when i see grownup folk trying to arrange for other people i always think of children playing at snapdragon one gets ones fingers burnt so badly when we try to pull out our neighbours plum no no bearing other peoples burdens never meant that chapter xviii aunt madge gives her opinion death is a black camel that kneels at the gate of allabdelkader after all the dreaded influenza epidemic did not make its appearance and though people still talked learnedly of germs and microbes and put meddling fingers into the medical pie it was decided by the legitimate authorities that the mischief had blown over for the present it is a curious fact that there is a fashion even in talk a subject is discussed until it is worn threadbare when the germ theory was exhausted the bicycle craze took its place perhaps future students of hieroglyphics may yet discover in some palimpsest that in old days the egyptian maidens had quaint iron machines that carried them swiftly through the desert in the early march days when the winds were keen and blusterous mr williams died his end was very sudden greta had just retired to her room for the night when the nurse noticed a change in him and hastily summoned her a messenger was sent for dr luttrell but before he could reach the house mr williams was dead he could have done nothing if he had been there that was the sole comfort marcus could give to the stricken daughter and she knew that he spoke the truth the bow of the king of terrors is never drawn at a venture the arrow goes deep and true but to greta and olivia he was only the angel of sorrow who did his masters bidding alwyn in after years worked out this idea in a noble picture called the house of mourning the little one evidently the sole child and heir of a goodly heritage lay panting out his feeble life on the pillow the brokenhearted parents bent over him hand in hand the filmy look of unshed tears in the mothers eyes was wonderfully rendered on the threshold stood a kingly presence in dark trailing robes of majesty and a starry crown on his head the face solemn and beautiful wore an expression of infinite pity the arms were stretched out to the child with a gesture of tenderness underneath was written those striking words is it well with the child and the answer it is well it was that picture that made alwyn gaythornes name olivia hurried round to brunswick place as soon as her husband broke the news to her and spent the greater part of each day there for the next week or two it was touching to see how the poor girl clung to her friends she would do nothing without their advice dr luttrell saved her as much as possible he and alwyn did the necessary business and olivia brought her work and dot and strove in every way to cheer and console her it was a very quiet funeral only marcus and his wife and alwyn and the lawyer were present when they went back to the house the will was read the provisions were perfectly simple everything with the exception of a few minor legacies was left to gretathe house in brunswick place and an income of nearly three thousand a year olivia opened her eyes a little widely when she heard this she had no idea that greta would be such a rich woman but greta herself seemed utterly indifferent how am i to live on here alone she said with an outburst of grief when she found herself left with olivia dear mrs luttrell you must both help me all my friends must help me to some decision but to live alone in this house just because it belongs to me oh i cannot do it with a sudden shiver of repulsion i would sooner go into a hospital and learn nursing but when olivia repeated this speech to marcus he only smiled an attractive young woman with three thousand a year will soon discover some object of interest he said a little dryly but it would hardly do to hint at this just now nursing in a hospital is a fine work no doubt for anyone who has a vocation but you may as well tell miss williams not to ask my advice she has not the physical strength besides in her position the idea is absurd why take the bread out of other womens mouths no no just counsel her to patience and in a few months we shall see which way the wind blows for though no word had yet passed between them marcus was quite aware of alwyn gaythornes penchant for his old playfellow though the idea was hardly more pleasing to him than it was to olivia there is not enough of him he said to himself he does not come up to her mark it is not her money for mr gaythorne is a rich man and his son will have plenty but she stands on a higher plane than his and in my humble opinion miss williams could do better for herself strange to say mrs broderick differed from them she had already made gretas acquaintance and they had mutually taken to each other greta had been charmed with mrs brodericks cheerfulness and quaint speeches and aunt madge in her turn had declared herself fascinated by gretas gentleness she is exactly my idea of a young english gentlewoman she had said after her first visit i thought the article had gone out of fashion oh as olivia looked shocked at this i grant you there are hundreds and thousands of good honest girls im thankful to say but they are so terribly outspoken and up to date of course i am only an oldfashioned frump and sadly behind the times but though slang may not be sinful and a little outward roughness is only the husk and there is plenty of sweet sound kernel inside yet i must own livy i like gentleness as well alwyn and aunt madge were already firm friends she shared his artistic tastes and could talk intelligently to him on the subjects he liked best and from the first she refused to see any defects in him my dear livy she once said when olivia had made a somewhat disparaging remark about his want of steadiness you are far too critical you judge men by marcuss standard but you must remember every one is not a moral son of anak now mr alwyn is a great favourite of mine and i think highly of him few young men would be so goodnatured as to come two or three times a week to chat with an elderly invalid and yet that is what mr alwyn does and he knows i enjoy his visits yesterday when he came in he found miss williams sitting with me and they both looked as pleased as though they had not met for years and it made me feel quite young to look at them oh in an exasperated tone as olivia shook her head i know what that meansthat you and marcus forbid the bannsbut you might just as well try to stop an express train with a penny whistle so you may as well save your breath those two mean to take each other for better or worse they dont know it themselves yet but it is written already in the book of fate oh aunt madge how can you say such things you have not seen greta more than three or four times all the same the oracle has spoken with a wise nod of her head my dear greta williams was born into this world to be someones crutch a strong healthyminded man could not utilise her best qualities she would be simply wasted on him she has got to mother her husband you see and that is what mr alwyn wants his wife to do leave them alone they will soon find out their need of each other and then they will settle matters and for pitys sake olive dont you try and put a spoke in their wheel but olivia who was a little huffy on the subject refused to say another word it was no business of hers or anyones she said pointedly whom alwyn gaythorne chose to marry but in her opinion it was always a pity to couple names together beforehand and with this virtuous snub she rose to take her leave but mrs broderick only indulged in one of her hearty laughs livy i do declare you are actually cross with mewell there i will not say another word dont look as though i have been talking treason i quite allow your greta is too good for any ordinary faulty man and that even my young friend is not worthy of her and at this admission olivias brow cleared thank you for saying that aunt madge i know we do not really differ onlyonly with a little laugh you are always so ready for a lovestory yes i love a lover returned mrs broderick playfully and then her manner changed no i will not jest about it life and death and love are no subjects for jeststhey are three splendid realities yes my dear olive you are right and lovestories even the poorest interest me havent i lived mine do i not know how it glorifies life but we can only read the first chapters herethere is eternity for us presently the many mansions i think i love those words more than any in the bible they always make me think that even there there will be a special home for fergus and me and our boy olivia certainly found it difficult to satisfy the various claims on her her household tasks occupied most of the morning as long as martha remained their sole domestic it was necessary for the mistress to superintend the cooking to look after marcuss comfort was her first and paramount duty and it was seldom that she found herself at leisure until the afternoon and then she and greta were generally together either at brunswick place or galvaston terrace sometimes she would combine her duties by taking greta with her when she went to mayfield villas but she never ventured to take her to galvaston house after her first visit as she found that mr gaythorne preferred her to come alone miss williams is all very well he said once and we are always pleased to see her but i like my pleasures singly besides alwyn always monopolizes her invalids are allowed to be exacting so i may tell you plainly that i like to have you to myself and after that olivia went alone it was always a pleasure to her to go there she had such a warm welcome from the father and son and it did her heart good to see the light of happiness in the old mans eyes he seemed hardly able to bear his son out of his sight alwyns health his comforts and his tastes were his chief topics of conversation one day he made alwyn take her upstairs and show her the new studio that had been planned two rooms were to be thrown into one and a fresh window put in directly the work was commenced he and alwyn were going to bournemouth for a few weeks the seavoyage had been postponed for the present mr gaythorne fretted himself at the idea of parting so soon with his boy and he hated the thought of his going alone if there were someone to look after him he would say to dr luttrell but i feel as though i could never trust him to take care of himself again look at him he is a perfect wreck and though marcus still held to his opinion that a long voyage would be his best remedy he thought it more prudent to wait a little and on his side alwyn seemed reluctant to go i have been too much my ain lane already he said i should prefer to stay at home a little longer and then bournemouth was selected as a compromise mrs crampton would go with them and at mr gaythornes request marcus went down first and chose their rooms why not go from saturday to monday and take your wife down i will frank your expenses he said and the little trip will do you both good and though marcus hesitated over this as martha was too young to be trusted with the care of dot greta came to the rescue by undertaking to look after the child olivia could scarcely believe her ears when this magnificent project was unfolded to her two whole days with marcus by the sea and they had neither of them had an outing since their modest weddingtripa week at st leonards it will be another honeymoon she said flushing with pleasure and as they sat together in the hotel garden that saturday evening she thought of the humble lodging to which marcus had taken her and what fun they had got out of their first attempt at housekeeping the little change did them both good but though neither of them would have owned it for the world no galvaston terrace certainly looked a little dreary on their return the bright spring weather only made the dinginess more apparent but nothing would induce the landlord to treat them to a fresh coat of paint marcus whitewashed one or two of the rooms in the intervals of his work and olivia put up clean curtains and purchased a plant or two as far as scrupulous cleanliness could avail the little house was in firstrate order nevertheless marcus gave vent to an impatient sigh now and then as he looked round the small low room the side windows had been blocked up in the days of the windowtax and the one small window lighted the room imperfectly if we could only move he said once i want you and dot to have more light and air we are too near the cemetery too we should do much better in compton street or norfolk terrace and then as olivia looked at him in surprise he said a little impatiently oh i know it is not to be done yet we shall have to want a little longer i believe it was that insufferable woman mrs tolman put it into my head she actually told me that we ought to move as no good class of patients would ever come to galvaston terrace it was just like her impudenceeh livy oh marcus i am so sorry and olivia put down her work and looked at him sympathetically i thought something had annoyed you the moment you came in it is too bad of mrs tolman always to tread upon peoples corns in this fashion she might wait until one asks her advice oh but it is true all the same he returned with a tinge of despondency in his voice a good house in a good neighbourhood would make all the difference to the practice a house in brunswick place for example but olivia only laughed someone besides myself can build aircastles she said archly you might as well go on marcus why not be dr bevans partner too then marcus started and an odd little smile played round his mouth the very same thought had already occurred to him chapter xix dame fortune smiles of pleasures those which occur most rarely give the greatest pleasureepictetus dr luttrells fit of pessimism did not last long the very next day he had a sharp twinge of remorse when he went round to galvaston house to take leave of his patient and mr gaythorne put a slip of folded paper in his hand i am an old man he saidand his thin fingers held the young doctors hand in a firm graspand i am using an old mans privilege i know what a hard uphill fight life is at present to you and i should like to ease the burden a little and to marcuss intense and overwhelming surprise he found it was a cheque for five hundred pounds marcus never could remember what he said but his first attempt to stammer a few words of gratitude for this unexpected and magnificent gift was promptly checked it is all very well observed alwyn rather gloomily when olivia told him of his fathers munificence she had shed tears of joy when marcus had shown her the cheque my father has settled up accounts with dr luttrell after his own fashion but he has not paid my debts and then in a deeply moved voice there are some debts that cannot be paid i was a stranger and ye took me in how many doors do you suppose mrs luttrell would have opened to a starving outcast that christmas night and then his blue eyes flashed with an expression of intense feeling that became him well i shall never be able to repay either of you i shall never try he went on do you know as i lay on that doorstep too weak and stiff to move and the doctor bent over me it seemed to me in my dazed condition as though it were the face of a beneficent angel god bless you both for you have made a man of me and then he lifted the kind womanly hand to his lips olivia missed her friends at galvaston house sorely but she had more time to devote to greta one day they had a pleasant outing together greta who still hankered after her old home had proposed that she and olivia should go down to medhurst together it is only an hours journey she observed and there is a dear old inn where we could have tea and just now it will be at its best the horsechestnuts will be out in the grange garden and the pink and white may at ivy dene and olivia consented readily but though she thoroughly enjoyed the little expedition and fell in love with medhurst and the old church the longedfor visit was only productive of disappointment to greta ivy dene in olivias eyes was not a desirable abode the rooms were low and cramped and had a mouldy disused smell in them even the little threecornered drawingroom with the baywindow overlooking the village green and the elmtree did not please her the solitary old man in a smockfrock with a red handkerchief knotted loosely round his lean old throat might be a picturesque object in the distance but on wet days she fancied even the green might be a dreary outlook as they sat over their tea in the little inn parlour she gave her opinion in her usual downright fashion dear greta she said i do not advise your taking this step ivy dene lodge would want a good deal of money spent on it to make it decently habitable and even if it were painted and papered from garret to basement it would never be a really comfortable house all those small rooms opening into each other are so inconvenient and then it is damp i am sure marcus would say so and then i am certain you would be moped to death there are no young people at the grange only that stout middleaged couple we met in the ponycarriage and the vicar is old and a widower i do think it would be terribly dull for you and greta owned rather regretfully that her friend was right her poor little aircastles had crumbled into nothingness her longings for the sweet country air and rustic quiet were doomed to be frustrated in her heart she felt that olivia was wise a solitary life at ivy dene would hardly content her and after all was she so ready to leave brompton she had found friends therereal friendsthe luttrells and mrs broderick and the gaythornes and though she still felt terribly lonely in her big house perhaps it would be better for her to wait a little i suppose i should feel rather like a ghost if i tried to settle here she said presently i do not think so badly of poor little ivy dene as you do it would be quite large enough for me but somehow medhurst itself seems changed after tea they walked to the grange and asked leave to go into the garden and greta showed her friend the lime walk and the orchard and the big elmtree where they had swung their hammock i think it looks just as lovely as it did in the old days she said as they paced down the smooth velvety lawn and even olivia allowed that the grange had not disappointed her it was a fine picturesquelooking house and as they passed to the front she had a glimpse of a handsome hall panelled in oak if you could only live at the grange she said and greta smiled mrs broderick told her niece that she was growing very gay and worldly actually marcus had taken her and greta to the royal academy one afternoon and they had sat in the park afterwards and olivia in her new spring dress and hat had looked the embodiment of youth and freshness and another afternoon they had gone to st jamess hall to hear sarasate livy has had more work than play i mean her to enjoy herself a little he said when aunt madge accused him playfully of spoiling his wife but olivia refused to endorse this no one could be happier she told herself day after day marcuss practice was certainly improving and he was getting very intimate too with dr bevan and it was already settled between them that he should look after dr bevans patients while he was away in august dr bevan had an extensive practice and was not young and dr luttrell suspected that he would soon take a partner he had complained more than once lately that he was sadly overworked but marcus never could be sure if these hints were intentionally dropped to be dr bevans partner would be the acme of his ambition but in that case a good house would be absolutely necessary olivia had only been joking when she had made the observation she had no idea that marcus even entertained such an idea for a moment but marcus who had his foot on the first rung of the ladder was eager to climb all his spare time was spent in study he still went to the models to gain experience he would say but in reality because the people loved to have him and because it gratified his organ of benevolence as the summer wore on the weather became exceedingly hot and oppressive and greta who had taken a small house at eastbourne for july and august insisted on carrying off olivia and dot for the first month it would be doing me the greatest kindness she said almost tearfully as she gave the invitation for how could i enjoy anything alone dr luttrell has promised to run down from saturday to monday and perhaps we could even induce him to stay longer and it would do dot so much good and it was this last consideration that had the greatest weight with olivia but oh marcus how am i to leave you she began in rather a dismal voice but marcus soon proved to her that he was only too willing to part with her my good child he said the idea of your hesitating for a moment miss williams is behaving like a brick and she had planned it all beforehand too do you suppose she would have taken a house if she had not meant you and dot to go too but marcus she pleaded i do not really need the change you only said yourself the other day that i had never looked so well yes and eastbourne will enable you to keep well he returned cheerfully think of a month of sea breezes does not your maternal heart swell at the idea of dot in a big sunbonnet stumping over the beach with her spade and bucket why you and miss williams will be as happy as the day is long oh no not without you marcus returned olivia tenderly do you think any enjoyment would be perfect without my husband but as marcus quietly reasoned with her she yielded at last with a good grace i could not well refuse aunt madge could i she said to her usual confidante when greta wanted me so and then it will do baby so much good marcus declares that martha will manage all right and that he will not be dull and he has promised to spend a whole week with us if he can and really it is so very very kind of greta and she is so happy about our coming you are a wise woman livy replied aunt madge and i am proud of you and so is marcus for we both of us know you are making a brave effort deb shall give martha a helping hand now and then when i can spare her and marcus has promised to have a cup of tea and chat with me sometimes on his way home from the models bythebye when do mr gaythorne and mr alwyn return but olivia could not answer this question galvaston house would not be ready for them until the end of july she knew that in his last letter to marcus alwyn had spoken of their going on to scarborough he had given a good account of his father he was less feeble and walked better but bournemouth was too relaxing and they both felt the need of more bracing air i shall keep him away until september unless he turns restless he had finished and marcus had strongly commended this greta sometimes heard from alwyn he wrote to her from time to time and she would read his letters to olivia the house that she had taken at eastbourne was charmingly situated from the windows they had a view of the sea and beachy head in the distance marcus took them down and settled them in and after the first few days olivia got over her homesickness and thoroughly enjoyed her life in the mornings they were always on the beach with dot either reading or working or watching the happy groups of children in the afternoons and evenings they either drove or walked over the downs greta who was resolved to spare no expense had hired a pretty little victoria for the month when marcus came down for his promised week he spent most of his time boating and one or two days they went out in a sailingboat and carried their luncheon with them both greta and olive proved themselves good sailors greta had entreated her friend to prolong her visit but olivia would not hear of this martha had been left long enough she said decidedly and she could not remain away from marcus any longer and marcus was too glad to get his bright companion back to say a dissenting word oh aunt madge i have had such a splendid time were olivias first words when she went round to mayfield villas on the morning after her return greta has been such a dear she has thoroughly spoilt me but the loveliest time of all was the week marcus spent with us you look the very essence of a sunbeam livy returned mrs broderick with an admiring look but what a nutbrown mayde you have become well was marcus pleased to get his wife and child back and then olivia smiled happily for only she knew how she had been missed dr bevan left town early in august and dr luttrell took up his position as locum tenens and in spite of the emptiness of london found plenty of work sometimes as olivia walked in the direction of brunswick place with dot toddling beside her the victoria with its bay horses would pass her how olivia would dimple with amusement as marcus gravely lifted his hat to her ever after a victoria with bay horses figured in olivias chateaux despagne greta complained bitterly of her dullness when her friends had left eastbourne has lost its charms she wrote and the crowds of people on the parade only make me feel more lonely if it were not for fear of dr luttrell i should come back to brunswick place at once but i dare not run the gauntlet of his sarcasms my one amusement is making smocks for dot i have finished the pale blue one and it looks lovely and now i have begun a creamcoloured one in spite of your stuckup pride olive you cannot prevent me from working for my darling dot this reproachful sentence was the outcome of a hot argument greta had tried in her affectionate way to lavish gifts upon her friend but olivia had steadily refused to allow this no greta she had said you do far too much for me already i have been treated like a princess for a whole month but i will not have presents heaped on me even poor people have their feelings you know and rich people must respect them but this dignified speech made no impression on greta you may call it proper pride she said contemptuously but i call it selfishness for you are just depriving me of my greatest pleasure well if you choose to be stiff and obstinate you must have your way but you cannot hinder me from finishing those smocks and olivia who was full of admiration for gretas exquisite smocking announced graciously that the smocks were to be the exception i was obliged to put my foot down marcus she said afterwards or she would have bought everything i admired perhaps i am proud but no one but my husband or aunt madge shall buy my frocks and as olivia said this she held up her head and looked so dignified and handsome that marcus refrained from teasing her evidently such pride was no fault in his eyes and it was certain that he very much enjoyed choosing his wifes gowns greta was the first to return the gaythornes stayed away until the middle of september when alwyn paid his first visit olivia was rejoiced to see the improvement in him he had gained weight and flesh and looked very handsome but marcus was less satisfied with mr gaythorne he is an old man before his time he observed i am afraid he will never throw off his invalid habits now he can just potter about in the sunshine and amuse himself with his flowers and museum but he will never be capable of work again the least effort to concentrate his thoughts for more than a few minutes seems to irritate his brain nothing pleases him better than to creep up to the grand new studio and watch alwyn at his work i shall be proud of him yet he said that to me yesterday and if you had seen his face livy when he said it chapter xx somebodys crutch of all the paths that lead to a womans love pitys the straightestbeaumont and fletcher one afternoon in october olivia sat at her work in the front parlour she was expecting greta to join her and more than once she had looked at the clock on the mantelpiece as though wondering at her lateness the foldingdoors were open the young couple had taken advantage of their improved circumstances to add to their scanty stock of furniture the diningtable and mahogany chairs bought secondhand in dr luttrells bachelor days and the small ugly chiffonier had been moved into the smaller and duller back room and the front parlour had been transformed into a dainty sittingroom gretas skilful fingers and good taste had been placed at her friends service to gratify marcuss love of comfort two really handsome saddleback chairs were beside the fireplace and a little round table occupied the centre of the room a secondhand writingtable with drawers had been picked up in the city as a great bargain and appropriated for marcuss use over it hung the sketch of dot and the kitten long ago presented by the grateful artist the pretty blue carpet and curtains gave an air of finish by marcuss desire the foldingdoors were always kept open and olivia no longer felt herself stifled for want of air this afternoon the little sittingroom looked at its best a bowl of darkred cactus dahlias stood on the table an offering from alwyn and a magnificent lilium auratum a gift from greta blocked up the diningroom window when the doorbell rang olivia laid down her work with a pleased smile and the next moment greta entered the room how late you are you naughty girl she said kissing her affectionately i have been sewing for the last hour yes i know something unforeseen detained me and then greta dropped her eyes in sudden embarrassment and blushed oh olive dear can you guess what i have to tell you this afternoon and then olivia looked at her steadily do you mean she began anxiouslybut greta blushing still more rosily interrupted her yes i do mean it and olive dear friend truest of friends you must congratulate me for i am so happy you take my breath away greta are you and alwyn actually engaged yes dear we settled it this afternoon but of courseof course i have known for weeks what he meant and wished he has gone round now to tell his father and will be here presently dear olive why are you so silent are you not glad about this i am glad that anything should make you happy returned olivia gently and you know how deeply interested i am in your and alwyns welfare but forgive me greta if i ask one question are you sure are you perfectly sure that this step will be for your happiness then greta looked at her in surprise and there was a reproachful expression in her grey eyes sure when i have loved him all these months my dear olive what can you mean alwyn is the only man i could ever marry oh how it relieves me to hear you say that dear greta i am so fond of you both alwyn is charming but until you said that i was afraid to congratulate you you know my views on this subject dear do you remember how we talked on the beach at eastbourne i am afraid that more than once i made you a little sad but i was thinking of this i knew then in my own mind that alwyn had begun to care for you and i wanted you to have plenty of time for consideration oh yes you made your meaning clear to me even then returned greta smiling but indeed no consideration was necessary when alwyn came to me and said quite simply that he loved me and wanted me to be his wife i just put my hand in his without a word it almost shocked me to see his gratitude he kept saying over and over again that he was not worthy of me that he knew he had done nothing to win my respect and i should not be able to look up to him oh olive he quite broke down when he said this but i soon comforted him i only remember two things i said to himthat you love me and that you need me and after that we understood each other dearest greta aunt madge was right when she told me that you were born into the world to be somebodys crutch did she say that and gretas eyes had a dreamy look in them but i tell alwyn that i mean to lean on him indeed olive you must not undervalue him alwyn is stronger than you think he has repented truly and deeply of all his boyish mistakes and those who love him should utterly and for ever wipe out the record of his past see how devotedly his father loves him his forgiveness was absolute dear you need not say any more and olivia embraced her with tears in her eyes i can only wish you all the happiness you deserve in that case my happiness would be little enough but of course i know what you mean and olive for the first time in my life i can say with truth that i have found my vocation it will be such a privilege to be allowed to take care of alwyn he is far from strong and he will need care for a long time i wonder if you know the feeling i have about that with dr luttrell you cannot have had it you have never been anxious about him and then he has always taken care of you but i shall always have to think for alwyn oh you are right there we shall think for each other she went on fearing that she had admitted too much and there is one thing of which i am certain that i shall have every right to be proud of him do you know what his father says that he has genius unmistakable genius and he is no mean judge mark my words he will be an ra yet he only said that to me a few days ago marcus thinks the same but greta there is one thing if you marry alwyn you will have to take his father too you can never separate them those were alwyns very words returned greta with a soft flush which made her look years younger but indeed i love him already for alwyns sake and because he is so good to him oh olive dear if you knew the joy it will be to me to have someone for whom i can care again i do not want my life to be too easy or free from responsibility but i do want it to be real actual life mrs broderick and i were only talking about it yesterday she says what single women miss in their lives is some absorbing interest a work that shall fill up all the crannies oh aunt madge is very strong on that point i remember before i knew marcus that we had wonderful talks on this subject she used to be so fond of quoting carmen sylvas speech a woman does not become a mother she is a mother from her birth a womans family satisfies her vocation but does not create it and she used to tell me to mother my pupils you must love them hard she would say and live their young lives as well as your own but thank god we can always find objects for our love i should make you laugh greta if i told you how i mapped out my future as an old maid but i am quite sure i should have made a good one just then the doorbell rang and alwyn entered he looked eager and excited well has she told you were his first words as olivia met him with outstretched hands and then as she warmly congratulated him his eyes glowed with feeling i have not deserved such a prize have i mrs luttrell but greta has promised to make the best of me will you forgive me if i take her away for a little my father is most impatient to welcome his new daughter and he will only excite himself if we keep him waiting go with him greta dear returned olivia mr alwyn will bring you back to us and then greta rose at once though she looked a little shy as olivia stood at the door watching them as they crossed the road marcus came up harbut street where are those two going he asked curiously i thought miss williams was to spend the evening with us then olivia linked her arm in his and drew him into the passage oh do come in marcus she said breathlessly i cannot talk at the streetdoor and i have such a lot to tell you then marcus put down his hat and drew off his gloves with exasperating slowness we have been married nearly three years he said flecking the dust off his coatcollar but i never remember the day when as you so elegantly express it you had not a lot to tell me yes but something has really happened she returned ignoring this provoking speech oh indeed was the cool answer so they have settled it at last have they well i have changed my opinion lately gaythorne may not be quite up to the mark but he will make a good husband i suppose he is taking her across for the parental blessing and then olivia admitted that this was the case i am so glad that you really do not mind she said in a relieved tone but i fancied you would not approve you almost said as much one day oh even great intellects change their opinions sometimes returned marcus dryly sir robert peel and gladstone for example and then most people know their own business best perhaps if you were to crossexamine me severely i might own that alwyn gaythorne is not the man i should have selected for your interesting friend but as she has chosen him she is evidently of another opinion and this is one thing in his favour he is thoroughly in love with her and really take him all in all he is not a bad fellow and olivia who understood her husband perfectly was quite content with this opinion when marcus went upstairs to wash his hands whistling the air of my old dutch she knew he was quite as much excited as she was when greta came back she looked a little flushed and agitated and at a sign from alwyn olivia took her upstairs what is it dear she said gently as greta shed a few tears was not mr gaythorne nice to you nice repeated greta with a little sob he was as dear as possible if i had been olive he could not have been more gentle i tell alwyn that i shall be quite spoiled between them but somehow as he talked to me i could not help thinking of poor father and of my mother how happy mother would have been for she was always so fond of alwyn yes dear i understand yes and alwyn understands too he told me so just now he said that though this was the happiest day of his life he could not help missing his mother and olive olivia do you know that mr gaythorne means us to live with him i was just a little bit frightened when i heard that and i am afraid alwyn saw it for he spoke about it afterwards does he wish it himself olivia was careful to reserve her own opinion both she and marcus had their own views on this subject i do not know what he really wishes and it was too soon to discuss things but he did say that he thought that his father ought not to be left alone and of course he is right and it is for him to decide and then she gave an embarrassed little laugh mr gaythorne was very good to me but you know what an autocrat he is he wants it to be soon very soon oh he quite took my breath away and i could see alwyn was sorry for me he thinks it is the impatience of the disease and that we must humour him a little alwyn was so beautifully gentle with him and so considerate for me but he saw how overwhelmed i was yes one wants quiet at first to realise ones happiness returned olivia sympathetically now i am going to make the tea and you shall join us when you like but when she got downstairs she found alwyn alone he was pacing up and down as though he were anxious where is marcus she asked at once oh someone wanted him at no sligo street i was to tell you that and then with a change of tone i hope my father did not really upset greta oh no she was only a little overwhelmed no wonder you know what my father is mrs luttrell he never will wait for anything if a thing is to be done it must be done at once only yesterday i was laughing at him and telling him he would have made an excellent slavedriver he is immensely pleased and excited and he treated greta as though she were a princess he has fine manners you will allow that but the dear girl looked dreadfully shy and embarrassed and then to put her at her ease he wanted her to promise that she would marry me as soon as possible it was no use trying to hush him for he would have his say i got her away at last by pretending you would be waiting tea for us oh here she comes and his face brightened as he hurried to his fiancees side greta had recovered her tranquillity and when marcus entered she received his congratulations as happily as possible olivia went over to galvaston house the next day mr gaythorne was evidently expecting her well he said holding her hand i suppose you have come to congratulate me on my new daughter i tell alwyn he is a lucky dog a sweet girl and three thousand a year not that either he or i care about the moneythere will be plenty for alwyn plenty i was telling them both last night he went on that there must be no delay and nonsense in my state of health any procrastination would be foolish i want to see him with a good wife crampton is all very well but a wife will understand him better the house will hold us all with the exception of the library and my own bedroom it will all belong to them alwyn can refurnish the drawingroom if he likes and there is that little room on the first floor opening into the conservatory that would make a charming morningroom for greta he can have carte blanche to do what he likes and she and crampton will manage the house between them so what is the use of waiting and as olivia noted the old mans feverish excitement she could not help thinking that a short engagement would be best and when alwyn walked with her to mayfield villas she told him so i quite agree with you was his answer dr luttrell and i had a talk over things last night but i do not mean greta to be bothered with plans and preparations until she has had a few days quiet you do not know her as well as i do mrs luttrell greta is so unselfish so absolutely selfless that she will do anything for the good of those she loves in the old days she always yielded her wishes to olive and she is just as ready to do so now and as alwyn said this with his bright winning smile olivia was not quite so sure after all that greta had made a mistake chapter xxi sunshine and clouds a friend who is both intelligent and wellaffected is the most valuable of all possessionsherodotus about a fortnight after this eventful afternoon olivia received a note from greta begging her to bring her work and to spend a few hours with her the invitation was a pressing one please do not disappoint me she wrote for i want to talk to you so much i think i can promise that we shall have no interruption alwyn is going up to town for the afternoon and will not pay his usual call and then olivia who had planned to have tea with aunt madge put off her visit until another day and sent a verbal message of acceptance it was one of those late october days when a touch of frost in the air gives a hint of the approaching winter and the bright little fire in gretas pretty morningroom was very welcome greta was sitting at her embroidery frame as usual her deep mourning was relieved by the little knot of white chrysanthemums and red leaves that she wore and her fair serious face looked bright and animated dear olive it was so good of you to come she said as she ensconced her guest in a big easychair i suppose you guessed that i wanted you particularly and olivia nodded i could hardly sleep thinking about it all olive we have settled the day mr gaythorne gave alwyn no peace and so he was obliged to speak to me he said it was very soon to ask me and that he would willingly have given me more time but that in his fathers state of health any delay would only harass him so i said that i would be ready by the middle of december i hope you do not think i am wrong no indeed i think you are very wise alwyn was so grateful went on greta he knew my objection to a winter wedding but as he says it will be so nice to begin the new year together and after all what do these outward things matter at first i thought i would be married in my travellingdress and go straight away from the church and then i remembered how alwyn once said that brides ought always to wear white that it was symbolical and poetical and that you agreed with him marcus thought just the same returned olivia and though i was in mourning for dear mother aunt madge bought me a lovely white cashmere alas i have never worn it since but sometimes i take it out and look at it i remember how pleased marcus was with it shall you wear silk or satin greta and then greta owned that she had already decided on a rich ivorycoloured silk but we will not discuss my trousseau just yet she observed blushing there is plenty of time for that i shall have seven weeks for my preparations i want to tell you about yesterday olive you know i had promised to have luncheon at galvaston house and that alwyn was to fetch me but before we left this house it was all settled and after luncheon alwyn told his father the dear old man was so pleased he made alwyn bring down his mothers trinkets a pearl necklace and some diamond stars and such splendid rings that he had given her and he told alwyn that they were all for me you know i never cared much for jewelry but alwyn will always want me to be well dressed so i shall have to be smart i think i liked best a little cross set with diamonds that olive used to wear he gave me that too how pleased alwyn must have been yes and of course i was pleased too and then mr gaythorne made alwyn take me over the house what a handsome house it is olive i like it ever so much better than brunswick place i had no idea it was so large but mr gaythorne said that italian palaces had spoilt him and that he must always have plenty of space there is a room on the first floor opening into the conservatory that will make a charming morningroom and then the studio is so lovely alwyn has been buying such beautiful things and there is to be a corner fitted up for my use where my embroidery frame can stand i shall so love to watch him work but oh olive is it not absurd mr gaythorne talks of refurnishing the drawingroom but it is not the least necessary i want you to convince him of this and to beg him not to spend money so needlessly i have so many nice things of my own all this beautiful china and those inlaid japanese cabinets a new carpet and a little fresh cretonne is all that is needed and i know alwyn agrees with me very well then we must bring mr gaythorne to reason i took mrs crampton into confidence went on greta when she showed me the kitchen and storerooms what a nice creature she is and how admirably she manages there is to be another maid kept so i asked if i might bring merton she has been with us so many years that i should dislike to part with her and alwyn has promised to speak to his father olivia listened and approved there was no mistaking gretas happiness she looked on the bright side of everything and would allow of no drawbacks when olivia ventured to hint that mr gaythorne might be trying at times greta only smiled and said that was very likely only alwyn managed him so beautifully and she hoped in time to do the same i know that he dislikes visitors she went on but as you and dr luttrell are exceptions i do not so much mind and i shall be quite happy with alwyn oh no doubt returned olivia in her quick decided way but you must remember greta dear that we owe a duty to our fellowcreatures and you must not allow mr gaythorne to carry his misanthropical views too far there is no need for him to be troubled with visitors he is far too ailing for much fatigue and exertion but surely you and alwyn can entertain your friends in your own rooms and though greta hesitated and looked rather alarmed at the idea of opposing her formidable fatherinlawelect she was soon brought to acknowledge that society would be good for alwyn there is no hurry we can be quiet this first winter she said but of course if people call upon me i shall return their visits but we cannot settle beforehand i shall first wait and see what alwyn wishes and you must own olive that i have not led a gay life here bythebye observed olivia suddenly what have you decided to do with this house and furniture but greta had evidently not taken these matters into consideration all the best things will go to galvaston house i suppose she replied looking round her but most of the furniture is oldfashioned and not uptodate i suppose people would call it handsome and of course the oak in the diningroom is in thoroughly good taste i must talk to alwyn about it perhaps it might be let furnished dear father used to say selling furniture was such a mistakeone never got the full value i remember how grand i thought it the first day i called returned olivia smiling the drawingroom with that beautiful conservatory opening out of it and the plush curtains and those luxurious couches made me feel so shabby but i suppose the drawingroom at galvaston house is still better the glass door opening on the garden is so pleasant and those venetian cabinets and that carved settle are really beautiful yes and it would be such a pity to modernise the room besides what does one want with a drawingroom at all i am sure i never enter mine i shall live in the morningroom and the studio and i suppose in the evenings we shall be in the library ah you are laughing because i have thought it all out in this matteroffact way but i assure you i hardly slept last night and then by mutual consent they began on the mysteries of the trousseau and they had not half finished when olivia looked at the clock and declared that she had stayed too long the world goes up and the world goes down and the sunshine follows the rain says the old song and human life is certainly made up of passing clouds and gleams of sunshine while alwyn superintended the decorations of the new rooms at galvaston house and brought his artistic taste to bear on every petty detail for the use of his ladylove and while greta busied herself over her trousseau dr luttrell was engaged from morning to night among his patients with the damp foggy days of november had come the dreaded epidemic influenza all the doctors were overworked and more than one of them succumbed to the maladyamongst them dr bevan marcus who had been devoting himself to his poor patients suddenly found the charge of a large practice thrown on him and had scarcely time to take his meals for a few days dr bevan was extremely ill and even when a short change had recruited his health it was evident that he would never be able to do the same amount of work again he has been overworking himself for years mrs bevan said to marcus with tears in her eyes but he would never spare himself and now dr randolph says that this utter breakdown is the result oh it is all very well for him to say that it is better to wear out than rust out but if a man has a wife and children he has no right to risk his life in this way it might not hurt a younger man to rise from his bed night after night in the depths of winter but for my husband it is simply suicidal when he gets well he must and shall have a partner what is the use of waiting until wilfred is ready to come into the practice for wilfred bevan the eldest son was at that time walking the hospitals and here mrs bevan with her comely face looking quite worn and aged with anxiety hurried away to sit with her husband olivia had her own private anxieties those long solitary days were very trying to her but she never dared be long absent from home lest she should miss one of marcuss flying visits his meals were taken at any odd hour but if he came in for a minute on his morning round there was always a cup of good soup ready for him or later in the day some hot coffee but perhaps the best cordial to the tired harassed doctor was the sight of his wifes bright face he would drink the soup snatch up his little daughter for a kiss and go back to his work refreshed but even to him the strain was excessive olivia who was unwilling to damp gretas cheerfulness would pour out her troubles to her aunt madge and mrs broderick would listen with her usual sympathy i hope it is not wicked of me aunt madge she would say but i do feel so worried and anxious marcus declares he is quite well but he is so tired every night that he can hardly drag himself to bed and when morning comes he is not a bit rested i think dr bevans illness has made me nervous for i am always dreading that marcus will break down too women need lot of faith dont they livy doctors wives as well as soldiers wives but i am not sure that you need fear for marcus he is really strong and at his age a little hard work will not hurt him he has his laurels to gather you must remember that it is an ill wind that blows no one any good but olivia who was tired and depressed was not so ready to be comforted i would rather go on being poor than see my poor boy work so hard she said mournfully but it is not only that aunt madge marcus is very tenderhearted and it makes him so unhappy when he loses a patient of course i know why he looked so dull last night that poor young fellow basil greenwood is dead yes i know dr randolph was called in returned mrs broderick but a hundred physicians could not have saved him the fever ran too high he was only eighteen and his poor mother doated on him and now she is ill too they called marcus up last night he did not get back till nearly five but i had the fire lighted and some hot cocoa ready for him marcus scolded me he is always so afraid of my knocking up but i know he was glad of the cocoa i tell greta that i cannot be much with her just now i am so afraid of missing him when he comes in and of course she understands but it is a little hard for her poor child greta is very good returned aunt madge she makes the best of things bythebye what is this i hear of a grand new dress for the wedding and then olivia did brighten up a little greta had begged in the most loving way that olivias dress and bonnet for the occasion should be her gift and the dark heliotrope silk and dainty bonnet to match were at that moment in gretas wardrobe i tell greta that it is far too handsome replied olivia and that marcus will object to my being so smart but she only laughs at me there is such a lovely cape to go with it but somehow in spite of gretas kindness i shall not enjoy it one bit unless marcus has time to go with me oh he will make time dont be so lugubrious livy you are just out of heart about things but we must have cloudy days some time dont you remember what longfellow says nothing that is can pause or stay the moon will wax the moon will wane the mist and cloud will turn to rain the rain to mist and cloud again tomorrow be today yes and november fogs will pass too well dear aunt madge i must go and as usual you have cheered me up what should i do without you i wonder i am glad you find the old log useful returned mrs broderick so come and grumble as often as you like greta is coming to tea with me tomorrow and mr alwyn has promised to fetch her why dont you come too and you shall have a real scotch tea bannocks and scones and seed cake but olivia shook her head at this tempting invitation marcus had asked her to go round to the model lodging houses she said to see two families in trouble and then it was that poor boys funeral and then mrs broderick said no more poor livy she said to herself as she lay alone in the twilight one may make light of her little troubles but they are real to her and i do not wonder that she worries over marcus dr randolph was only speaking of him this morning he told me what a splendid worker he was bevan may be thankful to have got hold of such a man those were his very words but he must be prudent and not burn the candle at both ends as bevan did the foul fiend has got hold of harris now he is dr mordaunts partner and was married a few weeks ago apollyon as we call it at our house does not spare doctors but i hope i really do hope that livy has not heard this chapter xxii you must not lose heart cherish those that love you that if ye love ye may be loved againmoschus when greta woke on her wedding morning she was greeted by the pale wintry sunshine the weather was unusually mild for december the sky blue and cloudless and only the bare blackness of the trees and their stripped branches testified that winter had come happy the bride that the sun shines on says the old proverb and as olivia repeated the saying she felt her old cheerfulness and buoyancy return marcus had promised to meet them at the church and to return with them to brunswick place and her finery would not be thrown away it would be of course a very quiet wedding the only guests would be the lawyer mr treherne an old family friend who had undertaken to give the bride away and alwyns best man a young artist as soon as the young couple had partaken of refreshment and greta had changed her dress they were to drive round to galvaston house on their way to the station the brief fortnights honeymoon was to be spent at st leonards mr gaythorne had begged that they would not go very far away and alwyn had been reluctant to leave his father for a longer time olivia had promised to spend the remainder of the day with mr gaythorne and if possible marcus was to join them in the evening but she had another visit to pay on her way to brunswick place so when the brougham came round she drove over in solitary state to maybrick villas mrs broderick regarded her niece with satisfied eyes why livy she said admiringly i have not seen you look so well since your own weddingday fine feathers make fine birds you are quite a strikinglooking woman marcus will be proud of his wife you must not make me vain returned olivia blushing she was as pleased as a child with her beautiful dress look what alwyn has given me and she exhibited a pair of delicate gold bangles you cannot think how smart i feel for that pretty brooch that marcus gave me the day before we were married was my sole piece of jewelry mrs broderick smiled i am not much richer than you in that respect livy i never would let fergus spend his money on trinkets i told him i was far too ugly and that i preferred books there are only two handsome rings to come to you livy when i am gone but olivia frowned at this speech she never could endure to think of anything happening to aunt madge marcus was at the church door to meet her and there was unmistakable approval in his eyes as they stood together for a moment in the porch and as they walked up the empty church together each was thinking of the day three years ago when they had plighted their troth in this very church greta made a sweetlooking bride there was a chastened gravity on her fair face but no tremor as she repeated the solemn responses but alwyn was painfully nervous and looked so pale that olivia feared more than once he was ill he looked more like himself when the service was over but that he realised his responsibilities intensely was evident from the few words he said to olivia while greta was changing her dress i have not deserved all this have i mrs luttrell he said in his impulsive way i feel as though coals of fire were heaped upon me fancy a sweet girl like greta consenting to link her lot with mine how am i to live up to it but she believes in me and god bless her i will try not to disappoint her and there were tears in the young mans eyes as he said this goodbye olive darling whispered greta as she put her arms affectionately round her friend i am glad that we are not to be long away the dear new home will be quite ready for us and then she took her husbands arm and the little group of friends watched them as they drove away when olive went to mr gaythorne an hour later she found him looking pleased and excited alwyn is a happy man he said he has got a good wife greta has tact as well as heart she will let him have his own way whenever it is possible and he will not find out that he is guided that is what alwyns nature needs i have found that out by bitter experience and the old man sighed heavily in spite of his contentment the memory of the past was still painful and both he and alwyn would carry their scars to their dying day i am sure you will love greta dearly olivia observed she is a little shy and quiet until she gets used to people but she is so wonderfully gentle yes and she was my little olives friend i shall never forget that but as i told you just now i have two daughters and then he laid his hand on olivias with one of his rare gestures of affection my dear alwyn and i were talking last night i told him that he must be master here and that he must put his wife in her proper place at once i shall want little during the few months or years that remain to me just my quiet rooms and my childrens affection and the society of the one or two friends that remain to me but alwyn needs more he loves society and to be a successful artist he must mix with his fellowworkers and rub against other minds he must go into the world and see and be seen i think you are right returned olivia slowly she was secretly very much surprised by this speech she had no idea how much he had brooded over this question yes he returned a little sadly i have learnt my lesson at last those young lives must not be overshadowed by a sick mans whims my son must never be able to say again that his fathers house was like a jail and that he felt cramped in body and mind sooner than that with a trace of the old excitement in his manner i would rather my weary bones were laid in the earth dear mr gaythorne in a soothing voice alwyn loves you far too well ever to say or think such a thing i hope soi trust so but i would rather not put his patience to the proof my boy must be happy or i can know no peace if you will bring your wife here and stay with your old father i will never interfere with either of you that is what i said to him you may turn the house out of window if you like so that you leave me my two quiet rooms but he only laughed in my face we will see about that was all he answered but i shall prove to him that i meant what i said greta will not care for gaiety this winter you must remember that she has been used to a very quiet life that is for her and alwyn to decide returned mr gaythorne ah mrs luttrell my dear what it will be to me to hear a womans step about the house again it will be like music in my ears and then he leant back in his chair as though he were exhausted and asked olivia to read to him later in the evening as she walked back with marcus she told him of this conversation and then she added he will be very good to greta i am sure of that his voice softened so when he spoke of her she is a link with the past you see but marcus as he talked he looked so old and broken that i cannot help fearing that they will not have him with them for long probably not i have hinted this more than once to alwyn and though he always turns it off i think he understands me it was his own proposition that they should only be a fortnight away now i have two or three patients to see so you must not wait up for me and tired as he was marcus walked off briskly whilst olivia lingered on the doorstep for a moment to look at the stars shining in the dark wintry sky alwyn had begged her as a special favour to him to pay a daily visit to galvaston house so for the next three or four days she found it impossible to go round to maybrick villas mr gaythorne took her visits as a matter of course there was always something he wanted to discuss with her some fresh arrangement for his daughterinlaws comfort one day he consulted her about a brougham that he intended to buy as a surprise i shall get dr luttrell to choose it he said and there is a man i know at medhurst who will pick me up a pair of chestnuts my sons wife is a rich woman and ought to have a pair for her carriage there is some good stabling to be got just by and dr luttrell knows a capital coachman who has been thrown out of place by his masters death in the spring she might have a victoria but a brougham will be more serviceable at this season of the year when alwyn takes her to theatres and concerts and though olivia smiled she could not but own that the brougham would be a boon to greta then we will see about it at once he returned eagerly would you ask your husband to call tomorrow morning if he can spare the time and as olivia took her leave she promised to give the message to her surprise she found marcus reading by the fire he looked up at her a little gravely as she entered you are rather late are you not livy he said laying down his paper martha brought me some tea but i waited to speak to you i shall have to go out again directly let me give you mr gaythornes message first he wants you to go round and speak to him tomorrow morning about a new brougham for greta how delighted she and alwyn will be greta is not strong and does not care for walking much in the winter and she catches cold so easily it is just what alwyn wished for her yes i will try to run across tomorrow morning but i have a long days work before me olive darling i have rather bad news for you and here he put his arm round her aunt madge is ill olivia turned very pale marcus how did you know has deb sent a message i hopeoh i do hope it is not influenza i fear it is returned marcus reluctantly i met randolph and he stopped and told me he was just going there for the second time he wants to send a nurse in but deb was so against it that he did not venture to insist but i am afraid she is very ill livy i must go round at once marcus do you think you can spare me martha is very careful she will look after dot but you knowand here there were hot smarting tears in olivias eyesyou know what aunt madge is to me i cannot leave her to deb marcus sighed he could not bear his wife to run the risk and yet how could he be selfish enough to deprive mrs broderick of the comfort of having her with her he knew their deep affection for each other aunt madge was her second mother few aunts were so fondly beloved i hate you to go dearest he said and yet i cannot deny that randolph is very anxious about her it is the prostration he fears the fever has been so high these two days she has been ill two whole days and deb has never sent for me and olivia sobbed in a heartbroken manner my dear girl you must not lose heart in this way and marcus stroked her hair tenderly let me tell you exactly how it was i went round with randolph and waited while he paid his visit deb came out to speak to me she is an obstinate incorrigible crossgrained old woman and i told her so oh i spoke my mind to her she cannot deny that she has been up for three nights and yet the mention of a nurse throws her into tantrums i have always nursed my mistress and as long as i can drag about she shall have no strangers to harass her dear soul she said defiantly now what are you to do with a woman like that i asked her why she had not let us know he went on and she confessed that aunt madge had made her promise not to send so you see deb was not to blame for that no i see and then olivia looked up in her husbands face pleadingly marcus dear you will not forbid my sitting up with aunt madge tonight deb will not mind me she knows how aunt madge will love to have me i will be very careful and do just as you tell me but i must i must be with her and then very reluctantly marcus gave his permission martha was interviewed and dot kissed in her cot and then olivia told marcus she was ready and they walked to maybrick villas almost in silence olivias heart was too full for speech if aunt madge died she told herself the world would never be the same to her again some of the warmth and the light and the joy of life would have faded out of it she is one of my few treasures she thought marcus and dear baby come first of course but aunt madge has taken mothers place all these years she has helped me so with her wise loving counsel and sympathy while there is life there is hope livy observed marcus gently and his hand touched hers in the darkness dr randolph does not own himself beaten by any means do what you can to help deb for she is just worn out the foolish faithful creature and his voice changing do not forget me or dot and for our sakes take care of yourself and with these words he opened the little gate and left her to go in alone chapter xxiii i have come to stay the dear lords best interpreters are humble human souls the gospel of a life is more than books or scrollswhittier deb i have come to stay were olivias first words as the woman met her on the top of the stairs but deborahs only answer was to lift her hands in dumb protest and lead the way into the kitchen debs strong hardfeatured face was haggard and drawn with fatigue and anxiety and she looked more gaunt and angular than ever her reddened swollen eyelids told their own tale i am come to stay repeated olivia firmly but deborah only shrugged her shoulders and walked over to the fireplace you wont need to stay long miss olive she said in a choked voiceat moments of excitement it was still miss olive with debshe is failing fast dear soul the fevers gone and left her as weak as a newborn babe i always said my mistress was only fit to be among the angels and deb gave an expressive sniff as she filled her kettle olivia felt a dull pain at her heart at this speech but she would not let herself give way deborah as she knew always took a gloomy view of her mistresss illnesses dr randolph is coming again tonight she observed my husband told me so but olivias hand shook as she took off her hat and jacket yes miss olive the doctor is coming again and that speaks for itself to my mind i knew what it was four days ago for she was taken ill the very night after you drove round to see her but i dare not let you know we wont tell mrs luttrell or she will be anxious and will insist on coming to nurse me promise me that you will not send to galvaston terrace deb and what was a poor servant to do i suppose if dr luttrell has sent you you will have to stop but i wont give up nursing my mistress even to you miss olive and deb sniffed defiantly there you may go in while i warm her milk but she will not take any notice of you she is too weak to speak the foldingdoors were open and the little sittingroom with its cheery fire had a cosy aspect the sickroom was dimly lighted as olivia bent over the invalid her heart contracted with anguish could only four days have wrought such deadly havoc aunt madges face looked pinched and sunken and so changed that olivia could hardly recognise it but as she hung over her in speechless grief the heavy eyelids unclosed and something like a smile passed over the features my little livy was all she whispered but it was the old caressing tone when dr randolph paid his last visit olivia begged him to use his influence with deborah she has been up three nights and is utterly worn out she went on i want her to let me watch while she has a good sleep on that couch i would promise to wake her if i saw the least change indeed i know something of nursing dr randolph i was with my dear mother when she died and i will carry out all your instructions well you heard what i said to mrs higgins returned dr randolph that everything depends on frequent nourishment the fever is down but there is a state of collapse that makes me uneasy mrs broderick has a good constitution or she would not have got through her last illness so i still hope we may pull her through but dr randolphs voice was not sanguine as he said this now i will go and have a talk with mrs higgins i shall tell her that unless she does as she is told tonight i shall bring round a nurse with me tomorrow i think that will fetch her and dr randolph was right possibly deb felt herself on the verge of breaking down for she consented at last to lie down on her mistresss couch for an hour or two but it was midnight before olivia found herself in sole charge there was very little to be done except to give medicine and nourishment at stated intervals and to make up the two fires as noiselessly as possible but olivia felt her responsibilities too acutely to be overcome by drowsiness though deborah lay hour after hour in the heavy sleep of utter exhaustion olivias thoughts went back to her childhood as she sat there a hundred instances of aunt madges affection and devotion recurred to her she remembered how the sprightly young aunt used to run up to the nursery with some new toy or gailydressed doll that she had purchased out of her scanty savings for aunt madge had been a daily governess too she could recall the sunday afternoons when she sat in her lap and the beautiful voice sang to her or told her storiesjoseph and his brethren and daniel in the lions denor on other days dear old fairy stories such as children love she had been her bridesmaid too and had grown very fond of the honest sturdy scotchman whom his wife so tenderly idealised uncle fergus was a good kind man she thought but he was not all that aunt madge imagined him most people would not have called him interesting but he was devoted to her what a bright creature she was until little malcolm died that was the first of her troubles what a happy home theirs had been but it was aunt madge who had been the heart of the house who had organised and planned uncle fergus had never originated anything and she loved him as dearly as i love marcus she went on and yet when she lost him there was not a murmuring word i thought it was too good to last she once said to me but my widows cruse will never be empty i have the sweetest memories and byandby i shall have my treasures again do you know i often pray livy that i may not long so much to die gods will not mine even in this oh aunt madge dear aunt madge i cannot spare you yet murmured olivia more than once that night for it is hard for human affection to rid itself of selfishness when olivia brought deb a cup of tea at seven oclock the good creature seemed quite shocked to think i have slept all these hours she said in a dazed voice miss olive why did you not wake me long ago you are fit to drop and what will dr luttrell say but olivia shook her head with a faint smile i will lie down now and get a nap deb i am sure she is no worse she has taken all dr randolph ordered and though she has not spoken she seemed to me a shade less exhausted but though deb would not endorse this olivia felt certain that she was right she was sitting at her late breakfast when marcus called to see how they had spent the night and her account evidently relieved him he waited to hear dr randolphs opinion olivia came back to him as soon as possible oh marcus she said the tears rushing to her eyes dr randolph says that the exhaustion is not quite so great and he owned frankly that he was afraid last night how he should find her this morning we are to go on just the same everything depends on frequent nourishment he thinks the heart is a little stronger but she must not be moved at all we must see what nature and rest will do he said to me do not relax your efforts we are not out of the woods yet he is coming again about four yes i should not be surprised if she weathered it after all returned marcus she must have a tough constitution to have gone through all she has yesterday i certainly felt anxious and so did randolph we both feared sudden collapse i worried myself for a long time because i had not offered to sit up with you livy but i have been up two nights already this week and one has ones work to do but olivia looked quite shocked at this my dear boy how could you think of such a thing it would have made me more miserable than i was already besides there would have been no room for you this is such a tiny place oh how i wish aunt madge could move into better lodgings her bedroom is far too small and that wardrobe quite fills it up bythebye marcus i wish you would tell me what i had better do may i come home for an hour or two and see baby i dont know that there would be any risk he replied slowly you cannot give influenza unless you have it yourself but all the same i would keep away from dot she is perfectly well and sat up in her highchair pouring out imaginary tea in her wooden set while i had my breakfast and martha begged me to tell you that the butcher had called and she had ordered a steak for master and would make a ricepudding for miss baby very well then i will stay but marcus i shall see you again this evening shall i not and marcus returned in an emphatic voice that he certainly intended to keep an eye on her i wont have you getting into mischief and knocking yourself up he remarked severely so be a wise woman or you will have to reckon with me there was plenty to do that morning putting things tidy in the sickroom and straightening the sittingroom in the course of the day some choice flowers came from galvaston house with mr gaythornes compliments and at teatime marcus dropped in unexpectedly and they had a cosy halfhour together in debs spotless little kitchen to her surprise he told olivia that dot was at galvaston house mrs crampton begged to have her and mr gaythorne thought it would be a good plan so she fetched her this afternoon i hope i have done right livy and marcus spoke in an apologetic tone as though he felt that he had trenched on the mothers prerogative but you see i am so much out and martha is so busy that i thought that we should both be less anxious to know that mrs crampton was looking after her and olivia agreed to this olivia had already arranged to take the earlier part of the night in the sickroom and when dr randolph had paid his evening visit deb took possession of the couch again olivia had promised faithfully to wake her at three oclock a long afternoon nap had refreshed olivia and a few hopeful words from the doctor had cheered her immensely a little after midnight she was sitting down by the bedside with some knitting to keep her awake when a movement from the bed made her look up aunt madges eyes were fixed on her there was a strange solemnity and deep sadness in their expression and as olivia rose hastily and bent over her with a tender inquiry the feeble voice whispered dont fret any more livy the master does not need me yetnot yet and then scarcely audibly i shall not die but live and declare the works of the lord and then it seemed to olivia that the weary eyelids closed in sleep again when her turn for rest came olivia felt almost too agitated to sleep the sad yearning in the sunken eyes haunted her too well she knew that the fresh gift of life would only be an additional cross laid on the weary shoulders what was life to aunt madge now but suffering and deprivation a daily stumbling among shadows as she had once called it there was no reserve and hesitation in dr randolphs manner when he came out of the sickroom the next day she has turned the corner now but it was a narrow squeak he said rubbing his hands now all we have to do is to build up her strength your aunt is a wonderful woman mrs luttrell i should not wonder if she is good for twenty years yet but we must be careful still i suppose you will be here for another day or two oh thats all right as olivia gave a decided assent to this it would be a pity to knock mrs higgins up there are not many women like her she is simply invaluable as the days went on the tension of anxiety was visibly relaxed the invalids progress was slow but sure in another day or two olivia was able to go home for an hour or two to have dinner with marcus and give martha directions but while the nightwork continued it was impossible for her to leave and it was arranged that dot was to remain at galvaston house for the present greta had written to beg for an extension of her visit she is such a darling and i shall be so delighted to have her she wrote she will not be at all in the way and indeed dot ruled royally over the household she and mr gaythorne became great friends great dada as she called him took a good deal of notice of the pretty goldenhaired child who played at his feet for hours and eros was devoted to her alwyns first work when he returned was to paint a large picture of dot in her creamcoloured smock hanging a withered garland round the neck of the blind hound friends he called it olivia was able to spend an hour or two at galvaston house the day after the young couple returned she found them in the studio with dot and eros alwyn was looking well and handsome and gretas sweet face wore an expression of gentle content she carried olivia off at once to the morningroom to have a chat as she said looking archly at her husband and though alwyn professed to grumble at the desertion he was too busy stretching his canvas for the new picture to resent it let me know when tea is ready he called after them and then they heard him whistling in his usual lighthearted fashion i need not ask you if you are happy greta were olivias first words and then a charming blush crossed the young brides face no indeed oh olive he is so good to me if you only knew how he studies all my wishes it was like a dream yesterday coming to this beautiful home and then mr gaythornes delight at getting his son back oh it was so touching to see them together alwyn wants me to call him father she continued shyly he says it will please him so so i must try to do it you know i always called my own father dad now tell me about dear mrs broderick poor olive what a time you have had and you are looking so pale and tired and then olive poured out her anxieties and past troubles into gretas sympathising ears she is very weak still she finished dr randolph thinks it will be some time before she will be able to leave her bed i have found such a nice woman who will come in and help deb for of course i cannot leave marcus any longer i am to go home the day after tomorrow deb will sleep on the couch in the sittingroom she will have to give nourishment every two hours but deb manages to sleep with one eye open as i tell her i am to go for a couple of hours every afternoon that will allow her to have a little rest marcus thinks this will work excellently oh how glad i shall be to be at home again and look after him you want looking after yourself dear returned greta affectionately and then alwyn came into the room with dot on his shoulder but she clamoured to go to her mammy how do you think mrs alwyn gaythorne looks asked alwyn mischievously she does me credit does she not bythebye greta do you think father will like us to have coffee with him in the library this afternoon i told phoebe that we would have it up here shall i go and ask him alwyn do love the attention will please him and i am sure mrs luttrell will not mind then as greta left the room he turned to olivia and said in a tone of deep feeling she looks well and happy dont you think so oh mrs luttrell every day i feel more what a treasure i have she is an embodied sunbeam i never knew anyone so gentle and yet so bright how my father will love her when he knows her better and then as his wifes step sounded in the corridor he sprang from his seat to open the door chapter xxiv not yet but here i bring within my trembling hand this will of mine a thing that seemeth small and thou alone o lord can understand how when i yield thee this i yield mine allanon it was some time before aunt madge could be lifted on to the couch in the sittingroom and even then deb declared that she was not the weight of a child of eight or nine there is nothing of her miss olive she grumbled she is worn to such a shadow tire my arms indeedi could lift a heavier weight than that and deb gave one of her ominous sniffs and went off to her kitchen to shed a few tears in private all those weeks olivia had been unremitting in her attentions and all other visits were interdicted but the friends at galvaston house showed their sympathy in every possible way mr gaythorne sent choice old wine and game and greta and alwyn kept the invalid supplied with fruit and flowers mrs crampton made jellies and soups the little larder at mayfield villas was filled to overflowing mrs broderick took it all gratefully and gave her nurses no trouble i am under orders she would say with a pitiful attempt at her old drollery but only olivia who loved and understood her ever guessed at the sadness of those days of convalescence one evening as they were together in the twilight olivia ventured to hint at this depression she was waiting for marcus to come and fetch her for they were to dine at galvaston house is it because you are too weak to feel cheerful dear aunt madge she asked tenderly but mrs broderick shook her head it is because i am a coward she returned with a spirit of her old energy ah livy i am ashamed to tell you what a coward i have been but i simply felt as though i could not face it let me explain myself i feel strong enough to talk and it may do me good dear child dearest livy stroking her hand you have been such a comfort to me do you remember that night when i told you i was not going to die well i had had a wonderful dream a vision rather for i shall always think it one i thought that i was wandering in some strange place some vast emptiness where there was nothing human but myself and that i came suddenly to a wide arched portal that seemed to reach to the stars and i said to myself this is the gate of paradise as i stood on the threshold i could see a green space like a valley bathed in sunlight and i even noticed the white starry flowers growing everywhere and then i saw my dear fergus looking just as he did in life only somehow with a grander and more peaceful look on his dear face and he was leading our little malcolm by the hand i thought i kissed them both and clung to them in a perfect ecstasy of joy but fergus looked at me in such a tender solemn way not yet madge he said your work is not quite done yet the master has sent me to tell you so be patient true heart when the time comes malcolm and i will be here and then i felt myself falling and when i opened my eyes i saw you sitting there by the bedside what a sweet dream dearest yes i am beginning to feel the comfort of it now but that night i felt as though my heart were broken to be so near and then to have to go back but livy i am trying to say itthy will not mine be done gods willnot ours surely our father knows what is best for his poor child and you are not unhappy only a little sad and tired but that will pass it is passing now and the old lovely smile came to her lips dont you recollect what keble says tis sweet as year by year we lose friends out of sight in faith to muse how grows in paradise our store what are a few more years of loneliness when fergus and i have eternity to spend together there i hear marcuss knock he will scold me for making you look sad but aunt madge was wrong for once in his life marcus was too preoccupied to notice the signs of agitation on his wifes face what do you think dear people he said brightly when he had greeted the invalid dr bevan and i have settled matters he will have the deed of partnership drawn up at once nothing can be fairer or more liberal than his terms i told him i had only halfadozen paying patients at present but he said that i should soon have more we have turned the corner livy and my wife shall walk in silk attire yet and marcus flung back his head with a gesture of pride and importance my dear laddie i congratulate you with all my heart returned aunt madge affectionately as she grasped his hands livy looks quite dazed and no wonder and then a warm flush came to olivias cheek dear marcus i am so glad so thankful she whispered yes but it will be uphill work at first he returned and i shall have plenty to do bevan is not the man he was randolph does not seem satisfied about him but he will pick up when the warm weather comes oh bythebye livy i have not told you half yet bevan insists on our moving at once he wants me to take a good house either in brunswick place or montague square or one of those roads leading out of it it is well that we have that nest egg the five hundred pounds untouched it will pay for the necessary furniture and the first years rent will be assured yes indeed returned olivia in a low voice she was awed and overwhelmed by this unexpected good fortune but marcus would not allow any more talking his professional eyes had already noted the signs of weariness and exhaustion in the invalid we must go now he said abruptly we will talk over details another time it is no use giving aunt madge a bad night and then olivia rose reluctantly and put on her wraps i shall come tomorrow afternoon and tell you everything she said and mrs broderick nodded and smiled but as they slipped out into the wintry darkness and olivia took her husbands arm she said with a little laugh i am so glad i have put on my weddingdress tonight i ought to be smart for such an occasion this is our first dinnerparty since we have been married then it wont be our last returned marcus in a tone of conviction i wonder livy whether we shall ever regret those cosy evenings in the dear little room at no galvaston terrace but olivia only sighed happily she was too good a wife to regret anything that led to her husbands advancement very likely her cares and responsibilities would be doubled she would have less of marcuss society and the world would have claims upon them the long three years honeymoon was over but thank god something else was over toothe dread of approaching poverty the sadness of unproductive labour of work done only for loves sake and without grudging the following afternoon mrs broderick lay tranquilly in the pleasant firelit twilight awaiting olivias promised visit a pine log was spluttering and diffusing tiny coloured sparks zoe lay curled up in a silken ball on the black bearskin rug and olivias favourite low chair had been wheeled to the foot of the couch the teathings were on the table and the brass trivet on the fender was suggestive of hot buttered scones oh aunt madge how cosy you look were olivias first words may i take off my hat and jacket i am going to stay a long time and marcus hopes to come round presently then we will wait tea for him returned aunt madge with something like her old briskness will you tell deb not to bring in the kettle and scones until we ring come this is like old times it is months since marcus had tea with me now draw up your chair livy and begin your story for you are just bursting with news and though olivia laughed at this she did not deny it we had such a lovely time last night she began greta looked so pretty in her black evening dress at the top of the table she wore the pearl necklace and olives diamond cross she has such a beautiful white throat the pearls hardly showed against it mr gaythorne came in to dinner and sat beside her but he was very tired and left us directly after and we all went up to gretas morningroom and sat round the fire talking just we four it was so nice and cosy i suppose mr gaythorne was told the grand news oh dear yes he and alwyn were so keen about it they drank the health of dr bevans new partner mr gaythorne proposed the toast himself just as we left the diningroom i noticed that greta detained alwyn and they did not follow upstairs for quite a quarter of an hour but of course marcus and i took no notice they both looked a little bit excited when they came in greta gave my arm a funny little squeeze and alwyn cleared his throat and looked at marcus and then said in such a serious voice that he had an important proposal to make to us it was gretas idea but he heartily approved of it the house at brunswick place was waiting for a tenant why should not marcus take it it was to be let furnished they had decided on that already so there would be no delay or fuss necessary you might go in next week he finished the rooms only need airing and warming my dear livy what a splendid idea three cheers for greta i say yes it was all gretas thought but oh aunt madge what a talk we had first the terms that alwyn proposed were so absurdly low that marcus got quite red and said in almost an annoyed toneyou know how proud he isthat he must decline living at other peoples expense he would pay a fair rent for the house or he would not have it at all and then alwyn patted him on the back and told him to keep calm for no one wanted to insult him and then they went on wrangling like two schoolboys marcus called alwyn a stuckup millionaire and alwyn retorted by telling him that he was as proud as a highlander and then greta and i called them to order but we were laughing so that we could hardly speak how i should have loved to hear them marcus is so delicious when he gets on his high horse well it was arranged at last to everybodys satisfaction though alwyn went on grumbling for a long time and we are to move in next month marcus is to pay the full rent and there is to be a fixed sum paid quarterly for the furniture and at the end of two years it will be ours they both thought this the best plan you see expenses will be heavy the first year and we must not look for great profits but there is every reasonable hope as marcus says if he keeps his health that in a year or two he may have a good practice there is room for another doctor even dr randolph says so well livy dear i can only congratulate you yes indeed greta and i have been in brunswick place all the morning planning things oh aunt madge it is such a lovely house the diningroom and drawingroom are such handsome rooms and there is such a study for marcus it is too large for us of course and then olivia stopped and her eyes grew very wistful aunt madge dear aunt madge we want you and deb to go with us i have set my heart on it darling and marcus wants it too dont get pale over it as mrs broderick gave a little gasp listen to me a moment and olivia knelt by the couch and put her arms round her there is gretas morningroom on the first floor it is such a large cheerful room with a baywindow overlooking the nice oldfashioned garden where you could lie and look out on the trees and flowers here you see nothing but the four walls gretas bedroom is next to it you would have that too it is a pleasant front room very large and airy and so nicely furnished and my room would be just opposite deb could have the room just at the top of a short flight of stairs it looks on the garden too and she could sit there and do her sewing there are three or four other rooms besides attics but they have not been used so you can judge what a good house it is aunt madge do say you will come it will make us so happy to know you are safe under our roof think what it would be to me to have you at hand in all my little difficulties and you shall not be troubled you shall live your old life and deb will have nothing to do but take care of you but aunt madge made no answer only a curiously sweet smite played round her lips i should be no expense to you she observed presently in a reflective tone i might even be able to help a little bythebye livy how many servants do you propose to keep in this palatial mansion i am afraid we can only afford two good ones at present that is my difficulty aunt madge what am i to do with martha she is certainly not eligible for a houseparlourmaid keep her as dots nurse and i will pay her wages yes i mean it livy in a year or two with careful training that girl will be worth her weight in gold she will be a second deb to you in time oh that is marcus and we have not finished well are you coming to us aunt madge were marcuss first words as he entered the room there was unmistakable eagerness in his tone if you do not want livy to cry out her eyes with disappointment and if i am to have a peaceful moment for the next six months i entreat you to consent am i likely to refuse marcus but aunt madges voice was not so clear as usual dont you think that i shall love to have you and livy caring for me so it is yes and god bless you both and a slow tear rolled down aunt madges pale face marcus and olivia never repented that step as the years went on and other childrens voices were heard in the house at brunswick place when three sturdy boys climbed up on dr luttrells knees and two small browneyed girls toddled after mother aunt madges room was the heart and nucleus of the busy household there would come marcus for a greeting word and a jest before he set off on his days round and there olivia would betake herself for a rest and a chat when her household tasks had been despatched she seldom found aunt madge alone nigel or hugh would have brought her their kites to mend or to beg that deb would make them new sails for their boat and of course where nigel went fat sturdy ronald followed or the twins would be playing with their japanese babies on the carpet or rolling over each other and zoe not the same zoe alas like kittens but the most frequent visitor was dot dimpled and winsome as ever olivia had verified aunt madges words she had grown a little stouter and more
