the adventures of hugh trevor by thomas holcroft tis so pat to all the tribe each swears that was levelled at me gay volume i preface every man of determined inquiry who will ask without the dread of discovering more than he dares believe what is divinity what is law what is physic what is war and what is trade will have great reason to doubt at some times of the virtue and at others of the utility of each of these different employments what profession should a man of principle who is anxiously desirous to promote individual and general happiness chuse for his son the question has perplexed many parents and certainly deserves a serious examination is a novel a good mode for discussing it or a proper vehicle for moral truth of this some perhaps will be inclined to doubt others whose intellectual powers were indubitably of the first order have considered the art of novel writing as very essentially connected with moral instruction of this opinion was the famous turgot who we are told affirmed that more grand moral truths had been promulgated by novel writers than by any other class of men but though i consider the choice of a profession as the interesting question agitated in the following work i have endeavoured to keep another important inquiry continually in view this inquiry is the growth of intellect philosophers have lately paid much attention to the progress of mind the subject is with good reason become a favourite with them and the more the individual and the general history of man is examined the more proofs do they discover in support of his perfectability man is continually impelled by the vicissitudes of life to great vicissitudes of opinion and conduct he is a being necessarily subject to change and the inquiry of wisdom ought continually to be how may he change for the better from individual facts and from them alone can general knowledge be obtained two men of different opinions were once conversing the one scoffed at innate ideas instinctive principles and occult causes the other was a believer in natural gifts and an active fabricator of suppositions suggest but the slightest hint and he would erect a hypothesis which no argument at least none that he would listen to could overthrow so convinced was he of the force of intuitive powers and natural propensities as existing in himself that having proposed to write a treatise to prove that apple trees might bear oysters or something equally true and equally important he was determined he said to seek for no exterior aid or communication from books or things or men being convinced that the activity of his own mind would afford intuitive argument of more worth than all the adulterated and suspicious facts that experience could afford to this his antagonist replied he knew but of one mode of obtaining knowledge which was by the senses whether this knowledge entered at the eye the ear the papillary nerves the olfactory or by that more general sense which we call feeling was he argued of little consequence but at some or all of these it must enter for he had never discovered any other inlet if however the system of his opponent were true he could only say that in all probability his intended treatise would have been written in the highest perfection had he begun and ended it before he had been born if this reasoning be just i think we may conclude that the man of forty will be somewhat more informed than the infant who has but just seen the light deductions of a like kind will teach us that the collective knowledge of ages is superior to the rude dawning of the savage state and if this be so of which i find it difficult to doubt it surely is not absolutely impossible but that men may continue thus to collect knowledge and that ten thousand years hence if this good world should last so long they may possibly learn their alphabet in something less time than we do even now in these enlightened days for these reasons i have occasionally called the attention of the reader to the lessons received by the principal character of the following work to the changes they produced in him and to the progress of his understanding i conclude with adding that in my opinion all well written books that discuss the actions of men are in reality so many histories of the progress of mind and if what i now suppose be truth it is highly advantageous to the reader to be aware of this truth chapter i my birth family dignity insulted resentment of my grandfather parental traits of character there are moments in which every man is apt to imagine that the history of his own life is the most important of all histories the gloom and sunshine with which my short existence has been chequered lead me to suppose that a narrative of these vicissitudes may be interesting to others as well as to myself in the opinion of some people my misfortunes began before i was born the rector of my grandfather was as vain of his ancestry as a german baron and perhaps with no less reason being convinced that adam himself was his great progenitor my mother not having the fear of her father before her eyes forgetful of the family dignity disgraced herself and contaminated the blood of her offspring by marrying a farmers son had she married a gentleman what that very different being which a gentleman doubtless must have generated might have been is more than i as i now am can pretend to divine as it is however low it may sink me in the readers opinion truth obliges me to own i am but of a mongrel breed the delinquency of my mother was aggravated by the daringness of her disobedience for the rector having a foresight of what was likely to happen had laid his express command on her never to see hugh trevor my father more on the very night that she eloped add to which she had the example of an elder sister to terrify her from such dereliction of duty who having married a rake had been left a widow poor desolate and helpless and obliged to live an unhappy dependent on her offended father ill please my eye though i break my heart said my mother she kept her word young hugh was an athletic well proportioned handsome man of a sanguine temper prone to pleasure a frequenter of wakes and fairs and much addicted to speculate particularly in cards cocking and horseracing discarded by the rector who was obstinately irreconcileable my mother went with her husband to reside in the house of her fatherinlaw folly visits all orders of men farmers as well as lords and rectors can be proud of their families the match was considered as an acquisition of dignity to the house of trevor and my mother bringing such an addition of honour was most graciously received here she remained something more than a year and here ten months after the marriage i was born i had not openly assumed the form which the vanity of man has dignified with divine above a fortnight before my grandfather trevor died he had been what is usually called a good father had lived in reputation and had brought up a large and expensive family but as good in this sense usually signifies indulgent not wise he had rather afforded his children the means and taught them the art of spending money than of saving his circumstances were suspected the creditors were hasty to prefer their claims and it soon appeared that he had died insolvent the family was consequently dispersed and i thus early was in danger of being turned a poor wailing imbecil wanderer on a world in which the sacred rights of meum and tuum daily suffer thousands to perish fortunately considering the exigence of the moment my father who was enterprising adroit and loquacious prevailed on some friends to lend him money to stock the farm of the lease of which he was now in possession in this he succeeded the more easily because he had already acquired the character of an excellent judge of agricultural affairs he was known to be acute at driving bargains could value sheep heifers steers and bullocks better than a leicestershire drover was an excellent judge of horse flesh and during his fathers life had several times proved he knew the exact moment of striking earnest had fate sent him to a ministers levee instead of a market for quadrupeds he would have been a great politician he would have bought and sold with as much dexterity as any dealer in black cattle the kingdom can boast at the first approach of misfortune my mother had felt great despondency but when she saw her young husband so active animated and fruitful in resource her hopes presently began to brighten the parish where the rector resided was four miles from trevor farm and the desolate prospect that at first presented itself to the imagination of my mother had induced her to write with no little contrition and all the pathos she could collect to implore pardon for her offence but in vain her humiliation intreaties and dread of want excited sensations of triumph and obduracy but not of compassion in the bosom of the man of god the rector was implacable his pride was wounded his prejudices insulted and his anger rouzed he had beside his own money in his own pocket and there he was willing it should remain now we all know that pride prejudice anger and avarice are four of the most perverse imps the dramatis personae of the passions can afford the irreparable wrong done to the family dignity and the proper vengeance it became parental authority to inflict on such presumption as my father had been guilty of and such derogatory meanness as that of my mother were inexhaustible themes the severity of her father rendered the fortunate efforts of her husband tenfold delightful they mutually exulted in that futurity that should enable them to set the unkind rector at defiance and hugh often boasted he would prove though but a farmer that the blood in his veins was as warm and perhaps as pure as that of any proud parsons in the kingdom these were pleasant and flourishing but fleeting days my father when he went to the fair to purchase his team happened to see a fine hunter on sale it was a beautiful beast who could forbear to prefer him and his noble form high blood and spirited action to the slouching dull and clumsy carthorse hugh trevor was not a man so deficient in taste he therefore instead of a team of five brought home three horses for the plough and this high bred hunter for his pleasure my mother herself when she saw the animal and heard her husbands encomiums could not but admire nay she had even some inclination to approve especially when she listened to what follows my dear jane said my father to her after alighting from the back of his hunter which he had walked trotted and galloped to convince her how perfect he was in all his paces my dear jane we have an excellent farm the land is in good condition the fences sound and the soil rich no man in this county understands seeding cropping and marketing better than i do we shall improve our stock and double our rent it was a hundred and fifty pounds per annum the first year i shall soon meet with a smart nag fit for the side saddle and shall easily make you a good horse woman and then when the seed is in the ground we may be allowed to take a little pleasure perhaps we may ride by the rectors door and if he should not ask us in we will not break our hearts who knows but in time we may have cause to be as purse proud as himself my father as it appears was sanguine high spirited and not without resentment my mother though her fancy was not quite so active did not think his reasoning much amiss and recollected the jaunts they were to take between seed time and harvest with complacency chapter ii progress of my education and conjectures on its consequences bold in his projects lucky in his bargains and fertile in resources every thing for a time which my father undertook seemed to prosper in the interim i grew apace and according to the old phrase was my fathers pride and my mothers joy his free humour and the delight she took in exhibiting her boy had occasioned me in early infancy to be handed from arm to arm and so familiarized to a variety of countenances as soon to be entirely exempted from the usual fears of children my fathers bargains and sales brought me continually acquainted with strange faces he was vain of me fond of having me with him and as he called it of casehardening me i became full of prattle inquisitive had an incessant flow of spirits and often put interrogatories so whimsical or so uncommon as to make myself remarkably amusing from inclination indeed and not from plan my father took some trouble in my education which i suspect was productive of unforeseen effects he played with me as a cat does with her kitten and taught me all the tricks of which he was master they were chiefly indeed of a bodily kind such as holding me over his head erect on the palm of his hand putting me into various postures making me tumble in as many ways as he could devise pitching me on the back of his hunter and accustoming me to sit on full trot with abundance of other antics at which he found me apt yet being accompanied with laughter and shouts and now and then a hard knock they tended or i am mistaken not only to give bodily activity but to awaken some of the powers of mind among which one of the foremost is fortitude insomuch that since i have had the honour to become a philosopher i have begun to doubt whether hereafter when the world shall be wiser the art of tumbling may not possibly supercede the art of dancing but this by the by nor was my mother on her part altogether deficient in activity exclusive of providing me with a sister who from some accident or other was but a puling wrangling rickety young lady she initiated me in the mysteries and pleasures of the alphabet the rector had taken some trouble to make his daughters good english scholars and my mother though she had retained much of his solemn song could not only read currently and articulate clearly but made some attempts to understand what she read it must be acknowledged however that her efforts were but feeble i know not how it happened that i very early became in love with this divine art but such was the fact i could spell boldly at two years and a half old and in less than six months more could read the collects epistles and gospels without being stopped by one word in twenty soon afterward i attacked the bible and in a few months the tenth chapter of nehemiah himself could not terrify me my father bought me many tragical ditties such as chevy chace the children in the wood death and the lady and which were infinitely the richest gems in my library robin hoods garland and the history of jack the giantkiller to render these treasures more captivating observing the delight it gave me he used sometimes to sing the adventures of robin hood with me whether to the right tunes or to music of his own composing is more than i know by accidents of this and the like kind i became so much my fathers plaything and toy that his affairs then going on prosperously he put me in breeches before i was four years old bought me a pony which he christened gray bob buckled me to the saddle for safety and with a leading rein used frequently to take me with him to markets fairs and races but before i proceed to relate more of my infantine adventures it will be necessary to introduce a kinsman of mine to the readers acquaintance of whom though the alliance were now of some standing he has yet never heard chapter iii rational courtship and prudent views of widowed lovers a strange doubt hinted the husbands code laws are quickly prescribed and yes is easily said i have already mentioned my aunt her imprudent first marriage the rectors resentment who used to pronounce himself the most unfortunate of men in undutiful children and her irksome dependence on his bounty with this aunt mr elford a man of much worth considerable knowledge and great integrity of intention became acquainted and by a variety of motives was prompted to pay her his addresses no people are so certain of the happiness of a state of wedlock as a couple courting some difference however must be made between lovers who have never married and lovers who having made the experiment find it possible that a drop of gall may now and then embitter the cup of honey my aunts first husband had been a man of an easy disposition and readily swayed to good or ill she had seldom suffered contradiction from him or heard reproach a kind of good humoured indolence had accustomed him rather to ward off accusation with banter or to be silent under it than to contend his extravagance had obliged her to study the strictest economy she therefore was the ostensible person she regulated she corrected she complained she had a tincture of the rector in her composition and her husbands follies afforded sufficient opportunities for the exercise of her office after his death which happened early the wrecks of his originally small fortune scarcely afforded her subsistence for a year by many humble but grating concessions on her part and no less proud upbraidings on the part of her father she was first allowed a trifling annuity almost too scanty to afford the means of life and as it were in resentment to the unpardonable conduct of my mother was afterward permitted to return to the parsonage house the state of subjection in which she was kept the dissatisfaction this evidently created the gloom that was visible in her countenance and that seemed to oppress her heart added to a disconsolate and habitual taciturnity soon occasioned mr elford to consider her with compassion and the very questioncan i not afford her relief gave birth to ideas of a still more tender nature these were seconded by a retrospect to his own situation he had lost a beloved wife who had left him an infant daughter in whose future felicity he was strongly interested he had often considered the subject of education and had become the determined enemy of boardingschools where every thing is taught and nothing understood where airs graces mouth primming shouldersetting and elbowholding are studied and affectation formality hypocrisy and pride are acquired and where children the most promising are presently transformed into vain pert misses who imagine that to perk up their heads turn out their toes and exhibit the ostentatious opulence of their relations in a tawdry ball night dress is the summit of perfection determined that his child should be sent to no such academy he considered a second marriage as necessary though an excellent economist he was utterly a stranger to avarice my aunt was neither rich nor handsome nor young being according to the rectors account on the debtor side of his books of an adust complection atrabilarious in look and temper thirtyfour and two years older than mr elford but he imagined he could make her happy or at least could relieve her from a state little less than miserable he likewise supposed that she was well fitted to promote plans which he held to be wise errors in moral calculations frequently escape undetected even by the most accurate but as he was very sincere and honest in his intentions he thought proper while paying his court to her to explain what his expectations were and the reasons on which they were grounded his system was there must be government and if government there must be governors this by the by i believe to be a radical mistake in politics though i likewise believe there is not one man in fifty thousand who would not scoff at me for the supposition proceeding in his hypothesis he concluded that the strongest understanding had a prescriptive and inherent right to govern and with great candour thus laying down the law to my aunt he undisguisedly avowed a conviction that his understanding was the strongest and that to govern would be his inherent right his words were so powerful his arguments so excellent his statement of them so clear and all his deductions so indubitable that my aunt had not the least objection to offer that must be allowedthat cannot be deniednothing can be more reasonablewere her continual answers the consequence of all this was a marriage and my aunt having been noted for her prudence during the life of her first husband though not indeed in having made him her husband and mr elfords character for propriety rectitude and good intention being still more permanently established there was not the least doubt entertained especially by the parties but that this would be a happy match having thus brought the reader and mr elford together i must now proceed to relate the manner in which i myself and my good uncle first became acquainted chapter iv my curiosity leads me into danger but introduces me to a friend who discovers that he is my uncle in the month of august and the city of a fair is annually held in which during those halcyon days of prosperity my father was an active trafficker thither the neighbouring gentry yeomanry and dealers in general repaired as the best mart in the county at which to expend their money it was fifteen miles from trevor farm curiosity is an incessant impulse to youth i intreated to go and my petition was favourably received when we were there in consequence of some bargain or sale it happened that my father had occasion to ride with a farmer to a place at some distance from the fair and in the interim to leave me in the care of the barmaid of the inn at which we had put up he had not been long gone before i eager to see what could be seen broke loose from my keeper who was too busy to pay much attention to me and strolled into the throng i wandered about without any suspicion of danger from place to place i know not how long to drink in all the knowledge that could enter at my eyes how i came there i cannot tell but at last it appears i had rambled into a coffeehouse put questions to the guests who found amusement in the novelty of my undaunted air appearance and prattle and having taken up a newspaper and begun to display my talent was placed upon a table to read it aloud to the company the astonished farmers could scarcely believe their ears so much was i a fouryearold child their superior in learning some of them were not certain that i was not an imp of satan so utterly did my performance exceed credibility my beauty too at this age was uncommon my limbs were straight and strong my cheeks of the purest red and white and my full flaxen hair hung in short ringlets down my neck the mistress and barmaid kissed me the men gave me money and they all eagerly enquired who i was where i was going and how i had come there in the height of this scene it happened that mr elford came in who though two years married to my aunt till that time had never seen me though his understanding prevented any stupid wonder yet he felt uncommon emotion for a child unknown to everybody yet happy and fearless and so attractive in manners form and intelligence he asked what was my name i answered little hugh from whence did i come from homewho brought me gray bobwhere was i going to see the fair in the midst of these interrogatories a beggar with a child at her back and another that she led came into the coffeeroom in one hand i had a cake given me by one of the company which i had begun to eat and in the other the money that the kindness and amazement of my auditors had forced upon me the woman intreated piteously for relief and the landlord angry that his guests should be disturbed advanced to turn her out she again intreated with great earnestness for charity that she inspired me with some share of pity seems certain for i held out my hand with the money to her and saidhere pleased with my promptness mr elford bade her take it and she obeyed the child at her back seeing my cake stretched out its arm i understood its language and was going to give it the cake but checked myself and said no you must not have all your brother must have a bit and broke it between them seized with one of those emotions to which some few people are subject mr elford snatched me in his arms kissed me and exclaimedmy good boy i prophecy thou wilt one day be a brave fellow just as this was passing the city bellman took his stand opposite the coffeehouse door and with his o yes gave notice that i was lost concluding with a description of my age dress name and place of abode mr elford immediately conjectured his business went to listen was struck when he heard the particulars and hastily returned to ask me if my name was hugh trevor i answered yes little hugh he instantly ran after the bellman told him the boy was found and i was conducted by mr elford and the bellman with a crowd in their retinue back to my terrified father between whom and my uncle an acquaintance from this time commenced chapter v benevolent stratagem of my uncle defeated by the unlucky and foolish triumph of my father the anger and oath of the rector mr elford cultivated a small estate of his own lying about ten miles from trevor farm and beyond that village of which my grandfather was the spiritual guide the daughter for whose sake he had first been prompted to marry again was dead and this perhaps was one cause that strengthened his affection for me he frequently rode over to visit us made himself my playmate and favourite encouraged a greater degree of intimacy between the sisters who were not too cordially inclined toward each other and soon obtained permission to take me home with him for a fortnight the disposition he shewed to aid my father and the possibility that i might one day be his heir readily induced my parents to comply mr elford as his history will shew was perhaps liable to greater mistakes than might have been expected from a man of so much understanding ardour and goodness of intention but though like other men occasionally blind to his own errors he could not but feel pain at the obduracy of the rectors conduct toward my mother for this reason on my first visit to his house he concerted a plan by which he hoped to effect a reconciliation from the incidents that occurred i think it probable that he would have accomplished his purpose had it not been for a trick that my father played by which this well meant scheme was rendered abortive squire mowbray the lord of the manor in which lay the village where my grandfather lived kept his coach and his post chariot the rector who had a secret enmity to him or rather to that influence by which his own power was diminished kept his coach and his post chariot too lest he should openly avow inferiority and his dignity be called in question to add to these honours he was drawn by a pair of bays it happened that one of these animals became unfit for service was sold and another was wanting as his successor a neighbouring horsebreeder had one that was a good match and for which the rector had bidden money but not enough my father in the mean time had purchased this and other horses of the owner and the rector when it was too late sent to offer the man his own price the breeder made application to my father to have the horse again with an allowance of profit to which he consented till he was accidentally told for whom the horse was designed flushed with temporary success and fallacious hopes hugh was happy to find an opportunity of shewing that he could resent as well as the rector and exultingly swore he should not have the horse if he would purchase him at his weight in gold the message with a due increase of insulting aggravation was conveyed to the divine who was so exasperated by this audacious act of insolence and gratuitous rebellion that he went down on his knees and took a solemn oath never to forget or forgive the injury whether this became an apostle of peace or whether divines are all and unexceptionably apostles of peace are questions which i do not here pretend to analyze ignorant of this event and glowing with the desire of affording me a grandfathers protection mr elford pursued his little plot the rector had always wished for a male heir the offspring of his own loins but in this he had not been indulged by those powers that regulate such matters a son of his own being therefore past hope mr elford imagined he might perhaps find consolation in the succedaneum of a grandson accordingly a few days after my arrival at his house where i was to stay a fortnight he invited the rector who had never yet seen me to dinner without telling him who i was my uncle made me so diverting by the art with which he knew how to manage me that the old gentleman quite surprized declared i was a very extraordinary child so fearless and free was my behaviour that the rector and i presently became familiar i shook hands with him sat on his knee felt in his pocket gave him the history of gray bob and asked for a penny to buy me a whip my request being granted i wanted immediately to have a horse saddled that i might ride to market and make my purchase and the good humour with which i received the information that this was a favour not to be obtained further gained on the old theologians heart i asked if he had a horse he answered yes he had many horses and that if i would go home with him he would let me ride them all come let us go said i taking hold of his hand and pulling him mr elford waiting for the proper moment and interrupting me asked my grandfatherif you sir had but such a little fellow of your own what would you do with himdo exclaimed the rector i would make a man of him oh that he had been mine twenty years agoand why not o that he were mine now answered mr elfordi could be well contented that he were as he said this the rector strange to tell sighedyour wishes then are gratified continued mr elford he is your ownhowyour grandson the reverend pastor was taken by surprise certain associations had been set afloat and the desire of realizing the vision had for a moment obliterated the recollection of revenge go hugh said mr elford and kiss your grandfather without asking any questions or shewing the least token of reluctance i went up to him as i was bidden to give the kiss but my goodhumoured face stretched out arms and projecting chin were presented in vain the words hugh and grandfather had conjured up the fiend and the rector sat motionless not accustomed to meet and therefore not expecting repulse i climbed up his chair stayed myself by the breast of his coat and sat down on his knee the recollection of his daughters crime his contaminated blood and the insufferable insolence of my father came strongly upon him he scowled at me seized me by the arms flung me from him with something like violence and walked hastily out of the house the tide of passion ran so high that he would not stay to dine but departed muttering anger at the conduct of mr elford and repeating asseverations of eternal resentment and maledictions against undutiful children mr elford felt an emotion something stronger than grief to see a pastor of the flock of christ thus cherish the spirit of persecution on me the scene made but little impression i had no apprehension that the day was coming when this inflexible guide of christians would find his prayers effectual and his prophecies of vengeance fulfilled how could i know that there was so hateful a vice as malignity the holy seer did not indeed indulge his wrath quite so far as elisha at least not openly he did not curse me in the name of the lord nor did shebears come out of the wood to devour me but i soon enough had my share of misfortune preachers of peace it appears were always irritable but to do them justice i believe they are something less so now than they were of old chapter vi my different preceptors and early propensities i ride to hunt with my father which is productive of a strange and terrible adventure my fathers affairs still continued to wear the appearance of success and by the aid of mr elford he extended his speculations for some few years my time passed merrily away under the tuition of my father i gained health strength and intrepidity and was taught to sip ale eat hung beef ride like a hero climb trees run jump and swim that as he said i might face the world without fear i grew strong of muscle and my thews and sinews became alert and elastic in the execution of their office to my uncle i was indebted for hints and notions of a more refined and elevated nature by familiar instances he endeavoured to make me distinguish between resisting wrongs and revenging them and to feel the pleasure not only of aiding the weak but of pardoning the vanquished from the books which i found in his house i likewise early acquired a religious propensity which was encouraged by my aunt with all her power and seconded by my mother their education and the dogmas they had heard from the rector had given them very high notions of the dignity of the clerical character in the superior presence of which temporal things laymen and civil magistracy itself sunk into insignificance the perusal of foxs book of martyrs of which i was so fond that i would sit with my aunt for hours before i was eight years old and read it to her aided their efforts and this childhood bias as will be seen greatly influenced my first pursuits in life we are all the creatures of the necessities under which we exist the history of man is but the history of these necessities and of the impulse emotion or mind by them begotten of the incidents of my childhood that which made the deepest impression upon me i am now going to relate the daring hugh my father who feared no colours had long been accustomed whenever he could find time and often indeed when he could not to follow the fox hounds and hunt with his landlord the squire himself among his other bargains he had lately bought one of the squires brood mares bay meg that had been sold because she had twice cast her foal on the eve of my ninth returning birthday being in a gay humour he was seldom sad he said to me i shall go out tomorrow morning with squire mowbrays hounds hugh will you get up and go with me my heart bounded at the proposal yes said i lord husband exclaimed my mother would you break the childs neck there is no fear retorted i well said hugh continued my father you shall ride bay meg you are but a feather she will carry you with ease and will not run away with you never fear that replied i stoutly my mother at first made some opposition but my father laughed and i coaxed intreated and teazed till she complied for this was by no means the first scene of the kind i went to bed with an overjoyed heart and a head so full of the morrow that i was up dressed and ready the first in the house the horses were brought out my father and i mounted we soon came up with the sportsmen and away we went in quest of a fox we were at first unlucky and it was late in the day before reynard was found but about noon the hounds opened he started in view and the sport began the chace happened to be long heavy and continued for many miles my father was an eager sportsman he valued himself both upon his hunter and his horsemanship and who should be first in at the death was an honour that he would contend with the keenest sportsman in the kingdom though it were the squire himself the running was so severe that bay meg became willing to lag he looked behind called after me to push on and i obeyed and laid on her with whip and heel as lustily as i could my father anxious to keep sight of me yet not lose the hounds pulled in a little and the hunted animal in hopes of finding cover made toward a wood being prevented from entering it he skirted along its sides and turning the corner the hindmost sportsmen followed by a short cut through the wood keeping my eye on my father i likewise struck into the wood but taking a wrong direction was presently entangled among the trees and brambles and entirely at a loss i afterward learned that my father having lost sight of me for some minutes stopped hoping i should come up and then rode back to seek me while i was spurring forward in a contrary line after many efforts stoppages and windings i at last made my way through the wood and came to the entrance of an extensive heath the hounds though at a great distance were still in hearing and bay meg accustomed to the sport erected her ears and listened after them with great attention for some time longer she obeyed the whip and increased her gallop evidently with a desire to come up with them but after a while finding they were out of hearing she grew sulky slackened her pace tired and at last fairly stood still i had been so much used to horses that perceiving her humour i had the sagacity to turn her head homeward and she then went on again though with a sullen and sluggish pace on looking round however and considering my alarm began i was in the middle of an extensive heath or moor with no living creature house or object in sight except here and there a scattered shrub and a few sheep it was winter and the day was far advanced add to this the wind had risen and when i turned about was in my face and blew a sharp sleet which then began to fall full in my eyes half blinded me and the mare and offended her nostrils so much that she once more wheeled about and refused to proceed either one way or the other not yet quite daunted while i was making every effort to bring her round a gust of wind blew off my hat forgetting that bay meg was tall and i short and that there was neither gate nor mounting stone to be seen i alighted to recover my hat being down to get up again was impossible my foot could not reach the stirrup the lowering sky the approach of darkness and the utter desert in which i found myself at length conjured up the full distress of the scene which seized upon my imagination and i burst into tears i continued sobbing crying and tugging at bay meg till night had fairly overtaken us at last i found myself beside some white railing which was the boundary of a race course within the distance this at first seemed to promise me relief with great difficulty i coaxed bay meg up to it climbed upon the railing and hoped once more to mount but in vain the perverse animal set her face to me nor could any language i was master of prevail on her to approach sideways and if i lifted my whip she did but run backward and pull me down this contest continued i know not how long till quite hopeless i gave it up and again proceeded to lead her not knowing where or in what direction i was going after a time the moon appeared and a very indifferent afternoon was succeeded by a fine night i continued sobbing but still proceeded as fast as i could prevail on bay meg to follow me till propitious fortune brought me to a road where the wheels had cut deep ruts and the tread of horses had left the ridges high here i once again essayed to mount and by the help of the stirrup succeeded still i knew not where i was nor what to do except that my only chance was to go on i had not proceeded far before the traces of road began to diminish and i struck into another path that seemed more beaten this gradually disappeared and i soon found myself on the level greensward without any marks of footing for my guide to relieve this new distress i turned to the right hoping again to recover the track i had lost instead of which after riding on i know not how far i found the heath begin to grow marshy again i turned but so unfortunately that every step the mare set sunk her deeper and deeper in a bog till at last she could not drag herself out my danger was extreme but i rightly conjectured the bog would support me singly better than it would me and the mare i therefore jumped off kept hold of the bridle which i threw over her head and by shifting my ground prevented myself from sinking very deep while i continued my endeavours to relieve the mare she made a lucky plunge and i turning her head in a different direction as much as possible found myself in part released from this danger though i was obliged to proceed every step with the utmost precaution once more dismounted wearied and despairing i had no resource but to wander i knew not whither or lie down perishing with cold on a damp moor while a severe frost was setting in great as my distress was i had too much courage to sink under it and i went on giving some relief to my affliction by sobs and tears these various circumstances continued till the night began to be far advanced but after two or three hours of most tedious and weary wandering i again came to a rising ground by the help of which with great efforts i once more contrived to mount i was no sooner in the saddle than i thought i saw a light at a distance which sometimes seemed to glimmer and as often disappeared toward this however i determined to direct my course and proceeded losing and recovering it till i could catch sight of it no more continuing in the same direction for some time i came to a barn benumbed fatigued and ready as i was to drop from the saddle i entered it as joyfully as a shipwrecked sailor climbs a barren rock i scarcely could dismount and it was with great difficulty i could unbuckle and take off the bridle of bay meg but my hands were so frost bitten and my perseverance so exhausted that the saddle was beyond my ability i therefore shut the door and left her to feed on what she could find while i went and laid myself down among some trusses of straw that were heaped on one side the pain of my thawing hands would not immediately suffer me to go to sleep and just as it was beginning to decrease and i to slumber the door opened and a woman came in my fears were again alarmed for as i listened i heard her weep bitterly in no long time afterward a man leaned forward through the door and saidmary art thou thereto which she replied with a sobyea tummas i be here my half frozen blood and my fears again afloat made me tremble through every limb and there was something in the grief of the woman and particularly in the voice of the man which had no tendency to calm my agitation i could see distinctly for the moon shone full in at the door he entered the barn they sat down together and after some trifling questions i heard the following dialogue and so mary thou sayst thou beest with child yea tummas that i too surely be the more is my hard hap and what dost thou mean to do nay tummas what doon you mean to do no matter for thatthou threatest me last night that thou wouldst swear thy bastard to me for shame for shame tummas to talk othatn if it mun be a bastard thou well knowest it is a bastard of thy own begetting i know better oh christ tummas canst thou look in my face and tell me that yea i can thou art a base false man tummas dont call names thou knowest thou art

be for nothing but mayhap thou hadst a better a kept a good tongue in thy head thou hadst a better a kept an honest one in thine tummas ill make thee repent taunting me as thou hast done afore folks and threaping and threating to lay thy bastard at my door do thy worst thou hast brought me to shame and misery and hast sworn thyself to the bottomless pit what canst thou do more thou shall see as he said this he deliberately drew a knife from his pocket and began to whet it upon his shoei was breathless my hair stood on endthe woman exclaimed jesus god tummas what dost thou mean say thy prayers merciful saviour why thou wilt not murder me tummas thou shalt never go alive out of this place christ have mercy upon my sinful soul ill do thy business for the gracious love of the merciful heaven tummas bethink thyself ill teach thee to swear thy ugly bastard brat to me i wunnot tummas i wunnot for christ jesus sake bethink thyself dunnot murder me tummas oh dunnot murder me ill never trouble thee tummas while i have breath ill never trouble thee indeed indeed i wunnot i know thee better tomorrow thou wouldst tell all this and all never tummas as god shall pardon my sins never never never the poor creature screamed with agony while the determined fellow kept whetting his knife at last she made a sudden spring and endeavoured to seize his arm but missing her aim he immediately struck her with his fist and began to stab her unable to contain myself i shrieked with no less horror and vociferation than the poor mangled creature the mare herself took fright and sprang with the snorting of terror and clattering of hoofs with her shoulder against the door endeavouring to get out this unexpected noise aiding his guilt inspired the murdering wretch with instantaneous dread and he immediately took to flight leaving the woman weltering in her blood groaning and as i supposed expiring impelled by my fears and the horror of the scene i had no longer any feeling of cold or sense of debility i ran to the door shut it and finding a fork that stood beside it made as good a cross barfastening as i was able i then resolutely set my own shoulder to it and there remained i know not how long in momentary dread the murderer would return the womans groans seemed to diminish as if she were dying and i durst neither stir nor speak for i feared to do any thing but listen the energy of my terror was so great that it was very very long before i was weary enough of my situation to be obliged to move fatigue and a dead silence without at length however induced me first to change my position and after a time gradually and with great caution to open the door and look out neither hearing nor seeing any thing i waited awhile and then ventured so far as to walk round the barn though in the utmost trepidation and possessed by the most horrid fears which were increased by a great increase of darkness the moon being then either descending or hidden behind the clouds having made no discoveries except that every thing was quiet i once more entered the barn where all was still as death the woman had ceased to groan nor could i though i listened with the most solicitous attention hear her breathe horror returned in all its force and i stood immoveable unknowing what to resolve on or what to attempt at length i took courage and exclaimed in the name of god if you are alive speak the very sound of my own voice inspired unutterable terror which was augmented by a heavy and long confined groan proceeding from the woman she had retained her breath fearing the return of the assassin the answer that followed her groan was if you are a christian soul get me some help i told her i was lost benighted and did not know where to go for any she replied there was a town not half a mile distant at the back of the barn and named the very place at which my aunt and uncle elford lived as soon as surprise and joy would permit i asked if she knew mr elford her answer was i am his servant and this is his barn various recollections immediately crouded upon me and the scene and the voice of poor mary to which a moment before i had been so utter a stranger became familiar to me it is i mary little hugh said i dont you know me a dismal oh excited no doubt by the most painful associations was her answer i desired her to be quiet and patient while i ran for aid assuring her i would soon be back for that i now knew where i was and was perfectly acquainted with the road accordingly away i ran with all the speed i had to my uncles house where when i arrived i knocked at the door pelted the window and called as vociferously as i could for them to rise the housedog barked violently and my uncle was soon at the window with my aunt at his back demanding with surprise and dissatisfaction who i was and what i wanted i exclaimed come down uncle a man has been murdering your maid mary she will be dead if you do not make haste good god cried my aunt pressing forward child hugh trevor nephew is it you yes yes aunt answered i make haste and try to save the poor creatures life the astonishment excited by such a messenger bringing such a message and at such an hour may well be imagined master mistress and servants were immediately in motion and the doors opened question succeeded question exclamations were incessant and my answers quickly communicated much of the terror i myself had felt regulating his proceedings according to my account mr elford dispatched a servant to the surgeon and having prepared a hurdle by way of litter went with me and two of his men to the barn my aunt was very loath i should return but my spirits by the various incidents of the night were much too active to suffer me to feel either hunger weariness or want of sleep and mr elford recollected i might be useful in preventing the terrors of poor mary at our approach for which reason he suffered me to run before and inform her that help was coming when i came to the barn the moment i set my foot over the threshold my terrors of murder and of her having expired all returned after a short pause i called with a trembling voice mary are you alive and my heart bounded with joy to hear her though dolefully answer yea mr elford and his attendants soon came up and the remainder of the story of poor mary was that being removed and put to bed her wounds though deep and dangerous were found not to be mortal that she recovered in a few weeks and by the influence of mr elford was retained in my aunts service to the great scandal of the place where it was affirmed that such hussies and their bastards ought to be whipped from parish to parish and so as i suppose whipped out of the world that in two months time she was delivered of a fine boy whom when my uncle left the country she maintained by her own hard earnings and that in the extremity of her distress when she thought herself at the point of death she obstinately refused to declare who was her intended murderer and though by his having been known to be her sweetheart and his flight from the country where he never more appeared people were sufficiently convinced who the man was yet her pertinacious theme wasshe would never be his accuser if god could pardon him she could chapter vii mistakes and family quarrels of mr and mrs elford his departure and exile with the letters he wrote and now the period approached when the pleasures of the days of childhood were to terminate and when i was to experience an abundance of those rude disasters under which the poor the friendless and the fatherless groan the first stroke which the malice of fortune aimed at me was the voluntary banishment of my uncle though i have forborne to interrupt my narrative by a recapitulation of the unhappy bickerings that took place between mr elford and my aunt soon after their marriage yet these bickerings were very frequent very bitter and at last very fatal instead of the happiness which they and every body had thought so certain they were completely wretched my youth had not prevented me lately from remarking when at their house the steady and severe silence which mr elford endeavoured to preserve and the fixed dissatisfaction and gloom of my aunt notwithstanding the efforts they made especially mr elford not to suffer their unhappiness to extend beyond themselves it became frequently painful even for me to be in their company he indeed was often in part successful in these efforts but she seldom or never their mutual discontent was the more easily increased to misery because it happened between people who each had the character of prudent and whose partiality individually acquitted them of that disorder which the want of good temper alone had produced in making an estimate of the probable conveniences and inconveniences agreements and disagreements that might happen between them they had reciprocally been deceived mr elford had endeavoured to provide against this by a plain declaration of his sentiments and expectations which mrs elford had too inconsiderately concluded she should continue to think rational and just she imagined there was no fear of violent quarrels between a man of so much understanding as mr elford and a woman so disposed to listen to reason as herself she was ignorant of the power of habit over her temper the rector had taught her pride marriage had taught her misfortune and pride and misfortune had made her fretful melancholy and moody she had suffered no opposition from her first husband her will had been his law and she knew not till she had made the trial how difficult it is to concede with a good grace the least thing that offended her threw her into tears the passions of mr elford and my aunt were mutually too much inflamed for either of them to draw equitable and wise conclusions and tears he held to be a false insulting and odious mode of proclaiming him a tyrant it was to say i dare not utter my complaints in words but my tears i cannot restrain too angry to doubt of or examine his reasons convinced of his own humanity and his desire to see and make her happy such an accusation he considered so violently unjust as to be unpardonable it must be owned she did not confine her grief to weeping she was often seized with fits of hysteric passion in which the most outrageous and false accusations were indulged to reply to them or attempt to disprove what he knew to be so absurd he thought derogatory to innocence and the world half suspected him to be the tyrant he had been painted this increased his sense of injury and consequently did not diminish the affliction of my aunt of the happiness indeed which was to result from this marriage she had conceived romantic ideas and when she found herself again involved in the cares of a family liable to the control of a man who expected the utmost propriety and order who looked with a strict eye over every department and whose opinion did not always coincide with her own she became constantly peevish and her former gloom grew ten fold more gloomy she pined after that connubial affection which their reciprocal conduct was calculated to destroy and from the hasty decisions of passion convinced herself that no part of the blame was justly her own mr elford was no less obstinate in the contrary opinion taking philosophy such as he found it he like his neighbours too hastily concluded there were duties and affairs for which men were fitted but of which women were incapable blending much truth with some falsehood he thus argued the leading features in the character of an amiable and good woman are mildness complacency and equanimity of temper the man if he be a provident and worthy husband is immersed in a thousand cares his mind is agitated his memory loaded and his body fatigued he returns from the bustle of the world chagrined perhaps at disappointments angry at indolent or perfidious people and terrified lest his unavoidable connections with such people should make him appear to be indolent or perfidious himself is this a time for the wife of his bosom his dearest most intimate friend to add to his vexations and increase the fever of an overburthened mind by a contumelious tongue or a discontented brow business in its most prosperous state is full of anxiety labour and turmoil oh how dear to the memory of man is that wife who clothes her face in smiles who uses gentle expressions and who makes her lap soft to receive and hush his cares to rest there is not in all nature so fascinating an object as a faithful tender and affectionate wife had he wished for a wife who instead of indulging the caprice of indolence would have awakened him to energy and have taught him to be just not captious his desires would have been more rational but to a man who had formed a system of obedience to authority and not to reason the arguments he used were irrefragable to a woman who imagined that obedience in all cases was the badge of abject slavery they were absurd thus opposite in principle and in practice their unhappy state of existence finally became so intolerable to one of them at least as to occasion the violent measure and the painful sensations described by mr elford in the following letter to mrs elford the bitterness of unjust reproach the invectives of an ungoverned tongue the rancorous accusations of a stubborn heart these wretched as they long have made me to me are now no more forgetful man no more you i can forsake but where shall i fly to rid myself of them you have riveted them upon me and while i have life they can never die with you i have travelled through the vale of tears you like misery personified have held the cup of sorrow have fed me with affliction strewed thorns beneath my feet by day and wound adders round my pillow by night absence itself cannot afford a cure yes reconcile it to your conscience how you may you have given my peace a mortal wound you cannot forget when i first thought of you for a wife the plainness and sincerity with which i acted i carefully stated that my family was reputable but not rich and that i was a younger brother that my wealth was not great but that it was sufficient with industry and the character i had established to gratify the desires of people whose hearts were not vitiated and whose wants were bounded i conscientiously repeated my ideas concerning the regulations and economy of a well governed family and of the parts which it became the husband and the wife to take that was the time in which you ought to have made your objections but then every thing was just every thing was rational and from your ready acquiescence to my proposals and the admiration with which you seemed to receive them i had no doubt of enjoying that serene that delightful state of connubial happiness so often desired and so seldom obtained on such conditions and with such views i confidently entered with you into a partnership which unhappily cannot be dissolved the irrevocable contract was scarcely ratified before it was violated with a temper habitually gloomy and suspicious and a mind incapable of bending to those inevitable little anxieties and vexations which occur in the most quiet families you soon discovered your propensity to repel every thing that your jealous and fanciful temper deemed an infringement of your privileges let your own heart testify how long and how ardently i endeavoured by mildness and the most simple and convincing reasons to bring you back to your duty but in vain causes of disagreement became so frequent and injury succeeded injury so fast that i was obliged to proceed to those gentle severities which are all that a husband who preserves a proper respect for himself can inflict and gentle they certainly were when compared to the contumely by which they were provoked i forbore those tender and endearing epithets by which former affection should be continually revived i then avoided and indeed refused to converse with you except in the company of a third person or as far as necessity obliged me sorry am i to say that instead of warning you to shun the rocks of mischief my efforts did but aggravate your folly it is true you had your hours of contrition in which with tears and prayers and unbounded acknowledgments of the absurdity of your conduct together with solemn assurances of reformation you have for a moment recalled my lost love and made me hope you would acquire some power over the discordant passions that devoured you but these promises were so often repeated and so continually forgotten that at length they afforded neither hope nor ease they had only been gleams of sunshine foreboding that the tempest would soon return with increasing violence yes partial as i know you and blind to your own errors you cannot deny that at last you approached the fury rather than the woman to a man like me of a delicate temper quick at discovering errors and eager to redress them even in cases where they do not personally affect myself but indefatigable where they do this eternal discord these quarrels and despicable brawls are become insupportable i have endured the torture seven miserable years and surely that is no slight trial surely that is sufficient to prove i have not wanted patience or fortitude to be a good husband and a provident father and to protect those that depend on me from injury and want are qualities which i believe the whole world will allow me you alone excepted you upbraid me with faults you accuse me of crimes you proclaim me a tyrant when i am gone when your passions have subsided and when you feel the want of me you will be more just you will then lament that nothing short of this desperate proof could convince you of the criminality of your conduct where i shall seek where find or where endure existence or to what hospitable or inhospitable shore i shall wander i know not yet i only know that in england it cannot shall not be we have lived long enough in misery which everlastingly to avoid seas or death shall everlastingly divide us w elford this letter although it contained many marks of that impatience which had increased his family misfortunes could only have been written by a man of virtue whose very austerity had in it a preponderance of benevolent intention such was my uncle whose memory though but a child i often had occasion to regret by various plausible pretexts with the hope of forwarding a fortune that was to descend to me mr elford had been prevailed on to lend my father several sums of money to the amount of seven hundred pounds my uncle too had found other occasions for the exercise of his humanity his property had been hastily sold and therefore disadvantageously so that the sum with which he went to seek his fortune on foreign shores was but small he was enough acquainted with my fathers affairs to know that of the money lent to him there was little hope to me he wrote a letter which will sufficiently shew how kind he would have been had he possessed the power it was inclosed in one to my father with directions to suffer me to read it now and that it should be preserved and given to me when age should have matured my understanding the following were its contents to hugh trevor my dear boy young as you are i have conceived a friendship and affection for you which perhaps inflict as severe a pang at the present moment as any one of the distressing circumstances that occasion my flight had i wealth to leave i would endeavour to secure you from the baneful effects of poverty as it is accept all that i have to give my best wishes my dearest love and a little good advice though your understanding is greatly above your years yet you cannot have experience and knowledge enough of sorrow to conceive what my feelings are but if hereafter you should remember me and if at that most serious moment when you enter on the marriage state you should wish for a friend like me to advise with let this letter supply my place the miseries i have endured by my mistakes on the subject are so strongly imprinted on my mind that i can think of nothing else and inapplicable as it may seem to your present course of thought i cannot persuade myself but that it is the most interesting of all topics upon which i could write to you of the wisdom of entering into the marriage state and of the virtue of the institution i have lately begun to entertain the most serious doubts whether they are well founded or are the consequences of my own mistakes of conduct i dare not at this moment determine but while the present forms of society exist should you arrive at manhood the probability is that you will marry if then you should ever think of marriage think of it as a duty and not merely as the means of self gratification or the indulgence of some childish and irrational passion which irrational people dignify with the name of love let the affection you conceive for woman be founded on the qualities of her mind but above all things first examine yourself whether you can endure opposition without anger and next put the woman you intend to marry to the same test for unless you are mutually unshaken in your resolutions on this head if you marry you are miserable the task of man and wife is reciprocally arduous she should be mild goodhumoured cheerful and tender he cool rational and vigilant without acrimony devoid of captiousness and free from passion it is mutually their duty to inspect and to expostulate but to beware how they reprove where gentleness and equanimity of temper are wanting happiness never can be obtained believe me my dear boy i have never stood so low in my own opinion as when i have caught myself betrayed into petulance and descending to passion the combats i have maintained to overcome this weakness are inconceivable whether it be constitutional in me or habitual i cannot determinehad mr elford been more a philosopher he would have known that frequent anger is merely a habitbut i suspect that to this i chiefly owe my present misfortunes as i am half persuaded there is no woman that may not be moulded into what form her husband pleases provided he possess a superior understanding and an entire command of his temper but oh how severe the task to preserve a perfect equality in despite of the ill humour caprice or injustice of a woman for whom you undergo a thousand difficulties encounter continual labours and undauntedly expose yourself to every fatigue and dangeri blush to think i have sunk beneath the trialbut we have both gone too far to recede we have mutually said and done what never can be forgotten as good temper is the basis of connubial felicity means must be taken by which it may be cultivated and preserved from the first hour of marriage beware of too much familiarity and of encouraging or of taking liberties be as circumspect in your behaviour as if a stranger were present and dread deviating from that respect which is due from man to woman and from woman to man in a single state this does not imply coldness or formality but the cheerful intercourse of good sense behave as you would to a person from whom you are happy to receive a visit and with whose company you are delighted should you indulge those ebullitions of passionate fondness which lose sight of these limits it is impossible to foretell to what they may lead a caress neglected or supposed to be neglected a kiss not returned with the like warmth or a fond pressure not answered with equal ardour may poison a mind which applauds itself for the delicacy of its sensations do not expect to find your wife all perfection i know the romance of lovers they read descriptions in which the imagination has been exhausted to depict enamoured youth superior to every terrestrial being and they are convinced that above all others the object of their own particular choice has never yet been equalled such fanciful and silly people when time and experience have something allayed their ardour will often find their dainty taste offended at discovering a mole on the bosom or a yellow shade in the neck or any other trifling bodily blemish which was as visible before marriage as after had they looked with the same scrutinizing eyes be resolute in repelling every emotion of anger or disgust never permit a choleric or bitter expression to escape you for wedded love is but too often of a tender and perishable nature and such rude potions are its poison i look back at what i have been writing and am astonished at the subject i have chosen but the torrent of my thoughts is irresistible they hurry me away and persuade me that though young it is yet possible you may hereafter remember me and at a time when perhaps you shall have arrived at the exercise of many of those noble virtues which are now only in the bud i have a great affection for you my dear nephew and should be glad that if you then cannot think kindly you should at least think justly and that you should possess some faint picture of the present state of my feelings could you but know all the emotions of my heart you would bear witness to its honesty and would own that its efforts have been strenuous unremitted and sincere though unfortunate years pass quickly away yet a little while and you will be an actor in this busy world of which at present your knowledge is small i am doomed never to see you more but while i have life and memory i shall never forget you w elford chapter viii my father becomes a bankrupt flies the country lists for an east india soldier and dies on shipboard distress of my mother and the beginning of my misfortunes i am bound apprentice characteristic traits of my master the dreadful sufferings i undergo and my narrow escapes with life young as i was i perfectly remember that the strange departure of my uncle elford produced a very sensible effect upon me it may well be imagined that when my understanding was more mature the perusal of this affectionate letter and the recollection of his kindness to me in my days of childhood excited no little emotion as for my aunt prepared as she had been for some violent catastrophe to their quarrelling she was either so struck by the letter and the remembrance of past follies or so fearful of the comments and scrutiny of the neighbourhood that within a month after he was missing she quitted the country and went to reside at the city of where in less than a year she died her departure was private and the place of her retreat was not known till her last illness when intelligence was sent to the rector to whom she bequeathed such property as she possessed the absence of my uncle contributed to hasten the approach of that cloudy reverse at which i have already hinted for some time the ruin of my fathers affairs had been prevented by the sums which his eloquence had wrung from the wellmeaning mr elford hugh was no contemptible orator on these occasions hope seldom forsook him and he built so securely on what he hoped might come to pass as sometimes to assert the thing had already happened such convenient mistakes are daily made if indeed the good graces of fortune would but have kept pace with his expectations england would not have afforded a more flourishing or gallant yeoman but like monopolizers in general he was apt to speculate a little too deeply eager to enjoy he was impatient to obtain the means of enjoyment so that at one time the turning up of the jack at all fours was to make his fortune but how provoking it happened to be the ten at another it depended on a duckwing cock which who could have foreseen so strange an accident disgraced the best feeder in the kingdom by running away and it more than once did not want half a necks length of being realized by a favourite horse yet was lost contrary to the most accurate calculations which as the learned in these matters affirm had been made from wheatherbys racing calendar thus to repeated disappointments in his bets and his bargains and to his neglect of his farming affairs it was owing that in anno domini when i was nine years and a half old after having expended the property with which he had been supplied and incurred debts to the amount of little less than a thousand pounds my father found it prudent to depart by night in the basket of the stage coach for london and prudent it certainly was for his effects had not only been seized in execution of a bond and judgment but the bailiffs from all quarters were at his heels my mother at this time was pregnant the sister i have mentioned was dead but i had a fine healthy brother about three years old and it was agreed that we should follow to the great city as soon as he had found employment which according to his notions was the most easy thing imaginable it so happened however that he had not been there a full month before the trifling sum he and my mother had collected for his immediate existence was lost by the turn of a die contrary to his certain conviction that he had discovered at a hazard table the ready way to repair all past mistakes to send for wife and children was now out of the question destitute of support without the means of obtaining another shilling after fasting a day and a half his courage that is his appetite could hold out no longer and he enlisted for an eastindia soldier having first convinced himself by the soundest arguments that he should immediately be made a serjeant which perhaps was no improbable calculation that he should then soon get a commission and that he should undoubtedly return a commanding officer or general in chief to the surprise of his friends and the utter confusion of the rector and all those whom he accounted his persecutors that these great events might not actually have happened who shall pretend to say miracles of old were plentiful and even in these unbelieving days strange things have come to pass but all his unbounded hopes many of which he had stated in his last letter to my mother were unexpectedly subverted by an accident to which it appears men in general are subject he caught a fever while the ship in which he was to be a passenger lay waiting in the downs for a wind and in spite of the surgeon and his whole chest of medicines died of all which events there was a circumstantial account transmitted by one of his comrades to my mother the ruin of prospects so fair the desolation of a house and homeless woman with two orphan children and pregnant of a third and the loss of a husband who at the worst of times had always kept hope alive were sufficient causes of affliction to my mother tears were plentifully shed and daily and nightly wailings were indulged every resource was soon exhausted and immediate relief became necessary to whom could she apply to whom but the rector she wrote to him in terms the most moving the most humiliating and indeed the most abject that her imagination could suggest but in vain no prayers no tears no terrors of this world or of the next could move him the father and the divine were equally inexorable he pleaded his oath but he remembered his revenge after the first letter he would receive no more and when she wrote again and again with the direction in a different hand and using other little stratagems he returned no answer from this extreme distress and from the intolerable disgrace as my mother supposed it to be of coming on the parish we were relieved to the best of her ability by a poor widow woman with four children who had formerly lived a servant in the trevor family and who after her husbands death maintained herself and her orphans with incredible industry and with no other aid but the produce of a cow that she fed chiefly on the common where her cottage stood the active good sense with which she did every thing that was entrusted to her was the cause that she never wanted employment and she exerted her utmost attention to make her children as they grew up as useful as herself by this womans advice and aid my mother applied herself to spinning and it was agreed that i should either drive the plough or be put apprentice as soon as i could find a master for my own part all my sources of pleasure and improvement were at once retrenched that i had not horses to ride a father to play with and caress me and a kind uncle to instruct and delight me were among the least of my misfortunes reading that great field of enjoyment which was daily opening more amply upon me was totally cut off my curiosity had been awakened my memory praised and my acuteness admired in an instant as it were all these joys were vanished previous to my uncles departure i had found another mode of obtaining knowledge and applause he was musical and a few persons of the like turn scattered through the neighbouring hamlets used occasionally to meet at his house where they exercised themselves in singing from the works of croft green boyce purcell handel and such authors as they possessed one of them played the bassoon another the flute and a third the violin i had a quick ear was attracted by their harmony and began to join in their concerts a treble voice was a great acquisition i was apt and they encouraged me by frequent praise and admiration my uncle gave me arnolds psalmody in which i eagerly studied the rudiments of the science but this book with the rest was swept away in the general wreck and i after having had a glimpse of the enchanted land of knowledge was cast back apparently to perish in the gloomy deserts of ignorance i had no source of information except my mother and her stores at the best were scanty at present labour left her but little leisure and the little she had was spent in complaint the poor widow indeed willingly did me every kindness in her power but that alas was small with this honesthearted creature i remained eight months going out to a days work whenever i could get one to weed drive the plough set potatoes or any thing else that they would put me to till at last a farmer finding me expert agreed to take me as an apprentice on condition that i should serve him till i was one and twenty the offer was joyfully accepted by my mother and i had spirit and understanding enough to be happy that i could thus provide for myself i had soon reason to repent my master was the most passionate madman i ever beheld and when in a passion the most mischievous his cattle his horses his servants his wife his children were each of them in turn the objects of his fury the accidents that happened from his ungovernable choler were continual and his cruelty when in these fits was incredible though at other times strange to tell he was remarkably compassionate he one day beat out the eye of a calf because it would not instantly take the milk he offered another time he pursued a goose that ran away from him when he flung it oats and was so enraged by the efforts it made to escape that he first tore off its wing and then twisted its neck round on a third occasion he bit off a pigs ear because it struggled and cried while he was ringing it one of his children was lamed and though nobody knew how it happened every body gave him credit for the accident yet he had his paroxysms of fondness for his children and for the lame boy in particular indeed it was generally remarked that he was the most cruel to those for whom he had the greatest affection the perception of his own absurdity did but increase his rage till it was exhausted after which he has sometimes been seen to burst into tears at the recollection of his own madness and inhumanity one habit arising from his excessive vivacity was that when he wanted any thing done he expected the person nearest to him should not only instantly obey but conceive what he meant from the pointing of his finger the turn of his head or the motion of his eye without speaking a word while the dread of his anger stupified and rendered the person against whom it was directed motionless i continued for an unexampled length of time to be his favourite the family remarked at first with surprise and afterward either with a sense of injustice or of enmity the restraint he put upon himself and the great partiality with which he treated me my superior quickness excited his admiration he held me up as an example and laid the flattering unction to his soul that he was no tyrant on the contrary when people had but common sense nobody was more kind but old habits though they may suffer a temporary disguise are devils incarnate the tide of passion at length broke loose and with redoubled violence for having suffered constraint to add to the misfortune my thirst after knowledge was the cause or at least the pretext of this change it happened that an old book of arithmetic fell in my way and as this was at that time the sole treasure of instruction within my reach i made it my constant companion carried it in my bosom and pored over it whenever i could steal a moment to myself in the heinous act of reading this book i was twice detected by my moody master the first time he cautioned me with fire in his eyes never to let him catch me idling my time in that manner again and the second he snatched hold of my ear and gave me so sudden and violent a pull that he brought me to the ground he did worse he took away my book and locked it up hostilities having thus commenced they soon grew hot and were pursued with bitterness tyranny and malignity proceeding from bad to worse after a while every thing i did was wrong in proportion as his frenzy became hateful or rather terrible to his own imagination his cruelty increased he seemed in my instance to have the dread upon him of committing some injury so violent as perhaps to bring him to the gallows and several times in his chafing fits declared his fear this idea haunted him so much that he adopted a new mode of conduct with me and instead of kicking me knocking me down or hurling the first thing that came to hand at me gave himself time enough to take the horsewhip yet he could not always be thus cautious and even when he was such infernal discipline though less dangerous was more intolerable the scenes i went through with this man the sufferings i endured and the stupifying terrors that seized me if i saw but his shadow i can never forget every thing i did was a motive for chastisement one day it was for having turned the horses out to graze and the very next for suffering them to stand in the stable the cattle of his neighbour for whom he had a mortal enmity broke into his field during the night and for this i was most unmercifully flogged the next morning the pretence was my not having told him that the fence was defective rainy weather made him fret and then i was sure of a beating if it were fine he was all hurry anxiety and impatience and to escape the wicked itching of his fingers was impossible one effect that he produced might be thought remarkable had we not the history of sparta in its favour and did we not occasionally observe the like in other boys under tyrannical treatment the efforts i was obliged to make to endure the terrible punishment he inflicted and live at last rendered me to a certain degree insensible of pain they were powerfully aided indeed by the indignant detestation which i felt and by the something like defiance with which it enabled me to treat him this on one occasion exasperated him so much that seeing me support the lash without a tear and as if disdaining complaint he franticly snatched up a pitchfork drove it at me and i luckily avoiding it struck the prongs into the barndoor with the exclamation damn your soul ill make you feel me the moment after he was seized with a sense of his own lunacy turned as pale as death and stood aghast with horror my supposed crime was that i had eaten some milk the last of which i myself had seen the dog lap perceiving the terror of his mind i took courage and told him jowler eat the milk i saw him just as he had done i would not tell you because i knew if i had you would have hanged the poor dog this short sentence had such an effect upon him that he dropped on his knees the tears rolling from his eyes and cried out in an undescribable agony lord have mercy upon my sinful soul i shall surely come to be hanged the terror of this lesson remained longer than those who knew him would have expected but it insensibly wore away the efforts i made in the interval to conciliate and avoid wakening the fiend were strenuous but ineffectual i shrunk from no labour and the business with which he intrusted me shewed the confidence he placed in my activity and intelligence at eleven years old i drove the loaded team to market or elsewhere without a superintendant i was sent in every direction across the country to bring home sheep deliver calves to the butcher fetch cattle cart coals or any thing else within my strength various were the distresses in which these duties and the distempered choler of my master involved me on one occasion a wicked boy set his dog at my sheep and drove them into a turnip field out of which i could not get them but with great difficulty and loss of time of which my master demanded a severe account a calf once broke from me and foolishly tumbled into a waterpit from which i delivered it at the hazard of my life another time when the roads were heavy my waggon was set fast in a clay rut where i was detained above an hour two drivers refusing to give me a pull because they had both lived with my malicious master and a third being only prevailed on for this master of mine was generally hated by my prayers and tears and the picture i drew of my own distress at length the violence of his temper recovered its full elasticity which was a second time chiefly excited by my earnest longing after knowledge notwithstanding that my book was taken from me my mind was often occupied with the arithmetic i had learned in better days which had been strongly revived by its contents at the employment this afforded me i was twice caught by my master once multiplying and dividing with a nail against the paling and the second time extracting the square root with chalk on the wall these misdemeanours were aggravated by another incident i one morning happened to find by good luck as i thought a halfcrown piece that was lying on the high road the moment i was possessed of this treasure i began to consider how it ought to be expended i was in great want of shoes stockings and other things but with those my master was bound to provide me and if i attempted to supply myself the probability was that he would beat me for not having given him the money after pondering again and again on the necessaries i might obtain the luxuries in which i might indulge and what was infinitely more tempting the stores of learning with which such a sum would furnish me the recollection of my mother brother and sister for so the young one proved to be and their distress with that of the benevolent poor creature who afforded them a shelter seized me so strongly that i thought it would be wicked not to send my halfcrown where it was so much wanted but how to convey it thither that was the difficulty i had no means no messenger no soul in whom i durst confide i therefore resolved for the present to conceal it by pinning it in the lining of my waistcoat and this was one of those unforeseen events that are generally called lucky chances my masters devil was again let loose and a most uncontrolable devil he was i had overslept myself a very uncommon accident with me and had put him into one of his hateful humours at breakfast while eating his bread and cheese i was set to watch the milk that stood on the fire to boil by some accident i forgot my office he saw it rise in the pipkin looked toward me could not catch my eye and seized with one of his unaccountably hellish fits sprang forward just as the milk began to boil over and struck at me with a clasped knife that he held in his hand fortunately for me the point found resistance by the saving intervention of my halfcrown the clasp gave way with the violence of the blow and shutting made a deep gash in his own hand again he turned pale and as the blood smeared the floor knew not i believe whether it was mine or his own my dame trembling called out are you hurt hugh for she too saw the blood and knew not whose it was i answered no but with a tremulous voice being in dread of more blows they soon descended upon me after he had discovered his mistake and it was with difficulty that i escaped being thrown behind the fire this was not the end of the history of my halfcrown i kept it above three months till i happened to be sent to the market town with a load of hay here in passing through the street my eye as usual was attracted by the booksellers window i had not forgotten how rich i was and could not resist i went in examined some of the stores the shop contained and with great difficulty restrained myself to the purchase of the seven champions of christendom which cost me a shilling the other eighteen pence i found an opportunity it being market day of sending by a neighbour to my mother with an injunction that sixpence of it should be given to her poor hostess with what eagerness i read the valiant deeds of these valiant knights as i rode home in my empty cart i will leave the reader to divine but he will probably pity me when i inform him that i was so deeply engaged in my book as not to perceive the arrival of the cart at my masters yard gate and that he himself stood at the barn door contemplating me in the profound negligence of my studies riding in the cart neglecting the team having a new book and reading in it formed a catalogue of crimes too black to hope for pardon not the horse but the cart whip was the instrument of vengeance and after having tired himself and left weals of a fingers breadth on my body arms legs and thighs he completed his malice this time not by locking up but by burning my book i had already lived a year and a half under the tortures of this demon till they became so intolerable that at last i determined to run away i was confirmed in this resolution by another dangerous incident which terrified me more even than any of the preceding and convinced me that if i stayed any longer with this villainous savage i could not escape death i was one day driving the plough for him when a young horse not half broken in was the second in the team i used my utmost endeavours but could not manage him and the lunatic my master who was as strong as he was ferocious caught up a stone and aimed it at the colt at least so from his manner at the moment i supposed but struck me with it and knocked me down immediately in the furrow where the plough was coming i saw the ploughshare that in an instant was to cut me in two but the madman with an incredible effort started it out of the earth and flung it fairly over me unable however to recover his balance he trod upon my forehead with his hobnailed shoe and cut a deep gash just over my eye and another in my skull whether with the same foot or in what manner i do not know my eye was presently closed up and my hair steeped in the blood that flowed plentifully from both wounds there i lay stunned for a moment while he was obliged to attend to the frightened colt which forced the other horses to run and was become wholly unmanageable when i recovered i heard him holloa and saw him struggling with the horses at the farther end of the field but the impression of the danger i had just escaped was so strong that my resolution of running away came upon me with irresistible force and perceiving him so thoroughly engaged i immediately put it in execution i imagine it was some time before he missed me and he then probably conjectured i was gone home be it as it will i used my legs without molestation and committing myself to chance and the wide world made the best of my way chapter ix my flight desponding thoughts adventure with a stranger on the road i am promised relief but learn a fearful secret that again plunges me in doubt and anxiety i reveal myself to a near relation the struggles of passion the animation that fear gave me was so great that though i felt my shirt collar drenched in the blood that flowed from my wounds i continued to run for at least four miles and though my pace at length slackened into a walk i still hurried eagerly forward the dread of again falling into his power after an attempt so audacious as this deprived me of any other sense of pain afforded me strength and made me forget the completely desolate state to which i had reduced myself i had no money no food no friend in the world i durst not return to my mother she was the first person of whom the tyrant would enquire after me to avoid him was the only plan i yet thought of and thus impelled i pursued my road so long as i was acquainted with the country through which i travelled i went on without hesitation but as soon as i found myself entirely beyond my knowledge i began to look about me the questionswhere am i whither am i going what am i to doinspired a succession of rising fears which the joy of my deliverance could scarcely counterbalance i regretted the rash haste with which i had parted with my halfcrown i had not a farthing on earth i had nothing to sell nothing to eat no soul to give me a morsel it was noon when i fled from the ploughed field i had been hard at work from three oclock in the morning had since travelled at least twelve or fourteen miles wounded as i was and began to feel myself excessively weary stiff and craving after food where i had got the notion whether from father mother aunt or uncle i know not but i had been taught that to beg was an indelible disgrace and to steal every body had told me was the road to tyburn starve or hang that is the law if i even asked for work who wanted my service who would give me any who would not enquire where i came from and to whom i belonged these and many more tormenting ideas were forced upon me by the situation in which i found myself till at last i was so overcome with fears and fatigue that i sat down to debate whether it were not best or rather whether i should not be absolutely forced to turn back still however when i came to reflect on the sufferings i had endured the dangers i had escaped and the horrible punishment that awaited me if i returned any expedient seemed better than that terrific project the distance too exhausted as i thought myself was an additional fear and for a moment i doubted whether i should not lie down and die young minds hold death in peculiar horror and the very thought inspired returning energy among my cogitations i had not forgotten the rector he was obdurate hard hearted and even cruel but was he so cruel as the fiend from whom i had escaped from a latent and undefined kind of feeling i had made toward that side of the country where his village lay and was as i supposed within four or five miles of it the resolution of making an effort to gain his protection came upon me and i rose with some alacrity to put it in practice he kept horses a coachman and a stableboy he had a garden he farmed a little for his amusement in any of these capacities i could be useful and if he would but give me bread i would do whatever he would put me to he could not surely be so stony hearted as to refuse i was inexperienced and knew not the force of rancour i pursued my way ruminating on these hopes fears and disasters toward a village that i saw at a distance where i intended to inquire the road i meant to take descending a hill i came to a bridge over a rivulet of some depth with a carriage way through the water just as i had passed it i met a postchariot that drove into the stream i was walking forward with my face toward the village till i suddenly heard a cry of distress and looking behind me saw the carriage overturned in the water i ran with all speed back to the brook the body of the carriage was almost covered the horses were both down and the postillion entangled between them called aloud for help or his master would be drowned i plunged into the water without fear having as i have elsewhere noticed long ago learned to swim perceiving the extreme danger of the person in the carriage i struck directly toward the door which i opened and relieved him or confined as he was he must have been almost instantly suffocated his terror was exceedingly great and as soon as he was fairly on his feet he exclaimed with prodigious eagerness god for ever bless you my good boy you have saved my lifethe pallidness of his countenance expressed very strongly the danger of perishing in which he had felt himself we then both waded out of the water he sat down on the side of the bridge and i called to some men in a neighbouring field to come and help the postillion i then returned to the gentleman who was shivering as if in an ague fit i asked if i should run and get him help for he seemed very ill you are a compassionate brave little fellow said he and looking more earnestly at me exclaimed i hope you are not hurt how came you so bloody i knew not what to say and returned no answer you do not speak child said he let me go and get you some help sir replied inay nay but are you hurtnot more than i was before this accidentwhere do you come fromi was silentwho are youa poor friendless boyhave you not a fathernoa motheryes but she is forsaken by her father and cannot get bread for herselfhow came you in this conditionmy master knocked me down and trod on meknocked you down and trod on youyes he was very cruel to mecruel indeed did he often treat you illi do not know what other poor boys suffer but he was so passionate that i was never safeand you have run away from himi was afraid he would murder mepoor creature your eye is black your forehead cut and your hair quite clotted with bloodi have a bad gash in my head but i can bear it you shake worse and worse let me go and get you some help the village is not far offi feel i am not wellshall i call one of the mendo my good fellow i ran and the men came they had set the carriage on its wheels but it was entirely wet and not fit to ride in the gentleman therefore leaned on one of them walked slowly back to the village and desired me to follow i gladly obeyed the order he had pitied me i had saved his life if i could not make a friend i was in danger of starving and i began to hope that i had now found one the best accommodations that the only inn in the village afforded were quickly procured at first the gentleman ordered a postchaise to return home but he soon felt himself so ill that he desired a bed might be got ready and in the mean time sent to the nearest medical man both for himself and to examine my wounds what was still better he ordered the people of the house to give me whatever i chose to eat and drink and told them he had certainly been a dead man at that moment if it had not been for me but he would not forget me he would take care of me as long as he lived this was joyful news indeed or rather something much more exquisite than joyful my heart melted when i heard him i burst into tears and replied i would willingly die to serve him he then went to bed and as evening came on the fever with which he was attacked increased the anxiety i felt was excessive and i was so earnest in my intreaties to sit and watch by him that he was prevailed on to grant my request from what i can now recollect i imagine the apothecary gave him the common remedy dr jamess powders when the medicine no longer operated he fell into a sound sleep about eleven oclock and when he awoke the next morning found himself much refreshed and free from fever in the interim my wounds had been dressed and to make the truth of my story evident i took care to shew the bruises and black and blue marks with which my body was plentifully covered every favourable circumstance every precaution every effort was now indeed become necessary for late in the evening i accidentally learned a secret of the most important and hopeinspiring yet alarming nature my all was at stake my very existence seemed to depend on the person who it is true had promised to be my protector but who perhaps when he should hear who i was might again become my persecutor the man to whom i had attached myself whose life i had saved and who had avowed a sense of the obligation was no other than my grandfather the moment i heard this terrific intelligence it chilled and animated me alternately and as soon as i could recollect myself i determined not to quit his apartment all night no persuasions could prevail on me and when the chambermaid who sat up with him attempted to use force i was so violent in my resistance that she desisted and suffered me to remain in quiet when he awoke in the morning i trembled at the sound of his voice i remembered the oath he had sworn which my mother had often affirmed he would never break he was totally changed in my idea from the gentleman whose life i had saved the day before there had not indeed been any thing particularly winning in his aspect but then there was a strong sense of danger and of obligation to the instrument of his escape who interested him something the more by being unfortunate but an oath solemnly taken by a man of so sacred a character the thought was dreadful his curtains were drawn and my trepidation increased what my good boy said he are you up and here already he has never been in bed answered the chambermaid we could not get him out of the room i replied in a faint voice such as my fears inspired i hoped he was better yes yes said he i have had a good sleep and feel as if i wanted my breakfast go my girl and let it be got ready the chambermaid obeyed his orders and he continuedwhy did not you go to bed childit did not become me to leave youhow so i hope i know my duty betteryour dutyyes siryou seem to be an extraordinary boy you act with great spirit and talk with more good sense than i should expect from your poverty and educationso i ought to do sir though i am desolate i have been brought up better than most poor boysay indeed the apothecary entered and after having paid all necessary attention to his patient informed him of the state in which he had found me talked of my wounds and bruises and the cruelty of the man that could inflict them repeated several of the anecdotes of his tyranny which i had told him and concluded with remarks on my good fortune in having found so kind a protector the boy has saved my life said my grandfather and he shall not want a friend are you quite sure of that sir answered i with emphatical anxiety never while i live replied the rector nay but are you quite quite positive do you doubt my word boythat is very wrong of you indeed child said the apothecarya thought suddenly struck me if he would but take an oath said i to myself the oath the oath that was what i dreaded an opposite oath seemed to be my only safeguard i continuedi swear sir while i have life never to forsake you but to be dutiful and true to youswear boyyes sir most solemnlyi spoke with great fervoryou are an unaccountable boyoh that you would never forsake mei tell you i will notoh that you never wouldwont you believe meoh that you never never wouldthe boy i believe wants me to swear tooay do sir take an oath not to disown me and indeed indeed ill die willingly to deserve your favourdisown younay sir but take an oath you say i saved your life i would lay down my own again and again to save it do not deny me do not turn me to starve or send me back to be murdered by my barbarous masteri tell you i will notnay butwell then i swear boy i will notdo you indeed duly and truly swearsolemnly boy i take heaven to witness that if you are not guilty of something very wicked while i live i will provide for youi fell on my knees caught hold of his hand burst into tears and exclaimed with sobsgod in heaven bless my dear dear good grandfather he has forgiven me he has forgiven me grandfather i am hugh trevor never did i behold so sudden a change in the human countenance the rectors eyes glared at me there was something ghastly in the sunken form of his features my shirt was still red and my coat spotted with blood the hair had been cut away from the wound on my head which was covered with a large plaister my eye was black and swelled up and my forehead too was plaistered above the eyebrow my body he had been told was covered with bruises tears bathed my cheeks and my face was agitated with something like convulsive emotions this strange figure was suddenly changed into his grandson it was an apparition he knew not how to endure to be claimed by such a wretched creature to have been himself the author of his wretchedness to have had an oath extorted from him in direct violation of an opposite oath to feel this universal shock to his pride and his prejudices was a complication of jarring sensations that confounded him to resist was an effort beyond his strength for a moment he lost his voice at last he exclaimed with a hoarse screamtake him awaymy heart sunk within me the apothecary stood petrified with astonishment the rector again repeated with increasing agonytake him away begone never let me see him more the pang i felt was unutterable i rose with a feeling of despair that was annihilating and was going broken hearted out of the room at that instant the figure of my master started to recollection and with such terror as to subdue every other fear i turned back fell on my knees again and clasping my hands cried out for god almightys sake do not send me back to my master i shall never escape with life he will murder me he will murder me ill be your servant as long as i live i will go of your errands take care of your horses drive your plough weed your garden do any thing you bid me indeed indeed i willdo not send me back to be murdered the excess of my feelings had something of a calming effect on those of the rector he repeated go go boy go i feel myself very ill the apothecary recovered his tongue and added ay my good child you had better go the altered voice of the rector removed a part of the load that oppressed me and i left the room though with no little sensation of despondency in about half an hour the apothecary came down he had had a conversation with the rector who i found could not endure the sight of me again under my present forlorn or rather accusing form the remembrance however that i had saved his life was predominant how his casuistry settled the account between his two oaths i never heard on that subject he was eternally silent he was probably ashamed of having taken the first and of having been tricked out of the second his orders were that i should go home with the apothecary with whom he had arranged matters should be new clothed wait till my wounds were healed and then if he possibly could he would prevail upon himself to see me chapter x hopes in behalf of my mother the arrival of the rector i gain his favour am adopted by him and effect a family reconciliation anecdotes of a schoolfellow and his sister grammatical and musical studies causes of discontent between the squire and the rector tythes and law produce quarrels the tragicomic tale of the rats six weeks had elapsed before my wounds bruises and black marks had totally disappeared and the scar above my eye still retained a red appearance the alteration of my person however aided as it was by dress was so remarkable as to excite surprise among my village friends the apothecary prided himself upon the change persuading himself that the rector would thank him for the present of so fine a grandson his art and care had wrought miracles i was quite another creature the alteration was so prodigious since he had taken me that he was sure there was not so fine a boy in all england in the mean time i had written to my mother whose cottage was about ten miles across the country from the village where the apothecary lived he would not permit me to go to her it might offend the rector but he agreed that if she should by chance come to me there could be no harm in my speaking to my mother he too understood casuistry she accordingly came to see me and was overjoyed at what had happened it might lead to a general reconciliation especially now that my brother and sister were both dead they had been carried off by the smallpox and she rightly enough conjectured that the rector would not be the less prone to pardon her for being clear of further incumbrance she enjoined me to intercede in her behalf and i very sincerely promised to speak as soon as i dared the day at last came on which the rector was to pay his visit and examine how far i was fit to be his grandson my terror by this time had considerably abated he having taken thus much notice of me i scarcely could believe myself in danger of being rejected i was not however without trepidation and when the well known post chariot drove up to the door my heart sunk within me the apothecary had two sons one a year older and the other some months younger that i was the eldest was deformed and his brother squinted abominably curiosity had brought them and the whole family into the parlour to be spectators of the interview my grandfather entered i was dressed as genteelly as every effort of the village taylor could contrive an appearance so different from that of the beaten bruised and wounded poor elf he first had seen with clouted shoes torn stockings and coarse coating dripping with water and clotted with blood was so great as scarcely to be credible the ugliness of my companions did but enhance the superiority of my look he could not be mistaken in which was his grandson and the pleasure my preeminence inspired excited a smile of no little approbation for my part i had conceived an affection for him first i had saved his life then he had relieved me from distress and now was come to own me as his grandson the change of my present situation from that in which i had endured so much misery gave me ineffable pleasure the entrance of the rector who had been the cause of this change and the smile with which he regarded me went to my heart i kneeled my eyes flowing in tears and begged his blessing he gave it bade me rise and thus made me one of the happiest creatures existing the rector stayed some time to settle accounts with the apothecary after which the postillion was called leave was taken and i found myself seated beside my grandfather in that fortunate post chariot from which i had so happily extricated him how extreme are the vicissitudes of life what a reverse of fortune was here from hard fare severe labour and a brutal tyrant to plenty ease and smiling felicity no longer chained in poverty and ignorance i now had free access to the precious mines of knowledge far from being restrained i had every encouragement to pursue inquiry and the happiness of the change was at first so great as almost to be incredible but the youthful mind easily acquires new habits and my character varied with the accidents by which it was influenced yet to use my fathers language the casehardening i had received tempered my future life and prepared me to endure those misfortunes with fortitude which might otherwise have broken my spirit from the day that i arrived at the rectory i increased so fast in my grandfathers favour that he scarcely knew how to deny me a request i was soon bold enough to petition for my mother and though the pill at first was bitter my repeated importunities at length prevailed and the rector agreed that when his daughter should have sufficiently humbled herself in terms suited to his dignity and her degradation she should be permitted to kneel at his footstool for pardon instead of perishing like an outcast as she deserved it was not to be expected that my mother should object to the conditions the alternative was very simple submit or starve beside she had been too much accustomed to the display of the collective authority accumulated in the person of the rector to think of contest his government was patriarchal and his powers plenipotentiary he was the head of his family the priest of the parish the justice of peace for the hundred and the greatest man of miles around he had no rival except the beforementioned squire mowbray whom if divines can hate i certainly think he hated of the claims of my late master over me as his apprentice i never heard more perhaps there was no indenture for i do not recollect to have signed one but if there were he certainly was too conscious of his guilt to dare to enforce his right now that he found me acknowledged and protected by a man so powerful as my grandfather it is possible indeed that he should never have heard what became of me though i consider that as very improbable while i was at oxford i was informed that he died raving with a fever in the brain i have mentioned the encouragement i received to pursue inquiry one of the first things the rector thought of was my education now that he had owned i was indeed his grandson it was fitting that his grandson should be a gentleman in the parish committed to his pastoral guidance was a grammar school that had been endowed not indeed by squire mowbray or his ancestors but by the family that in times of yore had held the same estate the pious founder had vested the government not entirely in his own family and its representatives but in that family and the rector for the time being this circumstance and many others of a parochial nature conduced to a kind of partition of power well calculated to excite contempt in the wealthy squire who was likewise lord of the manor and inflame jealousy in heavens holy vicegerent whose very office on earth is to govern and to detect reprove and rectify the wanderings of us silly sheep to this school i was immediately sent and here among other competitors was the squires eldest son hector mowbray he was two years older than i and in the high exercise of that power to which he was the redoubted heir to insult the boys seize their marbles split their tops cuff them if they muttered kick them if they complained to the master get them flogged if they kicked and cuffed in return and tyrannize over them to the very stretch of his invention were practices in which he daily made himself more and more expert he was the young squire and that was a receipt in full for all demands i soon came to understand that he was the son of a great man a very great man indeed and that there was a prodigious difference between flesh and blood of a squires propagating and that of ordinary breed but i heard it so often repeated and saw it proved in such a variety of instances that i too was the grandson of a great man ay so great as openly to declare war against or at least bid defiance to the giant power of magog mowbray it was an epithet of my grandfathers giving i say i was so fully convinced that i myself was the son of somebody pshaw i mean the grandson that no sooner did young hector begin to exercise his ingenuity upon me than i found myself exceedingly disposed to rebel i had been bred in a hardy school at my first admission into this seminary i did not immediately and fully enter into the spirit and practice of the place though i soon became tolerably active at robbing orchards tying up latches lifting gates breaking down hedges and driving cattle astray i was by no means so great a proficient as hector nor had i any great affection for swimming hedgehogs hunting cats or setting dogs at boys and beggars but at climbing trees running leaping swimming and such like exercises i was among the most alert my courage too was soon put to the proof and my opponents found that i entered on action with very tolerable alacrity so that not to mention sparrings and skirmishes from which having begun i was never the first to flinch i had not been a year at school before i had been declared the conqueror in three set battles the third was with a butchers boy in defence of hector who for once instead of giving had suffered insult but who though older and stronger than i was had not the courage to attack his hardy antagonist my victory was dearly earned for the boy was considerably my superior in age and strength and bred to the sport but this defence of him and the fear of having me for a foe induced hector to court my favour and often to invite me to mowbray hall nor did the whole of my fame end here the first day i entered the school i was allowed to be the best english scholar excepting one turl a youth noted for his talents and who while he remained there continually kept his place in every class as head boy but this was no triumph over me for beside having been so long at school he had three or four years the advantage of me in point of age neither did my thirst of inquiry abate and i had now not only books but instructors on the contrary my eagerness increased and my progress both in latin and greek was rapid the rector was astonished at it and was often embarrassed by the questions which my desire of learning impelled me to put among my other acquirements i became a practical musician the rector could strum the bass tolerably and his friend the lawyer could play the violin in which however he was excelled by the clerk of the parish i retained some remembrance of what i had formerly studied and felt a great desire to learn the rector encouraged it and as the clerk is always the very humble servant and slave of the parson he was inducted my music master i loved the art so that in less than twelve months i had made a sufficient progress to join in corellis and even handels trios and thus to strengthen the parsonagehouse band people who hate each other do yet visit and keep up an intercourse according to set forms purposely to conceal their hatred it being a hideous and degrading vice of which all men are more or less either ashamed or afraid to preserve these appearances or perhaps from the impulse of vanity the rector admitted of my excursions to mowbray hall for my own part i found a motive more alluring than the society of hector that frequently occasioned me to repeat these visits his sister olivia two years younger than myself was usually one of our parlour playmates born of the same mother living in the same family accustomed to the same manners it is difficult to account for the very opposite propensities of this brother and sister every thing the reverse of what has been recited of hector was visible in olivia he was boisterous selfish and brutal she was compassionate generous and gentle his faculties were sluggish obtuse and confined hers were acute discriminating and capacious his want of feeling made him delight to inflict torture her extreme sensibility made her fly to administer relief the company of olivia soon became very attractive and the rambles that i have sometimes taken with her hand in hand over mowbray park afforded no common delight she too was a musician and already famous for her fine voice and execution on the harpsichord i accompanied her on the violin and sang duets with her so as to surprize and even charm the squire and throw the visitors at mowbray hall into raptures this sweet intercourse however was terminated by the bickerings backbitings and smothered jealousies between the squire and my grandfather which at length burst into a flame the squire had succeeded to his estate and manor by the death of a very distant relation and by this relation the rector had been presented to his living he therefore considered himself as under no kind of obligation to the squire while the latter on the contrary the advowson being parcel and part of the manor held the manor and himself as owner of the manor to be the actual donor to all this was added another very serious cause of discontent that of tythes a cause that disturbs half the villages in the kingdom and that frequently exhibits the man who is sent to preach peace and afford an example of mild forbearance and christian humility as a litigious quarrelsome and odious tyrant much better qualified to herd with wolves than to be the shepherd of his meek master it is sufficiently certain that neither christ nor his apostles ever took tythes and the esquires farmers and landholders of this christian kingdom would in general be better satisfied if their successors were to follow so disinterested and laudable an example my grandfather had accepted his rectory at the same commutation that the former incumbent had enjoyed it and while the patron to whom he owed the presentation was living he contented himself with his bargain as well as he could but soon after the accession of squire mowbray considering that tie as no longer a clog to his conscience he began to inquire very seriously into the real value of his first fruits and tythes personal predial and mixed that is his great tythes and his small the calculation inflamed his avarice and he purchased and read all the books on the subject of tythes he could collect being fond of power and having discovered as he supposed that the man who knows the most quirks in law has the greatest quantity of power over his simple and ignorant neighbours he was a tolerably laborious and successful student of these quirks i say tolerably for it seldom happens that the rector is the most industrious person in the parish it was thus that after having made the whole hundred tremble at his authority in the exercise of his office of justice of the peace he next hoped to conquer the behemoth magog mowbray himself his own fears of being vanquished and the advice of his friends had indeed for years prevented him from proceeding to an open rupture with his parish and the squire at its head but his irritability had been gradually increasing ever since the departure of my uncle elford the progress of his avarice at first was slow but it gained strength as it proceeded and there was now no one whose opinion had sufficient weight with him to keep it longer quiet his friend the lawyer it is true might have had some such influence over him but the lawyer had been duly articled to the most famous that is the most litigious attorney in the country and was himself his very famous successor a practitioner of the first repute the squire by a trick he thought proper to play contributed not a little to kindle the smothering embers my grandfather having announced his intention of demanding a commutation of nearly double the sum or of being paid his tythes in kindfirst his tythes de jure and next his tythes by custom enumerating them all and each corn hay hops and hemp fruits roots seeds and weeds wool milk chickens ducklings and goslings or eggs corn rakings and pond drawings not forgetting agistment and subbois or sylva caedua with many many more of the sweets of our prolific mother earth which i would enumerate if i did but recollect them and for which men so often have been and still are impleaded in court christianthese particulars i say being recapitulated and set forth in terrible array by the rector excited in the whole parish so much dread of the rapacious vulture who was coming with such a swoop upon them that high and low young and old rich and poor all began to tremble the squire was the only man at first who durst bid defiance to the general ravager the rectors deviation from his original commutation agreement threw him into a rage and he panted for an opportunity of shewing the contempt in which he held my grandfather and his threats malicious chance favoured his wishes it happened while his passions were in full force that a ratcatcher arrived at mowbray hall which at that time was greatly infested by the large norway rats the man had the art of taking them alive and was accordingly employed by the squire while he was preparing to perform his business the gentle olivia very innocently and without any foresight of consequences chanced to sayi do not think papa that our good rector who considers all things as tytheable would be much pleased to have his tythe of ratsthe squire no sooner heard this sentence uttered than he began to dance and halloo like a madman swearing most vociferouslyby g wench he shall ha um he shall ha um he shall ha um his boisterous joy at this rare thought which was indeed far beyond the discovery of his own brain could not be appeased nor could olivia sorry for what she had done prevent him from most resolutely determining to put it in practice the ratcatcher was immediately ordered to entrap as many of his best friends as he possibly could and a carpenter was set to work to make a covered box for the rectors tytherats with a lifting door hector mowbray was consulted on the whole progress and the fancies of father and son were tickled to excess by the happy prank they were about to play the rats were caught the box was made and the ratcatcher commanded to select the finest fattest and largest of them and enclose them in their cage in order to heighten and secure their enjoyment the squire and hector chose four of the stoutest servants gave the cage into their custody and ordered the ratcatcher to attend away they then went in turbulent procession they even wanted olivia to go with them to see the sport and young hector probably with malice prepense against me when she refused was for using force but she was a favourite with the squire and being very determined was suffered to remain at home arrived at the parsonagehouse they entered the hall the squire loudly called for the rector the noise and vociferation of their approach had rouzed his attention and he was not long in coming the servants too were collected some without the door and others of more authority within it to hear and see what all this could mean i likewise was one of the companyhere here mr rector bawled the squire we ha brought you your due ill warrant for once you shant grumble that we do not pay you your tythes my grandfather hearing this address seeing the covered cage and remarking the malicious grins of the squire and his whole posse knew not what to think and began to suspect there was mischief in the windby the waunds mister tythe taker continued the squire but you shall ha your own here lads lift up the cage put it on the table let his reverence see what we ha broughtn come raise the door the men with each a broad grin upon his countenance did as they were bidden they lifted up the box raised the door and out burst above twenty of the largest wildest rats the well stocked barns of mowbray hall could afford their numbers their squealing their ferocity their attempts to escape and the bounds they gave from side to side struck the whole parsonage house community with a panic the women screamed the rector foamed the squire hallooed and the men seized bellows poker tongs and every other weapon or missile that was at hand the uproar was universal and the squire never before or after felt himself so great a hero the death of the fox itself was unequal to it this was but the first act of the farce the catastrophe of which had something in it of a more tragical cast servants partake of the prejudices of their masters and the whole parsonagehouse young and old male and female felt itself insulted no sooner therefore were the rats discomfited than the rector summoning all his magisterial and orthodox dignity commanded the squire and his troop to depart despising the mandate magog mowbray continued his exultations and coarse sarcasms and oh frailty of human nature the man of god forgot the peaceful precepts of his divine mission and gave the signal for a general assault nay he himself so unruly are the hands and feet even of a parson in a passion was one of the most eager combatants age itself could not bind his arms the battle raged fierce and dreadful for sometime in the hall but heroism soon found it wanted elbowroom and the two armies by mutual consent sallied forth numbers were in our favour for the very maids armed with mophandles broomsticks and rolling pins acted like amazons i was far from idle for i had singled out my foe hector whose courage example had enflamed to a very unruly height had even dared to begin the attack and i was no less alert in opposition but though he was hector i as it happened was achilles and bestowed my wrath upon him most unsparingly in fine valour victory and right were for once united and we very fairly put the squire his heir his ratcatcher and his beefeaters to flight the rector dreading a second attack from the enemy began to fortify his castle provide ammunition and arrange his troops i acted as his aidedecamp burning to be myself commander in chief but the caution was superfluous the squire like his son was rather revengeful than valorous and returned no more to the field in the parish however the fortune of the day might be said to wear a very different face for there was not a farmer who did not triumph at the tythe in kind which had been paid to the rector and it became a general threat to sweep the parish of moles weazles stoats polecats and vermin of every species and tenant the rectory with them if any thing more was heard on the subject of tythes neither did detraction forget to remind the rector of his age and how shameful it was for a man with one foot in the grave to quarrel with and rob the poor farmers whom he was hired to guide console and love the poor farmers forgot that in the eye of the law the robbery was theirs and the rector forgot that in the eye of justice and common sense he had already more than enough the framers of the law too forgot that to hire a man to love a whole parish is but a blundering kind of a mode but such mistakes are daily made chapter xi different accounts of the battle olivia offended legal distinctions and lawsuits commenced the rumours of the village soon made it apparent that the history of the battle royal as given by the vanquished party like many other histories deviated in various particulars from the strict truth thus the squire asserted that he and his myrmidons quitted the field victoriously drums beating and colours flying after having driven the enemy back into their citadel and strong holds out of which they durst not peep and to the truth of what the squire asserted his trusty adherents made it a case of conscience to swear encouraged by so good an example hector vaunted loudly of his own high feats of arms and by his narration made it appear not only how much he had the best of the battle with me but that it was by kicking him when up kneeing him when down striking him when rising and other such like cowardly foul and malicious acts that he brought home such a quantity of bruises of which with all his valour he bitterly complained together with a pair of black eyes knowing my partiality for his sister and suspecting that olivia herself was not without her inclinations he did not fail to repeat these particulars when she was present carefully adding such other injurious accusations and epithets as might most effectually lower me in her esteem his efforts were successful olivia was offended first that her brother should be so cruelly beaten by one of whom she had conceived so kindly and next that it should be by such base and dishonourable means thus one of my chief pleasures that of visiting at mowbray hall admiring and sometimes mounting the squires hunters and straying through the gardens and grounds with the gentle olivia was cut off hector by this time had passed the age of sixteen and the wrath of the squire rose so high that he would not suffer him any longer to go to the same school with me for which reason it being a part of his plan to send his heir to the university that he might not only be a squire but a man of learning and thus become greater even than his father before him preparations and arrangements were made something sooner than had been intended and not long afterward he was entered a gentleman commoner of college oxford it has been noticed that the farmers thought more of the vexation of their case than of the law but not so the rector he thought first of the law and the law told him that the vexation of the case relative to tythes was all in his favour of the late affray with the squire indeed he had his doubts as for the entrance upon his premises though it might be pleaded it was for a lawful purpose namely that of paying tythes yet as rats were ferae naturae and therefore things not tythable it was very plain that this was a case of trespass ab initio and his action would lie for a trespass vi et armis but unfortunately passion had prevented him from waiting to bring his action and he had assumed the vi et armis to himself in the first instance not having patience to attend the slow and limping pace of the law he was not indeed quite certain that although he and his party gave the first blows an action of battery brought against mowbray might not be justified for did he not come upon him in full force he the rector being in the peace of god and our lord the king and did not he the squire by shouting and oaths and blasphemous words put him the rector in bodily fear and was not the very act of turning ferocious animals namely norway rats loose in his hall to the danger of his face eyes and throat a very indubitable and sufficient assault was it not likewise clearly in self defence that the rector and his faithful servants did molliter manus imponere on the squire and his crewthe molliter it is true appeared rather doubtful but then it was a term of law and would bear that exact signification which the circumstances of the case required and lawyers so well know how to give thus with law in his head wrath in his heart and money in his pocket away went the rector to hold consultations with his now favourite friend the attorney who has before been mentioned as so thorough bred and far famed a practitioner the result of which was that an action of trespass upon the case as the safest mode of proceeding should be brought against the squire and that public information should be given that tythes in kind would in six months be demanded from the whole parish with a formal notice that as malicious threatenings had been uttered against the rector whom the laws civil common and ecclesiastical would protect if any such threatenings should be put in execution actions against the offenders would immediately be instituted it was the spring of the year when these resolutions were taken and before the end of the following november the rector in consequence of squabbles insults and frauds had brought actions against more than half his parishioners by which the attornies counsellors and courts were in the end the only gainers while plaintiff and defendant most ardently concurred and rejoiced in the ruin of each other but so it is anger avarice and law are terrible things and malice and selfishness are indefatigable foes chapter xii progress of my studies my predilection in favour of theology the decay of the rector his testament death and funeral three additional years passed away under the auspices of my grandfather during which he pursued his lawsuits and i my studies though with very different success he lost the dearest thing on earth to him his money and i gained the dearest thing on earth to me knowledge among other superfluous appendages superfluous to him for he made but little use of it he had a good library not of his own collecting he enjoyed it by descent this was my daily resort its treasures were inexhaustible and my desire of information could not be satiated i spent many happy hours in it and it is still remembered by me with that sweet pleasure which its contents were so well calculated to impart i had another accidental advantage the usher of the school got preferment and his successor happened to be well read both in the dead and living languages this person whose name was wilmot was not only a good scholar and an amiable man but an excellent poet he had an affection for me and i almost worshipped him he was assiduous to teach me every thing he knew and fortunately i was no less apt and eager to learn having already made a tolerable proficiency in the learned languages the richness of the french in authors made me labour to acquire it with avidity the italian poets were equally inviting so that by his aid i mastered the idioms and attained the spirit of both those languages the dialects of the teutonic were likewise familiar to him and i made some progress in the german being desirous from his recommendation to read among others the works of lessing klopstock goethe and schiller the acquirement of knowledge is an essential and therefore a pure pleasure and my time though laboriously spent glided swiftly and happily away with respect to amusement the violin became my favourite my now dearest friend the usher among his other attainments was a musician my affection for him had made him intimate at the parsonagehouse and his aid greatly promoted our musical parties finding knowledge thus delightful my zeal to promulgate it was great i had as i imagined so much to communicate that i panted for an opportunity to address myself to multitudes at that time i knew no place so well calculated for this purpose as the pulpit and my inclination to be a preacher was tolerably conformable to the views of the rector not but he had his doubts few men are satisfied with their own profession and though he had great veneration for church authority which he held to be infinitely superior from its very nature to civil government yet his propensity to dabble in the law had practically and theoretically taught him some of the advantages of its professors in rank it was true that the archbishop of canterbury was the second man in the kingdom and in the rectors opinion ought to have been indisputably the first in days of yore who so potent but obsolete titles are not equal to actual possessions the lord high chancellor in this degenerate age enjoys much more political power neither does it in general die with him like that of the archbishop he seldom fails to bequeath an earldom or a barony at least to his heir on these subjects i had frequent lectures from my grandfather who perceiving the enterprise of my temper and the progress of my studies began to entertain hopes that from his loins some future noble family might descend that is provided i would follow the advice which he so well knew how to bestow in support of his argument he would give me the history of the origin of various barons viscounts and earls which he could trace to some of the lowest departments of the law thus though he was convinced that the sacerdotal character claimed unlimited authority by right divine yet from the perverse and degenerate nature of man it was most lamentably sinking into decay while that of the law was rising on its ruins had he been a man of the world instead of the rector of a village he would have heard of another profession superior to them both for the attainment of what he most coveted power rank and wealth and would have known that the lawyer only soars to the possession of these supposed blessings by learning a new trade that is by making himself a politician the effect his maxims produced on me was a conviction that divinity and law were two superexcellent things but my mind from many circumstances had acquired a moral turn and as i at that time supposed morality and religion to be the same the current of my inclinations was strong in favour of divinity whoever imagines the youthful mind cannot easily acquire such moral propensities has never observed it except when habit and example have already taught it to be perverse i speak from experience and well know how much the accounts i had read of aristides epaminondas regulus cato and innumerable other great characters among the ancients inflamed my imagination and gave me a rooted love of virtue so that even the vulgarly supposed dry precepts of seneca and epictetus were perused by me with delight and with an emulous determination to put them in practice my morality however was far from pure it was such a mixture of truth and error as was communicated to me by conversation books and the incidents of life from the glow of poetry i learnt many noble precepts but from the same source i derived the pernicious supposition that to conquer countries and exterminate men are the acts of heroes further instances would be superfluous i mean only to remark that while i was gaining numerous truths i was likewise confirming myself in various prejudices many of which it has been the labour of years aided by the lessons of accident to eradicate and many more no doubt still remain undetected and now the period approached when i was to adventure forth into that world of which i had experienced something had heard so much and with which i was so impatient to become still better acquainted the weight of age began to press upon the rector and he had an apoplectic fit at which he was very seriously alarmed he then thought it high time to put his temporal affairs into the best order that his own folly would admit for in consequence of his lawsuits they were so much in the hands and power of his friend the lawyer that notwithstanding the plausibility and professions of the latter he trembled when he came to reflect how much they were involved his former parsimony had led him to hope he should leave great wealth behind him but when he came to consult his friend concerning his will he had the mortification to find how much it had been diminished by his litigious avarice the will however was made but it was under this friends direction and influence the lawyer was a lawyer and affecting the character of disinterestedness reminded the rector of the folly of youth and in how short a period money that had taken a life to acquire was frequently squandered by a thoughtless heir his advice therefore was that the property should be left to my mother and that she should have a joint executor this executor ought to be the most honest of men and the dearest of friends or he would never perform so very arduous and unprofitable a task with fidelity and effect a task as thankless as it is laborious and which nothing should prevail on him to undertake but the desire to serve some very dear and much esteemed friend with respect to my mother and me i was her darling and there was no danger that she should marry again at least infinitely less than that a young man should abuse wealth of which he had not by experience learned the value by making me dependent my assiduity would be increased but that all might be safe it might perhaps be well to set apart a sum for my maintenance at the university and if i should decide for the church when i quitted it another for the purchase of an advowson or if for the law to place me in the office of some eminent practitioner this counsel was so much that of a man of foresight and knowledge of the world that my grandfather heard it with pleasure it was literally followed one hundred per annum for four years residence at the university was allotted me and a legacy of a thousand pounds was added which though the purchase of an advowson was recommended was entrusted to my discretion and when i should come of age left to my own disposal the will was then copied and signed and the lawyer at the request of a dear and dying friend was prevailed on to be joint executor with my mother this was the last legal act and deed of the rector for he died within a month and with him died his few friendships his many enmities and his destructive lawsuits his spiritual flock was right glad that he was gone and his funeral was only attended by my mother myself the lawyer the master and usher of the grammar school and a few visiting friends when the will was opened i and my mother were necessarily present the rector had detailed the arguments which his friend had suggested he mentioned his fears of youthful folly but spoke of me with affection and hope and seriously warned my mother for my sake to beware of a second marriage with which requisition she very solemnly affirmed it was her determination to comply i was young and high in expectation for hugh the second was scarcely less sanguine of temper than hugh the first few people in the world i was persuaded were possessed of such extraordinary abilities as myself i had read in a thousand places of the high rewards bestowed on men of learning wit and genius i was therefore eager to sally forth convinced that i need only be seen to be admired and known to be employed these ideas were so familiar to my mind that i intreated my mother to lay no restraint upon her inclinations for i well knew how to provide for myself but she was wounded by the request and begged i would not kill her by a supposition so cutting so unaffectionate and so unamiable the energy with which she expressed herself somewhat surprized me a kind of good humoured chearfulness which resembled indifference rather than sentiment was the leading feature in my mothers character she was however on this occasion more sentimental because as i supposed more in earnest than usual chapter xiii preparations for parting a journey more of education or something to be learned in a stage coach these solemn affairs being adjusted and by the lapse of a few weeks we the mourners more reconciled to our loss it began to be necessary for me to prepare for my removal to the university for it was there only according to the wise laws of our wise forefathers and who will dare to suppose that our forefathers were foolish or could make foolish laws that a regular and incontestible induction can be obtained to the holy ministry of which i was ambitious it was determined i should enter of college oxford the same at which hector mowbray had been admitted and to which all the scholars from the grammar school where i was educated repaired but there was a warm contest whether i should enter as a commoner or a gentleman commoner my mother was eager for the latter which the lawyer opposed she could not endure that her dear hugh should as it were publicly confess the superiority of his rival and sworn foe the insolent hector he contended that to affect to rival him in expence were absurd and might lead to destructive consequences the lawyer had the best of the argument yet i was inclined to take part with my mother inferiority was what i was little disposed to acknowledge i therefore consulted my friend the usher fortunately he had more wisdom and alledged some very convincing moral motives which i too much respected to disobey previous to my departure i endured much lecturing which i considered as exceedingly useless and consequently little less than impertinent the lawyer reminded me of my youth and warned me against the knavery of mankind who he affirmed are universally prone to prey upon one another this miracles out of the question must be the creed of a lawyer i had a better opinion of my fellow bipeds of whom i yet knew but little and heard him with something like contempt my mother wearied me with intreaties to write to her at least once a week she should never be easy out of my sight if she did not hear from me frequently the omission of a mail would throw her into the utmost terrors she should conclude i was sick or dying nay perhaps dead and she conjured me to respect her maternal feelings i did respect them and promised all she required she was desirous too that i should continually be with her during the vacations the lawyer on the contrary advised me to remain at college and pursue my studies it will seem very unnatural to most mothers and highly censurable to many moralists that the person whom i felt the greatest regret at parting with was my instructor and friend the usher he was no less affectionate he too cautioned me against youthful confidence and hinted that men were not quite so good as they should be i knew him to be a little inclined to melancholy and that he considered himself as a neglected man who had reason to complain of the worlds injustice but though the belief that this was true moved my compassion he did not convince me that men were constitutionally inclined to evil my own feelings loudly spoke the contrary i had not yet been initiated i knew but little of those false wants by which the mind of man is perverted the credulity of youth can only be cured by the experience of age the prejudices of age can only be eradicated by appealing to the feelings and facts of youth man becomes what the mistaken institutions of society inevitably make him his tendency is to promote his own well being and the well being of the creatures around him these can only be promoted by virtue consequently when he is vicious it is from mistake and his original sin is ignorance my books clothes and effects were forwarded to the next market town through which the coach that i was to travel in passed that i might meet it in time on monday morning it was necessary to set out the evening before and sleep at the inn my mind was by no means free from popular prejudices when they were of a moral cast and i was not entirely satisfied at beginning my journey on a sunday i struggled against the nonsense of ill omens for i had read books in which they were ridiculed but i was not quite certain that the action was in itself right things however were thus arranged and my friends were assembled to take leave of me the lawyers reiterated advice teased me my mothers tears gave me pain but the pressure of the ushers hand and his cordial god be with you went to my heart however the sun shone the month was may the grass was green the birds were singing my hopes were mantling and my cares were soon forgotten i seemed to look back on my past existence as on a kind of imprisonment and my spirits fluttered as if just set free to wander through a world of unknown delights fortune was disposed to favour the delusive vision for at the inn on the morrow being roused from a sound sleep to pursue my journey after stepping into the coach i found myself seated opposite to the handsomest sweetest young lady i had ever beheld i except olivia but her i had only known as it were a child and i looked back on those as on childish days the lovely creature was clothed in a skyblue ridinghabit with embroidered buttonholes and a green hat and feather with suitable decorations she had a delicate twisted canewhip in her hand a nosegay in her bosom and a purple cestus round her waist there were beside two gentlemen in the coach genteelly dressed and they all appeared to know each other the young lady spoke to every body without the least reserve or pride which did but increase the good opinion i had conceived of her the gentlemen likewise were easy and familiar and in spite of my friend the lawyer i already plainly perceived the world was a very good humoured polite and pleasant world the young lady was peculiarly attentive and kind to me and i being but a raw traveller insisted that the gentleman next her should change places with me that i might sit with my face toward the horses lest i should be sick by riding backward at this however my manly pride revolted and i obstinately kept my seat notwithstanding her very obliging intreaties the phrase raw traveller i did not think quite so politely and happily chosen as the rest but then it fell from such a pair of modest lips that it was impossible to conceive offence after a pleasant ride of three hours we arrived at the breakfasting place the coach door was opened and i not waiting for the steps leaped out like a young greyhound the lady seemed half inclined to follow me but was timid i placed myself properly promised to catch her and she sprang into my arms suddenly recollecting herself she exclaimedwhat a wild creature i am and ran away hiding her face with her hands i blamed myself for having been too forward and inwardly applauded her quick sense of propriety the gentlemen laughed walked into the breakfastingroom and invited me to follow them in about ten minutes the young lady entered with apologies and hoping we knew the rules of travelling too well to wait she seemed improved in beauty there was a kind of bloom spread over her countenance contrasted with a delicate pearl white such as i had never seen in the finest cherry cheeks of our village maidens it is the blush at the little incident of leaping from the coach said i to myself that has thus improved her complexion she sat down to the table and with the kindness that seemed native to her poured out my tea sugared and creamed it just to my taste and handed it to me with sweetness that was quite seducing i knew not how to return or to merit her favours and the attempt made me mawkishly sentimental it is delightful said i when amiable people live together in happy society it is indeed said she and her bosom appeared gently to heave our feelings seemed to vibrate in unison but they were disturbed by a sudden burst of coughing of one of the gentlemen drinking his tea and were not much harmonized by a fit of laughing with which the other was seized who told his companion he was a droll dog but what the drollery could be of a man choaked with swallowing too hastily was more than i could comprehend the appellation of droll dog however was repeated till the two gentlemen could appease their titillation i own i thought it a little rude but they seemed neither of them so wellbred as the lady and i concluded they could be nothing more than travelling acquaintance i even supposed i saw them wink at each other as if there had been something strange or improper in my behaviour i then thought it quite necessary to let them know who i was accordingly i took an opportunity of succintly telling them whence i came where i was going who my relations were and what my expectations i let them understand that i had money in my purse and gave broad hints that i was neither fool nor coward they were quite civil but still their looks to each other seemed very significant and to have more meaning than i knew how to develope i was a little piqued but comforted myself with the assurance that i should show them their mistake if they conjectured any thing to my disadvantage breakfast over we returned to the coach and after handing the young lady i stepped in as lightly as i had stepped out she again insisted i should not ride backward and i for my former reason refused to change my place till one of those abrupt gentlemen exclaimedwhat my young buck are you afraid of a petticoat oh fie said the young lady rouzed by this insulting supposition and despising every kind of cowardice i immediately crossed over and took my seat by her side men fellows are very rude horsegodmother kind of creatures said the young ladythe colour flushed in my facemen fellows horsegodmother it was strange i was more than half afraid she meant menot all of them i hope said i as soon as i could recollect myselfno not all of them answered the young lady with a gentle smile and a glance that i thought had meaning my flow of spirits being somewhat checked by the behaviour of the gentlemen i sat silent and they fell into conversation by which i learned that one of them was a gentleman of great fortune in wales and the other a captain in the army and that they were well acquainted with london dublin bath brighthelmstone and all places of fashionable resort the young lady too had not only been at each of them but had visited paris and mentioned many persons of quality with whom as it appeared from her discourse she was quite familiar it was evident from all she said that she knew how to distinguish the well bred and the polite she was immensely shocked at any thing that was ungenteel and low it was prodigiously horrid the whole discourse indeed convinced me that they were all people of consequence and that my supposition of ill breeding on the part of the gentlemen must have been hasty one thing however surprised me and particularly drew my attention i valued myself on my knowledge of languages and the quickness of my ear yet though they continually spoke english they introduced occasional words and phrases which to me were wholly unintelligible one especially of these phrases seemed so strange that i repeated it to myself again and again it wasthe kinchin will bite the bubblei pondered and fifty times questionedwho is the kinchin what is bite the bubble i but in vain it was incomprehensible we did not stop to dine till between four and five oclock and then the young lady at alighting was more circumspect she having retired the gentlemen asked me if i would take a turn to the river side at the back of the inn and i to shew that i now understood their characters better willingly complied as i was following them the landlord who had attended while we were alighting plucked me by the skirt and looking significantly after my companions whisperedtake care of yourself young gentleman then hastily brushed by the first moment i thought it strange the second i exclaimed to myselfah ha i guessed how it was i soon found them out but if they have any tricks to play they shall find i am as cunning as they the landlord need not have cautioned me i am not so easily caught thus fortified i proceeded boldly and we had not walked two hundred yards before one of them who had stepped forward stooped and picked up a piece of paper which he instantly began to read sdeath exclaimed he as we approached here is a bill at three days sight for fifteen guineas drawn on fairlamb and company bankers at oxford you are acquainted with country bills captain said he presenting it to his companion do you think it a good one his companion took it examined it upside and down to the light and from it and repliedas good as the bank but we must share to be sure we must said the finder why should you doubt it tis a trifle five guineas a piece but it will serve to pay travelling expences they laughed and i was staggered at this honourable and generous conduct i have proceeded too hastily thought i and the landlord is own cousin to our lawyer he thinks every man a rogue their liberality is proof sufficient in their favourcome give us our five guineas a piece said the gentleman of wales to the captaini have no ready cash answered he i never chuse when i am travelling to have more money in my pocket than barely enough for expencesthat is exactly my case replied the welsh gentleman but perhaps our young friend may be less cautious and may have loose cash sufficienti had twelve guineas said i when i left homeoh that will just do answered the captain we turn off tomorrow morning for cirencester you are going to oxford otherwise our luck would have been lost upon us for we would not have gone a mile out of our road for such a trifle my hand was in my pocket and the guineas were between my fingers when my heart smote me the landlords significant take care of yourself young gentleman my own sagacious conjectures when he gave me this warning and their strange phrase of bite the bubble all rose to my recollection they shall not make a tool and a jest of me said i to myself the gentleman of wales seeing me hesitate jogged me by the elbow and saidcome come we must dispatch dinner is on the table by this time and the coach will not wait a minutethose who think me a fool replied i with something of indignation in my countenance will find themselves deceivedwhat do you mean by that sir retorted the captainstrange language for a gentleman i stopped a moment my conscience smote me if i should mistake the character of these gentlemen thought i my behaviour will appear contemptibledo you mean to insult us said the gentleman of walesthe captain once more saw my hand in my pocket i caught his eye he winked to his companion and said no no the young gentleman knows betteryes answered i instantly fired i know better than to give my money to sharperssharpers retorted onesharpers reechoed the other and began mutually to hustle memy valour was roused i faced about with the first blow laid the gentleman of wales sprawling and with the second made the captains eyes strike fire the attack was infinitely more vigorous and powerful than they could have expected the welsh gentleman shook his ears the captain clapped his white handkerchief to his eyes they swore a few oaths in concert but neither of them seemed desirous to continue the combat such an attack from a stripling was quite out of all calculation if however i could guess their motives from their manner they were rather those of caution than of cowardice be that as it will i could better deal out hard blows than utter coarse expressions and i left them with a look of contempt entering the dinner room i found the young lady and told her the story she was all astonishment could not believe her ears was never so deceived in her life was immensely glad that she now knew her company she had seen them at bath and had imagined them to be as they professed themselves gentlemen but people do not know who and who are together at such public places she was sorry to ride in the same carriage with them but dine with them she would not i asked if i might be permitted that honour and she readily replied certainly sir you are a gentleman proud to be thus distinguished after dinner i insisted on paying the bill and she still more strenuously insisted i should not she pulled out her purse which seemed well filled and put down her quota which no entreaties could prevail on her to take back it was her rule the horses being ready we were summoned to our seats which we took in pairs the gentleman of wales and the captain sitting in sullen silence and the young lady not deigning to address a word to them at night we again paired off and i was admitted to be her companion at supper she continuing to treat me since their detection with a marked partiality supper being over and the lady unfortunately as she said for her being to travel the cirencester road with those odious sharpers i was again exceedingly desirous to shew some trifling mark of respect by discharging the bill which she again peremptorily refused to accept unluckily however going to draw her purse as before she could not find itit was exceedingly strangeinfinitely distressing what could have become of it thirty guineas were but a trifle but to lose them at such a moment was very tormentingshe felt again and having no better success her features assumed a very dismal and tragical cast none but a heart of stone could endure unmoved the anxiety and distress of so kind so amiable and so lovely a creature i took my eleven guineas my whole store except a few shillings told her it was all i had but intreated she would not put me to the pain of refusing the little supply i had to afford she thanked me infinitely recollected she had left her purse when she retired after dinner to comb up her dishevelled hair having taken it out with the comb and totally forgotten it repeated that she was proceeding to london for which a single guinea would perhaps be sufficient but unfortunately she was obliged to pass through cirencester having a poor relation there that was sick and in absolute want and to whom she had promised an immediate relief of ten guineas with an intention of further support however she could not think of accepting my offer it had so strange an appearance and she would rather suffer any thing than forfeit the good opinion of a gentleman especially after having conversed with those good for nothing men as if acquainted with them but of whom she knew nothing and had therefore supposed no harm the debate was long and managed on both sides with almost equal ardour at length however i prevailed on her to take ten of the eleven guineas but not till she had given me a draft on her banker signed harriet palmer which she assured me would be honoured the instant it should be presented i took it to satisfy her scruples but i had read the old romances and too well understood the gallantry due from a gentleman to a lady to think of putting it to the use she intended i lingered and knew not how to take leave but the coach would only allow her three hours repose i therefore reluctantly bade her good night and we parted with mutual admiration hoping for some fortunate opportunity of renewing our acquaintance chapter xiv morning thoughts conjectures and expectations a specimen of oxford manners being another new lesson left by myself on the morrow and revolving in my mind the events of the preceding day i had occasional doubts which had i suffered them to prevail would have been exceedingly mortifying the young lady was certainly a beautiful lady was modest too and well bred i had seen nothing to impeach her virtue on the contrary it had been the principal topic of our discourse tis true i had as became me been too respectful to put her chastity to any proof i was not so discourteous a knight but then that she should have been so intimate as she appeared to be with those gentlemen sharpers that she should be going the same road that she should lose her purse in so odd a manner and that she should accept my ten guineas were circumstances that dwelt irksomely upon my mind yet it was totally improbable that so sweet a young creature should be trammeled in vice what be the companion of such men relate a string of falsehoods give a forged draft on a banker and even shed tears at distress which if it were not real was a most base and odious artifice that she could act so cunning and so vile a part and i not detect her was wholly incredible i was very unwilling to imagine i could be so imposed upon so duped a raw traveller if so raw indeed of all suppositions that was the most humiliating i endeavoured but in vain to banish suspicion in fine whatever might be the cause which i could not very well develope i found the soliloquies of the morning by no means so fascinating as the visions of the preceding evening wearied of this subject i turned my thoughts into a new channel and endeavoured to conjecture what oxford was and what kind of people were its inhabitants i had heard it described and remembered the leading features its expansive streets aspiring turrets noble buildings and delightful walks the picture rose to magnificence but the wisdom learning and virtue of its sages and their pupils were still more sublime high minded and noble youths thirsting after knowledge assembled under the auspices of philosophers whose science was profound and whose morals were pure the whole fabric rising in beautiful order undergraduates bachelors masters doctors professors presidents heads of colleges high stewards and chancellors each excelling the other in worth as in dignity their manners engaging their actions unblemished and their lives spent in the delightful regions of learning and truth it must be the city of angels and i was hastening to reside among the blest a band of seers living in fraternity governed by one universal spirit of benevolence harmonized by one vibrating system of goodness celestial among such beings evil and foolish men could find no admittance for they could find no society theology too would here be seen in all her splendour active energetic and consolatory not disturbed by doubt not disgraced by acrimony not slumbering in sloth not bloated with pride not dogmatical not intolerant not rancorous not persecuting not inquisitorial but diffusing her mild yet clear and penetrating beams through the soul where all could not but be light and life and loveoh oxford said i thou art the seat of the muses thou art the nurse of wisdom thou art the mother of virtuei own my expectations were high my reveries concerning my old companion hector were in the same tone i had heard that he had often been down at mowbray hall during vacation time but the mutual interdiction of our families had prevented our meeting he cannot but be greatly altered said i it is impossible he should have remained so long in this noble seminary and continue the same selfish sensual and halfbrutal hector mowbray whom formerly i knew i regretted our quarrel he might now have become an agreeable companion perhaps a friend olivia tooshe had a sisters partiality for him before she might now love him infinitely and justly while i sat ruminating the coach continued rolling onward over hill and dale passing house hedge row and heath till the towers and turrets of oxford came in view my heart bounded at the sight and active fancy industriously continued her fictions we entered the city and drove clattering along to one of the principal inns the moment the coachman pulled up i stepped out of the carriage and into the street it was the eve of a new term the gownsmen were swarming carriages and horsemen post haste were arriving the bells were ringing waiters and footmen were hurrying to and fro and all was dazzle all was life eager to mingle in the scene i walked up and down the high street saw college after college hall after hall and church after church the arches the pillars the quadrangles rose in incessant and astonishing succession my eyes turned from building to building gazing with avidity adding wonder to wonder and filling the mind with rapture it is all that i had imagined said i and much much more happy city happy people and happy i that am come to be one among you now and now only i begin to live fearful of bewildering myself in this fairy land i turned back to the inn but continued gazing with new amazement at every step just as i came to the gate i heard the galloping of horses behind me looked round and there most unexpectedly saw hector mowbray pulling up his horse with two livery servants three greyhounds and a brace of pointers at his heels he had new boots buckskin breeches a buff waistcoat a scarlet coat with a green collar and a gold button and loop tassel and hatband i was within a yard of him when he alighted bless me said i mr mowbrayg d my blood trevor is it you the apostrophe startled me hector gave three loud cracks with his whip whistled his dogs and with a stentor voice called after one of his servantswhy holloa you blind blood of a w why sam g shiver your soul what are you about uncouple jerry sneak and jowler and give limping jennys ear a nointingd my body trevor im glad to see you when did you arrive how did you come in stile a chaise and four

the jolly dog his tutor tell him we have a new comer a friend a freshman piping hot dn me from our village and that we must make him free of oxford to night dn me do you hear astound breathless thunderstruck at this intolerable profaneness i stood like an idiot unable to speak or think hector took hold of my arm and dragged me along i obeyed for i was insensible soulless and even when the return of thought came it was all confusion was this oxford were these its manners were such its inhabitants oaths twenty in a breath unmeaning vulgar oaths ribaldry such as till that hour i had never heard what could i do i was a stranger were they all equally depraved and equally contemptiblethat said i to myself is what i wish to know and i suffered him to lead me wherever he pleased he took me to inns coffeehouses and halls to call on one companion and beat up for another i saw the buildings the architecture doubtless was the same but the scene was changed the beauties of oxford were vanished i was awakened from the most delightful of dreams to a disgusting reality and would have given kingdoms to have once more renewed my trance the friends of hector though not all of them his equals in turbulence profaneness and folly were of the same school their language though less coarse was equally insipid their manners when not so obtrusive were more bald they all cursed blustered and behaved with insolence in proportion to the money they spent or the time they had been at the university the chief difference was that those who were less rich and less hardened than he had less spirit that is had less noise nonsense and swagger but though the scene was not what i expected it was new and in a certain sense enlivening and my flowing spirits were soon at their accustomed height the president had been written to and i was expected at college where when we came and my arrival was announced i found an apartment prepared for my reception passing through the common room i saw a face which i thought i recollected is not that turl said i to hectorpshaw dn me take no notice of such a raff replied he and stalked away i was too ignorant of college cant at that time to know that raff was the term of contempt for poverty as we passed through the quadrangle the president entering the gate saw hector in his scarlet green and gold and without his gown and cap and beckoned to him hector to evade as i afterward learned what he expected introduced me the president eyed me for a moment received me graciously and desired me to call on him in the morning he then asked mowbray why he left his chamber in that dress and without his gown hector answered he had only arrived the day before had been to take a ride and had mislaid his cap which was not to be found but he had a new one coming home in the morning the president after sayingwell sir i request i may not meet you in this manner again passed on the story of the cap mislaid was a direct falsehood the old and new cap were both in his chamber for he had been trying them on and asking me which looked the best hector winked his eye lolled his tongue and said to methats the way dn me to hum the old ones supper time presently came and hector and his companions were assembled beside lord saddog and his tutor there was a senior fellow and a master of arts all of our college and all of them the prime bucks of the place my late high expectations of learning and virtue were entirely forgotten there was novelty in every word they uttered and i listened to their conversation with the most attentive ardour nor did i feel astonishment to hear that dogs horses gluttony drunkenness and debauchery were the grand blessings of life hector had prepared me to hear any thing with but little surprise the lord and the squire gloried in braving and breaking the statutes of the college and the university the tutor fellow and master of arts in eluding them the history they gave of themselves was that the former could ride drive swear kick scoundrels bilk prostitutes commit adultery and breed riots the latter could cant lie act the hypocrite hum the proctors and protect their companions in debauchery in gluttony drunkenness and libidinous thoughts they were all avowed rivals hector descending to trifling vices vaunted of having been five times in one week imposed that is reprimanded by set tasks for having neglected lectures and prayers and worn scarlet green and gold while the more heroic lord saddog told how he had been twice privately rusticated for an amour with the barmaid of a coffeehouse whom he dared the vicechancellor himself to banish the city fearful of being surpassed they exaggerated their own wickedness and often imputed crimes to themselves which they had neither the opportunity nor the courage to commit that i might appear worthy of the choice group among whom i was admitted hector by relating in a distorted manner things that had happened but attributing to me such motives as he imagined he should have been actuated by had he been the agent told various falsehoods of my exploits i had too great a mixture of sheepishness and vanity to contradict him in such honourable society and therefore accepted praise at which i ought to have blushed during supper while they were all gormandizing and encouraging me to do the same his lordship addressing his tutor askeddn me jack can you tell me why it was i took you into my pay what the dmntn are you good fortell you to be sure i can you will not pretend that when you first came under my tuition you were the man you now are who taught you to laugh at doctors bully proctors stare the vice chancellor out of countenance and parade the streets of a sunday in sermon time but iyouyes idn my body well said jack roared hector dn me you are a good one go it keep it up dn me go it the tutor continued of whom did you learn to scout the gownsmen cudgel the townsmen kiss their wives frighten their daughters and debauch their maids but i you were a mere tyro when i took you in hand you did not so much as know how to throw in a knock down blowwhy you lying son of a i must not repeat his lordships reply or the continuation of the dialogue it was too gross to be read or written i only intend the above as a short specimen of what lords private tutors at universities sometimes are and of the learning which their pupils sometimes acquire while at supper i was continually plied to drink each pledging me in turn their intention being as hector had declared to make me free that is as drunk as possible i had not the courage to incur their ridicule by refusing my glass beside my spirits were raised and my appetite which travelling had increased was good my constitution too was strong for it had been confirmed by exercise and a cheerful mind and never injured by excess for these reasons i stood their attacks far beyond their expectation and my manhood received no little applause the night advanced and they grew riotous the lord and his tutor were for sporting the door of a glum that is breaking into the chamber of a gownsman who loves study hector vociferously seconded the motion but the fellow and the master of arts cunningly endeavoured to keep them quiet first by persuasion and when that was ineffectual by affirming the students they proposed to attack sported oak in plain english barred up their doors had they been without the walls of the college there would have been a riot but having no other ventilator for their magnanimity they fell with redoubled fury to drinking and the jolly tutor proposed a rummer rounddn me said hector thats a famous thought but you are a famous deep one dn me the rummers were seized the wine poured out and his lordship began withdmntn to the flincher who should that be i the freshman oh no for that night i was too far gone in good fellowship this was the finishing blow to three of us hector fell on the floor his lordship sunk in his chair and i after a hurrah and a hiccup began to cast the cat an oxford phrase for what usually happens to a man after taking an emetic happily i had not far to go and the fellow and the master of arts had just sense enough left to help me to my chamber where at day light next morning i found myself on the hearth with my head resting against the fender the pain of which awakened me chapter xv morning reflections the advice of a youth and the caution of a grave senior another rencontre discovering myself in this condition recollecting the scene in which i had so lately been an actor and feeling my stomach and head disordered and my whole frame burning with the debauch looking round too and seeing myself in a room where every object reminded me that i was a stranger and that the eyes of many strangers were upon me and my conduct i found but little cause of satisfaction either in myself the acquaintance i had made or the place to which i had come the more i reflected the more was my mind disturbed i walked about the chamber unable to rid myself either of my sickly qualms the feverish distemper of my blood or the still more fevered distemperature of my mind it was a violent but i suspect it was a useful lesson after a while cold water washing cleaning and shifting my dress gave me a little relief the air i thought would be refreshing but as i opened the door to descend the stairs turl was passing and very kindly inquired after my health said he was happy to see me and asked if i were come to enter myself at the college neglecting or rather at that moment despising hector and his caution i answered in the same tone and invited him into my room too much ashamed to avow the debauch of which i had been guilty or the painful feelings that were the result i endeavoured by questions to gain the information which might best appease my roused curiosity i am but just arrived said i will you be kind enough to give me such intelligence as may aid me to regulate my conduct what i have hitherto seen has rather surprized and even disappointed me i hoped for perfection which i begin to doubt i shall not find what are the manners of the placesuch as must be expected from a multitude of youths who are ashamed to be thought boys and who do not know how to behave like menbut are there not people appointed to teach themnowhat is the office of the proctors heads of houses deans and other superintendants of whom i have heardto watch and regulate the tufts of caps the tying of bands the stuff and tassels of which gowns are made to reprimand those who wear red or green and to take care that the gownsmen assemble at proper hours to hear prayers gabbled over as fast as tongue can give them utterance or lectures at which both reader and hearers fall asleep what are the public rewards for proficiency in learningfew or in reality nonebeside numerous offices are not exhibitions fellowships professors chairs and presentations bestowedyes on those who have municipal or political influence or who by servility and effrontery can court patronagesurely you have some men of worth and genius who meet their due rewardfew very few indeed sloth inanity and bloated pride are here too often the characteristics of office fastidiousness is virtue and to keep the poor and unprotected in awe a duty the rich indeed are indulged in all the licentious liberties they can desirewhy do so many young men of family resort hithersome to get what is to be given away others are sent by their parents who imagine the place to be the reverse of what it is and a third set intended for the church are obliged to go to a university before they can be admitted into holy ordersthat rule i have heard is not absoluteit is supposed here to be little lessthen you would not advise a young person to come to this city to complete his educationif he possess extraordinary fortitude and virtue yes if not i would have him avoid oxford as he would contagionwhat are its advantages to the formerleisure books and learned men and the last benefit would be the greatest were it not publicly discountenanced by the arrogant distance which both the statutes of the university and the practice of the graduates and dignitaries prescribe in my opinion it has another paradoxical kind of advantage to a mind properly prepared the very vice of the place by shewing how hateful it is must be healthful insolence haughtiness sloth and sensuality daily exhibited if truly seen cannot but excite contemptyou seem to have profited by the lessonoh there is but little merit in my forbearance i am poor and have not the means i am a servitor and despised or overlooked those are most exposed to danger who have most money and most credit i have neither charmed with his candour our conversation continued he directed me in the college modes and i sent to the bursar and prevailed on turl to breakfast with me i understood that he had obtained an exhibition but that having expressed his thoughts too freely on certain speculative points he had incurred the disapprobation of his seniors who considered it as exceedingly impertinent in any man to differ with them in opinion and especially in such a youth it was now time i should visit the president and we parted this college magistrate had formerly been acquainted with my grandfather and i had strong recommendations to him from my native village he therefore laid aside much of his dignity and questioned me on various subjects he took but little notice of the reading and knowledge i was ambitious to display but gave me much advice and instruction concerning the college and university discipline necessary to be observed which he very seriously admonished me not to neglect i endeavoured to find what his opinion concerning hector mowbray was and the lord to whom i had been introduced but this he evaded with a caution to me however not to indulge in any imprudent expence i then mentioned the name of turl at which he seemed instantly alarmed and replied he should be exceedingly sorry if mr turl were one of my acquaintance he was a very dangerous young man and had dared not only to entertain but to make known some very heterodox opinions he had even proceeded so far as to declare himself an antitrinitarian and should therefore certainly never receive his countenance neither he nor any of his connections if he escaped expulsion he would assuredly never obtain his degrees i was too orthodox myself not to be startled at this intelligence and felt a very severe pang that a young man from whose conversation i had hoped so much should hold such reprobate doctrines i had thought he would prove both an instructive and pleasant companion but i now positively determined to shun his society of this i informed the president and he highly applauded my resolution i then proceeded to the ceremony of entering myself of the college and took the oaths that is i subscribed to the thirtynine articles took an oath of allegiance and supremacy an oath to observe the statutes of the university and another to obey every thing that was contained in a certain huge statute book of the college brought out on this occasion which i never saw either before or since to this hour what its contents were is a thing to me unknown what is still more strange the very persons who oblige you to take these statutebook oaths publickly confess that to obey most of them is impossible they relate to obsolete customs the very means of practising which are wanting some for example swear to have mass said for the soul of the founder of the college and others though men of good estates swear themselves not worth five pounds per annum of these particulars however i was ignorant and the whole was hurried over so much in the way of form and without inquiry of any kind that it seemed like the mere dictate of good manners to do what i was bidden warned by the information which turl had communicated and disgusted by what i myself had seen and partaken of i industriously for sometime avoided hector mowbray who as it happened was too much engaged in his own pursuits to molest me in about three weeks however he came to me one morning rallied me in his coarse way asked if i had entered myself of the glums and insisted that i should go with him and take a ride to abingdon the chaise would be ready in half an hour and he would introduce me to the finest girl in all england thinking his language equivocal and suspecting his intentions i ventured to ask if she were a modest woman he burst into a loud laugh and exclaimed i shall omit his oaths modest to be sure as modest as any of her sex this did not satisfy me i continued to interrogate and he to laugh but still swearing there was not a modester woman in all england a strong inclination to take exercise my own active curiosity and the boisterous bawling and obstinacy of hector at length prevailed and i yielded i walked with him to the inn the chaise was ready and we stepped into it and galloped away as we were driving on the image of the gentle olivia rose to my recollection instantly the thought struck me if it should be why not who else could it be oh it must yes yes i was soon convinced it could be no other than olivia the dear the divine olivia in less than forty minutes we were at abingdon and the postillion by hectors direction drove us on the back of the town till we came to a neat newly painted house at which he was ordered to stop my heart began to beat hector jumped out and thundered at the door a female threw up the sash looked through the window and instantly drew it down again alas it was not olivia there was some delay the impatient hector cursed and knocked again and in a little while the door was opened hector entered swearing hurried up stairs bad me follow him dashed open the door and a young lady in a skyblue ridinghabit with embroidered buttonholes a nosegay in her bosom and a purple cestus round her waistleaped into his armsi stood in a trance it was she herself that sweet lovely creature who had lost her purse given a draft on her banker and gone to relieve a poor sick relation at cirencester it was the true and identical harriet palmer she that had been so attentive to me had sugared my tea suffered me to sup in her company and been so fearful lest i should be sick by riding backward the innocent soul that had felt her delicacy so much disturbed by the horsegodmother rudeness of the menfellowsbless me said i she had not time to attend to me what the dmntn is the matter said hector why was not i let in who have you herehere answered the sweet creature how can you suppose i have any body here there was a watch studded with diamonds lying on the sofa it caught the eye of mowbray he snatched it up and with a volley of oaths askedwhose watch is thismine said harriet hector looked again yours set with diamonds a mans gold chain heres the seal of lord saddog his arms engraved on it i thought i saw one of his fellows as we turned the corner there was another door to an inner chamber to that hector with all his force applied his foot a loud laugh was heard within the door opened and out came lord saddog in propria persona miss palmer not knowing what better to do joined his lordship in the forced laugh the surly hector shewed every propensity to brutal revenge but had only the courage to bully in which art the lord and the lady soon shewed they were as great proficients as himself as for the feelings of the blooming harriet and me they were reciprocal we were equally averse to acknowledge each other for acquaintance i did not wish to be proclaimed the dupe of a courtezan nor she to pay back the ten guineas or be sued for a fraud hector was in no humour to stay and we soon returned to oxford i ruminating and even laughing now at myself now at him he in high dudgeon and finding his choler and his courage increase in proportion as he was driven farther from danger chapter xvi education still progressive a widows continence religious fervour a methodist sermon olivia in danger love dreams fanatic horrors present disgrace and honours delayed during the short period of my absence from my native home i had been taught two additional and essential lessons the first that men are not all as good as they might be and the second that i was not quite so wise as i had supposed myself having once been duped the thought occurred that it was possible i might be duped again and i thus acquired some small degree of what is called worldly caution at once to display one vice and teach another to expose fraud and inspire suspicion is to an unadulterated mind a severe and odious lesson and when repeated too often is in danger of inculcating a mistake infinitely more pernicious than that of credulity that is a conviction that man is depraved by nature and a total forgetfulness that he is merely the creature of habit and accident hitherto i had met disappointment but i had found novelty and though it was not the novelty i expected yet it was invigorating it kept me awake the qualities for which i most valued myself no one indeed seemed to notice but the world was before me i had seen but little of it my own feelings assured me genius and virtue had a real existence and sometime or another i should find them among consolatory thoughts the most animating was the recollection of what turl had said that to the possessor of fortitude and virtue oxford was a place where study might be most advantageously prosecuted and aided by this cheering hope i applied myself to books with courage and assiduity on the subject of reading however my mind had strong contentions with itself poetry and the belles lettres homer horace virgil shakespeare spenser milton dryden tasso ariosto racine moliere congreve with a long and countless et caetera were continually tempting me to quit the barren pursuits of divinity and law for the study of which i had come to oxford yet a sense of duty so far prevailed that i went through a course of the fathers pored over the canonists and made many resolute attacks upon the schoolmen not only aristotle but his doctors the irrefragable the angelic or eagleeyed the subtile the illuminated and many more had their peaceful folios vainly disturbed by my researches and my determination to understand what alas in its essence was unintelligible in the very beginning as it were of these labours an event took place which gave a very serious aspect to my future fortunes though except the first emotions of regret chagrin and surprise at my mothers conduct no present uneasiness to me in despite of his lawsuits my grandfather had left considerable property which it was supposed would descend to me it had indeed the disadvantage of being left under the executorship of a lawyer who represented it to be in a very involved and disorderly state for with respect to my mother though she had immediate possession she declared that agreeably to the intention of the rector her own subsistence excepted she held it only for my use thus in several of her letters she had affectionately pressed me not to deprive myself of what was necessary to my situation to the appearance of a gentleman or to the support of the family character for the first two months we punctually wrote to each other once a week my dear dear hugh was the first phrase in all her letters and my kind and good mother in mine every maternal anxiety was expressed by her and by me every return of filial affection and duty at length a week came in which i received no letter i was alarmed wrote to express my fears and in a few days was answered by the lawyer that my mother was in good health but was from home on a visit a month longer passed away in silence at the end of which i wrote to my mother expressing my feelings and fears and requesting an answer under her own hand otherwise i should come myself to see what was the matter the answer arrived i hastily opened it and began to read it was no longer prefaced with my dear dear hugh it was what follows dear son you seem impatient to hear from me and so i sit down to write you an account of something that has happened which perhaps you will think well of i hope you will i am sure you have no reason to think otherwise though when one does things all for the best one is not always best thought of but i dare say you will not think ill of your mother for that would not be dutiful nor at all agreeable to what your poor dear grandfather always taught nobody can suppose that i am not come to years of discretion and you very well know i have always been a good and tender mother to you and so i always shall be and i am sure you will not think hardly and improperly of my conduct in any way for that would be very unkind and unbecoming and if i have done all for the best to be hardly thought of afterwards would be very improper indeed mr thornby the lawyer is a very prudent man and so i have acted by his advice which you may well think cannot be wrong and his nephew mr wakefield is a gentleman that nobody need be ashamed of owning and so since you must be told you may as well be told at first as at lasti am married which i hope and expect you will think was a very prudent thing i am sure when you come to know mr wakefield you will like him prodigiously he sends his kind blessing to you and so i remain your ever loving mother jane wakefield little as i was attached to personal interest or fearful of being left without a provision i own this letter electrified me was this the tone of affection had it vanished so instantly after such strong and reiterated professions for my sake never to have a second husband not only to marry but to cool intirely toward me and to be only anxious in a poor selfish circumlocutory apology for a conduct which she herself felt to be highly reprehensible the lawyer too his nephew not satisfied with the executorship he had engulphed the whole in his family the stipend of a hundred a year while i remained at college and a thousand pounds for the purchase of an advowson when i should leave it excepted i wondered on reflection that he should even have advised the rector to this but it was by affecting disinterestedness that he could most effectually secure the remainder but the pain these thoughts occasioned was neither debilitating nor durable my sanguine selfconfidence though sometimes apalled has all my life prevented me from being subject to fits of permanent chagrin or melancholy the recollection of my mothers passionate promises the shortness of the time the suddenness of the change the family into which she had married and the instability of a woman that was my mother drew a few sighs from me and in these my gloom evaporated i returned cheerfully to my books and determined to visit home no more but while a student to make oxford my home and not incur the frequently wellmerited reproach of being a termtrotter as for my companion hector whatever the intentions of the squire his father might be he considered oxford only as a place of dissipation and loved it for nothing but because he was here first let entirely loose and here first found comrades that were worthy to be his peers most of his time was now spent in london or in parties such as himself and his intimates planned i suffered little interruption from him he now and then indeed gave me an indolent call but as there was no parity of pursuit nor unity of sentiment between us there could be but little intercourse little farther remarkable happened during the three years and ten months of my residence in this city except the incident that occasioned my removal by being a constant spectator of the debauchery of the young and the sensuality of the old i conceived an increasing dislike of their manners and sought the company of a few secluded young men who like myself were severe students toward the close of this period i became acquainted with some who were tinged with methodism and by frequently listening to their conversation my thoughts were turned into the same channel the want of zeal in prayer and every part of religious duty the tedious and dull sermons heard in the churches and what methodists call preaching themselves and not their saviour were the frequent topics of our animadversion this was a doctrine most aptly calculated to inflame an imagination like mine which was ardent and enthusiastic beside it relieved me from a multitude of labours and cares for as i proceeded thomas aquinas and his subtilizing competitors were thrown by in contempt i had learned divinity by inspiration and soon believed myself fit for a reformer the philosopher aristotle with his dialectics and sophisms were exchanged for those of the philosopher saint paul from whom i learnt that he who had saving faith had every thing and that he who wanted it was naked of all excellence as the new born babe this nakedness i had discovered in myself and in the language of the sect was immediately clothed in the righteousness of christ jesus i in common with my methodistical brethren was chosen of the elect my name was inscribed in the book of life never to be erased my sins were washed away satan had no power over me and to myself and my new fraternity i applied the text that the gates of hell could not prevail against us to these mysteries which all the initiated allow are suddenly unfolded descending like lightening by the inspiration of the spirit and illuminating the darkened soul to these mysteries no man perhaps was ever a more sudden or a more combustible kind of convert than myself i beamed with gospel light it shone through me i was the beacon of this latter age a comet sent to warn the wicked i mean i was all this in my own imagination which swelled and mounted to the very acme of fanaticism under the impulse of these wild dreams in which my soul delighted i was sometimes tempted to rise up a prophet preach salvation to the poor and confound the wise persecution i must expect but in that i should glory it was the badge of blessedness the mark of election the signing of the covenant elevated to these celestial heights with what contempt did i look down on the doctors proctors and preachers of baal for such were all the unenlightened and on their dignities paraphernalia and many coloured robes what were these but the types of babylon the ensigns of the scarlet whore the purple tokens of the beast in the most extravagant eccentricities of mind it is remarkable what a mixture there is of truth and falsehood and how nearly and frequently they approach each other during the height of this paroxysm a famous gospel preacher a divine man on his way from shropshire to london came to hold forth in the vicinity of oxford not in churches they were shut upon him but in the fields not to the rich not to the worldy wise not to the self righteous they were deaf but to the poor in spirit to the polluted the hardened reprobate who wished by faith and repentance though dyed in sin like scarlet to be washed white as wool to hear this teacher of the word who set up his stool near a village on the witney road i repaired i and many a moaning old woman beside watchful with our chorus of amen and our sobs and groans at every divine ejaculation to aid the heaving motions of the spirit and take heaven by storm the elect were assembled and with them a greater number of the unconverted heads were uncovered a hymn was sung and a long extempore string of intercessions praying that the lord would lay bare his arm and strike the guilty with terror that christ crucified would be among them that they might be washed in the blood of the immaculate lamb and that the holy spirit would breathe the godman jesus into all hearts with many more absurdities was uttered the preacher then took his text and chose for his subject the casting of the buyers and sellers out of the temple this was an opportunity not to be lost by me a gospel minister was indeed a rara avis at oxford i therefore took out my utensils and very industriously wrote notes that the divine breathings of the man of god might not be lost upon mebuyers and sellers said he you must be cast out the tables of the money changers must be overthrown you have defiled the temple of the saviour in what do you trade in vanity in gold silver iron brass houses corn cattle goods and chattels but gold and silver may be stolen iron will rust brass will break cattle will die corn will mildew houses will burn they will tumble about your ears repent or you will quickly bring an old house over your heads your goods and chattels will but kindle the fire in which you are to burn everlastingly what are your occupations why to hoard and sell your souls for gain that your heirs may squander and buy a hot place in hell i am not one of your fashionable fine spoken mealy mouthed preachers i tell you the plain truth what are your pastimes cards and dice fiddling and dancing guzzling and guttling can you be saved by dice no will the four knaves give you a passport to heaven no can you fiddle yourself into a good birth among the sheep no you are goats and goat like you may dance yourselves to damnation you may guzzle wine here but you shall want a drop of water to cool your tongue hereafter you may guttle while righteous lazarus is lying at your gate but wait a little he shall soon lie in abrahams bosom

swear and shuffle and cut with you no the martyrs are no shufflers you will be cut so as you little expect you are a field of tares and lucifer is your head farmer he will come with his reapers and his sickles and his forks and you will be cut down and bound and pitched and carted and housed in hell i will not oil my lips with lies to please you i tell you the plain truth you will go to hell

will come when you will pray to beelzebub to let you escape his clutches and what will be his answeri will see you damned first to this rhapsody of strange but impressive vulgar eloquence i listened with rapture for nearly an hour selecting and noting down the passages that i thought most remarkable many of which were too extravagant if repeated to be believed in the height of these effusions when the divine man was torturing his lungs to be heard by the increasing croud he on his stool i seated uncapped in a cart by his side who should i see approach in a phaeton and pair but hector mowbray and by his side yesolivia the beauteous olivia no longer a child but tall straight perfectly formed every limb in the most captivating symmetry every feature in the full bloom of youth intelligence in every look grace in every motion sweetness in every smile attracted by curiosity her brother arrested his course drew up and placed the celestial vision full in view oh frailty of the flesh my new made garb of righteousness dropped from my shoulders the old adam that had been dead in me again revived the workings of the spirit ceased i gazed on an apparition which was indeed heavenly and forgot the apostles the prophets and the martyrs the preacher himself was heard no more nor more would have been heard had he not with all the effrontery of a fanatic interrupted his discourse to address himself personally to hector and olivia by which he excited sensations in me that were wholly unexpectedjehu driveth furiously said he but jezebel was given to the dogs my choler instantly began to rise sinners drive not so fast the way is broad and tophet is gaping where is weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth you will be there poor lost souls sooner than you expect the way to heaven is narrow much too narrow for your large consciences and though the court is spacious the gate is too little for you to drive in with your coaches and six no not even your vis a vis nor your phaetons neither not so much as a tumbril or a buggie can get past but perhaps you think to ride up to the gate and there to cry peccavi and that then it will open and you will be admitted but no no i tell you no you shall never be able to utter more than pec pec pec and while with your mouths open you are stammering and stuttering to get out cavi satan and his blackguards shall come and peck you even as crows peck carrion yes jehu and jezebel remember i give you warning if i one of the preachers disciples could scarcely refrain from falling upon him for his insolence what must the choleric and brutal hector feel hearing himself repeatedly laughed at by the delighted unmannerly mob during this impudent harangue he dropped the reins jumped from the phaeton sprang through the croud and began to horsewhip the inspired man in the most furious manner and now an accident happened which of all others that i can remember gave me the most terror olivia sat alone in the phaeton the reins were loose and the fighting shouting and uproar of the divided mob occasioned the horses to take fright they snorted kicked and set off full speed with the helpless olivia screaming for aid the moment hector left the carriage i saw what was likely to happen leaped from the cart where i sat and flew like lightening after the frantic animals few men were swifter of foot than i was but they had the start and were on the full gallop the danger was imminent on one side of the road was a gravel pit on the other the river and before them was a bridge the walls of which were not breast high a cart was passing the bridge and the mad horses still on full speed ran on the wrong side dashed the phaeton against the cart overturned it and threw olivia over the wall into the river the freshes had lately come down and the stream was both deep and strong i was at the foot of the bridge when she fell and when i reached the place she was still above water and had passed the arch on the other side i instantly stripped off my coat cap and gown sprang into the eddy made a few strokes and as happy fortune would have it just caught her as she was sinking loaded with this precious burden i had the strength of twenty men i stemmed the current and presently brought her into shallow water where i could find footing i then bore her into the nearest house and every possible aid was immediately administered while i was thus employed hector arrived his rage boiling over anew at his lamed horses and broken phaeton for his inquiries concerning his sister were short as soon as he understood that she was not drowned i paid as little attention to him as he did to her and was disturbed only by my fears lest the fright should be productive of fever or still worse consequences olivia had too much sincerity of heart and too great a desire to remove the anxiety of those around her to be guilty of the least affectation she had received no injury for the danger being over her mind was too strong not to dispel her fears and after reposing an hour and finding herself perfectly well she insisted on coming down and joining us at dinner her thanks to me in words were not profuse but they were emphatical she was alive and should never forget that she owed that life to me this she three times repeated once at table again in the postchaise in which we returned to oxford and once more when we took leave of each other in the evening to me this day was indeed a day of tumult nothing perhaps more aptly prepares the mind for the passion of love than religious enthusiasm the subject of my conversation with olivia was chiefly a revival of former times which seemed to be remembered by us mutually with glowing regret as the happiest moments of our existence times which i inwardly dreaded might never return fanatical reveries excepted this perhaps was the first desponding thought i had known at least it was the first i can distinctly remember and the pang that accompanied it was severe olivia was so lovely her form so enchanting her manners so captivating that my eyes were riveted on her my soul absorbed and the faculty of thinking arrested every look of her beaming eyes penetrated to the heart every motion of her moist coral lips gave exstacy and every variation of her features discovered new ineffable and angelic beauties why did the hours fly why was the day so short she had only passed through oxford in her way to london and was to depart in the morning i would gladly have persuaded her to regard her health and not expose herself so soon after the fright but in vain she felt no malady nor would acknowledge any and the selfish hector was rather inclined to hurry her off than invite her to stay it was years since i had seen her and to be torn thus suddenly from bliss unutterable never had i felt a pang like this before in the evening returned to my chamber and left in solitude i sat with my arms folded disconsolate motionless and in a profound but yet a most active trance i remained thus for hours ardently thinking on olivia recollecting every incident of my past life in which she had had the least part placing all her divine perfections full in view and unable to detach my mind one moment from the beatific vision at length by accident i cast my eye on two books that lay on the mantlepiece before me baxters call to the unconverted and the history of francis spira two of the most terrific productions to such a mind at such a moment that ever the ravings of fanaticism sent forth the impulse was irresistible i opened them read and all the horrors of hell came upon me i was a backslider perdition was certain all the torments that baxter described were devouring me and my soul was sinking like the soul of francis spira into sulphureous flames there to howl and be eternally tormented by the malignant mocks and mows of inexorable fiends i have since suffered many evils or what are called evils and have known misfortunes such as are supposed to be of the severest kind but of all the nights of my life not one can equal this i fell on my knees and attempted to pray but imagined the ear of mercy shut and that i beheld the wicked one stand ready to seize and fly away with me my teeth began to gnash as if by irresistible impulse my hair stood on end and large drops of sweat fell from my face the eternal damnation of which i had read and heard so much seemed inevitable till at last in a torrent of phrenzy which i had not the power to controul i began to blaspheme believing myself to be already a fiend it is by such horrible imagery that so many of the disciples of methodism have become maniacs my dereliction of intellect fortunately was but of short duration overpowered and exhausted i at length sunk to sleep my head leaning on the bed and i kneeling by its side how long i remained thus i cannot tell but i awoke in a shivering fit from a dream of terror and found myself in the dark i hastily undressed myself got into bed and shrunk beneath the bed clothes as if escaping from satan whom imagination once more placed at my elbow in forms inexpressibly horrid the visions of the night had left too deep an impression not to be in part revived in the morning thoughts however that had lately escaped me were now called to recollection i remembered having once believed that god was the god of mercy that for him to delight in the torture of lost souls was impossible and that i had even doubted of the eternity of future torments to this relief a more effectual one was added olivia could not be forgotten and my thoughts by being continually attracted and fixed on her were relieved from despair which might otherwise have been fatal a week passed away in such kind of convulsive meditations my attachment to methodism daily declining and at last changing into something like aversion and horror at the end of this period i was sent for in the morning by the president the incident was alarming i had broken no college rules neglected no prayers nor been guilty of any indecorum i foreboded that he had heard of my methodistical excursion the conjecture was true he told me it was too publicly known to be passed over in silence that the character of the university had greatly suffered by this kind of heresy that the vice chancellor proctors and heads of houses had been consulted and that the gentlest punishment they could inflict was rustication for two terms it would have been much more severe he said but for the respect he bore to the memory of my grandfather who had been a doctor of the university a worthy pillar of the church and his good friend though i suspected my opinions i was not so entirely convinced as openly to renounce them and i remained silent when he required me to recant but i requested him to tell me how the event had become public not a gownsman was present except hector mowbray and surely he was above the character of an informer especially thought i in this instance the president however was silent i was suffered to suppose what i pleased and i left him with the sentence of rustication confirmed and my long expected academical honours deferred the only favour granted me was that the punishment should not be made public chapter xvii disappointment more marriage accidents preparations for a journey the delay of two terms was by no means pleasing to me i had nearly waited the stipulated time had read wall lectures and had done juraments and generals aristotle had been laid upon my head and i had been created a soph in fine i had complied with all the forms of the university forms which once perhaps might have had a meaning but which are now offensively absurd i expected the next term to have obtained the degree of bachelor of arts after which it was my intention to have gone to london there to have been ordained and to have sought a flock wanting a pastor on whom the stores of my theology and the powers of my elocution might have been well bestowed traversed in this design i determined to repair to the great city immediately and return to keep my terms at oxford when the period of rustication should have elapsed but i had been obliged to furnish myself with books and music and had found the hundred pounds a year allowed me scarcely sufficient and beside the charges of travelling and removal i was informed that london was an expensive place it was therefore necessary i should write to the country for a supply the correspondence with my mother though not pursued with all the zeal in which it was begun had been occasionally continued at first her letters abounded with eulogiums on her husband but the subject afterward began to cool with her and she had lately forborne even to mention his name in answer to the letters which i wrote to inform her and lawyer thornby of my plan and to request a supply a part of the truth appeared her husband was a young man who coming sooner into the possession of money than of good sense had squandered as much of it as he could wrest from his uncle the lawyer who affirmed the whole or nearly the whole was wasted and when he could obtain no more had left her to depend on thornbys bounty and had gone to london these disagreeable circumstances were in part communicated by my mother and in part by thornby who had written to tell me that if a small advance were made it must be deducted from the thousand pounds bequeathed as before mentioned to this i willingly agreed and giving him all the legal security he required i received fifty pounds after which i made the necessary preparations for my intended journey and obtained letters of recommendation to a clergyman in london and to the bishop ofto whom when i should have taken my bachelors degree i meant to apply for deacons orders end of volume i volume ii chapter i retrospect and character afore taste of futurity entrance to london or where does it begin all alive a civil gentleman curiosity cooled the period was now approaching in which i must fix on a profession for life my choice as i imagined was made there was no place so worthy of or so fit for the display of great talents as the pulpit this opinion i supposed to be too well founded for any possible arguments to overturn or even shake i had heard much of theology from the rector but more at oxford to promote this branch of knowledge the university was first established and by it is still maintained consequently it is there the chief object of pursuit and topic of discourse my hour of doubt was not yet arrived and of the absolute preeminence of the clerical office i was a bold and resolute asserter nor had my ambition been wholly bounded by the desire of fame i was in expectation of my full share of those advantages which the world thinks more substantial though this was but a subordinate consideration under all points of view my constant source of hope was in the energy of my own mind among the numerous examples which i had seen of men who had gained preferment many by the sole influence of personal interest and many more by the industry of intriguing vice there were some who had attained that end by the exertion of extraordinary talents and virtue it is true they were but few very few yet on them my attention had been constantly fixed them i was determined to emulate exert the same powers rise by the same means and enjoy the same privileges every example of successful genius delighted animated me and fired my glowing imagination the histories of great men even when persecuted and distressed a galileo a dryden or an otway did but excite my admiration and my envy let me but equal them and i could willingly live with them in poverty and imprisonment or die with them of misery malady and famine these were no transient feelings but the daily emanations of desire from my infancy the lessons and incidents of my life had rendered me aspiring and however steep and rugged the rock might be described on which the temple of fame stood i was determined to ascend and enter i was possessed of that hilarity which when not regulated by a strong desire to obtain some particular purpose shews itself in a thousand extravagant forms and is then called animal spirits but when thus turned to the attainment of one great end assumes the more worthy appellation of activity of mind it must be acknowledged i was but little aware how much i had to learn and unlearn or of the opposition i should meet from my own prejudices as well as from those of the world but dangers never imagined are never feared and my leading characteristic was the most sanguine hope were all the dangers of life to present themselves to the imagination in a body drawn up in battle array the prospect would indeed be dreadful but coming individually they are less formidable and successively as they occur are conquered foreboded their aspect is terrific but seen in retrospect they frequently excite present satisfaction and future fortitude and this is the way in which they have most frequently been seen by me nor had my time been wholly consumed in gathering the sweets of literature i had long been exercising myself in writing improving my style arranging my thoughts and enabling myself to communicate the knowledge i might amass of sermons i had written some dozens and the most arduous of the efforts of poetry had been attempted by me from the elegy to the epic poem each had suffered my attacks and though i myself was not so well satisfied with my performances as to complete these daring labours yet i had so far familiarised myself to a selection of words and phrases as to be able to compose with much more facility than is usual at such an age possessed as i was well persuaded of no common portion of merit it was a cheering thought that i was now going to bring it immediately to market at least into view london i understood to be the great emporium where talents if exhibited would soon find their true value and were in no danger of being long overlooked to london which was constantly pouring its novelties its discoveries and its effusions of genius over the kingdom i was going i did not as at oxford expect to find its inhabitants all saints no i had heard much of their vices the subtle and ingenious arts by which they trick and prey upon each other had been pictured to me as highly dangerous and of these arts self confident as i was i stood in some awe but fore warned said i fore armed and that i was not easily to be circumvented was still a part of my creed such were my qualities character and expectations when i entered the carriage that conveyed me toward the great city it was early in the month of february the days were short and evening came on as we reached hounslow brentford i imagined to be london and was disappointed to find myself again driven out of town the lighted lamps and respectable buildings of turnham green made me conclude that to be the place or at least the beginning which hammersmith did but confirm and my surprise at once more finding myself in a noble road still lighted with lamps and with only here and there a house was increased at kensington to me london actually began and i thought myself hurried nearly through it when the coach stopped at the gloucester coffeehouse in piccadilly i had already for miles been driven through streets over stones and never out of sight of houses and was astonished to be told that i was now only as it were at the entrance of london the quantity of carriages we had passed the incessant clattering of hoofs and rolling of wheels over the pavement the general buzz around me the hurry and animation of the people and the universal illumination of streets houses and shops excited ideas which were new unexpected and almost confounding imagination conjured up a mass that was all magnificence the world till now had to me been sleeping here only men were alive at oxford indeed owing to circumstances i had felt some similar emotions but that was a transient scene that quickly declined into stillness and calm here i was told it was everlastingly the same the mind delighted to revel in this abundance it seemed an infinitude where satiety its most fatal and hated enemy could never come i had questions innumerable to ask and made fifty attempts to get intelligence from the waiters but in vain they were too busy to attend to me and treated my interrogatories with impertinent neglect however i was overflowing talk i must and i attacked various persons that were coming and going in the coffeeroom still i could get only short answers and i wanted volumes thus disappointed i went and stood at the door that i might divine as much as i could for myself for though it was night in london there is scarcely such a thing as darkness while i was standing here a gentleman of a more complaisant temper came up and fell into conversation with me answered my inquiries and informed me the kings palace was at no great distance the kings palace was indeed a tempting object and he goodnaturedly offered to walk and shew it me this very obliging proposal i readily accepted and away we went as we were going down st jamessstreet as i imagine the thought occurred if this gentleman now should be a sharper he behaves with great civility it is very improbable but who knows let him there is no trick he is master of shall prevail on me to part with the little money i have in my pocket of that i am determined scarcely had the idea passed through my mind before two men ran with such violence against me that they threw me flat on the pavement and hurt me considerably my companion and another immediately came to help me up and the moment i was on my legs my friend and guide requested me to stay there half a minute he would see that the watch should soon secure the rascals and off he ran full speed the other kind gentleman followed his example all this happened in an instant and while i was standing in a kind of amazement a passenger who had seen the transaction at a distance came up and asked meare you much bruised sirnot very muchhave you lost nothinglost the question alarmed me no i believe notsearch your pockets going to do as i was desired and putting my hands down i found my breeches pockets were both turned inside out and emptied of their contents i stood speechless and motionless while i was informed that it was a commonplace trick for gangs of pickpockets to throw unwary passengers down with violence pretend to pity and give them aid pick their pockets while helping them up and then decamp with all possible expedition but said i with great simplicity to my informer will not the gentleman come backwhat the man who ran offyesback no no you will never see his face more i promise you sir unless you will take the trouble to visit newgate or attend the old bailey there was no remedy i stared for a moment looked foolish and returned toward the coffeehouse having taken care to mark the way i went on repeating this story afterward i learned further that to watch at inns and places where strangers arrive and to play such tricks as may best succeed with them is a very frequent practice with sharpers and pickpockets my only consolation was the sum was small for i had been cautioned not to travel with much money about me lest we should meet robbers on the road and the advice happened to be serviceable that i had not my watch in my pocket was another lucky circumstance or it would have disappeared the fear of highwaymen had induced me to pack it up in my trunk as for my handkerchief it was gone in the company of my purse chapter ii a journey in town good breeding and morality a new order of priests a clerical character or the art of pleasing episcopal influence more gazing a strange adventure and the first sight of a play as soon as i had breakfasted in the morning my first care was to change my dress powder my hair put my watch in my pocket inquire my way and deliver my letters of recommendation i thought it most prudent to apply first to the clergyman and take his advice concerning the best manner of appearing before a bishop my letters for i had two were addressed to the reverend enoch ellis suffolkstreet middlesex hospital which way i went i cannot now tell but i had so many sights to see shops to examine and curiosities to admire that by the help of wandering perhaps a mile or much more out of my road i was at least two hours before i came to my journeys end i knocked at the door and was told by the servant that his master was not at home but was asked if i had any message i replied i had letters which i wished to deliver into his own hand the reverend enoch who as it appeared was listening through an aperture left purposely at the parlour door put his head out like a turtle from his shell and desired the servant to shew the gentleman in he would be with him in a moment this was another phenomenon in morals a clergyman suffer nay encourage or as it must be command his servant to tell a lie it was inconceivable i knew nothing of fashionable manners and that being denied to people whom you do not wish to see instead of being thought insolent or false was the general practice of the well bred at that time i understood no single point of good breeding i had it all to learn but indeed so dull am i on such topics that to this hour how it can be a clergymans or any honest mans duty or interest to teach servants to lie is to me incomprehensible the difficulty as i have found it is to teach both them and all classes of people to tell the truth what the morality of the practice is cannot be a serious question before i proceed with that part of my story in which the reverend enoch ellis takes a share it is necessary to remark that there has sprung up in modern times a clerical order of men very distinct in manners and character from the subservient curate or the lordly parish priest houses in london have lately been built much faster than churches yet though the zeal of these times does not equal that of ancient days when our cities were divided into numerous small parishes when religion was the universal trade of mankind and when the temples of superstition reared their proud heads in every alley still men who know how to turn the penny have found it advantageous even in these days of infidelity to build here and there a chapel and to let each of these chapels out to the best clerical bidder who in his turn uses all his influence to allure the neighbourhood to hire in retail those bits and parcels called pews that for the gratification of pride are measured off within the consecrated walls which he has hired wholesale in these undertakings if the preacher cannot make himself popular it is at least his interest to make himself pleasing of one of these chapels enoch ellis was the farmer general and this necessary endeavour to please had produced in him a remarkable contrast of character he was a little man with thin legs and thighs and a pot belly but precisely upright an archbishop could not carry himself more erect his chest projecting his neck stiff his head thrown back his eyes of the ferret kind red tender and much uncovered by the eyelid his nose flat on the bridge and at the end of the colour and form of a small round gingerbread nut but with little nostril his lips thin his teeth half black half yellow his ears large his beard and whiskers sandy his hair dark but kept in buckle and powdered as white as a millers hat his complexion sallow and his countenance and general aspect jaundiced and mean with these requisites there was a continual struggle between his efforts to preserve his clerical solemnity and to make himself agreeable his formal manner of pursing up his face into smiles for this purpose had produced a regular set of small wrinkles folds and plies that inevitably reminded those who were not accustomed to him of the grinning of an ape for he was so fearful of derogating from his dignity that it was impossible for his smile to take the form of meaning after waiting about ten minutes this reverend little gentleman such as i have described entered assumed one of these agreeable solemn smiles and bowed but instantly recovered his full stature as if he had been then measuring for a grenadier i delivered my letters one was from the tutor and the other from a regent master who was one of the caput he read them and as i was desirous to gain friends in a city of strangers i anxiously watched his countenance but i could not perceive that they produced any remarkably favourable effect not but he assumed all his civility was vastly glad to hear his oxford friends were in good health should be exceedingly happy to do any thing that lay in his power to serve a gentleman of their recommendation but the duties of his profession were very laborious they could not be neglected his calls were incessant he had not a moment to himself however if i could point out any waythat ishe should be prodigiously happyprodigiously indeed to give me any advice in his power i was by no means satisfied with the pauses hems and has with which he delivered these apologies however not knowing what better to do i mentioned that i had letters to the bishop of and should be glad if he could tell me which was the properest hour and manner of gaining access to deliver them the mention of the bishop was electrical it produced an immediate and miraculous change in the countenance of the reverend enoch ellis the quantity of emphasis on his favourite epithet prodigious was wonderfully increased he was prodigiously glad to find i was so well recommended was prodigiously happy to hear from his friends of college should take prodigious satisfaction in serving a gentleman in whose behalf they had written nothing could give him such prodigious pleasure and that i might be under no difficulty if i would permit him he would first make the necessary inquiries and then attend me in person to pay my respects to the right reverend dignitary this relaxation in his manner flattered and pleased me he now perceived me to be somebody my halfoffended vanity was appeased and i accepted his offer with thanks to add to these obligations finding that i was but just come to town of which i was entirely ignorant and that i wanted a lodging he very obligingly told me his servant should inquire in the neighbourhood and provide me one by the morrow i endeavoured to make a suitable return to this prodigious increase of courtesy by a pedantical but in my then opinion classical quotation dii tibic virgil will tell the rest these civilities being all acted and over i bowed and took my leave appointing to call again the next morning and he bowing in return and waiting on me to the door i much better pleased with my reception after the mention of the bishop than before and he no less well satisfied i had now nothing to do for the rest of the day but indulge my curiosity which made very large and imperious demands on all my senses i walked from street to street examined object after object tasted the tarts of the pastry cooks listened to the barrel organs bells tambours de basque and cymbals of savoyards snuffed ten thousand various odours gazed at the inviting splendour of shop windows innumerable and with insatiable avidity gazed again all the delights of novelty and surprise thrilled and tingled through my veins it was a world of such inexhaustible abundance wealth and prosperity as to exceed the wildest of the dreams of fancy recollecting what my feelings then were it seems almost surprizing that i can walk through the same tempting world of wonders at present scarcely conscious that such things have any existence the sole drawback i felt to these delights was the fear of sharpers and thieves which owing to my two unlucky adventures of the lady with the ridinghabit and the obliging gentleman who took me to see the kings palace was so great that i never thought myself in safety under these impressions i happened in the afternoon to stray through brydgesstreet and saw a croud of people gathered round the playhouse doors who on inquiry i found were waiting to get in the play bills were pasted in large letters red and black against the walls i read them and their contents told me it was one of my most favourite tragedies rowes fair penitent and that mrs siddons was to act i had never yet seen a play in my life for so licentious are the manners and behaviour of the youth of oxford that the vice chancellor dare not admit players into the city this was an invitation to enjoyment not to be resisted i blessed my lucky stars that had led me by accident that way and immediately took my stand among the people who surrounded the pit door and pressed forward to better my situation as much as i could without ill manners here i waited with the hope of pleasure exciting me to patience i know not how long till the hour of opening the doors approached about which time the croud was frequently put in motion i observed that the people around me had several times appeared to be watchful of each other and presently i heard a voice proclaim aloudtake care of your pockets my fears suddenly came upon me i put my hand down to my fob and missed my watch i eagerly looked round as well as i could hemmed in as i was and fixed my eyes onastonishmenton my conductor to the palace the blood mantled in my face you have stolen my watch said i he could not immediately escape and made no reply but turned pale looked at me as if intreating silence and commiseration and put a watch into my hand i felt a momentary compassion and he presently made his retreat his retiring did but increase the press of the croud so that it was impossible for me so much as to lift up my arm i therefore continued as the safest way to hold the watch in my hand soon afterward the door opened and i hurried it into my waistcoat pocket for i was obliged to make the best use of all my limbs that i might not be thrown down and trodden under foot at length after very uncommon struggles i made my way to the money door paid and entered the pit after taking breath and gazing around me i sat down and inquired of my neighbours how soon the play would begin i was told in an hour this new delay occasioned me to put my hand in my pocket and take out my watch which as i supposed had been returned by the thief but good heavens what was my surprize when in lieu of my own plain watch in a green chagrin case the one i was now possessed of was set round with diamonds and instead of ordinary steel and brass its appendages were a weighty gold chain and seals my astonishment was great beyond expression i opened it to examine the work and found it was capped i pressed upon the nut and it immediately struck the hour it was a repeater its value could not but be very great yet i was far from satisfied with the accident it was no watch of mine nor must i keep it if the owner could be found of which there could be no doubt and my own was gone past all recovery i could not let it rest i surveyed it again inspected every part more minutely and particularly examined the seals my former amazement was now increased ten fold they were the very same arms the identical seals of the watch on the sopha that had betrayed the lovely creature in the blue riding habit to hector mowbray the watch too was in every particular just such another had a gold chain and was studded with diamonds it must be the property of his lordship in vain did i rack invention to endeavour to account for so strange an incident my conjectures were all unsatisfactory all improbable i looked round to see if i could discover his lordship in the house but without success the numbers were so great that the people were concealed behind each other beside it was long since i had seen his lordship perhaps his person was changed as his title had been by the death of his father he was now the earl of idford my surmises concerning this uncommon accident kept my mind in continual activity till the drawing up of the curtain when they immediately ceded to ideas of a much more captivating and irresistible kind the delight received by the youthful imagination the first time of being present at the representation of a play is not i suspect to be equalled by any other ever yet experienced or invented the propriety and richness of the dresses the deception and variety of the scenery the natural and energetic delivery of the actors and the reality of every incidental circumstance were so great as to excite incessant rapture to describe the effects produced on me by mrs siddons is wholly impossible her bridal apathy of despair contrasted with the tumultuous joy of her father the mingled emotions of love for her seducer disdain of his baseness and abhorrence partly of her own guilt but still more of the tyranny and guilt of prejudice and the majesty of mind with which she trampled on the worlds scorn defied danger met death and lamented little for herself much for those she had injured excited emotions in me the remembrance of which ages could not obliterate it may here be worthy of remark that the difference between the sensations i then had and those i should now have were i present at the same exhibition is in many particulars as great as can well be imagined not an iota of the whole performance at that time but seemed to me to be perfect and i should have readily quarrelled with the man who should have happened to express disapprobation the art of acting i had little considered and was ignorant of its extent and degree of perfectibility to read a play was no common pleasure but to see one was ecstacy whereas at present the knowledge of how much better characters might in general be performed occasions me with the exception of some very few performers infinitely to prefer the reading of a good play in the closet to its exhibition on the stage the curtain being dropped for the night i stood for a while gazing at the multitude in motion unwilling to quit the enchanted spot but the house beginning to be empty and the lights put out i thought it was time to retire that i might feel no interruption from having so valuable a deposit in my charge for so i considered it to be instead of putting the repeater in my fob i had dropped it securely under my ham being much rather willing to endure any slight disagreeable sensation it might there excite than run any farther risk the precaution as it happened was prudent as i left the pit i thought i saw the identical obliging guide and pickpocket who had returned me this watch in mistake for it could be no other way and as i ascended the steps two men who were standing at the door immediately advanced before me and spread themselves out to prevent my passing while a third came behind me put his hand gently round my waist and felt for the chain my mind was so alive to dangers of this kind just then that i was immediately aware of the attempt and pushing the men aside with my whole force i sprang up the steps of which there were not more than half a dozen i then faced about in the door way not being acquainted with the passages nor thinking it safe to run the moment i rushed by one of them asked the otherhave you nabbed it and was answeredno go it immediately one of them darted toward me but i stood above him was greatly his superior in size and strength and easily knocked him down a second made a similar attempt and met a similar reception hearing the scuffle one of the house constables who happened to be standing at a little distance under the portico and some of his assistants came up but before they had time to be informed of the affair the fellows had taken to their heels the constable uttered many exclamations against the rascals and said they had become so daring that nobody was safe they had that very afternoon picked the pocket of the earl of idford of a repeater studded with diamonds under the piazza as he was coming out of the shakespeare where he had been to attend an election meeting by this i learned in five words what before the play began my brain had been ineffectually busied about for a full hour being told that i was a stranger and did not know my road the constable informed me it would be safest to go home in a coach i took his advice a coach was called and i was once more conveyed to the gloucester coffeehouse chapter iii the advice of enoch complaisance of a peer a liberal offer and enochs sensibility or the favour doubly returned my health appetite and spirits suffered no check from this tide of novelty and tumult of accident i eat heartily slept soundly and rose chearfully it is true i came up to london with propensities which from my education that is from the course of former events would not suffer me to be idle and in the space of a few hours i had already received several important lessons that considerably increased my stock of knowledge of these i did not fail to make an active use they awakened attention and i began to look about me with quickness and with caution i had business enough for the day and my first care was to keep my appointment with the reverend enoch whose counsel concerning the earl of idford and the repeater i once more thought it prudent to ask thither i repaired was readily admitted and told him my story it related to an earl and the ear of enoch was attentively open having heard the whole he made application immediately to the court calendar to discover the earls town residence and it was found to be in bruton street but how to gain admission his lordship would not be at home unless i were known i replied that i had formerly been acquainted with his lordship at the university ay but answered enoch is your face familiar to the servants nothen they will not let you in the best way therefore will be to write a note to his lordship informing him that you have particulars to communicate concerning his repeater he will then appoint an hour and you will certainly be admitted i have enquired concerning my lord the bishop you cannot see him at present for he is in the country but will return to town in less than a week consequently you can wait on the earl at any hour it is a lucky event a prodigiously fine opportunity for an introduction to a nobleman be advised by me and profit by it mr trevor if you please i will attend you to his lordship you are a young man and to be accompanied by a clergyman has a respectable look and gives a sanction you conceive me mr trevor i had acuteness enough to conceive the selfishness of his motives which was more than he intended but i acceded to the proposal for i was almost as averse to giving as to receiving pain beside i was a stranger and he would be my conductor the note to his lordship was accordingly written a messenger dispatched with it and while he was gone i again repeated the whole story of the watch which in all its circumstances still appeared to me very surprising and asked the reverend enoch if he could account for them he replied that the piazza where the watch was stolen was scarcely two hundred yards from the door at which the croud was assembled that the thief probably thought this croud the best hiding place that he could not remain idle and therefore had been busy with the pockets of the people and among the rest once again with mine that his terror and confusion lest he should be detected with a diamond repeater in his possession might be much greater than usual that after having delivered it to me and discovered his mistake he was very desirous to remedy the blunder and therefore watched me into the pit that seeing me seated he then went in search of his companions and that what afterward followed was first their usual mode of stealing watches and when that failed a more vigorous attempt to recover a prize of uncommon value these suppositions which enochs acquaintance with the town and not the efforts of his imagination had suggested made the history of the event tolerably probable and i suppose were very like the truth the messenger quickly returned with a note containinghis lordships compliments he was then at home and if i should happen to be at leisure would be very glad to see me immediately i told you said enoch that if you meant to play the sure game you must mention the repeater my vanity would willingly have given another interpretation to his lordships civility and have considered it as personal to myself but the philosophy of my vanity did not in this case appear to be quite so sound as that of the reverend enoch and i was mute neither i nor enoch were desirous of delay and in a few minutes we were in bruton street where the doors opened to us as if the hinges had all been lately oiled his lordship who had acquired much more of the man of the world that is of bowing and smiling than when i first saw him at oxford instantly knew me received me and my friend graciously and easily entered into conversation with us the first thing i did was to restore him his watch and tell him the whole story with the comments of the constable and of the reverend enoch he laughed as much as lords in general laugh said it was a whimsical accident and paid me a number of polite compliments and thanks treated the watch as a trinket which as he recollected had not cost him more than three hundred guineas but the bauble had been often admired he was partial to it and was very glad it was thus recovered to this succeeded the smiles and contortions of enoch to make himself agreeable his endeavours were very assiduous indeed and to me very ridiculous but his lordship seemed to receive his cringing and abject flattery as a thing rather of course and expected than displeasing or contemptible among other conversation his lordship did not fail to inquire if i were come to make any stay in town and what my intentions and plan were on being informed of these he professed a great desire to serve me and added that a thought had struck him which perhaps might be agreeable to me if so it would give him great pleasure he wished to have a friend who during an hour of a morning might afford him conversation perhaps he might occasionally trouble him to commit a few thoughts to writing but that might be as it happened if i would come and reside in his house and act in this friendly manner with him he should be gratified and i not injured enochs open eyes twinkled with joy sparkle they could not he foresaw through my means intercourse with a peer and perhaps patronage he was ready to answer for me and could not restrain his tongue from protesting that it was a prodigiously liberal friendly and honourable offer i had not forgotten his lordships former jolly tutor the terms on which they had lived or the treatment to which this tutor had occasionally submitted yet i was not displeased with the proposal i spurned at the idea of any such submission but the character of his lordship seemed changed and changed it certainly was though i then knew not why or to what nor was it supposed that i was to act as his menial i therefore expressed my sense of his lordships civility and owned the situation would be acceptable to me as i was not at present encumbered with riches and living in london i found was likely to prove expensive i had desired to have a genteel apartment and enoch had told me that one had been hired for me at a guinea and a half per week at which i had been not a little startled the secret of want of wealth a very cunning man would have concealed a very wise man though from other motives would have told it with the same unaffected simplicity that i did still the transports of enoch at his lordships bounty were inexhaustible they put me to the blush but whether it was at being unable to keep pace with him in owning this load of obligations or at his impertinent acknowledgment of feelings for me of which i was unconscious is more than i can tell for his part he did but speak on the behalf of his young friend i had come well recommended to him and he had already conceived a very singular affection for me he had no doubt but that i should be prodigiously grateful to his lordship for all favours his good advice should certainly never be wanting and patrons like his lordship could not by any possible efforts be too humbly and dutifully served i did but feebly second this submissive sense of obligation and these overflowing professions for favours not yet received luckily however he talked so fast and was so anxious to recommend himself that i had scarcely an opportunity to put in a word he took all the trouble upon himself i ought to have mentioned that before the proposal was made his lordship had taken care to inquire if i understood the living languages he spoke a few sentences in french to me himself and attempted to do the same in italian but succeeded in the latter very indifferently my answers satisfied him that i was no stranger to these studies the fact was his lordship found it necessary to keep a secretary to aid him in his politics not only to write but to think and i afterward learned from his valet that he had allowed a hundred a year to one who had left his service that very day his lordship was doubtless therefore well satisfied with the meeting of this morning in which he not only recovered his diamond repeater but rewarded the youth who brought it by suffering him to do the same business gratis for which he had before been obliged to pay chapter iv memento of an old acquaintance gentility alarmed the family of enoch musical raptures and cardtable good breeding by the order of his lordship two chairmen with a horse were dispatched for my effects and possession was given me of the apartment occupied by my predecessor in this apartment a trunk which he had not removed was left and on it was a direction to henry turl this excited my curiosity i inquired of the valet and from his description was confirmed in the conjecture that my quondam school and college acquaintance turl had been his lordships late secretary though at college i had considered his opinions as dangerous yet every thing that i had heard of his behaviour challenged respect i scarcely knew at present whether i wished to have any intercourse with him or not but the high opinion i had of his understanding made me hope well of his morals and wish him prosperity my good fortune was in danger of being immediately disturbed by an incident which to me was very unexpected instead of being treated as the friend and companion of his lordship when the dinner hour came an invitation was sent up to me by the housekeeper from which i understood i was to dine at what is called the second table at this time i had much pride and little philosophy and a more effectual way to pique that pride could not have been found i returned a civil answer the purport of which was that i should dine out and immediately wrote a short note to his lordship informing him that i took it for granted his housekeeper had mistaken his intentions and did not understand the terms on which i presumed i was to live in his lordships house his lordship had said he wished me to be his companion and this distinction would certainly make me unfit to be the companion of his housekeeper the discharging my conscience of thus much vanity gave me immediate relief and was productive of the effect intended his lordship took the hint my spirited letter gave and feigned ignorance of his housekeepers proceeding my appearance person and understanding he thought would not disgrace his table at which consequently i was afterward permitted to take my seat in the evening i went by appointment to visit at the house of the reverend enoch when i was introduced by him to his wife and daughter as a very accomplished young gentleman an undergraduate of oxford intended for the church of prodigious connexions recommended to a bishop patronized by an earl and his very particular good friend i bowed and the ladies curtsied mrs ellis too had studied the art of making herself agreeable but in a very different way from enoch her mode was by engaging in what are called parties learning the private history of all her acquaintance and retailing it in such a manner as might best gratify the humours prejudices and passions of her hearers she had some shrewdness much cunning and made great pretensions to musical and theatrical taste and the belles lettres she spoke both french and italian ill enough but sufficiently to excite the admiration of those who understood neither she had lately persuaded enoch to make a trip with the whole family to paris and she returned with a very ample cargo of information all very much at the disposal of her inquisitive friends her daughter eliza was mammas own child she had an immense deal of taste no small share of vanity and a tongue that could not tire she had caught the mingled cant of enoch and her mamma repeated the names of public people and public places much oftener than her prayers and was ready to own with no little self complacency that all her acquaintance told her she was prodigious severe in addition to these shining qualities she was a musical amateur of the first note she could make the jacks of her harpsichord dance so fast that no understanding ear could keep pace with them and her master signor gridarini affirmed every time he came to give her a lesson that among all the dilettanti in europe there was not so great a singer as herself the most famous of the public performers scarcely could equal her in the bravura she astonished in the cantabile she charmed her maestoso was inimitable and her adagios oh they were ravishing killing she indeed openly accused him of flattering her but signor gridarini appealed both to his honour and his friends the best judges in europe who as she well knew all said the same of personal beauty she herself was satisfied that the gods had kindly granted her a full share tis true her stature was dwarfish but then she had so genteel an air her staymaker was one of the ablest in town her complexion could not but be to her mind for it was of her own making the only thing that she could not correct to her perfect satisfaction was a something of a cast with her eyes which especially when she imitated enoch in making herself agreeable was very like squinting not but that the thought squinting itself a pleasing kind of blemish nay there were instances in which she scarcely knew if it could be called a blemish by these two ladies i was received with no little distinction the mother recollected the earl and the bishop the daughter surveyed my person with which she was almost as well satisfied as with her own i heard her tell her female acquaintance during the evening that she thought me immense well bred and that in her opinion i was prodigious handsome and when they smiled she added that she spoke with perfect song fro and merely as a person of some critical taste i could indeed have corrected her english grammar and her french pronunciation but i was not at this time so fastidious as to accuse her of any mistake in judgment in the opinion she gave of me my musical talents gained me additional favour miss eliza was quite in raptures to hear that i could accompany her in a concerto or take a part in an italian duet she vowed and protested again to her friends that i was a most accomplished charming man she spoke aside but i was rather remarkably quick of hearing that evening she proposed a lesson of kozeluchs immediately i should play the violin accompaniment and her papa as it was very easy would take the bass all voices for there was a prodigious large party by this time were loud in their assent every body was sure before any body heard it would be monstrous fine so there was no refusing the fiddles were tuned the books were placed the candles were snuffed the chord was struck and off we went allegro con strepito we obeyed the composers commands and played with might and main during the first thirty or forty bars till the obligato part came in which miss was to exhibit her powers she then with all the dignity of a maestro di capella directed two intersecting rays full at enoch and called aloud piano after which casting a gracious smile to me as much as to say i did not mean you sir she heaved up an attitude with her elbows gave a short cough to encourage herself and proceeded her fears give her no embarrassment thought i and all will be well i could not have been more mistaken the very first difficult passage she came to shewed me she was an ignorant pretender time tune and recollection were all lost i was obliged to be silent in the accompaniment for i knew as little what was become of her as she herself did enoch knew no more than either of us but he kept strumming on he was used to it and his ears were not easily offended she certainly intended to have been very positive but was at last obliged to come to a full stop and again casting an indignant squint at her father she exclaimed lord sir i declare there is no keeping with you no nor with you neither said enoch will you have the goodness to begin again mr trevor continued she i saw no remedy she was commander in chief and i obeyed we might have begun again and again to eternity had we stopped every time she failed but as i partly perceived my silence in the accompaniment instead of continuing to make a discordant noise with enoch and herself had chiefly disconcerted her i determined to rattle away my ears were never more completely flayed but what could be done miss panted for fame and the company wanted music we had the good luck to find one another out at the last bar and gave a loud stroke to conclude with which was followed by still louder applause it was vastly fine excessive charming miss was a ravishing performer and every soul in the room was distractingly fond of music there said enoch taking off his spectacles there ladies now you hear things done as they should be not satisfied with this specimen we must next sing an italian trio for enoch like miss could sing as well as he could play but it was the old story over again things done as they should be the company by this time were pretty well satisfied though their praise continued to be extravagant miss however would fain have treated them with a little more and when she found me obstinate in my negative she with a half reprimanding half applauding tap with her fan for we were by this time very familiar acquaintance told me that great performers were always tired sooner than their auditors while miss had been thus busied her mamma had not been idle she and her friends who were so fond of music had frequently in full gabble joined the con strepito chorus and quite completed that kind of harmony in which our concert excelled add to which there was the rattling of the card tables placed ready by her order during the music for she was too good an economist to lose time but she professed to have a delicate ear enoch had taught her to know when things were done as they should be the concert being ended and the cards ready i was invited to draw for partners one elderly lady was particularly pressing i excused myself and miss said pouting to her mamma but looking traverse at the elderly lady law mamma you are so teazing we have made up a little conversazione party of our own and you want to spoil it by taking mr trevor from us i declare continued she turning her back on the card tables and lowering her voice that old tabby is never contented but when she is at her honours and her tricks but let her alone she never goes away a loser she has more tricks than honours i presume it was not the first time that she had said this good thing at least it was not the last for i heard it every time afterward that the parties met on a like occasion the old lady however contrived before they broke up to weary me into compliance i played a single rubber lost a guinea and was asked for my half crown to put under the candlestick i say asked for i have before observed that i came up to london ignorant of every point of good breeding i could not have surmised that the six packs of half dirty cards were to be subscribed for by the company at half a crown a head chapter v politics and patriotism of a lord a grand undertaking sublime effusions or who but i politics and taste of enoch the honey changed to gall or rules for fine writers the next day about noon his lordship sent his compliments informing me he should be glad of my company i hastened to him eager to have an opportunity privately to display before a lord my knowledge wit and understanding after a short introductory dialogue his lordship turned the conversation on politics and it so happened that though my ideas on this subject were but feeble and ill arranged yet it had not wholly escaped my attention while i was at oxford the want of a parliamentary reform had agitated the whole nation and was too real and glaring an evil not to be convincing to a young and unprejudiced mind the extension of the excise laws had likewise produced in me strong feelings of anger and the enormous and accumulating national debt had been described to me as a source of imminent absolute and approaching ruin these and similar ideas though all more or less crude i detailed and concluded my creed with asserting my conviction that government used corrupt and immoral means and that these were destructive of the end which it meant to obtain his lordship was quite in raptures to hear me and declared he could not have expected such sound doctrine from so young a man yes mr trevor continued he government is indeed corrupt it has opposed me in three elections one for a county the others for two popular boroughs the opposition has cost me fifty thousand pounds and i lost them all time was when the minister might have made me his friend but i am now his irreconcilable enemy and i will hang upon his skirts and never quit him no not for a moment till he is turned out of office with disgrace he ought not to have angered me for i and my friends kept aloof he knew i did and he mightbut now i have openly joined the opposition and nothing less than his ruin shall satisfy me i am exceedingly happy mr trevor to find you reason so justly on these subjects and to say the truth i shall be very glad of your assistance i answered his lordship that i should be equally glad if i could contribute to the good government and improvement of mankind by correcting their present errors and that the vices i had mentioned and every other vice that i could discover i should always think it my duty to oppose that answered his lordship is right mr trevor you speak my own sentiments opposition strong severe and bitter is what i am determined on your principles and mine are the same and i am resolved he shall repent of having made me his enemy we will communicate our thoughts to each other and as you are a young man whose talents were greatly esteemed at college and who know how to place arguments in a striking form i have no doubt of our success i will make him shake in his seat his lordship then drew a whole length picture first of his own griefs and next of the present state of representation and the known dependence and profligacy of the ministers adherents which highly excited my indignation my heart exulted in the correction which i was determined to bestow on them all and i made not the least doubt but that i should soon be able to write down the minister load his partizans with contempt and banish such flagitious proceedings from the face of the earth with these all sufficient ideas of myself and many professions of esteem and friendship from the earl i retired to begin a series of letters that were to rout the minister reform the world and convey my fame to the latest posterity i had already perused junius as a model of style had been enraptured with his masculine ardor and had no doubt but that the hour was now come in which he was to be rivaled i could not disguise from myself that the motives of his lordship were not of the purest kind but i had formed no expectations in favour of his morals and if the end at which he aimed was a good one his previous mistakes must be pardoned he had engaged me in a delightful task had given me an opportunity of exerting my genius and of publishing my thoughts to the world and i sat down to my labours with transport and zeal so copious was my elocution that in less than four hours i had filled eight pages of paper two of which at least were greek and latin quotations from aristotle demosthenes and cicero i meant to astonish mankind with my erudition all shall acknowledge said i that a writer of wit energy and genius is at last sprung up one who is profoundly skilled too in classical learning my whole soul was bent on saying strong things fine things learned things pretty things good things wise things and severe things never was there more florid railing my argument was a kind of pitiful jonas and my words were the whale in which it was swallowed up i was quite enamoured of my performance and was impatient for twelve oclock the next day that his lordship might admire it in the mean time to allay my insatiable thirst of praise i took it to upright enoch when the reverend little man heard that i was employed by his lordship to write on affairs of government he declared it as a thing decided that my fortune was made but he dropped his under lip when told that i had attacked the ministerwas prodigiously sorrythat was the wrong sideministers paid well for being praised but they gave nothing except fine imprisonment and pillory for blame i heard him with contempt but was too eager in my thirst of approbation to make any reply except by urging him to read he put on his spectacles and began but blundered so wretchedly that i was soon out of patience and taking the paper from him began to read myself no one will doubt but that he was the first to be tired however he said it was fine and was quite surprised to hear me read greek with such sonorous volubility for his part it was long since he had read such authors to which i sarcastically yielded my ready assent he had partly forgotten them he said indeed answered i my tone signified he never knew thembut you think the composition good do you notoh it is fine prodigiously fine fine was the word and with fine i was obliged to be satisfied as for prodigious it sometimes had meaning and sometimes none it depended on emphasis and action i knew indeed that he was no great orator otherwise i should have expected an eulogium that might have rivaled the french academy the odes of boileau or even my own composition i was still hungry my vanity wanted more food much more though i knew not where to seek it to write down a minister was such a task and i had begun it in so sublime a style that rest i could not though it was with great difficulty having done with enoch that i could escape from miss and her mamma they were dressed to go to a party and they insisted that i should go with them it would give their friends such monstrous pleasure and they should all be so immense happy that go i must but their rhetoric was vain i was upon thorns there were no hopes that the party would listen to my manuscript and as i could not read it to others i must go home and read it to myself as i was going miss followed me to the door called up one of her significant traverse glances and told me she was sure i was a prodigious rake but no wonder all the fine men were rakes i returned to my chamber read again and again added new flowers remembered new quotations and inserted new satire enoch had told me it was fine yet i never could think it was fine enough night came but with it little inclination in me to sleep and in the morning i was up and at work reading correcting and embellishing my letter before i could well distinguish a word about nine oclock while i was rehearsing aloud in the very heat of oratory two chairmen knocked at my door and interrupted my revery they were come to take away the trunk of turl the thought struck me and i immediately inquiredis the gentleman himself here i was answered in the affirmative and i requested one of the men to go and inform him that an old acquaintance was above who would be very glad to speak a word with him mr turl came was surprised to see me and as i received him kindly answered me in the same tone at college he had acquired the reputation of a scholar a good critic and a man of strong powers of mind the discovery of a diamond mine would not have given me so much pleasure as the meeting him at this lucky moment he was the very person i wanted he was a judge and i should have praise as much as i could demand the beauties of my composition would all be as visible to him as they were to myself they were too numerous too strong too striking to escape his notice they would flash upon him at every line would create astonishment inspire rapture and hold him in one continual state of acclamation and extacy i requested him to sit down apologized told him i had a favour to ask took up my manuscript smiled put it in his hand stroked my chin and begged him to read and tell me its faults i had a perfect dependence on his good taste and nobody could be more desirous of hearing the truth and correcting their errors than i was nobody i was surprised to observe that he felt some reluctance and attempted to excuse himself but i was too importunate and the devil of vanity was too strong in me to be resisted i pleaded with great eloquence and much more truth than i myself suspected how necessary it was in order to attain excellence that men should communicate with each other should boldly declare their opinions and patiently listen to reproof thus urged by arguments which he knew to be excellent and hoping from my zeal that i knew the same he complied took out his pencil and began his task he went patiently through it without any apparent emotion or delay except frequently to make crosses with his pencil never was mortal more amazed than i was at his incomprehensible coldness has he no feeling said i is he dead no token of admiration no laughter no single pause of rapture it was astonishing beyond all belief having ended he put down the manuscript and said not a word this was a mortification not to be supported speak he must i endured his silence perhaps half a minute perhaps a whole one but it was an age i am afraid mr turl said i you are not very well pleased with what you have read the tone of my voice the paleness of my lips and the struggling confusion of my eyes sufficiently declared my state of mind and he made no answer my irritability increased what sir said i is it so contemptible a composition as to be wholly unworthy your notice i communicated much of the torture which i felt but collecting himself he looked at me with some compassion and much stedfastness and answeredi most sincerely wish mr trevor that what i have to say since you require me to speak were exactly that which you expected i should say i confess it gives me some pain to perceive that you mistook your own motives when you desired me to read and mark what i might think to be faults you imagined there were no faults forgetting that no human effort is without them the longer you write the less you will be liable to the error of that suppositionperhaps sir you discover nothing but faultsfar the contrary i have discovered the first great quality of genius this was a drop of reviving cordial and i eagerly askedwhat is thatenergy but like the courage of don quixote it is ill directed it runs a tilt at sheep and calls them giants go on sir said i continue your allegoryits beauties are courtezans its enchanted castles pitiful hovels and its mambrinos helmet is no better than a barbers bason but pray sir be candid and point out all its defectsalli am sorry to observe mr trevor that my candour has already been offensive to your feelings if we would improve our faculties we must not seek unmerited praise but resolutely listen to truthwhy sir should you suppose i seek unmerited praise he made no reply and i repeated my requisition that he should point out all the defects of my manuscript once more all all the defects mr trevor said he are many of them such as are common to young writers but some of them are peculiar to writers whose imagination is strong and whose judgment is unformed paradoxical as it may seem it is a disadvantage to your composition that you have the right side of the question diffuse and unconnected arguments a style loaded with epithets and laborious attempts in the writer to display himself are blemishes that give less offence when employed to defend error than when accumulated in the cause of truth which is forgotten and lost under a profusion of ornaments the difficulties of composition resemble those of geometry they are the recollection of things so simple and convincing that we imagine we never can forget them yet they are frequently forgotten at every step and in every sentence there is one best and clearest way of stating a proposition and that alone ought to be chosen yet how often do we find the same argument repeated and repeated and repeated with no variety except in the phraseology in developing any thought we ought not to encumber it by trivial circumstances we ought to say all that is necessary and not a word more we ought likewise to say one thing at once and that concluded to begin another we certainly write to be understood and should therefore never write in a language that is unknown to a majority of our readers the rule will apply as well to the living languages as to the dead and its infringement is but in general a display of the authors vanity epithets unless they increase the strength of thought or elucidate the argument ought not to be admitted of similes metaphors and figures of every kind the same may be affirmed whatever does not enlighten confuses there are two extremes against which we ought equally to guard not to give a dry skeleton bones without flesh nor an imbecile embryo flesh without bones i understand you sir what you have read is an imbecile embryoyour importunity mr trevor and my desire to do you service have extorted an opinion from me i must not shrink from the truth in confirmation of what i have already said i must add that your composition is strong in language but weak in argumentha much declamation little thought he was once more silent for a few seconds and then assuming a less serious tone endeavoured to turn the conversation by inquiring if i were come to reside in london and to live with his lordship i took care to inform him that i considered myself as a visitor in the house and that i meant to take my degrees be ordained and devote myself to the church i then attempted to bring him back to the manuscript but ineffectually he seemed determined to say no more this silence was painful to both of us and after i had inquired where he lived and made some professions which formal civility wrung from me that i should be glad to see him again we parted we were neither of us entirely satisfied with the other and i certainly much the least the lesson however did me infinite service the film was in part removed from my eyes in my own despite i read again but with a very different spirit his marks in the margin painfully met my eye with endless repetition the rules he had been delivering were strong in my memory and i frequently discovered their application after the clear statement he had given of them i could but seldom bring myself to doubt of their justice the result was i immediately went to work and disgusted with my first performance began another in truth my too much confidence and haste had made me guilty of many mistakes which i knew to be such the moment my vanity had been a little sobered into common sense i had often written before and perhaps never so ill i now arranged my thoughts omitted my quotations discarded many of my metaphors shortened my periods simplified my style reduced the letter to one fourth of its former length and finished the whole by one oclock his lordship was not so fastidious a critic as i thought turl had been he was delighted with my performance it is true he made some corrections and additions in places where i had not been so personal and acrimonious against the minister as his feelings required but as he accompanied them with praise i readily submitted and thus improved my first political essay was committed to the press chapter vi further efforts of critical improvement doubts of a serious kind suggested more politics and new acquaintance a dissertation on rakes the critical precepts of turl were still tingling in my ears and as i meant to shew the bishop some of the sermons that i had written or in other words as many as he should be willing to read they underwent an immediate revisal though in general they were less faulty than my posthaste political effort yet i found quite enough to correct and was so far reconciled to the benefit i had derived from turl as to wish to meet him again in two or three days therefore after having expunged interlined and polished one of my best performances till i was tolerably well satisfied with it i visited him at his lodgings i then owned to him that i had not received the castigation he gave me quite so patiently as i ought to have done but i had nevertheless profited by it and was come to request more favours of the same kind though i could not but acknowledge i had hopes that my present performance was not quite so defective as the former he received me kindly but took the manuscript i offered him with what i again thought great coldness he read two or three pages without as before drawing his pencil upon me and then paused you have enjoined me a task said he mr trevor which i do not know how to execute to my own satisfaction you are not aware of the truth and if i tell it you i shall offendnay sir i beg you will not spare me speakyou have not explicitly defined to yourself your own motives you think you are come in search of improvement in reality you are come in search of praisenot unless praise be my duewhich you are convinced it isyou see deeply into the human heart mr turlif i do not i am ill qualified to criticise literary compositionsand you think my divinity no better than my politicsyou do not state the question as i could wish divinity i must acknowledge is not a favourite subject with mei have heard as muchi am too sincere a friend to morality to encourage dissention quarrels and enmity concerning things which whoever may pretend to believe no one can prove that he understands as a composition from the little i have read i believe your sermon to be very superior to your letter but from the exposition of your subject i perceive it treats on points of faith asserts church authority and stigmatises dissent with reprobation you tell me you are recommended to a bishop with him it will do you service to me it is unintelligible his inclination to heresy or which is the same thing his difference with me in opinion piqued me on this occasion even more than the unsparing sincerity of his remarks i answered i was sorry he did not agree with me on subjects which i was convinced were so momentous and owned it was for that reason that while he remained at the university i had avoided his society he replied he doubted if it were right to avoid the vicious and the precaution which he himself thought necessary on all such occasions was to inquire whether in accusing another of vice he were not himself guilty of error he considered his own opinions as eternally open to revision and if any man were to tell him that two and two did not make four he should have no objection to reexamine the facts with his opponent on which his own previous conviction had been founded we ought to be ardent in the defence of truth but we ought likewise to be patient and benevolent i made some attempts to convince him of the impiety of his scepticism while he remained cool but unshaken and i left him with mingled emotions of pity for his adherence to doctrines so damnable and of admiration at the amenity and philanthropy with which they were delivered thus catechised in criticism and theology the ardour of my pursuits would perhaps have found some temporary abatement had it not been rouzed anew my letter had appeared signed themistocles his lordships known political cognomen it was the first in which he had declared openly against the minister his sentiments in consequence of this letter were become public and many of the minority desirous of fixing in their interest one whom they had before considered rather as their opponent than their friend came to visit and pay him their compliments the resolute manner in which i had purposely and uniformly shewn him that i must be treated as his equal had produced its intended effect i was dismissed with no haughty nod but came and went as i pleased and frequently bore a part in their conversation i had still an open ear for vanity which was not a little tickled by the frequent terms of applause and admiration with which themistocles was quoted his lordship did me the justice to inform his visitors that the letter was written by me we had indeed conversed together they were his thoughts his principles and it was true he had made such additions and corrections as were necessary then proceeding to invectives against the minister he there dropped me and my share of merit the mortification of this was the greater because truth and falsehood were so mingled that however inclined i might be i knew not which way to do myself justice but the praise which they bestowed wholly on his lordship and which his lordship was willing to receive i very unequivocally took to myself it gave me animation the pen was seldom out of my hand and the exercise was sanative mean while enoch and his agreeable family who knew so well when things were as they should be were not neglected i was careful to inform them of my rising fame and my new friends for so i accounted all those who paid their court to his lordship and his lordships favourite were individually named characterised and celebrated the family heard me with avidity each desirous of having a share in a lord and the friends of a lord enoch told me i was in high luck mamma affirmed i was a fine writer and miss was sure i must be a monstrous favourite i was a favourite with every body and for her part she did not wonder at it not but it is a great pity added she aside that you are such a rake mr trevor this repeated charge very justly alarmed my morality and i very seriously began a refutation but in vain i might say what i would she could see very plainly i was a prodigious rake and nothing could convince her to the contrary though she had heard that your greatest rakes make the best husbands perhaps it might be true but she did not think she could be persuaded to make the venture she did not know what might happen to be sure though she really did not think she could she could not conceive how it was but some how or another she always found something agreeable about rakes it was a great pity they should be rakes but she verily believed the women loved them and encouraged them in their seducing arts for her part she would keep her fingers out of the fire as long as she could but if it were her destiny to love a rake what could she do nobody could help being in love and it would be very hard indeed to call what one cannot help a crime in this key would she continue without let or delay whenever she had me to herself till some accident came to my relief for the philosophy of miss eliza on the subjects of love and rakishness was exhaustless and though it could not always convince it could puzzle i often knew not how to behave such a warfare did she sometimes kindle between inclination and morality my resource was in silence hers in talking notwithstanding her very great prudence i suspect there might have been danger had i not been guarded by the three fold shield of an unfashionable sense of moral right strong aspirings after clerical purity and the unfaded remembrance of the lovely chaste olivia chapter vii enoch made acquainted with more of my perfections which by his advice are brought to market a bishops parlour the bishop himself or a true pillar of the church heretical times and arduous undertakings new honours awaited me my lord the bishop was come to town of which enoch had providently taken care to have instant notice among the other good things i had related of myself i had not forgotten to tell enoch of the several sermons i had written nor to shew him that which i had corrected and taken to turl i had another attainment of which too i did not neglect to inform him for it was one of which i was not a little proud much of my time during my residence at oxford had been devoted to the study of polemical divinity or the art of abuse extracted from the scriptures the fathers and the different doctors of different faiths the points that had most attracted my attention were the disputes concerning the athanasian creed and the thirtynine articles on both these subjects i had made many extracts many remarks and collected many authorities for i had subscribed the thirtynine articles and consequently the athanasian creed and what i had done it became me to defend this is the maxim of all people who think it more worthy their dignity to be consistent in error than to forget self revere truth and retract i had beside been well educated for this kind of pertinacity the rector when living was so sternly orthodox as to hold the slightest deviation from church authority in abhorrence what he meant by church authority or what any rational man can mean it might be difficult to define except that church authority and orthodox opinions are with each individual those precise points which that individual makes a part of his creed but as unfortunately for church authority no two individuals ever had or ever can have the same creed church authority is like a body in motion no man can tell where it resides at that time i thought otherwise and then as now did not refrain from speaking what i thought in addition to the other arts of pleasing which the industrious enoch had acquired that of maintaining orthodox doctrines in the presence of orthodox people was one he was glad to find me so deep a proficient for to what market could we so profitably carry such ware as to the levee of a bishop the little man scrupulously attentive to whatever might advance me or him in the good graces of the right reverend advised me to put my corrected sermon in my pocket which with or without his advice i suspect i should have done these particulars said the provident enoch must every one of them be told but be you under no concern leave all that to me merit you know is always modest though i had not on this occasion the courage to contradict him i doubted the truth of his apothegm the good qualities i could discover in myself i wished to have noticed and if nobody else would notice them i must like other people i have too frequently been desirous to make my principles bend to my practice though the door was the door of a bishop and we had the text in our favour knock and it shall be opened yet enoch no doubt remembering his own good breeding was too cautious to ask if his lordship were at home he bade the servant say that a clergyman of the church of england and a young gentleman from oxford bringing letters from the president of college and other dignitaries of the university requested an audience the message was delivered and we were ushered into a parlour the walls of which were decorated with the heads of the english archbishops surrounding hogarths modern midnight conversation there was not a book in the room but there were six or eight newspapers with these we amused ourselves for some time till the approach of the bishop was announced by the creaking of his shoes the rustling of his silk apron and the repeated hems with which he collected his dignity the moment i saw him his presence reminded me of my old acquaintance the highfed brawny doctors of oxford his legs were the pillars of hercules his body a brewers butt his face the sun rising in a red mist we have been told that magnitude is a powerful cause of the sublime and if this be true the dimensions of his lordship certainly had a copious and indisputable claim to sublimity he seemed born to bear the whole hierarchy his mighty belly heaved and his cheeks swelled with the spiritual inflations of church power he fixed his open eyes upon me and surveyed me from top to toe i too made my remarks he is a true son of the church said ithe libertine sarcasm was instantly repelled and my train of ideas was purified from such irreverend heresyhe is an orthodox divine a pillar of truth a christian bishop thought is swift and man assents and recants before his eye can twinkle i delivered my credentials and he seated himself in a capacious chair substantially fitted to receive and sustain its burden of divinity and began to read my letters were from men high in authority purplerobed and rotund supporters of our good alma mater and met with all due respect clearing his sonorous throat of the obstructing phlegm with which there seemed to be danger that he should sometime or other be suffocated he welcomed me to london rejoiced to hear that his good friends of the university were well and professed a desire to oblige them by serving me i briefly explained to him my intention of devoting myself to the church which he highly commended and enoch who far from being idle all this time had been acting over his agreeable arts soon found an opportunity of informing the right reverend father in god what powerful connexions i had how well skilled i was in classical learning how deeply i was read in theology how orthodox my opinions were and to give a climax which most delighted me added that young as i was i had already obtained the character of a prodigious fine writer he did not indeed say all this in a breath he took his own time for his oratory was always hide bound but he took good care to have it all said his secret for being eloquent consisted rather in action than in language and now with the spiritual lord as before with the temporal he accompanied his speech with those insinuating gesticulations which he had rarely found unsuccessful he had such a profound reverence for the episcopacy bowing to the ground was so bitter an enemy to caveling innovators grinning malignity had so full a sense of his own inferiority contorting his countenance like a monkey begging for gingerbread and humbled himself so utterly in the presence of the powers that be that while he spoke the broad cheeks of the bishop swelled true high church satisfaction dilating and playing like a pair of forge bellows my modesty was his next theme and with it was coupled the sermons i had written not omitting the one i had brought in my pocket but his young friend was so bashful was so fearful of intruding on his lordship as indeed every one must be who had any sense of what is always due to our superiors yet as the doctrines of his young friend were so sound and he was so true a churchman it might perhaps happen that his lordship would have the condescension to let one of his chaplains read him the sermon of his young friend he was sure it would do him service with his lordship not but he was almost afraid he had taken an unpardonable liberty in intruding so far on his lordships invaluable time and patience evil communication corrupts good manners i could not equal the adulation of enoch but when i afterward came to canvas my own conduct i found i had followed my leader in his tracks of servility quite far enough his lordship to indicate his approbation of our duplex harangue graciously accepted the sermon to peruse informed me of his day and hour of seeing company and invited me and my friend to become his visitors with which mark of holy greeting enoch and i well pleased were about to depart the retailer of pews recollected himself no man could be more desirous than enoch not to neglect an opportunity after more bows cringes and acknowledgments not to be expressed he requested permission to mention to his lordship that his young friend had made a particular branch of theology his study of which he thought it his duty to acquaint his lordship in these days of doubt rank infidelity and abominable schism the danger of the church was felt by every good and pious divine and her most active defenders were her best friends his lordship would therefore perhaps be glad to hear that mr trevor had particularly devoted himself to polemics was intimately acquainted with the writings of the fathers and the known orthodox divines and was qualified to be a powerful advocate and champion of conformity indeed said his lordship with open ears and eyes i am very glad to hear it have you written any thing mr trevor on these subjectsi have made many references memorandums and preparatory remarks my lordthen you intend to writei saw the satisfaction with which the affirmative was likely to be received and boldly answered i do my lordi am very glad to hear it i am very glad to hear itshall i do myself the honour to bring my manuscript as soon as it is written and consult your lordships judgmentby all means mr trevor by all means these are weighty matters the church was never more virulently and scandalously attacked than she has been lately the most heretical and damnable doctrines are daily teeming from the press not only infidels and atheists but the vipers which the church has nurtured in her own bosom are rising up to sting her her canons are brought into contempt her tests trampled on and her dignitaries daily insulted the hierarchy is in danger the bishops totter on their bench we are none of us safe to the reality of this picture i readily assented but said i my lord we have the instruments of defence in our own power we have the scriptures the fathers the doctors of our church and all the authorities for us the only thing we want is a hero qualified to bear this cumbrous armour and to wield these massy weapons the words that hero am i quivered on my tongue and if my teeth had not resolutely denied them a passage out they would have bolted his lordship agreed that the truth was all on our side and for his part he wished it to be thundered forth so as at once to crush and annihilate all heretics and their damnable doctrines since i am encouraged by your lordship said i this shall be the first labour of my life and though i grant it is herculean i have little doubt of executing it effectually his lordship though not quite so certain of my success as i was in the name of the church again gave his hearty assent and we with smiles thanks and bows in abundance took our leave enoch with a fine pisgah prospect of the land of promise and i another caleb bearing away the luscious grapes i had been gathering on which my fancy licentiously banqueted chapter viii beatific visions irons enough in the fire egotism and oratory hints on elocution this sudden elevation to fame and fortune for i had not the smallest doubt that so it was this doubleelection of me who alone perhaps had the power to execute such mighty tasks was more than even i sanguine as my expectations had been could have hoped to rout politicians and extirpate heresy to pull down a minister and become the buttress of the church to reform the state and establish the hierarchy was indeed a glorious office honour and power were suspended over my head i had but to cut the thread and they would drop and crown me but which should i choose to be the pillar of the state or the head of the hierarchy a prime minister or an archbishop the question was embarrassing and it was not quite pleasant that i could not be both i did not however forget that i had first some few labours to perform to which therefore with all my might i immediately applied my busy brain had now fit employment politics and divinity but was puzzled with which to begin the table at which i wrote was richly strewed with invectives now hurled at state profligacy now thundered against the nonconforming crew it was my determination to spare neither friend nor foe i often remembered the zoilus turl and his heretical opinions and was ready to exclaim in the language of the patient job oh that his words were now written oh that they were printed in a book the dictatorial spirit of his reproof for so i characterised it had wounded me deeply and though i was not depraved enough to feel rancour i ardently wished for the means to come pen in hand to a fair combat for i feared no mortal wight if i had he perhaps would have been the man it will hereafter be seen that my wish was gratified some days were wasted in this state of indecision in which i did little except write detached thoughts and contemplate the sublime and beautiful of my subjects till i was rouzed from this lethargy of determination by a hint from his lordship that it was necessary for themistocles to appear abroad again lest his enemies should say he was silenced and his friends fear he was dead a second political letter was then quickly produced in which with the fear of turl before my eyes and carefully conning over his whole lesson i profited by that advice which i half persuaded myself i despised i wrote not only with more judgment but with increasing ardour and the effects were visible the second composition was much better than the first the dish too was seasoned to the palate of him for whom i catered i peppered salted and deviled the minister till his lordship was in raptures it was indeed dressed much more to the taste of the times than i myself was aware it was better calculated to gall annoy and alarm a corrupt system than if i had produced a better composition not only the satellites but the leading men of opposition began now to pay their respects to his lordship in his company i had the pleasure of meeting several of them and of being frequently surprised by the readiness of their wit the acuteness of their remarks their depth of penetration comprehensive powers and fertility of genius mr himself came occasionally to visit his lordship so strenuous and sincere did he appear to be in his political conduct during this intercourse and particularly in these conversations i had sufficient opportunities of studying his lordships character he was selfish ignorant positive and proud yet he affected generosity talked on every subject as if it were familiar to him asserted his claim to the most undeviating candour and would even affect contempt for dignities and distinctions when they were not the reward of merit a nobleman might by accident possess talents but he was free to confess that the dignity of his birth could not confer them he would rather be mr mr was present than a prince of the blood he panted to distinguish himself by qualities that were properly his own and had little veneration for the false varnish of ancestry were that of any worth he had as much reason to be vain as any man perhaps in the kingdom his family came in with the conqueror at which time it was respectable it had produced men through all its branches whose names were no disgrace to history then summoning an additional quantity of candor he addedthere have been many fools among them no doubt and i am afraid some knaves but what have i to do with their knavery folly or wisdom society it is true has thought fit to recompense me for their virtues such is the order of things but i cannot persuade myself that i have received the least tarnish from any of their vices i am a friend to the philosophy of the times and would have every man measured by the standard of individual merit these liberal sentiments were delivered on the first visit he received from the leader of the minority anger self interest and the desire of revenge had induced him to adopt the same political principles anger self interest and the desire of revenge induced him to endeavour after the same elevation of mind esop is dead but his frog and his ox are still to be found at this interview the conversation turned on the last debate in both houses in which the merits of the speakers were canvassed and his lordship was severe to virulence against his opponents he had harangued in the upper house himself but as his delivery for it could not be called elocution was slow hesitating and confused no one ventured to mention his speech this was a severe mortification among his mistakes that of believing himself an accomplished orator was not the least conspicuous unable any longer to support their silence he quoted his speech himself though with that candor which was continually at the tip of his tongue he acknowledged it was possible perhaps for him to have delivered his sentiments in a more terse and pointed manner but no man said he addressing himself to mr no man knows better than you how arduous a task it is to speak with eloquence mr was dumb but the appellant and the appellee were relieved by the less delicate intervention of one of the company who declared perhaps with malicious irony he never heard his lordship to greater advantage do you think so said the peer turning to his panegyrist no i believe you are mistaken i never can satisfy myself i am so fastidious in the choice of my phrases i dislike this word i reject that and do not know where to find one that pleases me i certainly think for my part that i spoke vilely the duke indeed and lord piper both declared they never heard me greater but i cannot believe it though sir francis who went to the house purposely to hear me positively swears it was the first speech i ever made the house had seldom i believe he said never heard its equal indeed he called it divine and some affirm he is one of the best judges of elocution in the kingdom but i am sure he is wrong i know myself better i was not quite in the cue had not absolutely the true feel as i may say of my subject though i own i was once or twice a little pleased with myself there might perhaps be something like an approach to good speaking i dare not imagine it was great it was not i believe indeed i am sure it was not every thing i could have wished i am not often satisfied with others and with myself still seldomer to all this self equity and abstinence mr to whom it was again addressed made no other answer than that he had not the pleasure to hear his lordship but the candid peer in imitation of the poets of the days of louis xiv and charles ii continued to be the censurer and eulogist of himself to change the dull theme one of the company inquired what is the reason that many men who are eloquent in the closet should stammer themselves into confusion and incapacity when they attempt to speak in public to this mr returned the following acute and philosophical reply a happy choice of words after we have obtained ideas is one of the most constant labours of the person who attempts to write or speak with energy this induces a habit in the writer or speaker to be satisfied with difficulty desirous of giving the thought he has conceived its full force he never imagines the terms and epithets he has selected to be sufficiently expressive if after having accustomed himself to write it be his wish to exert his powers as a public speaker he must counteract this habit and instead of being severe in the choice of his words must resolutely accept the first that present themselves encourage the flow of thought and leave epithets and phraseology to chance neither will his intrepidity when once acquired go unrewarded the happiest language will frequently rush upon him if neglecting words he do but keep his attention confined to thoughts of thoughts too it is rather necessary for him to deliver them boldly following his immediate conceptions and explaining away inaccuracies as they occur than to seek severe precision in the first instance hesitation is the death of eloquence and precision like every other power will increase by being exercised it is doubtless understood that i do not speak of orations already written and digested but of speeches in reply in which any laboured preparation is impossible his lordship applauded the solution of the difficulty and some of the company observed the orator had given the history of his own mind chapter ix literary labours continued the thermometer of hope still rising the sermon and the disappointed cravings of vanity to carry on two controversies at the same time was certainly favourable to neither except that abuse or something very like it being the key common to both the subjects were so far in unison politics afforded me strong temptations but theology was still predominant the thirtynine articles consequently were not neglected memory was taxed my own manuscripts were examined and authorities were consulted his lordships library abounded in political information but not in theological and i had recourse to that of the british museum i did not indeed compose with all the rapidity with which i wrote my first political effusion for i had not only been rendered more cautious but exclusive of the conversations and employment which the peer afforded me a regular attention was to be paid to the levees of the bishop to these the sedulous enoch carefully accompanied me for no man pursued his own interest as far as he understood it with greater avidity circumstances were unfavourable or he would certainly have been a bishop himself learning talents and virtue might have been dispensed with but not these and the total want of patronage the bishop finding us thus continually paired one day gave me a hint that he should be glad to see me the next time alone without suspecting the motive i was careful to comply with the request and the ensuing morning the right reverend dignitary no other person being present gave me to understand that he had read my sermon with satisfaction after this and various other circumlocutory efforts and hints he at last spoke more plainly the subject was a good one and he had an inclination to deliver it himself at one of the cathedrals where he intended to preach but then it must be in consequence of a positive assurance from me that i should act with discretion he did not want sermons he had enough but this pleased him though if it were known it were a borrowed discourse especially borrowed from so young a man not yet in orders it might derogate from episcopal dignity enraptured at the fund of self approbation which i collected from all this i ardently replied i knew not how to express my sense of the honour his lordship did me that i could neither be so absurd as to offend his lordship nor so unjust as to be insensible of his favours that i held the sacerdotal character to be too sacred to suffer any man to trifle with it much less to be guilty of the crime myself and that if his lordship would oblige me by fulfilling his kind intention my lips should be irrevocably and for ever closed the honour would be an ample reward and whatever my wishes might be it was more than i could have hoped and greater perhaps than i deserved it might well be expected that at this age i should fall into a mistake common to mankind and consider secrecy as a virtue yet i think it strange that i did not soon detect the duplicity of my conduct nor imagine there was any guilt in being the agent of deceit but this proves that my morality had not yet taught me rigidly to chastise myself into truth nor had it been in the least aided by the example of the agreeable enoch perhaps i did not even at the moment suspect myself to be guilty of exaggeration notwithstanding the caution given me no sooner had i quitted the ghostly governor than i hastened to my little upright friend tell him indeed i must not honour shame principle forbade yet to keep the good news wholly secret would be to render the severe covenant cruel what could be done enoch perceived a part of my transport and reproached me for not having called to take him with me this was too fair an opportunity to miss i answered the bishop had desired to see me alone that morning indeed said the suspicious pastor what could be his lordships reason for that have i given offence no no answered i with a condescending look to calm his fears but i am not at liberty to tell you the reason there will be no breach of confidence however in my informing you that his lordship is to preach next sunday sevennight atcathedral many of the clergy as i have gathered from him are to be present and he intends to make doctrinal points the subject of his discourse he expects the attendance of his friends no doubt and i shall be there and i too said enoch though i should be obliged to pay a guinea at my chapel for a substitute this point gained and my vanity thus disburthened i left the divine man and hastened to brutonstreet to defend subscription with ten fold vigor my young laurels were ripening apace they were already in bud and were suddenly to bloom every new sprig of success burst forth in new arguments new tropes and new denunciations my margin was loaded with the names of high church heroes and my manuscript began to swell to a formidable size mean while the day of exultation came and i and enoch with miss and her mamma for i could not be satisfied with less than the whole family repaired early to the cathedral bribed the verger procured ourselves places and rallied our devout emotions as stedfastly as we could amid the indecent riot of boys the monotony of the responses and the apathy of the whole choir in spite of all my efforts and aspirings never was service more tedious the blissful minute at length came his lordship robed in solemn procession moved magnificently toward the pulpit the lawn expanded dignity was in every fold and what had been great before seemed immeasurable mamma blessed herself at the spectacle of power so spiritualized miss protested it was immense enoch was ready to fall down and worship i myself did little less than adore but it was the golden calf of my own creating it was the divine rhapsody that was immediately to burst upon and astonish the congregation the right reverend father in god began and with him very unexpectedly began my dissatisfaction his voice was thick his delivery spiritless and his candences ridiculous his soul was so overlaid with brawn and dignity that though it heaved panted and struggled it could never once get vent speaking through his apoplectic organs i could not understand myself it was a mumbling hubbub the drone of a bagpipe and the tantalizing strum strum of a hurdygurdy never was hearer more impatient to have it begin never was hearer better pleased to have it over every sentence did but increase the fever of my mind enoch himself perceived it though he could not discover the cause the orator indeed produced no emotion in him but that was not wonderful the effect was quite as good as he expected he had never i believe been entertained at a sermon in his life not even at his own he went to hear sermons sometimes because it was decorous because he was a parson and because it was his trade to preach them but never with any intention to enlarge his mind or improve his morals his lordship however had no sooner descended than he was encircled by as many flatterers as thought they had any right to approach among whom to my shame be it spoken i was one i did not indeed applaud either his discourse or his delivery i was not quite so depraved nor so wholly forgetful of the feelings he had excited but i laboured out an aukward panegyric on the important duties he had to fulfil and on the blessing it was to a nation when worthy persons were chosen to fill such high offices thus endeavouring to quiet my conscience by a quibble and with a half faced lie make him believe what it was impossible i could mean the discourse too was praised abundantly it was divine his lordship had never delivered more serious and alarming truths but though no man could be better convinced that in reality this was all fact yet coming from them i knew it to be all falsehood they could not characterize what they could not hear and the maukish adulation curdled even upon my digestive stomach the lesson however certainly did me good though it had yet but little influence upon my conduct chapter x the critic once more consulted in vain the bishop less fastidious the playhouse elbows and knees or virtue in danger mrs jordan it was possible i found under the rose be it spoken even for a bishop to be a blockhead but if that bishop had sense enough to discern my good qualities i ought not to be the most unrelenting of his censurers my defence of the articles would indeed do its own business yet to come forth under episcopal auspices was an advantage by which it was perhaps my duty to profit politics necessarily had their interval but though this created delay my manuscript was at length finished fairly recopied and impatient to be applauded again the ghost of turl haunted me not with terror no i had prepared a charm that could arrest or exorcise the evil spirit let him but fairly meet me on this ground and i would hurl defiance at him refrain i could not and to him i went i was surprised to find him at work engraving does he said i pretend to learning taste and genius yet stoop to this drudgery it was a good prefatory pretext to introduce my main design and i asked his reason for chusing such an employment he answered it was to gain a living by administering as little as he could to the false wants and vices of men and at the same time to pursue a plan on which he was intent this plan he did not voluntarily mention and as my eagerness was all nestling in my manuscript i made no further inquiry it was presently produced i have two or three times said i mr turl intruded upon you and am come to trouble you once more i have been writing a pamphlet and should again be glad to have your opinion i know before you open it you are inimical to its doctrines although i think them demonstrable but perhaps you will find arguments in it which you might not expect and if not i still should be glad to have your judgment of it as a composition it contains a defence of the thirtynine articles and indisputable proofs of the duty of religious conformity turl paused for a moment and then replied i would most willingly mr trevor comply with your desire were i not convinced of its absolute inutility the question has long been decided in my mind no arguments can prove a right in any man or any body of men to tyrannize over my conscience to find a standard to measure space and duration has hitherto baffled all attempts but to erect a standard to equalize the thoughts of the whole human race is a disposition that is both hateful and absurd should you understand the sincerity with which i speak as hostile to yourself you will do me wrong were it in my power to render you service few men would be more willing but on this occasion it certainly is not i replied with some pique to condemn any man any question or any cause unheard sir is neither the act of a christian nor of a philosopher christians mr trevor answered he are so different from each other that what the act of a christian may be is more than i know but if i may speak as a philosopher it is an immoral act to waste time in doing any one thing if there can be any other done that will contribute more to the public good do you think mr turl retorted i with indignation that making scratches with a bit of steel on a bit of copper is contributing more to the public good than the examination of a question of so much importanceno mr trevor but i repeat i have examined the question and whenever the public good shall make it my duty am willing to examine it again i am not i think so called upon at present and i therefore must decline the task i could wish you were not to leave me in anger for i assure you i have an affection for your genius but it may now be said to be in a state of ferment when it subsides if i do not mistake it will brighten and contribute i hope to the greatest and best of purposes upon my honour mr turl you are a strange person so saying i hastily put my manuscript in my pocket and took my leave offended with his peremptory refusal but half appeased by the something more than compliment with which it was concluded this market always failed me but i had one that was better calculated for my ware which was immediately open to me i hastened to the bishop displayed my precious cargo and did not fail to report its value i stated my principal arguments and boldly affirmed in conformity with the most approved leaders of our church that the articles were to be interpreted in an arminian sense and that only that is strictly in regard to the trinitarian controversy and liberally in the questions of predestination and grace nothing according to my reasoning could be more plain than that they were purposely left ambiguous in these matters by the compilers in favour to men in their public capacity who i admitted in their private were treated by them as heretics blasphemers and antichrists i allowed no quarter to those who fixed the standard of orthodoxy a hairs breadth higher or lower than i had done and attacked with a virulence that shewed i was totally blind to the lameness of my own cause the socinianizing clergy who dared subscribe in defiance of the grossness of their heresy and the calvinists who had the impudence to understand the articles in the sense in which their authors wrote them then i had a formidable army of authorities the fathers tertullian chrysostom austin jerome the famous high church men archbishops bishops deans and doctors from whitgift to waterland from rogers to rutherforth them i marshalled in dread array a host invincible the church thundered by my lips i created myself the organ of her anathemas and stood forth her selfelected champion all this i detailed to my right reverend patron who heaved his cumbrous eyebrows and gazed approbation while i spoke i was so full of myself and my subject repeated sounding names and apt quotations with such volubility and imparted my own firm conviction that this was the death blow to nonconformity with such force that the rotund man felt some small portion of sympathy looked forward to happy times and began to hope he might see the thrones dominions powers and principalities of the church reestablished and flourishing once more had this been his only motive however false his tenets he would have acted from a virtuous intention but he had another with which the reader will in due time be acquainted thus favourably prepossessed i left my manuscript for his perusal and he treated me with as much condescension as for a client so undignified he could persuade himself to assume it must not be forgotten that enoch was present this my vanity and his cunning required he played his part his congratulations of his young friend and his amazement at his lordships most prodigious goodness would have risen to ecstacy if ecstacy and enoch could possibly have been acquainted we hied back to suffolk street where our good news was as usual related i had my vanity to feed and the family had their views miss had been presented with two box tickets for the benefit of a capital performer the inimitable mrs jordan was to play the country girl and i was invited by the family and pressed by miss to accept of one of them and accompany her to the theatre i was not of a saturnine and cold complexion and fearful and guarded as miss was against rakes i had some latent apprehension that the tempter might be at hand but the playhouse was the region of delight mrs jordan i had never seen and to reject a ladys invitation was as cowardly as to refuse a gentlemans challenge i had not yet philosophy enough for either and at the appointed hour a hackney coach was in waiting and i and miss eliza accompanied by enoch who had business in the temple were driven to drury lane theatre places were kept we took our seats and the play began so intent was i on plot incident character wit and humour that had i been left unmolested i fear i should have totally forgotten miss eliza but that was no part of her plan at least it was no part of her practice our knees soon became very intimate and had frequent meetings of a very sentimental kind for she being courageous enough to advance could i be the poltroon to retreat they were however very good and loving neighbours and the language they spoke was peculiarly impressive the whole subject before us was love and intrigue and the way to torment the jealous whenever a significant passage occurred and that was very often either the feet or the legs or the elbows of miss and me came in contact our eyes too might have met but that i did not understand her traverse sailing commentaries conveyed in a whisper were continual her glances shot athwart frequently exclaimedoh la and the fan half concealing their significance often enough increased the interjection tooh fie the remarks of miss ocular and oral were very pointed and it must be owned that she was a great master of the subject whenever the tone of libertine gallantry occurred she was ready withthere thats you there there you are again well i protest was any thing ever so like that is you to a t i must tell the truth and acknowledge she created no little perturbation in my inward man my thoughts were attracted this way and hurried that the divine mrs jordan for one moment made me all her own miss insisted on having me to herself the next then came theology a dread of eve and her apple supported by a still more redoubtable combatant virtue with her fair but inflexible face and could olivia the gentle the angelic the beaming olivia such as i remembered her in days of early innocence such as i beheld her reclining in my arms as i bore her from the dangerous waters could love be the theme and she forgotten no there was not a day in which that phenomenon happened and on such occasions never why i thought on her or what i meant i seldom staid in inquire for that was a question that would have given exquisite pain had i not remembered that the world was soon to be at my command but olivia was absent and i had entered the lists with a very different heroine through play and farce there was no cessation to the combat and in spite of the fencing and warding of prudence before the curtain finally dropped i own i felt myself a little breathed the footboy was to attend with a hackney coach i led my fair thalestris into the lobby where miss elliss carriage was vociferated from mouth to mouth with as much eclat as if she had been a dutchess the footboy made his appearance but no carriage alas was there why i was partly sorry and partly glad i leave the reader to divine it rained violently and it was with difficulty that i could procure a chair into this conveyance miss ellis was handed i was left to provide for myself and a storm in the heavens fortunately relieved the storm of the passions the last flash of their lightening exhausted itself in the squeeze of the hand which i gave miss before the chairmen shut the door or rather in that which she gave me in return disappointed men often rail at accident whereas they ought to avow that what they call accident has frequently been the guardian of what they call their honour i returned home where full of the delightful ideas which the fascinating jordan had inspired i retraced those discriminating divine touches by which she communicates such repeated and uncommon pleasure she is indeed a potent sorceress but not even her incantations could exclude the august and virgin spirit of olivia from again rising to view as for miss eliza keep her but at a hairbreadth distance and she was utterly harmless chapter xi possibilities are infinite or great events in embrio a bishops dinner and a deans devotion a discovery clerical conversation the way to rise in the church by this time my political labours began to wear a respectable appearance a third letter had been published and a fourth was preparing i was in high favour men of all ranks visited the earl and dukes lords and barons became as familiar to me as gowns and caps had formerly been in the streets of oxford i stood on the very pinnacle of fortune and proud of my skill like a ropedancer that casts away his balancing pole i took pleasure in standing on tiptoe noticed by the leading men caressed and courted by their dependants politics encouraging me on this hand and theology inviting me on that the whole world seemed to be smiles and sunshine and i discovered that none but blockheads had any cause to complain of its injuries and its storms having eased myself for the present of my load of divinity my fourth letter required no long time to finish i hastened with it to his lordship my spirits mounting as usual he took it but not with his former eagerness read it praised it but with less of that zeal which interested hope supplies i remarked the change and began to inquire what was my fault none replied his lordship your letter is excellent charming every thing i could wishthen i may send it to the pressno i would wish you not to do thatmy lordleave it with me wait a few days and perhaps you may hear of something that will surprise and please youindeed my lord i stood fixed with inquiring eyes hungry after more information but this was not granted except that with a significant smile he told me he had an engagement of importance for the morning and with this hint i retired it was impossible for me to hear so much and no more and to forbear forming conjectures there was going to be a new ministry it could not be otherwise mr soon afterward knocked at the door i looked through the window and saw his carriage i went to the head of the stairs and heard him received by the earl with every expression of welcome i had now no doubt but that a place if i would accept it would incontinently be bestowed on me and it was almost painful to think that my future plans were of an opposite kind yet why opposite churchmen were not prohibited the circle of politics my station would be honourable for they would not think of offering me trifles and why not step from the treasury bench to the bench of bishops let but the love of the state and the love of the church be there and neither seat would suffer contamination a revolution of fortune was certainly at hand what it was i could not accurately foresee but that it would be highly favourable no man in his senses could have the least doubt such was my creed the very next day i received a note from the bishop inviting me to partake of a family dinner with him and his niece so it is and so true is the proverb it never rains but it pours good fortune absolutely persecuted me honours fell so thick at my feet that i had not time to stoop and pick them up in the present humour of things i knew not whether i might not be invited before the morrow came to dine with a party of prime ministers and be elected their president mean time however i thought proper to accept the bishops invitation and as nothing better did actually intervene when the hour came i kept my appointment being there the footman led me up to the drawingroom in which were a lady who curtsying told me the bishop would soon be down and the dean of another rosy gilled son of the church i have often asked myselfwhy are butchers tallowchandlers cookmaids and church dignitaries so inclined to be fat but i could never satisfactorily resolve the question his lordship soon made his appearance and having first paid his obedience to the dean he took the lady by the hand and presenting her to me saidthis mr trevor is my niece who i dare say will be glad to be acquainted with you bows curtsies and acknowledgments of honours conferred were things of course miss wilmot that was the ladys name miss wilmot and i made attempts to entertain each other her person was tall her shape taper her complexion delicate and her demeanour easy her remarks were not profound but they were delivered without pretension she was more inclined to let the conversation die away than to sustain it by that flux of tongue which afflicted the ear at the house of the elliss her countenance was strongly marked with melancholy and a languid endeavour to please seemed to have been the result of study and to have grown into habit our attention was soon called to another quarter dinner dinner gentlemen exclaimed the right reverend father come come we must not let the dinner get cold do any thing rather than spoil my dinner i cannot forgive that away we went when a bishop has the happiness to be ready for his dinner his dinner is sure to be ready for him hunger three times a day is the blessing he would first pray for no remiss cooks no delays for politeness sake there nor is there any occasion scandal itself cannot tax the clergy with want of punctuality at the hour of dinner we sat down the lady carved there were three of us for she ate little but heaven bless me she had work enough it was like boys fighting one down and the other come on i might wonder about the fattening of butchers and tallowchandlers as i pleased but the last part of my wonder was over i was no mean demolisher of pudding and piecrust myself but lord i was an infant you dont eat mr trevor said the lady you dont eat mr trevor said the dean you dont eat mr trevor blubbered the bishop yet never had i been so gorged since the first night at oxford and scarcely then i would have held it out to the last for who would not honour the cloth but the thing could not be and i fairly laid down my knife and fork in despair lord mr trevor why you have not done was the general chorus there is another course coming it was in vain man is but man i fell to at first like the rest thinking that the engagement though hot would be soon over but i little knew the doughty heroes with whom i had entered the lists the chiefs of homer with their chines and goblets and canisters of bread would have been unequal to the contest i had time enough to contemplate the bishop i thought i beheld him quaffing suffocation and stowing in apoplexy and homers simile of the ox and agamemnon forced itself strongly upon me so while he feeds luxurious in the stall the sovreign of the herd is doomd to fall neither did their eating end with the second course the table was no sooner cleared of the cloth and the racy wine with double rows of glasses again placed in array than almonds raisins olives oranges indian conserves and biscuits deviled covered the board to it again they fell with unabating vigour i soon found reason to leave them but i doubt whether for three hours their mouths were once seen motionless in the act of error its enormity escapes detection i had momentary intervals in which i philosophised on the scene before me but not deeply i was a partaker of the vice and my astonishment at it was by no means so great then as it is now but there was another circumstance at which it was even extreme and mingled with high indignation i was ignorant of the clerical maxim that the absence of the profane washes the starch out of lawn hypocrisy avaunt they are then at liberty to unbend i was soon better informed the bishop and the dean miss wilmot being still present the moment the devil of gluttony would give them leisure could find no way of amusing themselves so effectually as by attempting to call up the devil of lust allusions that were evidently their commonplace table talk and that approached as nearly as they durst venture to obscenity were their pastime with these they tickled their fancy till it gurgled in their throats applied to miss wilmot to give it a higher gusto and while they hypocritically avoided words which the ear could not endure they taxed their dull wit to conjure up their corresponding ideas i must own that in my mind poor mother church at that moment made but a pitiful appearance disgusted with their impotent efforts to make their brain the common sewer of joe miller i at last started up with difficulty bridled my anger and addressing myself to the lady said shall we retire to your tea table miss wilmot ay do do replied the father in god try liddy if you can entertain mr trevor we will stay by our bottle i led her out and i leave the initiated to guess with what episcopal reverence all saints and their mother were introduced the moment the ladys back was turned in the course of conversation with the lady i thought i remarked many strong traits of resemblance between her and my former friend and instructor the usher of the grammar school whose name also was wilmot the name perhaps was the circumstance that turned my thoughts into that channel and the fancied likeness between them soon increased upon me so forcibly that i could no longer forbear to relate all that i knew concerning him and to inquire if he were her relation while i spoke she changed colour and after some hesitation answered he is my brotherand the nephew of his lordship her flushings and hesitation were increased i am sorry madam said i if i have been indiscreet she answered in a feeble and inarticulate manner he stands in the same relationship to the bishop that i do the feelings of the lady turned my attention and prevented me from noticing the ambiguity of the reply i respected and loved your brother madam continued i his stay was but short after i left the school and i have not heard of him since is he in londoni believe so but i do not know where every question gave additional pain and i dropped the subject with saying that i was happy to be acquainted with the sister of a man who had so essentially aided me in my education and for whom i had the highest esteem i thought i perceived the tears struggling to get vent and to relieve her i made a short visit to the dignitarieswho werenot drunk beware of scandal calumny itself could not say that madeira port and brandy mingled could make them drunk madeira port and brandy mingled were but digestives no i found the bishop relating one of the principal incidents of his life which incident it was his practice to relate every day after dinner and so mr dean it was the first day after i had been consecrated a bishop that i appeared in my full canonicals and so you know the young gentlemen he was speaking of the westminster boys had never seen me in them because as i was a saying it was the first day of my putting them on and so mr dean as it was the first day of my putting them on they had placed themselves all of a row for to see me pass through them because as i say it was the first day of my putting them on and you cant think mr dean what an alteration it made every body told me so and the young gentlemen as i passed i assure you when they saw me with my lawn sleeves and quite in full decoration being the first day of my putting them on they all bowed and i assure you behaved with the greatest respect you can think for as i tell you it was the first day of my putting them on so they had never seen me in them before so i assure you they bowed and behaved with the greatest respect they seemed quite surprized i made such an appearance and so i assure you they bowed and behaved with the greatest respect for as i was a saying it was the first day of my putting them on perhaps mr trevor you never heard the story of my first appearing in my canonicals ill tell it you his lordship then began the story again he had not a single circumstance to add yet he would not be stopped in his career by my assuring him that i had heard the whole his lordship and the dean then began a discourse concerning the clubs of which they were both members with inquiries after and annotations on prebends archdeacons and doctors that had the honour to gluttonize together on these occasions this though highly amusing to them was intolerable dulness to me and i returned to miss wilmot at nine oclock the deans carriage was at the door and he departed he was a great lover of decorum i was preparing to follow his example but his lordship joined us and desired me to sit down for half an hour he had something to say to me wondering what it could be i readily complied he then began to ask me how i liked his niece and to talk of this and the other young clergymen who had risen in the church by matrimony miss wilmot i perceived was greatly embarrassed i listened to him with some surprise for i had nothing to say he concluded his remarks with telling me that we would talk more on these subjects another time while the dean had been present the turn of the conversation was such that though i made two or three aukward attempts i could find no opportunity of introducing my defence of the articles i was now more successful and his lordship told me it was well written certainly very well written he had read it himself and had consulted two or three very sound divines i had no doubt of the fact yet was glad to hear it confirmed especially by testimonies that i persuaded myself must be good and expressed my satisfaction yes said his lordship your defence is very well written mr trevor and i have something to say to you about that matter but i am a little drowsy at present ring for my night cap niece if you will be with me tomorrow morning at ten oclock mr trevor well talk the thing over i then bade the lady and his lordship good night and returned to brutonstreet with my brain swimming with cogitations concerning bishops nieces deans articles sound divines the church the sons of the church sensuality obscenity and innumerable associating but discordant ideas that bred a strange confusion and darkness of intellect chapter xii the killing of the goose with the golden eggs the next morning my first business was with the bishop and i took good care to be punctual i knew not very well why but the ardour of my expectations was in some sort abated the preaching my sermon clandestinely the niece and the young clergymen that made their fortune by matrimony were none of them in unison with the open and just dealing which was requisite to my success the forebodings at which people have so often marvelled are when they happen nothing more than perceptions of incongruity that disturb the mind of this kind of disturbing i was conscious i repaired however to my post and was ushered up to the prelate he began with telling me what an orthodox divine the dean was who dined with us the day before and how sure he was of rising in the church i could make no answer rise in the church he probably would for facts are facts and i had sufficient proof before me my ready compliance with the first act of deceit that he had required from me had not given him reason to suspect he should find me more scrupulous than many others whom he had made subservient to his purposes what measure had he for my conscience but the standard that regulated his own the caution therefore that he practised with me was only that which the routine of cunning had made habitual introductory topics were soon discarded he began to talk of his niece and again asked if i did not think her an agreeable handsome young lady of her person and manners i had no unfavourable opinion and replied in the affirmative i assure you mr trevor said he she thinks very well of younay my lord she has seen me but onceoh no matter for that who knows but you may come to be better acquainted especially if something that i have to say to you be taken right you are a likely young man mr trevor and may be a promising young man i dont know that is as things shall happen and according as you shall understand things and be prudent this was a vile preface it contained more forebodings but i was so eager for an explanation that i had scarcely time for augury he continued you have been to oxford mr trevor and you have studied i was at oxford and i studied and read greek and the fathers and the schoolmen and other matters but all that there wont do alone mr trevor a young man must be prudent i was prudent or i should never have been this day what i am now sitting here nor what it may happen i may be but all that is as things shall happen to come to pass we have all of us a right to look forward and so i would have you look forward mr trevor that is the only prudent way more and more impatient i answered his lordship i would be as prudent as i could and again requested he would explain himself why yes mr trevor that is what i mean you are a young man i dont know you but you come recommended to me by my very learned friends you have not the cares of the church to trouble you and so you fill up your idle time with writingmy lordnay mr trevor you write very prettily i could write too but i have not time i never had time i had aways a deal of business on my hands persons of distinction to visit when i was young and to take care not to disoblige that is a main point of prudence mr trevor never disoblige your superiors but i dare say you have more sense and so if that be the case why you will make friends as i did i will be one of them and i will recommend you mr trevor and introduce you and every thing may be to the satisfaction of all parties well but how my lord why you have written a defence of the articles now do you wish to make a friendi wish for the friendship of all good men my lordthat is right to be sure and you can keep a secreti have proved that i can my lordwhy that is right and perhaps you would be glad to see your defence in printi should my lordwhy that is right and if it would serve a friend to put another name to the workmy lord nay if you have any objection i shall say no more i do not comprehend your lordshipa work mr trevor would not sell the worse or be less read or less famous for having a dignified name in the titlepageyour lordships for examplenay i did not say that but if you are a prudent young man and should have no objectioni find i am not the man your lordship has supposednayi will be no participator in falsehood private or publicfalsehood sir what interpretation are you putting upon my words i thought you had been a prudent young man mr trevor i was willing to have been your friend but i have donemy lord i must be free enough to declare i neither understand the friendship nor the morality of the propositionsir morality is that language sir morality i am sorry i have been deceivedi have been equally so my lord and am equally sorry i wish your lordship a good morning away i came and in my vexation totally forgot to redemand my manuscript i recollected it however while within sight of the door and turned back i knocked asked for his lordship and was told he was not at home this profligate impudence exceeded belief and my choler became ungovernable his lordship exclaimed i to the footman is a disgrace to the bench on which he sits the footman thrust the door in my face and epithets then burst from me that were a disgrace to myself i hurried homeward determined to give vent to my feelings in a letter and half determined that it should be publicly addressed to the rank hypocrite signed by my own name my angry imagination teemed forth the biting taunts that should sting him to madness and the broad shame with which he was to be overwhelmed active memory retraced each circumstance that could blacken the object of my present contempt and abhorrence and every trait increased the bitterness of my gall and made my boiling blood more hot was this a pastor of the church a follower of christ a christian bishop the question astonished and exasperated me almost to frenzy in this temper i arrived in brutonstreet where another very unexpected scene awaited me the earl i was told had inquired for me and desired to see me the moment i should be at home the message by turning my thoughts into a new channel gave relief to the impetuous tide of passion the gloomy scene instantly brightened into prospects the most cheering and opposite it was good to have two strings to the bow especially as this second was of so firm and inflexible a texture all my favourable forebodings were confirmed when on entering i observed the smiles that played on his lordships countenance he was in a most pleasant humour i hinted to you mr trevor said he that i should probably have something agreeable soon to communicate his words gave certainly to expectation they uttered volumes of rapture in a breath the fresh laurels of politics sprouted forth with tenfold vigour and the withered figtree of theology was totally forgotten there is likely to be a change in affairs then my lord said i smiling in rapturous sympathy as i spokethere ismr has been with your lordship several times i thinkyes yes i am courted by all parties at presentindeed my lord then themistocles has become formidableyes yes i have made them feel mei am glad that i have been instrumentalcertainly mr trevor certainly an architect cannot build palaces with his own hands but we will not talk of that we must complete the work we have begunand publish our fourth letterby no means mr trevor that would ruin all for a moment i was speechless at last i ejaculatedmy lordthings at present wear a very different face we must now write on the other side you seem surprised well might he say so i was thunderstruck but i will tell you a secret the minister and i are friends i send four members into the house and if government had not expended five times the sum that it cost me to carry their elections i should have sent three more i have attacked the minister in the house by my votes i have attacked him in the papers by my writings so finding i wielded my two edged sword with such resolution and activity he has thought proper to beat a parley he acknowledges that the fifty thousand pounds the election contest cost me were expended in support of our excellent constitution and that i ought to be rewarded for my patriotism his offers are liberal and peace is concluded we must now vere about and this was the business for which i wanted you a good casuist you know mr trevor can defend both sides of a question and i have no doubt but that you will appear with as much brilliancy as a panegyrist as you have done as a satirist how long i remained in that state of painful stupefaction into which i had been thrown at the very commencement of this harangue is more than i can say but as soon as i could recover some little presence of mind i repliedyou my lord no doubt have your own reasons which to you are a justification of your own conduct for my part when i wrote against the minister it was not against the man a desire to abash vice advance the virtuous and promote the good of mankind were my motivesmr trevor i find you are a young man you do not know the worldthe scene with the bishop was acting over again and i felt myself bursting once more with indignation with ineffable contempt in every feature of my face i answeredif a knowledge of the world consists in servility selfishness and the practice of deceit i hope i never shall know ityou strangely forget yourself mr trevori am not of that opinion my lord i rather think it was the man who could suppose me capable of holding the pen of prostitution that strangely forgot himself his lordship hemmed rang his bell hummed a tune and wished me a good morning and i rushed out of his apartment and hurried up to my own where i found myself suddenly released from all my labours and at full leisure to ruminate on all the theological and political honours that were to fall so immediately and profusely upon me and here it is worthy of remark that i did not accuse myself for i did not recollect that i had been in the least guilty yet when the earl had asked me to write letters that were to be supposed by the public the production of his own pen i had then no qualms of conscience and when the bishop invited me to favour falsehood by attributing my best written sermon to him i concurred in the request with no less facility when deceit was not to favour but to counteract my plans its odious immorality then rushed upon me men are so much in a hurry to obtain the end that they frequently forget to scrutinize the means as for my own part far from supposing that i had been a participator in guilt i felt a consciousness of having acted with selfdenying and heroic virtue this was my only armour against the severe pangs with which i was so unexpectedly assaulted chapter xiii gloomy meditations or pills for the passions more of enochs morality turl improves yet is still unaccountable and almost profane consecrated things themistocles and vengeance a love scene more marriage plots and a tragicomic denouement the fate of themistocles the manuscript in danger i shut the door upon myself as it were to conceal my disgrace and for a considerable time traversed the room in an agony of contending passions rage amazement contempt of myself abhorrence of my insidious patrons and a thirst of vengeance devoured me at length i was seized with a bitter sense of disappointment and a fit of deep despondency my calculations had been so indubitable my progress so astonishing and my future elevation in prospect so immeasurable that to see myself thus puffed down as it were from the very pinnacle not of hope but of certainty was more than my philosophy had yet learned to support with any shew of equanimity i sunk on my chair where i sat motionless in silence gloom and painful meditation groaning in spirit as tormenting fancy conjured up the dazzling scenes with which she had lately been so actively familiar i was roused from my trance at last by the recollection that i was in the house of the earl and starting up as if to spurn contamination from me i hurried out to ease my heart by relating the whole story in suffolk street and to procure myself an apartment enoch mamma and miss were all at home i had preinformed the family of my engagement to dine with the bishop and they began a full chorus of interrogatories who did i meet said mamma what did i think of the niece asked miss what did his lordship say inquired the holy man i stopped their inquisitive clamours by answering my eyes darting rage his lordship said enough to prove himself a scoundrel heaven defend me exclaimed enoch why mr trevor are you in your sensesa pitiful scoundrel a pandar a glutton a lascivious hypocrite with less honesty than a highwayman for he would not only rob but publicly array himself in the pillage nay and impudently pretend to do the person whom he plundered a favour enoch stood petrified he could not have thought that frenzy itself would have dared to utter language so opprobrious against a bishop it was treason against the cloth the church tottered at the sounds but the fury i felt held him in awelords continued i heaven preserve me from the society of a lord i have done with them all i am come out to seek an apartment kingdoms should not tempt me to remain another hour under the roof of a lord if the eyes of enoch could have stretched themselves wider they would the females requested me to explain myself a pandar said mamma ay added miss what did that mean mr trevor the question sobered me a little i recollected my friend the usher and the honour of miss wilmot and evaded an answer it was repeated again with greater solicitation scandal stood with open mouth waiting for a fresh supply i answered that for many reasons and especially for a dear friends sake i should be silent on that head a dear friends sake exclaimed the suspicious matron who can that be who but mr ellis why mr i interrupted her in a positive tone not without a mixture of anger assuring her it was not mr ellis and then repeated that i was come in search of a lodging at that moment the bishops servant knocked at the door i saw him through the window and a note was received by the footboy and brought to enoch the instant he had read the contents he hurried away telling me that an unexpected affair which must not be neglected called him out immediately young as i was unhackneyed in the ways of men having so lately left the society of ignorant and inconsistent youth till that hour i had imagined though i discovered no qualities in enoch that greatly endeared him to me that he was sincerely my friend his duplicity on this occasion was in my opinion a heinous crime and i rushed out of the house with a determination never again to enter the doors i precipitately walked through several streets without asking myself where i was going at last i happened to think of turl and at that moment he appeared to be the man on earth i would soonest meet i hastened to his lodgings found him at home labouring as before and instead of feeling the same emotions of contempt for his employment i was struck with the calm satisfaction visible in his countenance and envied him i remembered his words he worked to gain a living by administering as little as he could to the false wants and vices of men and at the same time to pursue a plan on which he was intenta plan of importance no doubt perhaps of public utility it was sometime before i could relate my errand i hesitated and struggled and stammered but at last saidmr turl i yesterday thought myself surrounded by friends i now come to you and should you refuse to hear me i have not a friend in the world to whom i can relate the injustice that has been done mepray speak mr trevor if i can do you any service i most sincerely assure you it will add more to my own happiness than you will easily imagine these words though few were uttered with an uncommon glow of benevolence my heart was full my passions like the arrow in the bent bow were with force restrained and i snatched his hand and pressed it with great fervour may you never want a friend mr turl said i and may you never find a false one your opinions differ from mine but i see and feel you are a man of virtue i paused a moment and continued that you are a man of principle is fortunate because in what i have to relate the name and character of a lady is concerned the sister of a man whom a very few years since i loved and reveredyou may state the facts without mentioning her namei have no doubt of your honouri have no curiosity and it will be the safest and wisest way i then gave him a succinct history of the whole transactions between me enoch the bishop and the earl for i was almost as angry with the first as with the other two he heard me to the end and asked such questions for elucidation as he thought necessary he then saidmr trevor you are already acquainted with the plainness and what you perhaps have thought the bluntness of my character i have but one rule i speak all that i think worthy of being spoken and if i offend it is never from intention what you have related of these lordly men does not in the least astonish me their vices are as odious as you have described them your great mistake is in supposing yourself blameless you have chiefly erred in entertaining too high an opinion of your own powers and in cherishing something like a selfish blindness to the principles of the persons with whom you have been concerned your indiscriminate approbation of all you wrote raised your expectations to extravagance your inordinate appetite for applause made you varnish over the picture which the earl gave you of himself though it must otherwise have been revolting to a virtuous mind and your expectation of preferment so entirely lulled your moral feelings to sleep that you could be a spectator of the picture you have drawn of the bishop the day you dined with him yet go the next morning to accept if not to solicit his patronage you have committed other mistakes which i think it best at present to leave unnoticed in the remarks i have made i have had no intention to give pain but to awaken virtue at present you are angry and why why exclaimed i with mingled astonishment and indignation a peer of the realm to be thus profligate in principle and not excite my angerwhat is a peer of the realm but a man educated in vice nurtured in prejudice from his earliest childhood and daily breathing the same infectious air he first respired a being to be pitieddespisedi was but three days in this earls house the false colouring given me by his agent first induced me to enter it but i was soon undeceived well but a churchman a divine a bishop a man consecrated to one of the highest of earthly dignities consecrated there are many solemn but pernicious pantomimes acted in this worldsuffer me to say mr turl that to speak irreverently of consecrated things does not become a man of your understanding i can make no answer to such an accusation mr trevor except that i must speak and think as that understanding directs me enlighten it and i will speak better but what is it in a bishop that is consecrated is it his body or his mind what can be understood by his body is it the whole mass imagine its contents holy an ounce of civet good apothecary that mass itself is daily changing is the new body which the indulgence of gluttonous sensuality supplies as holy as the old if it be his mind that is consecrated what is mind but a succession of thoughts by what magic are future thoughts consecrated has a bishop no unholy thoughts can pride lust avarice and ambition can all the sins of the decalogue be consecrated are some thoughts consecrated and some not by whom or how is the selection made what strange farrago of impossibilities have these holy dealers in occult divinity jumbled together can the god of reason be the god of lies there was so much unanswerable truth in these arguments that i listened in speechless amazement at last i replied i am almost afraid to hear you mr turlyes it is cowardice that keeps mankind fettered in ignorancewell but this bishop does he not live in a state of concubinagethe scene of sensuality that you have painted makes the affirmative probableand my defence of the articles i will publish it immediately with a preface stating the whole transactionyou will be to blamewhy soyou may be better employedwhat than in exposing vicethe employment is petty and what is worse it is inefficient the frequent consequence of attacking the errors of individuals is the increase of those errors such attacks are apt to deprave both the assailant and the assailed they begin in anger continue in falsehood and end in fury they harden vice wound virtue and poison genius i repeat you may be better employed mr trevorand is your rule absolutethe exceptions are certainly few exhibit pictures of general vice and the vicious will find themselves there or if they will not their friends willthis enoch toois i believe a mean and selfish character though i by no means think the action at which you have taken offence is the strongest proof of his duplicity to decide justly we must hear both parties he saw your passions inflamed it was probable you would have opposed his going to the bishop though if he in any manner interfered to go was an act of duty the reasonings of turl in part allayed the fever of my mind but by no means persuaded me to desist from the design of inflicting exemplary disgrace on the earl and the prelate though a stern opposer of many of my principles his manners were attentive winning and friendly being better acquainted with the town than i was he undertook to procure me a neat and cheap apartment in his own neighbourhood and in half an hour succeeded to this my effects were immediately removed i was even too angry to comply with the forms of good breeding so far as to leave my compliments for the earl i departed without ceremony and retired to my chamber to contemplate my change of situation after mature consideration the plan on which i determined was immediately to publish the fourth letter of themistocles already written to continue to write under the same signature and in the continuation to expose the political profligacy of the earl themistocles was accordingly sent that very day i next intended accurately to revise my defence of the articles as soon as i should recover the copy from the bishop to turn the conversation with turl occasionally on that subject that i might refute his objections and then to publish the work for ordination i would apply elsewhere being determined never to suffer pollution by the unholy touch of that prelate the next morning my passions being calmed by sleep and i having reflected on what turl had said a sense of justice told me that i ought to visit enoch at least once more in which decision my curiosity concurred i went and found him at home but dressing the mother and daughter were at the same employment but miss imagining it was my knock sent her attendant to inquire and immediately huddled on her bedgown and mobcap to come down to me her tongue was eager to do its office lord mr trevor we have had such doings papa and mamma and i have been at it almost ever since but dont you fear i am your true friend and i have made mamma your friend and she insists upon it that papa shall be your friend too and so he is forced to comply though the bishop had convinced him that you are a very imprudent young gentleman and my papa will have it you dont understand common sense and that you have ruined yourself though you had the finest opportunity on earth and that you will ruin every body that takes your part you cant think how surprised and how angry he is that you should oppose your will to an earl and a bishop and lose the means of making your fortune and perhaps of making your friends fortunes too for there it is that the shoe pinches because i understand the bishop is very kind to papa at present and if he should take your part papa says he will never see him again but mamma and i argued what of that would the bishop give papa a good living said mamma and what if he would says i shall we give up those that we love best in the world because it is the will and pleasure of a bishop no indeed i dont know that bishops are better than other people for my part and perhaps not so good as those that are to be given up so mamma told me to be silent but she took my part and i took yours and i assure you for all what they both said i did not spare the bishop so my papa fell into a passion and pretended that i was too forward and i assure you he accused me of having my likings i dont know whether he did not make me blush but i answered for all that and said well and if i have who can help having their likings i have heard you and my mamma say often enough that you both had had your likings and that you did not like one another and that that was the reason that you quarrel like cat and dog and so if people will be happy they must marry according to their likings so said my mamma well but eliza have you any reason to think that mr trevor has any notions of marriage so i boldly answered yes i had for you know mr trevor what passed between us at the playhouse and the kind squeeze of the hand you gave me at parting with me and so why should i be afraid to speak and tell the truth and so mamma says it shall all be cleared up her eagerness would admit of no interruption till it was checked for a moment by the entrance of enoch and the mamma i suspected a part of what was to come and never in my life had i felt so much embarrassment well eliza said the matron have you and mr trevor been talking have you come to an explanation i would have answered but miss was an age too quick for me yes mamma we have explained every thing to the full and whole i have told it all over to him just now every syllable the same as i told it to you and he does not contradict a word of it contradict interrupted enoch but does he say the same no sir answered i with eagerness that i might if possible by a single word put an end to the eternal clack and false deductions of this very loving young lady lord mr trevor exclaimed miss her passions all flying to her eyes part fire and part water sure you are not in earnest you dont mean as you sayi am very serious miss ellis and am exceedingly sorry to have been so misunderstoodwhy will you pretend to deny mr trevor that all that i have been rehearsing here about the playhouse and about the kindness with which you paid your addresses to me there and indeed elsewhere often and before time and about your leading me to the chair and then your tenderly taking my hand and squeezing it and then the look you gave with your eyes and more than all the loving manner in which you said good night not to mention as before all that you said and did sitting next to me in the playhouse enough to win the affections of any poor innocent virgin you are not such a deceiver as that comes to i am sure mr trevor you have a more generous and noble heart here miss burst into a flood of tears and mamma exclaimedi am very much afraid mr trevor there have been some improper doings enochs anger for once made him honest no such a thing said he it is the forward fools own fault this is neither the first second nor third time she has played the same pranks the mother and daughter instantly raised their pipes like fifty ciphered keys in an organ first against enoch then against all the male kind and lastly turned so furiously upon me that there seemed to be danger of their tearing me piecemeal like as the mad females of thrace did the disconsolate orpheus at length i started up in a passion and exclaimedwill you hear me ladies no no no screamed miss we wont hear a word dont listen to him mamma he is a deceiver a faithless man i did not think there could have been such a one in the whole world and i am sure i warned him often enough against it and after the true friend that i have been to you mr trevor and have taken your part tooth and nail papa himself knows i have and would take your part through fire and water against the whole world and to be so ungrateful and so false and faithless to me in return oh shame mr trevor is that a man a fine manly part truly to win a poor virgins heart and then to forsake her finding the sobs and the rhetoric of miss inexhaustible and every effort to elucidate fruitless i rose told enoch i would explain myself to him by letter opened the door to go was seized by the coat by the young lady and could not without violence or leaving like joseph my garment behind me have torn myself away if i had not been aided by enoch who having according to his own story been probably present at such scenes before had sense enough i suppose to be ashamed of his daughters conduct i hurried home snatched up my pen and in an epistle to enoch instantly detailed as minutely as i could recollect them all the circumstances of the heroines behaviour acknowledging that i had listened had suffered the intercourse of knees legs and feet and as she said had once pressed her hand that for this i feared i might have been to blame but yet if this were treachery i knew not very well how a young man was to conduct himself so as not to be accused of being either rude ridiculous or a traitor while i was writing this letter it occurred to me that perhaps there was no small portion of cunning in the conduct of miss that she and her mamma had remarked my youth and entire ignorance of the world that enoch himself though more intent on what he thought deeper designs had entertained similar ideas that miss had probably been never before so much delighted with the person of any man whom she might approach and that the females had concluded i might have been precipitately entangled in marriage or marriage promises by this artful management be that as it may i wrote my letter eased my conscience and took my leave of the whole family mean time themistocles had lain with the printer several days while i impatiently looked for its appearance but in vain i then began to suspect the paper was under the influence of the earl wrote to the editor and read the next day among the answers to correspondents that the letter signed themistocles could not be admitted in their paper they were friends to proper strictures but not to libels against government my teeth gnashed with rage i was but ill qualified at this period to teach the benevolent philosophy which priests of all religions affirm it is their trade to inculcate neither could i procure the manuscript from the bishop the scene in suffolk street had occasioned me to delay sending that evening but the next day i wrote a peremptory demand for it to be delivered to the bearer and prevailed on turl to be my messenger he returned with information that the bishop was gone into the country but that the letter would be sent after him immediately and an answer might probably be received by the return of post i had no alternative and three days afterward the manuscript was sent sealed up and labeled on the backto be delivered to the author when called for his address not being known thus every new incident was a new lesson unveiling a system moral political and ecclesiastical which without such experience i could not have supposed to exist my conversations with turl came in aid of this experience and they combined to shake the very high opinion i had conceived of the clerical order but the finishing blow was yet to come chapter xiv the return to oxford a cold reception hector and more of his inmates olivia and the drive to woodstock symptoms of increasing misfortune an oxford scholar brawl the flight of hope the period of my rustication was expired and the term immediately preceding the summer vacation was on the point of beginning i resolved therefore to return to oxford and according to the claim of rotation take my bachelors degree my plans of punishment and my pursuit of fame must indeed lie dormant a few weeks but i determined they should both be revived with increasing ardour at my return i found no inconsiderable pleasure in revisiting the turrets groves and streams of oxford long experience itself could scarcely weed the sentiment from my mind that these were the sacred haunts of the muses it must be owned that such the fancy could easily make them and that it is a task in which the fancy delights i thought it my duty immediately to visit the president with respect to any mention of the letters of recommendation i scarcely knew how to behave the bishop and the president might have been friends in their youth the president might have his prejudices and might there not even be cruelty in rudely tearing away the mask and showing him what a monster he had formerly taken to his bosom should he inquire i certainly must declare the truth but should he be silent what good inducement had i to speak the morality of this reasoning was more questionable than i at that time suspected silent however he was on that subject he received me coldly asked in a tone that did not wish for information how i liked london and concluded with saying he hoped i did not return to set the university any more bad examples not well satisfied myself with my methodistical paroxysm i had not a word to offer in its defence i answered i hoped i should set no bad examples either to the university or the world but that i could only act to the best of my judgment and if that deceived me i must endure the consequences exactly so mr trevor said the president with a formal dismissing inclination of the head and so we parted when i had been at college about a week hector mowbray called on me one morning and told me his father was dead that mowbray hall the manor and its demesnes were all his own that he had the best pack of fox dogs in the county hunters that would beat the world setters as steady as a rifle barrel gun and coursers that would take the wind in their teeth and that he was going up to town with his sister of whom he was glad to be rid to place her with an aunt she would not let me be quiet said hector but i must come for she is as obstinate as a mule and bring our compliments and her special thanks for a signal favour that is her lingo which she makes a plaguey rout about your methodist parson trick you know of taking her out of the water after your damned canting gang had frightened the horses and thrown her into it she says she should have been in her cold grave or i dont know what but for you but i tell her women and cats are not so easily killed and so to please her i agreed to come directly and ask you to breakfast with us and spend the day together i love oxford it was not above thirty miles out of the road and i never come within a long shot of it without having a row with the boys and the bucks so if you will be one among us come along there is tall andrews spanking jack as i call him and three or four more of us that mean to meet at woodstock and take olivia to be sure andrews is sweet upon her but she beats off though he is a fine fellow a daring dog all christ church cant beat him and when his father is off the hinges which he swears will be within these six months he will make a famous wicked dash i tell her she is a fool for not taking him but my talking is all spilt porridge she is as piggish as father himself was so if you come why come along this was the first pleasant proposal that had been made to me since the day of my dining with the bishop my heart bounded while he spoke it was with difficulty i could contain my joy and the effort must have been much greater had not the brother of olivia been the dull undiscerning hector mowbray he would have hurried me away immediately but i insisted on decorating my person and fitting it to appear before the angelic olivia impatience like mine would not admit of languor i was soon equipped and flew to feast my senses with rapture ineffable i staid not to ask whether it were love or friendship or what were my intentions hopes or fears i felt a host of desires that were eager tumultuous and undecided the passions were too much in a hurry to institute inquiry or to have any dread of consequences i knew indeed that i already had a lovers hatred of andrews and even took pleasure to hear him characterised by traits so disgusting that olivia should reject such a being was no miracle and yet it gave me inexpressible gratification as i ascended the stairs strange sensations seized me such as i had never known before the elastic bounds with which i had hurried along sunk into debility aspen leaves never trembled more universally than i did from head to foot and as i opened the door my knees like belshazzars smote one against the other a sickness of the stomach came over me i turned pale and was pushed forward by hector before i had time to recover myself olivia saw my confusion in an instant her sympathetic feelings caught the infection she feebly pronounced i am glad to see you mr trevor and with the hue of death on her countenance snatched her handkerchief turned aside and uttered two or three hysteric sobs andrews my rival hectors spanking jack was present and burst into a loud laugh it was a medicine that immediately recovered both of us the blood hurried back flushed the cheeks of olivia and dyed them with a deep but beautiful scarlet i am a strange fool said she you came upon me so suddenly mr trevor and i never can see an old friend after long absence without these sensations long absence replied andrews why i thought it was only three or four months since the affair of the methodist preacher and the drowning that you were just now telling me about pshaw exclaimed hector if you pester your pate with her crotchets you will have enough to do come come where are the muffins i begin to cry cupboard beside i want to be off while this dialogue passed i recovered sufficient courage to salute olivia but affection and awe were so mingled that the burning kiss of love expired in cold blooded constraint and reserve we then sat down to the tea table i on one side of olivia hector on the other with his right leg on a vacant chair his left thrown on olivias lap and andrews extended sprawling his whole length on a sopha the two youths began a conversation in their own style while i endeavoured to entertain olivia with my remarks on london i related my principal adventures expectations and disappointments and she appeared to be deeply interested by the narrative the questions she put her tone of voice her countenance all expressed her feelings and several times a deep sigh was smothered and with difficulty passed away in a forced hem the two youths were so deeply engaged in the pedigree of their pointers and so warmly contested whose were the best that i doubt if they knew the subject of our discourse it was a fleeting but happy hour hector still drove his phaeton and breakfast being over it was waiting at the door attended by two grooms with two led saddle horses i will not go brother said olivia if you drive he drive replied andrews never believe it no no miss mowbray i will be your jehu i will wheel you along over velvet every yard smooth as sailing no jack interrupted hector that wont do trevor is no company has nothing to say or nothing that i want to hear sister and he will match best he will tell her what is greek for a gauze cap and she will teach him how to make it up you and i will pair off together on the hunters and ill gallop you the last mile into woodstock for your sum or look you the loser pay the expences of the day to this proposal seasoned with oaths three at least to a sentence andrews continued obstinately averse as hector did not drive he would nor did he pay any more respect to the opinion of olivia who remarked that he was booted and i was not so much the better said he that is genteel nay but really added olivia i shall not think myself more safe with you mr andrews than with my brother mr andrews was deaf he rudely seized her by the wrists hauled her across the room and swore if she would not go he would take her in his arms and carry her my fingers ached to catch him by the collar but i could not like him cast off all fear of offending olivia resistance must either have been violent or in vain olivia submitted and i dared not oppose we mounted and andrews drove for the first three miles with some moderation he then began to play tricks took a high quarter and a low one where he could find them to shew his dexterity whipped and fretted the horses increased their rate and at last put them into a full gallop as soon as i perceived what he was doing i rode full speed after him and in an authoritative tone called to him to drive with more care he was obliged to slacken his pace before he could understand what i said when he had heard me repeat my injunction which i did with no little vehemence he looked at me first in astonishment then with a sneer and was raising his whip to lash the horses forward with fresh fury olivia caught him by the arm and i immediately called with a voice of thunder by g sir if you either injure or terrify the lady i will pull you head long from your seat he made no answer and the contempt his countenance had exhibited the moment before sunk into sheepishness i immediately rode forward to the head of the horses kept a moderate pace would not suffer him to pass me unless he meant to stake the horse i rode with the pole and continued thus for more than a mile till i was convinced that he had no more inclination to divert himself by terrifying and endangering olivia i rode the rest of the way with the heart burn of anxiety fearful i had angered olivia but not knowing how much while i kept the lead to oblige andrews to temperance he cursed and muttered it was very fine mighty proper behaviour to a gentleman but he should see how it was all to end he vented other menaces which though in too low a key distinctly to reach my ear were loud enough to produce their effect on olivia we arrived at woodstock and i dismounted and stood ready to receive olivia andrews followed the example but she called to her brother and noticed neither of us he received her as she alighted and i perceiving her serious look said i hope miss mowbray i have not offended you she made no reply but stood half a minute as if to recover being cramped by sitting andrews was then on our left at some distance and i turned to the same side she saw me and called mr trevor she said no more but her look was too impressive to be misinterpreted hard fate it could not be obeyed i pretended indeed to walk away but the moment she entered the door of the inn i hastened back to andrews and said if you think yourself insulted sir you have only to inform me of it i am at your service his answer washe did not know what i could mean he had nothing to say to me i gave him a contemptuous glance he followed the grooms and i went to seek olivia i approached with trepidation i perceive madam said i my conduct is not approved she fixed her eye upon meyou have been speaking to mr andrews i was silent and a duel added she with increasing severity mingled with terror i hastily interrupted her no madam mr andrews is not a man to fight duelsmr andrews has the more understanding though the intelligence gave her relief she spoke in a tone that petrified surely madam i replied you cannot be angry with me for protecting you from danger and insultthe danger was trifling perhaps none he would not endanger himself and for insult i must be left to judge in my own case both what it is and when it deserves notice men have little respect for women when they are so ready to suppose a woman is incapable of being her own protectoris it then a crime miss mowbray to tremble for your safety or to teach manners to a bruteyes at least it is weakness to tremble without cause you must act as you please in whatever relates to yourself but it is inexpressibly criminal to be ready on every trifling occasion to take or to throw away life if this be teaching we have too many teachers in the world who have never themselves been to school i am personally concerned and you have asked my opinion otherwise mr trevor i should have been cautious of giving it the energy with which this reproof though severe was begun denoted what selfflattery might well have construed into affection for it proved the interest the lovely chider took in the rectitude of my conduct but the kindness of it seemed to be all killed in the formality and coldness of the conclusion i stood speechless she perceived the effect she had produced and in a soft and relenting tone addedi do not seek to wound your feelings mr trevor oh no would i couldthe angel checked herself but soon with returning enthusiasm continuedideas at this instant rush upon my mind thatagain she pausedyou saved my lifebutthe tears started in her eyes her voice faltered she could not proceed she had rung to inquire for a dressing room the damned maid entered olivia followed and i remained in speechless stupefaction with the dreadful but reverberating in my ear andrews and hector came in had the former known my thoughts he would have rejoiced at such ample vengeance he talked to mowbray but took no notice of what had passed they ordered dinner and asked if i would stroll with them to blenheim house i excused myself and away they went i remained anxiously expecting that olivia would come down and having waited till the approach of dinner time i sent the maid with my compliments to inform her that i should be glad to speak a word to her the answer i received was that she should see me in half an hour i sent again but to no purpose i could not catch a glimpse of her till the youths had returned and dinner was on the table they brought two gownsmen of christ church with them companions of andrews who were quite as talkative and nearly as rude and boisterous as themselves olivia had not perhaps all her accustomed vivacity but she behaved with infinitely more ease and chearfulness than i could have wished and i felt as if i were the only disconsolate guest the players were at woodstock and were to exhibit that afternoon they began at four oclock that the gownsmen might have time to return to oxford hoping that would be a favourable circumstance for them with the vice chancellor who as i have said is generally inimical to theatrical exhibition and whose influence extends to woodstock the party all voted for the play except olivia who observed their inclination to riot and ineffectually attempted to persuade them to return i was glad to find them obstinate it might afford me an opportunity of speaking with her for which i would almost have given an eye a servant was sent to keep places in one of the six boxes which the theatre fitted up in a barn contained the youths sat so late to enjoy the folly of their own conversation that the play had begun before we came there and inquiring for our box we found it in the possession of four gownsmen who had turned the servant out and seized upon it for themselves hector and andrews began to swear outrageously tigers could not have appeared more fierce they entered the box and addressed its usurpers in the gross vulgar terms to which they had been accustomed they were immediately answered in their own language and tall andrews and the bulky hector each laid hold of his man who were much their inferiors in strength and size to turn them out i was standing to guard olivia who seemed pleased that i should be rather so engaged than more actively employed but my aid was soon necessary hector and andrews each received a blow which neither of them had the courage to return though their opponents were little better than boys fired at their pusillanimity i darted by and seized the little gownsmen one in one hand and the other in the other pressed my knuckles in their neck shook them heartily and dragged them out of the box the two other collegians of our squadron seeing this intrepid advance followed up the victory hector and andrews again blustered and lent their aid and the box was cleared this did not all pass in a moment the oxonians and there were numbers of them in the theatre crouded to the spot and it was with difficulty a general riot to which these youths are always prone could be prevented at last we made way to the box but no words could persuade olivia to enter it she insisted on returning to the inn i interceded her brother swore and andrews attempted to hold her but her resolution was not to be shaken i am in a society of mad boys said she i hoped to have found one rational being among them but i was deceived the sentence was short but every syllable was an arrow that wounded me to the heart i was the supposed rational being in whom she had placed her hopes and by whom she had been deceived a second time i had disregarded the benevolent wisdom with which she had vainly endeavoured to inspire me had acted in open defiance of her peaceful morality and had forfeited all claim to her esteem i read my doom not only in her words but in her whole deportment while i stood drawing these painful conclusions motionless or active only in my fears a messenger arrived whose coming gave a climax to my ill fortune he brought a letter informing olivia that her aunt whom she was on her journey to visit was dangerously ill and if olivia desired to see her alive she must hasten to london with all possible speed the news entirely put an end to the endeavours of hector and his companions to detain her at the play a servant was sent forward to prepare a postchaise for olivia in which she insisted on returning to oxford by herself and we all immediately proceeded back to the inn just before we reached the inn hector and his companions being engaged in noisy disputation i said to olivia in a half whisperhave i then madam forfeited all claims to your good opinionshe paused for a moment and repliedthe incidents of today mr trevor have but confirmed the character which was long since given me of you and which i began to hope was not strictly true the benefit you have conferred on me i shall never forget it has induced me to be more prompt in my desire to prevent mischief than you perhaps might think became me such a trial can scarcely occur again and if it should i will endeavour to use greater caution yet suffer me for the last time earnestly to advise you to be less rash were i your sister mr trevor i should be in continual alarms and the most unhappy creature existing andrews heard her voice and prompted as i suppose either by jealousy or malice put an end to our dialogue i would have given worlds if i had possessed them to have continued it only five minutes but no such blessing could be obtained andrews was alert and olivia appeared to avoid further parley in a quarter of an hour the carriage was ready and olivia stepped into it and was driven away full speed andrews would have remained to see the play and hector had not i shamed him into the contrary would have consented but in consequence of my remonstrances they mounted accompanied by the rest of their clamorous comrades on horseback and i was left to the melancholy office of driving the phaeton with the seat vacant that had so lately been occupied by olivia we hurried off helter skelter no one respecting his neck and i the least for olivia was before and rode and drove at such a rate that we overtook the chaise a mile before it reached oxford what relief was this to me she sat concealed in the corner of the carriage and i could catch no glimpse of her i durst not even drive past lest i should add to the mortal offence i had already given and confirm her in the belief that i was no better than a madman or in her own emphatic language a mad boy the pain of suspence was quickly over we all soon arrived at oxford a courier had been dispatched from woodstock by the affectionately impatient niece with orders to have another chaise in readiness and after briefly bidding her brother and the company adieu she stepped out of the carriage which brought her from woodstock into the one that was waiting and again was driven off while i stood gazing in a trance of painful stupidity this was the last glance i had of her and rejecting the invitation to supper of hector and his party with more sullenness than i had ever felt before i returned to the college burst into my room locked the door and threw myself down on the boards in a state of the most wretched despondency end of volume ii volume iii chapter i gloomy thoughts filial emotions a journey to the country a lawyers accounts not easily closed conscientious scruples the legacy received and divided return to oxford more disappointment treachery suspected arrival at london difficulty in choosing a profession my agitation of mind was too violent to be quickly appeased it did not end with the day or with the week but on the contrary excited interrogatories that prolonged the paroxysm why was i disturbed why angry with myself why did i accuse olivia of being severe or what did the accusation mean what were my views from the tumultuous state of my emotions i could not disguise to myself that i had an affection for her but had she ever intimated an affection for me was the passion that devoured me rational she was of a wealthy family of the provision her father had made for her i was ignorant but i knew that her expectations from the aunt said to be now dying and from others of her kindred were great was i prepared to accept favours make myself a dependent and be subservient to the unfeeling caprice of hector or any other proud and ignorant relation did not such people esteem wealth as the test and the measure of worth what counterpoise had i but sanguine hopes of the probable fallacy of which i had already received strong proofs and which did not in the pictures that fancy at present drew burst upon me with those bright and vivid flashes that had lately made them so alluring my passions and propensities all led me to seek the power of conferring benefits controlling folly and of being the champion of merit and the rewarder of virtue ought i not either to renounce olivia or to render myself in every respect her equal and to disdain the degrading insolence with which any pretensions of mine would otherwise be received had i no reason to fear that olivia herself was a little influenced by personal considerations would she have been quite so ready to disapprove had the advantages of fortune been on my side was this inferiority entirely disregarded by her the doubt was grating but pertinaciously intrusive would not any proposal from me be treated with the most sovereign contempt if not by her by hector and her other relations why then did i think of her it was but a very few days since the wealth and power that should have raised me far above the sphere of the mowbray family were supposed to be within my grasp how painful was the distance at which they now appeared my present debility was felt with intolerable impatience to love and to be unable to heap happiness on the object beloved was a thought that assailed me with excruciating sensations at this very period another event happened that did not contribute to enliven the prospect i had lately received intelligence from my mother the tenor of which was that she dreaded the approach of poverty and about a fortnight after the departure of olivia a letter came by which i learned that lawyer thornby had refused all further supplies affirming that my grandfathers effects were entirely exhausted except the thousand pounds left by the rector at my own disposal of this i had already received fifty pounds and my mother urgently declared in her letter that if i did not apply part of the remainder for her support she should be left in the decline of life the approach of which she was now very ready to acknowledge in imminent danger of want nay so as perhaps even to come upon the parish my pride revolted at the very thought and i was angry with her for having conceived or committed it to paper should i suffer my mother to want no to become a pauper my heart spurned at the base suggestion i had been several years under the tuition of the rector and had acquired more than was good of his family dignity the picture before me was not a pleasing one but i would subject myself to any hardships ay would starve on a grain a day rather than abandon my mother my motives were mixed some wrong some right this affair made me resolve once more to visit my native country and my resolution was immediately put in practice it was a relief though of a painful kind to the more painful state in which my undecided thoughts at that moment held me the man whose contradictory impulses goad him in a thousand different directions without permitting him to pursue any one is happy to be put in motion my arrival was unexpected my mother who was but little inclined to accuse herself received me with much more satisfaction than embarrassment the behaviour of thornby was not quite so selfcomplacent my questions concerning the receipt and disbursement of my grandfathers property were sometimes answered with the affectation of open honesty and at others with petulant ambiguity so that i knew not whether he meant to shun or to provoke inquiry executorship was a very thankless office it involved a man in continual trouble for which he could receive no recompence and then subjected him to the suspicions of people who were unable or unwilling to look after their own affairs his very great friendship for the rector had induced him to take this office upon himself though he well knew the trouble and tediousness attending it and the ingratitude with which it was always repaid he had several times in his life played the fool in the same way and had always met with the same reward equivocation is the essence of law and i believe he spoke truth he should take care however not to involve himself in such officious troubles for the future as for the accounts he was ready at all times and desirous to have them settled he had been plagued enough and had even paid money out of his own pocket which he was sure whenever a balance came to be struck he should not be reimbursed but there were various affairs that he could not immediately close law accounts bad debts mortgages and other matters that required time he had business of his own to which he must attend or be ruined his clients would have good actions against him if it could be proved that their suits were lost by his neglect indeed he was not bound to give me any account but he always acted on the square and therefore defied scrutiny nay he wished it for what had an honest man to fear he talked so much of his honesty that if he did not quite persuade me it was immaculate he at least led me to doubt beside as he had reminded me what claims had i the property was bequeathed to my mother she had married her husband had squandered it away and there was an end of it farther inquiry was but vexation and loss of time it is true the supposed wealth of the rector had quickly disappeared but if the owner of it my mothers husband were satisfied what could be said she indeed hinted to me that wakefield finding he could wrest no more from his uncle unless by filing a bill in chancery or some other process at law for which he had no funds not to mention the great chance of his being cast in costs of suit had been obliged to desist though convinced that the property was not one half expended he had a better hope thornby was old had no children and might soon leave him the whole with most men this would have been a powerful motive but the passions of her young husband my mother owned were too impetuous to be restrained by the cold considerations of prudence at first she censured him with reluctance for to censure him was in reality to adduce mementos of her own folly but her resentment against him for having deserted her presently overpowered her caution and the pictures she drew shewed him to be not only dissipated and prodigal but unprincipled he had even so far offended the law that it was doubtful whether his life were not in danger and thornby whose plans had been frustrated by his extravagance had more ways than one of ridding himself of his importunity in any case it was necessary to make some provision for my mother and embroiled in doubt as i was the most prudent way that i could imagine was to consult thornby he affected to be very conscientious and scarcely knew what advice to give my mother was in want and to desert her would be cruel yet the money that was devised me was my own it was bequeathed for a good purpose and the pious will of the testator ought to be held sacred i was young the grandson of a good man an excellent man and his dear friend i had great learning and good sense and ought not to be deprived of the means that had been left me of establishing myself in life but then my mother had been tenderly brought up and a dutiful son to be sure could not desert his parent it was a difficult point to purchase a life annuity for her would be the best way of securing her against the miseries of poverty in old age but then it would sink deeply into the thousand pounds to make but a very moderate provision of this kind though he knew no other method in her case that would be so safe while i listened i resolved to provide for my mother i held to be an indispensable duty and notwithstanding my late disappointments my fears for myself were but few people of a sanguine temper are subject to temporary doubt and gloom but the sky soon clears and though one bright star may shoot and fall hope soon creates a whole constellation the earl and the prelate had both been unprincipled but the failure was in them not in me i could not but remember the terror that themistocles had excited in a prime minister and the avidity with which a prelate had endeavoured to profit by my theological talents how certainly and how soon could i bring these talents into notice how easy the task i need but mount the rostrum i need but put pen to paper and my adversaries would be brought to shame and mankind taught to do me justice incontrovertible facts were in my favour and to foster doubts and fears would be cowardice selfdesertion and folly such were my conclusions i determined therefore without farther hesitation to employ the sum of five hundred pounds in the purchase of an annuity for my mother the remainder would amply supply me till those rich mines should be explored from the fertile veins of which i had already drawn such dazzling specimens i continued in the country almost three weeks but as the purchase could not instantly be concluded i left the stipulated sum in my mothers possession drew the remainder of the thousand pounds in bills and cash from thornby and with more wealth than i ever bore about me at one time before returned to oxford though olivia was daily and hourly remembered i had recovered so far by the business in which i had been engaged as to think seriously of pursuing my studies for by their aid i was to realize those splendid projects on which as i supposed the happiness of man depends the learning which the general forms of taking a degree require is so little that a man of genius is inclined to treat it with contempt but if the candidate happen to be obnoxious to the heads of the university his examination may then be of a very different kind i had not much doubt for from the questions and answers i had so often heard on these occasions to reject me seemed to be almost impossible yet i was not entirely without alarm the disgrace of rustication that i had suffered the coldness of the reception i had met from the president on my return to college and the ambiguity which i conceived i had since remarked in his manner excited some fear and my preparatory efforts were so strenuous that i imagined i might defy reproof i had been told indeed that malice had a very strange mode of exerting itself but which was so arbitrary and odious as to be but rarely practised any member of convocation or master of arts without assigning any cause for his conduct may object for two terms to a person who shall ask leave to take his degree nay these terms ended another may object and another but this was a privilege so disgusting that i had not the least apprehension it would be put in practice against me to my utter astonishment i was mistaken on the day appointed to ask leave a master of arts actually did appear and without supporting his objection by reasoning charge or censure exercised this detestable university veto my surprize and indignation at hearing him pronounce his negative were so great that i was deprived of utterance i even doubted the reality of what i heard i stood gazing till he was gone and then exclaimed as if to a person presentme sirdo you mean me a minute afterward my interjections were not quite so inoffensive a torrent of passion burst from me and he whose malignity could not justly assert i wanted learning might had he stayed have collected sufficient proofs of my want of philosophy my attention had been diverted from the accuser by my amazement at the accusation but as soon as i recovered my recollection it seemed to me certain that i knew his face the idea was seized with so much eagerness and associations occurred so rapidly that the figure of one of my companions on the night of the debauch when i first came to oxford rose full before me though he had been absent from the university so that till this day i had never seen him since it was the very tutor of the earl of idford a train of the most tormenting suspicions rushed upon me i soon learned from inquiry that he was intimate likewise with the president was not this a combination what could it be else this tutor was connected with the earl and the president so was the latter with the bishop the whole plot in its blackest hues seemed developed my agitation was extreme i ran from college to college wherever i had acquaintance repeating all i knew and much of what i suspected nor did i merely confine myself to narrative i added threats which however impotent they might be were not the less violent one of my first projects was to seek personal satisfaction of the vile tutor or if he refused to chastise him with inexorable severity but this he had taken care to elude by keeping out of the way my denunciations soon reached the ear of the president and i was given to understand that if i were not immediately silent i should be expelled the university and that a degree would never be granted me till i had publicly retracted the opprobrious words i had uttered distant consequences are easily defied my blood was in a flame and despising the menace i publicly declared that my persecutors were as infamous as the tool they had employed that i should think it a disgrace to be a member of a body which could countenance proceedings so odiously wicked that i spurned at every honour such a body could confer and that with respect to expulsion i would myself erase my name from the register in which it had unfortunately been entered how little is man aware that by intemperance he damns his own cause and gives the face of seeming honesty to injustice itself vicious as the place is i myself could not abhor such proceedings more than many men in oxford would have done had they believed the tale fortune still continued in her wayward mood on the heel of one perverse imp another often treads while i remained at oxford which was but a few days after this event the retailing of my wrongs was my chief employment and in a coffeeroom to which i resorted for this purpose the following advertisement in a london newspaper met my astonished eye this day is published a defence of the thirty nine articles by the right reverend father in god lord bishop of injustice had by this time become so familiar to me that scourged even to frenzy as i was i sat rather stunned than transfixed by the blow that this was the very defence of the articles i had written did not with me admit of a moments doubt every thing i had heard or remarked of this wicked but weak church governor had afforded proof of his incapacity for such a task yet the injustice effrontery and vice of the act was what till seen could not have been believed nor did its baseness end here what could i suppose but that the bishop had been assiduously tampering with the president that they and the earl were in a conspiracy against me that this was the cause of the disgrace and insult put upon me and that having robbed me of my writings there was a concerted and fixed plan to render me contemptible take away my character and devote me to ruin the longer i thought the more painful were the sensations that assaulted me i had already been complaining to the whole city some few indeed seemed to credit me but more to suspect and none heard of my treatment with that glowing detestation which my feelings required were i to tell this new tale incredibly atrocious as it was what would men think but that i was a general calumniator a frantic egotist and a man dangerous to society the total inability that i felt in myself to obtain ample and immediate justice almost drove me mad i had previously determined to quit oxford and this new goad did but quicken my departure my preparations were soon made and from some vague and to myself undefined ideas partly of expedition and partly of letting the president the college and the whole university see that i hugh trevor was no ordinary person a chaise and four waited my commands at the gate about noon the next day behind which my goods and chattels were buckled and i after taking leave of the two or three friends who were thoughtless or courageous enough to acknowledge me threw myself indignantly into it with more maledictions in my heart than my impatient tongue could find energy to utter arrived in london it especially became me as i supposed to assume that consequence which should teach my enemies respect i had money in my pocket anger impelling me and more pride than prudence a waiter was dispatched from the gloucester coffeehouse and apartments for myself and a valet were hired in half moon street at three guineas and a half per week the valet was a sudden decision originating in the same false feelings that had lately taken possession of me when i consulted the mistress of the coffeehouse concerning apartments she said you have a servant to be sure sir yes madam replied my alarmed vanity no madam instantly retorted my veracity still more alarmed but i mean to hire one there continued she pointing to a smart well powdered young fellow that was talking to one of the waiters there stands one out of place who i dare say will be glad of a good master here philip i was one of the fools who right or wrong imagine it behooves them to be consistent i was ashamed to retract had not learned to prevaricate and philip to whom as a footman i could discover no rational objection was hired my effects were presently removed my useless valet sent to loiter and improve himself in vice as valets usually are and i left to meditate on the plan i had to pursue a little reflection induced me to renounce all thoughts of the church for which indeed the doubts that the conversation of turl had inspired me with the inquiries to which these doubts led and the disgust i had conceived at the character and conduct of the bishop had well prepared me for some time i sat perplexed in thought during the life of the rector i had often been told that the law was the road to honour and when at the university being eager to secure this said honour to myself i had laboriously read some of the civilians i say laboriously for the task was far from inviting the obscurity of their terms the contradictions i thought i discovered and the voluminous perplexity in which the whole was involved were no alluring pictures with what pleasure did the wearied intellect escape from this wilderness of weeds and brambles to rove through the paradise of poetry the minstrelsy of genius sporting with the fancy rouzing the passions and unfolding the secrets of the heart could fascinate at all times while nothing could sooner create lassitude and repugnance than the incongruous jargon of law but alas who ever heard of a poet being made lord high chancellor appoint him to such a station and he would act like a madman instead of employing his journeymen to dig through the rubbish of ignorance for precedents he would listen to the wants of the injured and would conceive that by relieving them only he could do justice did not the history of the world proclaim that he who would attain wealth and power must turn the prejudices of mankind to their own harm chapter ii the playhouse and an old acquaintance satirical portraits reception of a new comedy or of how much worth are praise and blame these were painful reflections and leaving the case undetermined for the present i escaped from them by shifting the scene to the playhouse it happened to be the first night of a new comedy and here in the boxes i perceived an acquaintance whom i had met at the house of ellis his name was glibly and the moment he saw me enter he advanced and accosted me with that familiarity which was essential to his character glad of company in a city where i was so little known i freely entered into conversation with him and the amusement he afforded me well repaid my complaisance he had long been what is called upon the town and was acquainted more or less with all orders of men he was intimate with authors actors and artists of every kind and degree knew their private and public history could give anecdotes of each and enumerate their various performances opera girls and their keepers musicians and musical dilletanti connoiseurs and their jackalls picture dealers and auctioneers collectors shell fossil and fiddle fanciers in short every class of idlers that i have since found swarming in this miscellaneous town ranked among his acquaintance he had long as i afterward discovered been a newspaper critic had written prologues appeared in poets corner abounded in sarcastic remarks and possessed an athenian loquacity he had indeed a copious vocabulary an uncommon aptitude of phrase though not free from affectation and a tide of tongue that was incessant he probably thought my personal appearance creditable for he did not quit me during the performance but amused me with the satirical portraits of various people whom he pointed out to me in the house do you see that man said he who is just entering three boxes distant on the right he is handing two ladies to their seats and is followed by a youngster who is all pertness and powder they make a great shew and on a first night give an appearance of good company that is mynheer van hopmeister a dutch dancingmaster with his daughter son and a kept mistress they live all together on very good terms and his own girl has preserved her character by her ugliness affectation and ill breeding he drives about in his chariot which passing in the street you would suppose belonged to a neapolitan count or a german envoy at least he gives dinners occasionally of several removes to which he invites all the fools and fiddlers he can find treats with french wines and usually makes up a quartet party for the evening which he spoils by playing a principal part himself he is nearly two thousand pounds in debt and in all things mimicking the great has been obliged to put his affairs to nurse except the booby his son he is the most prating forward ignorant coxcomb of my acquaintance and that is a bold word but his impertinence makes him amusing i will introduce you i thanked my gentleman for his politeness but declined the offer and he continued look at that man in brown leaning against the pillar he is a painter and a man of genius but the greatest ass existing how of genius and hear and judge for yourself no man has studied his art with so much assiduity and zeal or practised it with greater enthusiasm but instead of confining himself to portraitpainting by which with half the labour and one tenth of the talent he might have made a fortune he devoted all his youth to poverty and starving and undertook a series of paintings that would have immortalized a man under the patronage of leo x this task he was years in accomplishing living all the while on little better than bread and water and that procured by robbing his nights of the hours of rest for his pride which he calls independence is as great as his ambition which he dignifies with the title of a love of fame but the most prominent trait in his character is a jealous here my commentator suddenly interrupting himself pressed my arm and bade me turn to the left there said he pointing is a mr migrate a famous clerical character and as strange an original as any this metropolis affords he is not entitled to make a figure in the world either by his riches rank or understanding but with an effrontery peculiar to himself he will knock at any mans door though a perfect stranger ask him questions give him advice and tell him he will call again to give him more the first opportunity by this means he is acquainted with every body but knows nobody is always talking yet never says any thing is perpetually putting some absurd interrogation but before it is possible he should understand the answer puts another his desire to be informed torments himself and every man of his acquaintance which is almost every man he meets yet though he lives inquiring he will die consummately ignorant his brain is a kind of rag shop receiving and returning nothing but rubbish it is as difficult to affront as to get rid of him and though you fairly bid him begone today he will knock at your door march into your house and if possible keep you answering his unconnected fifty times answered queries tomorrow he is the friend and the enemy of all theories and of all parties and tortures you to decide for him which he ought to chuse as far as he can be said to have opinions they are crude and contradictory in the extreme so that in the same breath he will defend and oppose the same system with all this confusion of intellect there is no man so wise but he will prescribe to him how he ought to act and even send him written rules for his conduct he has been a great traveller and continually abuses his own countrymen for not adopting the manners and policy of the most ignorant depraved and barbarous nations of europe and africa he pretends to be the universal friend of man a philanthropist on the largest scale yet is so selfish that he would willingly see the world perish if he could but secure paradise to himself indeed he can think of no other being and his child his canary bird his cookmaid or his cat are the most extraordinary of gods creatures this is the only consistent trait in his character in the same sentence he frequently joins the most fulsome flattery and some insidious question that asks the person whom he addresses if he do not confess himself to be both knave and fool delicacy of sentiment is one of his pretensions though his tongue is licentious his language coarse and he is occasionally seized with fits of the most vulgar abuse he declaims against dissimulation yet will smilingly accost the man whomha migrate how do you do give me leave to introduce you to mr trevor a friend of mine a gentleman and a scholar just come from oxford your range of knowledge and universal intimacy with men and things may be useful to him and his erudite acquisitions and philosophical research will be highly gratifying to an inquirer like you an intercourse between you must be mutually pleasing and beneficial and i am happy to bring you acquainted this addressed to the man whom he had been satirizing so unsparingly was inconceivable the unabashed facility with which he veered from calumny to compliment the very moment too after he had accused the man whom he accosted of dissimulation struck me dumb i had perhaps seen something like it before but nothing half so perfect in its kind it doubly increased my stock of knowledge it afforded a new instance of what the world is and a new incitement to ask how it became so the inquiry at first was painful and half convinced me of the truth of manicheism but deeper research taught me that the errors of man do not originate in the perversity of his nature but of his ignorance these however were most of them after thoughts for glibly did not allow us any long pause yonder in the green boxes said he i perceive mrs fishwife the actress she should have played in the comedy we are come to see but threw up her part from scruples of conscience it was not sufficiently refined for her exquisite sensibility it wounded her feelings offended her morals and outraged her modesty yet in the greenroom she is never happy unless when the men are relating some lewd tale or repeating obscene jests at every one of which she bursts into a horse laugh and exclaimsoh you devil but i dont hear you i dont understand a word you say to heighten the jest her armours are as public as the ladies on harriss list but perhaps there is something violently offensive and immoral in the part she refused not a syllable the writer is too dull even for a double entendre as you will hear mere pretence the author who happens by some odd accident to have more honesty than wit and could not in conscience comply with the present vicious mode of bestowing indiscriminate praise on actors when no small mixture of blame had been merited by many of them forbore to write a preface to his last piece from which she had thought herself secure of a large dose of flattery this is an offence she can never pardon i have heard said migrate that our actresses are become exceedingly squeamish oh ridiculous beyond belief i have a letter in my pocket from a young friend in a country company the ladies of which have their sensibility strung up to so fine a tone that he cannot take the tragedy of king lear for his benefit because not one of them will play either regan or goneril if their feelings are so exquisite in the country where our wise laws treat players as vagabonds what must they be when loaded with all the legal tragic and royal dignity of a london theatre this was so incredible that i expressed my doubts of the fact but they were ill founded for glibly produced the letter a moment afterward two more of his acquaintance caught his eye look to the right said he the box next the gallery there they sit mr and mrs whifflewit they are now in state they have really a capacious appearance were rubens or jordaens but here we should have them painted in all the riches of oil colours grinning in company with silenus and his ass let the poor author beware they are prodigious critics madam can write a farce or even a solution to an enigma with as little labour as any lady in the land and her dear mr whifflewit can set them both to music with no less facility and genius nothing can equal them except his own jigs on the organ they never fail to attend the first night of a new play and their taste is so very refined that nothing less than writing it themselves could afford them satisfaction they never admire any nonsense but their own the manager and author have always to thank them for exerting their whole stock of little wit and abundant envy to put the house into an ill temper the favour is the more conspicuous because they are orderly people but that perhaps is a phrase you do not understand mr trevor they never pay for their places yet always occupy a first row for themselves and in general the rest of the box for their friends who they take good care shall be as well disposed toward the house and the author as they are you may be sure to meet them tomorrow very industriously knocking at every door where they can gain admission to tell their acquaintance what a vile piece it was and what a strange blockhead the manager must be who had refused farces of their writing and operas of their setting yet could dare to insult the town with such trash they have now continued for years in this state of surprise and there is no knowing when it will end the satire of glibly was incessant till the tinkling of the prompters bell and the rising of the curtain put an end to his remarks on persons and turned them all on the piece i cannot but own the author opened an ample field for the effluvia of critic gall i know not whether glibly might influence the tone of my mind but i think i never felt such ineffable contempt for any human production as for the thing called a comedy which i that night saw disjointed dialogue no attempt at plan or fable each scene a different story and each story improbable and absurd quibbles without meaning puns without point cant without character sentiments as dull as they were false and a continual outrage on manners morals and common sense were its leading features yet strange to tell the audience endured it all and by copious retrenchments and plaistering and patching this very piece had what is called a run how capricious a thing is public taste it can regale on garbage from which hottentots would turn with loathing and yet in the frenzy of idiotism could reject and condemn congreves way of the world glibly treated the piece with unceasing contempt yet clapped every scene and when on two or three occasions some few raised their voices and called off off he more loudly than the rest vociferated go on go on when it was over he left me saying it was the most execrable piece he had ever beheld but he had promised to give it a good character in the paper with which he was connected and this he must immediately go and write chapter iii repetition of doubts a very old acquaintance another pleasing rencontre perplexity and suspense created the adventures of the evening sent me home with no very agreeable reflections what a world was this how replete with folly hypocrisy and vice what certainly had the man of virtue that his claims should be heard amid the tumultuous pursuits of selfishness where all were eager to gratify their own passions and appease the capricious cravings of vanity how might truth and worth ascertain success the comedy i had seen had convinced me that farce inanity and supreme nonsense might not only pass current but find partisans yet proofs in abundance were on record that genius itself had no security against faction envy and mistaken opposition i was at present in a state of warfare and were judges like these to give the meed of victory how many creatures had the powerful and the proud obedient to their beck ever ready to affirm deny say and unsay and by falsehood and defamation involve in ruin men whose souls were the most pure and principles the most exalted for some days i remained in a state of suspense continually determining to seek the satisfaction which i supposed my injuries demanded but undecided with respect to the method this delay was still prolonged by another event my man philip one morning when he brought my breakfast told me that a woman in the house who lived with a young lady on the second floor had asked him various questions concerning me saying she was sure she knew me that she loved me from her soul for that i had once saved the life of her and her dear boy and that she wished very much to see me at first this account surprised me a woman and a boy whose lives i had saved where is she said i below in the kitchen answered philip i bade him desire her to come up and in a few minutes a woman about the age of forty entered but of whose countenance i had no clear recollection i beg pardon sir said she for my boldness but your name i believe is mr trevor it is mr hugh trevor the same god in his mercy bless and keep you since the night that you saved my life i never went to bed without praying for you but you were always a kind dear good child and your uncle mr elford was the best of men the epithet child and the name of elford instantly solved the riddle it was poor mary and the boy whose life i had saved was the child of which she was delivered after the adventure of the barn her features suddenly became as it were familiar to me she revived a long train of ideas inspiring that kind of melancholy pleasure which mind so much delights to encourage i kissed her with sincere good will and in sympathy with my feelings the poor creature yielding to her affections clasped me round the neck pressed me to her cheek exclaimed god in heaven for ever bless you then suddenly recollecting herself with that honest simplicity which was so constitutionally her character dropped on her knees and added i humbly beg pardon sir for being so bold after some persuasion i prevailed on her to sit down but i could not conquer her timidity and imaginary inferiority so far as to induce her to partake of my breakfast she knew her duty better i was a gentleman once her dear young master and she should always adore me and act as was befitting a poor servant like her we talked over former affairs and she brought many scenes of my early youth strongly to recollection on inquiry she told me she had apprenticed her son to a printer that till this period she had fed clothed and educated him by her own industry and that he was now likely to be no longer burthensome to her being an apt and industrious boy and already capable of supplying himself with clothes by his overwork i farther learnt from her discourse that she lived with a young lady whom she affectionately loved and there was something mysterious occasionally in her phrases that led me to imagine her mistress had been unfortunate she had been a kind mistress to her she loved her in her heart poor young lady she did not deserve the mishaps she had met with and it was a shame that some men should be so base as they were but though all the world should turn their back on her she would not be so wicked poor women were born to be misused by falsehearted men and if they had no pity for one another what must become of them i asked if she had lived with the lady long she answered that first and last she had known her ever since she left mr elfords service what was she of our county yea was i acquainted with her mary hesitated and my curiosity was rouzedwhat was the ladys name miss lydia wilmot wilmot wilmot surely not miss wilmot the niece of the bishop of no no said mary as not his niece a has better blood in her veins thof mayhap a may have had her failings god help us who is without em a bishop lord ha mercy on us no christian soul could have believed there was so much wickedness in the world my impatience increased and i eagerly demandeddid she ever live with the bishop poor mary knew not what to answer i perceived her confusion go mary said i and tell miss wilmot that mr trevor presents his compliments to her and will be glad to speak to her the moment she is at leisure after a little hesitation mary went continued up stairs some time and at last returned withmiss wilmots compliments she should be glad to see me i hurried to her apartment my conjectures were too well founded to be false it was the same miss wilmot to whom i had been introduced by the bishop the sister of the guide of my studies and the friend of my youth her embarrassment was considerable she sunk on the sopha as she curtsied pointed to a chair and faintly requested i would sit down i exerted myself to assume the tone that should tranquilize her feelings and by asking and answering my own questions and endeavouring myself to sustain the conversation brought her with some little difficulty to join in it i was burning to interrogate her concerning the bishop but was restrained by the fear of wounding her sensibility i inquired after her brother but him i found she had not lately seen i forebore to be minute but it appeared that they knew not the place of each others abode i sat with her an hour but notwithstanding my impatience perceiving she evaded the subject i wished to introduce and turned the discourse on the common place occurrences of the day i was too respectful of her delicacy to violate it and left her with an invitation to drink tea with me the following afternoon which she accepted i saw mary again in the interim had some discourse with her and by several phrases which she once more let fall was involved in greater perplexity a person of my family had a ruinated miss wilmot of all hope she never could have justice and right done her now that was impossable but mayhap all things was for the best the base man had shewn that he was not worth having she was sorry both on her ladyships account and mine but there was no help for it god send him a good end but she feared it such wickedness could never prosper this language was totally incomprehensiblea person of my family the base man sorry on my account what did she mean mary was afraid she had said too muchi dare not tell you dear good sir continued she only dont you be cunsarned it is no blame of yours you will know soon enough in this uncertainty she left me impatiently hoping some farther explanation from miss wilmot of which i was not disappointed the afternoon came mary announced her mistress we were left alone and i could no longer forbear expressing my desire of knowing her history at first she felt some reluctance but when i informed her how much mary had already told she sighed deeply and said i find sir it is in vain to think of concealment i will therefore since you desire it relate the few events that are remarkable in my unfortunate life i fear they are more blameable than extraordinary for from what i hear and see in this great city mine are no uncommon misfortunes i even fear i am hitherto less wretched and guilty than thousands god only knows for what i am reserved chapter iv the story of miss wilmot family misfortunes a fathers death a brothers disappointment intelligence that astonishes me wakefield characterized the death of miss wilmots mother and the dread of fatal consequences piety and compassion of a bishop deep designs of wakefield the good faith and affection of a poor adherent my father was an officer in the army in which though he served all his life he only attained the rank of major he was twice married the second time to my mother at the age of thirty by whom he had five children who except my brother and myself did not arrive at maturity being reduced to the income of halfpay they retired into their native county where they lived with such strict oeconomy that they contrived to educate us better perhaps than the children of people of much larger fortune my brother was the eldest child and i the youngest so that there was an interval of fifteen years between us my father had been well educated loved letters and undertook to be my brothers instructor himself to the age of fourteen at this period my brother was admitted a chorister at the cathedral of at which city my parents had fixed their residence they were respected by all the inhabitants whose wealth birth and pride did not place them at too great a distance and it was a severe mortification to be unable to provide better for their son but there was no remedy the disappointments of my fathers life had given him a melancholy cast with an aptitude to be dissatisfied and this propensity was strongly communicated to my brother the danger of a war between england and spain called my father up to town in the hope of being once more put on actual service but in this his hopes again were frustrated and expence without benefit was incurred early however in the american war he obtained his wishes unhappily obtained them for having been long unused to the baneful severity of camps he and many more brave men were carried off by the damps of the climate to which he was sent this happened when i was but nine years old and my mother was left with what little their economy had collected and such scanty provision as is made for officers widows my brother however who was truly affectionate and active in efforts to protect us afforded my mother some aid from being a chorister he had gained admission into the grammarschool of which while he remained there he was the pride and boast immediately after our fathers death from the recommendation of his own merit and the misfortunes of the family he was appointed a latin usher in the same school in which station he remained five years the difference of our age made him consider himself something rather like a father than a brother to me he loved me tenderly took every method to improve and provide for me and expected in return something like parental obedience the manners of my mother were of the mild and pleasing kind with which qualities she endeavoured to familiarize me and the behaviour of the whole family gained general approbation and esteem my brother was deeply smitten with the love of letters his poetical essays were numerous many of them were sent up to london and readily admitted into periodical publications anxious to place his family in that rank which he had been taught to suppose it deserved for my father and mother were both though not noble well born he did not rest satisfied with these attempts he wrote a tragedy and by the advice of people who pretended to have a knowledge of such affairs determined to go to london that he might if possible get it on the stage from this my mother would fain have dissuaded him but his arguments and importunity at length prevailed he was then but nine and twenty and i fourteen i could ill describe to you the state of anxiety and suspence in which his various literary efforts involved him while he remained in london but in about two years he returned to the country despairing of that pleasure profit and fame which hope had delusively taught him to consider as his due this was the period at which he once more became an usher of the school where you were educated this too was the period at which my misfortunes began and now mr trevor i am coming to events in which you without any knowledge or interference of your own may be said to be a partaker she paused a moment and i with amazement doubt and increasing ardour requested she would proceed the name of wakefield must certainly be familiar to you it is i am sorry to say it is the name my mother at present bears if you feel sorrow mr trevor what must my feelings be mine who had there been truth or honour in man ought to have borne that name myself mine who when i first heard of your mothers marriage should not have felt so severe a pang had a dagger been struck to my heart mine who from that moment or rather from the fatal and guilty moment when i confided in an unprincipled man have never known that cheerfulness and peace which once were the inmates of my bosom you astonish me madam wakefield wakefield him have i to thank for loss of selfrespect a brothers love and perhaps a parents life i was my mothers companion consolation and pride how can i estimate a mothers grief she died within a year have i not reason to believe her days were shortened by her daughters guilt the pain of recollection was agonizing she burst into a flood of tears nor could every effort she made keep down the deep sobs that for some minutes impeded speech i used every endeavour to appease and calm her mind she seemed sensibly touched by that sympathy which intensely pervaded me and as soon as she could recover herself thus continued the kind part you take in my affliction mr trevor affords me greater relief than any that perhaps i have felt for years it is true the faithful mary good creature has almost shed tear for tear but she herself is the daughter of misfortune and from her though grateful it is something like expected you are a man you perhaps have been accustomed to the society of those whose pleasure is the most exquisite when they can most contribute to the miseries of woman that you should be virtuous enough to contemn such instruction does more than sooth feelings like mine and i think we esteem benefits the more the less we expect them but where madam did you first meet with mr wakefield in the city of where he was bred under his father to the profession of the law from what i have seen of you and from what i have heard of your talents and understanding i should have expected you to have been the child of extraordinary parents otherwise i do not much wonder at your mothers conduct superior as she was to mr wakefield in years for of all the men i ever saw he is the most deceitful plausible and dangerous neither man nor woman are safe with him and his arts are such as to overreach the most cautious he has words at will and his wit and invention which are extraordinary are employed to entrap humiliate degrade and ruin all with whom he has intercourse his ambition is to gratify his desires by triumphing over the credulity of the unsuspecting whom he contemns for their want of his own vices it was he that after having seduced me placed me in the family of the bishop laid the plan that i should pass for his lordships niece by various falsehoods cajoled me to acquiesce the chief of which was that the project was but to save appearances till he could make me his wife left me in that unworthy prelates power then returning to the country plotted the marriage with your mother and by his intimate knowledge of the weakness or vice of each character which he seems to catch instinctively adapted his scheme with such cunning to the avarice of his uncle as to gain his concurrence and aid it was my clandestine departure at this period and the rumours and suspicions to which it gave birth that again drove my brother from the country for some months neither he nor my mother knew what was become of me at length her decline and the extreme affliction of dying and never hearing of me more occasioned her to prevail on my brother to advertise me in all the papers this he did by inserting the initials of my name and such other tokens as he knew must be intelligible to me should i read the advertisement informing me at the same time of the dying state of my mother his plan so far succeeded as to come to my knowledge i read the paper was seized with horror at the information and immediately wrote in answer it was too late my mother was dead and i left in that state of distraction to which by a single moments weakness i had been thus fatally conducted grief despondency and resentment took firm possession of my brothers mind he wrote me a dreadful letter of the state of his feelings and though he forebore explicitly to accuse me of my mothers death i could perceive the thought pervaded his mind after her funeral he came up to london but refused all intercourse with me once excepted a few days only after that on which the bishop introduced you to me he came knocked at the door inquired if i were at home and sent up his name of all the moments of my life that was the most awful a deathlike coldness seized me the sound of my brothers name was horror i know not what i said to the servant but the feelings of mr wilmot were too racking for delay he was presently before me dressed in deep mourning i motionless and dead he haggard the image of despair so changed in form that but for the sharp and quick sighted suspicions of guilt had i met him i should have passed him without suspecting him to be my brother i can tell you but little of what passed his sentences were incoherent but half finished and bursting with passion that was neither grief nor rage nor reproach nor pardon though a mixture of them all the chief impression that he left upon my mind was that he should soon be freed from the torment of existence not by the course of nature he complained with agony that labour disappointment injustice and contamination itself could not kill him but die he would from that day to this i have never seen or heard word of him more the deep despair with which he uttered his last resolution has kept me in a state of uninterrupted terror i daily read all the papers i can buy or borrow with the excruciating dread every paragraph i come to of catching his name and oh insufferable horror reading an account of his death my state of being seems wholly changed i am no longer the same creature my faculties which formerly compared to those of my brother i thought slow even to stupidity are now awakened to such keenness of discernment that the world is multiplied upon me a million fold sometimes it is all intelligence though of a dark and terrific hue at other moments objects swarm so thick that they dance confusion and give me a foretaste of madness to which i have now a constant fear that i shall be driven my own deep shame the loss of the man whom like an idiot i dearly loved my mothers death my brothers letter and particularly his last visit have altogether given such an impetuosity to my thoughts as i want the power to repel whither they will hurry me god only knows at one interval i imagine the earth contains nothing but evil at another strange to tell all is good all is wise all harmonious and i reproach my own extreme folly for wanting happiness under so perfect a system nay there are times in which i persuade myself i have been guilty of no crime that there is no such thing as crime and that the distinctions of men are folly invented by selfishness and continued by ignorance indeed i know not whither my thoughts do not range at one moment i seem as if i were actually free to penetrate the bowels of the earth dive into the deep transport myself with a wish from planet to planet or from sun to sun endure all extremes overcome them master all resistance and be myself omnipotent the very next instant perhaps i doubt if i have really any existence if waking and dreaming be not the same thing and whether either of them are definable or intelligible at this very moment i know not whither my thoughts are wandering or whether i ought not to snatch up this or the other weapon of death and instantly strike you breathless for having dared to listen to my shame while she spoke her eyes sparkled and flashed with that wildness which her tongue with such rapid imagery pictured forth had it continued the tumult might have been dangerous perhaps fatal but fortunately the firmness and intrepidity of my mind were equal to the scene with a cool and collected benevolence of look and with a determined though not severe tone of voice i said my dear miss wilmot be calm pause a moment recollect yourself i am your friend i hope you will never find another man your foe the idea suggested an opposite association to her active thoughts in an instant the fire vanished her eyes were suffused her features relaxed and she again burst into tears and sobs i was careful not to interrupt the tide of passion it gave relief and she presently became more calm desirous as i was of hearing particulars concerning the bishop i gladly listened when after a sufficient pause she thus resumed her tale you must not wonder mr trevor that i do not tell my story in a connected manner whenever i think on the subject the incidents i have related press upon my mind produce sensations i cannot command and for a time obliterate less momentous circumstances the part which the bishop acted in this tragic drama is what i have yet to relate mr wakefields father who let me here remark was an unprincipled man and died insolvent happened professionally as a lawyer to have certain temporalities in the county where he resided to manage for the bishop this brought his son acquainted with the character of the prelate the relationship in which i stood to himi interrupted her to whom madam the bishop i understood he was no relation of yours he is and is not pray explain he is by marriage twice removed not the least by blood his late lady a widow when he married her was the halfsister of my fathers first wife so that by the courtesy of custom he is called my uncle he is too artful not to have a shelter for his proceedings she continued an adept which as i have before said mr wakefield is in reading the weak and vicious inclinations of the human heart he hoped not only to have rid himself of importunity from me but by rendering me subservient to this unholy bishops vile propensities to have played a deeper game this is his delight the pleasure he receives in making other mens follies passions and vices administer to his own is the greatest he knows were he but the cunningest man on earth he would think himself the greatest his character sympathized with that of the bishop who was happy to find so artful and so active an agent it was not till i had been in the prelates family some time that the whole of their design was explained to me the bishop frequently used strange and to me unintelligible expressions disgusting from any man but from him inexpressively offensive and odious yet the full import of them i did not so much as suspect nor did he omit to make the solemnity of his supposed character an abettor to his hypocrisy feelings of compassion moral affection and christian forgiveness were assumed when i first entered his house he gave me to understand that he was acquainted with my crime this after mentioning it as a serious sin affecting pity he qualified away and as people in all such situations must talked an incoherent jargon that god hated and loved such sinners that religion was all powerful but that man was frail that christ died to save us and therefore though we should fall as perhaps the best of us were subject to back slidings his mercy was all sufficient but on this and every occasion he was careful to say nothing open and direct by which he should be detected if ever he ventured so far as to excite serious questions from me he was ever ready with evasive answers and had something like reasoning to offer in defence of his own manners and in ridicule of prudery he began with caution but when he had accustomed me to such discourse and after i had heard it repeated even in the presence of his clerical companions of which you mr trevor were once a witness my surprize wore away the pain it gave me was diminished and he became less and less reserved still however he did not venture openly to declare himself and mr wakefield was too busy in wasting your mothers fortune and gratifying his own desires to attend to those of the bishop but his prodigality which is excessive after a time brought him to london and the bishop imagined that with his help my scruples would at last be conquered the trial was made not by the cautious bishop but by mr wakefield how such a proposition coming from the man whom i had dearly loved and whose wife in justice i considered myself to be was received you who have a sense of the feelings of a highly injured and justly indignant heart may conceive yet impassioned determined and almost frantic as i was it was with difficulty he could relinquish his plan till that hour i never believed him so utterly devoid of principle but he then laid bare his heart hoping to make me a convert to its baseness he exulted in the power we should obtain over this sensual prelate and the sums which by these means we might extort he looked with transport forward to the opening which this would afford for projects still much deeper the vices of the great with which he might thus become intimate afforded a field ample as his own vice could wish nor could all the impatience of indignation with which i continually interrupted him impede that flow which the subject inspired at length disgusted beyond sufferance i abruptly left him and sought relief from the racking sensations which he had excited he then entered into a correspondence with me till i threatened to shew his letters to the bishop this induced him to desist and for some time i heard from him no more at last he wrote once again informing me that you mr trevor were come to london characterizing you as ignorant of the world and easily deceived telling me that you were intimate with the bishop and advising me to promote a plan of marriage between us which he had proposed to the prelate as the best way in his own phrase of making all things smooth i hope the deep shame i felt when the bishop introduced you and made the experiment was sufficiently visible to convince you how repugnant my feelings were to such a crime the bishop finding his first purpose thus defeated and himself encumbered by a kind of claimant which his acknowledging me as a niece had brought upon him was determined at all events to rid himself of me immediately before he left town he wrote me a letter telling me that my loss of character was become too public for me to receive any further countenance from a man under the moral and divine obligations which every bishop of the church of christ must be that he was going on a visit to his diocese that he could not think of taking me it was too flagrantly improper and that he advised and expected i should immediately return to my relations further hoping that i should see the enormity of my conduct and reform oh mr trevor what a world is this had he offered me money i should have rejected it with disdain but he had not even that much charity i instantly quitted the house with a few shillings only in my pocket mary had lived with me and my mother for some years before my elopement after my mothers death my residence in the bishops family being known i sent for her up to town and hired her her artless affection made her my confidante my situation required it and when she heard the bishops letter read the kind creature with honest anger instantly went and gave him warning a quarters wages was all her wealth for the earnings of her labour she had constantly expended on her boy for whom she seems to have more than a mothers affection she has been my constant comforter seeing the tears in my eyes as we left the bishops house with a look of mingled pity and indignation she exclaimeddo not grieve dear madam though i work my fingers to the bone you shall not want miss wilmot was proceeding with her narrative when she was interrupted by the hasty entrance of mary oh madam said she the dear young lady and her maid are below they were coming up stairs but i told them that you had a gentleman with you whereof at which the young lady seemed a little in amaze till i gave her to know that it was only a friend of your brothers a person from our own honest country and she would then a gone away but as i said i was sure you would be glad to see her and would go up a purpose to your own room so do you go madam and ill run down and tell her miss wilmot immediately took her leave and though my curiosity was a little awakened a sense of decorum would not suffer me to endeavour to see her visitor i therefore shut the door and as soon as all was silent on the stairs i took my hat and walked out that by changing the scene i might dissipate a part of the melancholy which her story had produced chapter v anger unabated more news of the bishop deliberation on the mode of my revenge the articles answered and new assailing doubts a visit to turl advice given and rejected and former feelings revived the next morning when i came to reflect on all that i had heard i was surprised with the degree in which by my mothers marriage with wakefield i appeared to be implicated in the history the character of wakefield his prodigality and total want of principle were all of a dangerous cast not satisfied with beggaring my mother he had projected to marry me to his mistress the recollection of him roused resentment and cunning and inventive as he was described to be i wished for an opportunity of punishing his baseness teaching him his own insignificance and treating him with the contempt he deserved if attacked i had not yet learned the philosophy of forbearance though i have been hurried forward too fast to narrate every little incident as it occurred yet it cannot be imagined that i all this while neglected to peruse the defence of the articles published in the bishops name no it was my very first employment on my arrival in town and though considerable trouble had been bestowed to disfigure the work as written by me yet in substance i found it to be the same the wrongs of miss wilmot quickened my feelings and angry as i was with wakefield i felt emotions of ten fold bitterness against the bishop association easily conjured up the earl the president the tutor themistocles and the injustice and disgrace i had suffered at oxford the fermentation was so great that i was determined immediately to expose them to the broad shame that should drive them from human society in this benevolent project i was confirmed by another piece of intelligence one of the rich sees of the kingdom had become vacant the kings conge delire was issued and gods holy vicar the bishop of himself was translated what could i conclude but that the defence which i had written had been the cause i had been made the stepping stone of vice i remembered the proceeding of the despot frederic of prussia with the immortal voltaire the orange had been squeezed and the rind thrown to rot in the highway my teeth gnashed with the abundance of my wrath and the impotence of my means i had hitherto forborne to write from a perplexity of different plans at one moment i determined to address my foes in the public papers at another i would concentrate the story and relate the whole in a pamphlet now it should be a history anon a satirical novel asmodeus in london in which i would draw the characters in such perfection that without mentioning names the persons should be visible to every eye but then this would not be sufficiently serious thousands might mistake that for fiction which i wished all the world to know was fact to give them the least shelter was cowardly to myself treacherous to society and encouragement to the criminal at last the pamphlet was the mode on which i determined and it was begun with all the enthusiasm that the accumulating circumstances could not but inspire in a being constituted like me eager after every species of aggravation my anger could never be hot enough the gall of my ink was milk to that of my heart the bitterness of my feelings was tormenting words that could burn contempt that could kill shame that could annihilate these and nothing less could satisfy me could the serpent revenge fly how would it dart and sting happily for man it can only crawl that i had been treated with great injustice was true but of justice my notions were very inadequate of revenge i had more than enough for a nation while hot in the pursuit of this task i was diverted from it by the publication of an answer to the articles the moment i saw it advertised not sufficiently habituated to the vice of indolence myself to recollect that i had an idle footman below i hurried to the publishers purchased it and returned with a greyhound speed to devour its contents disgusted as i was with the members of the church and beginning even to doubt of the perfect orthodoxy of the church itself i still had too high an opinion of my own arguments to imagine the wit of man could overturn them my haste had been so great that i had not taken off the paper in which the pamphlet was wrapped and in the shop i had read no more than the titlepage what was my surprise when snatching it from my pocket and opening it i discovered at the conclusion of a short preface the name of turl its author my emotions were confused at one moment an answer from him was what i wished the next it was something like what i feared in all argument i had hitherto found him so cool so collected and so clear that to my imagination he perhaps was the only man on earth fit to cope with me but the grating question was i fit to cope with him would now and then recur i could not but feel that i had in a certain manner been subdued and cowed by his greater extent of knowledge perspicuity and masculine genius by thoughts like these my anxiety if not my ardour was increased and i began to read my forebodings were fulfilled the impotence of my arguments was exposed their absurdity and selfcontradiction ridiculed their evil tendency demonstrated their falsehood rendered odious and the author of them treated like a child my self respect was wounded at every line each paragraph was a death stab and i never before felt myself so completely ridiculous as a lesson of philosophy it was the most serious salutary and impressive i ever received for though while reading i affirmed to myself that every thing urged against me was weak or ill founded inconclusive or absolutely false yet the arguments returned with increasing and reiterated force haunting and oppressing me like a painful dream from which i could not awake the evil tendency which he proved against my doctrines was the least to be forgotten as far as i understood myself i had a sincere love of truth and an unfeigned desire to benefit not mislead and oppress mankind as the author of the defence the heavy charge of immorality was brought against me not by personal attacks on my substitute the bishop but by a detail of the consequences of such doctrines this event made me pause and consider though with but little propensity to candour concerning the pamphlet on which i was then engaged consideration however did but seem to confirm me in my purpose let my defence be right or wrong and i had by no means yet decided in the negative still the turpitude of the bishop and my persecutors was no less flagitious these incidents once more turned my thoughts toward turl whom i knew not whether to admire love or hate i was not so entirely overwhelmed but that i had arguments at least i had words at my command beside i felt a wish to communicate to him my projected attack and perhaps read a part of my pamphlet that it might as it certainly must meet his approbation i felt satisfied that what he approved could not be wrong and how disapprove on former occasions indeed my hopes in this respect had been deceived but now it was impossible the case was so clear in the present instance there could be but one opinion feelings which were not the most honourable to myself for their source was egotism had withheld me from visiting him since my return but these were now subdued by others that were more imperious i was not satisfied with requiring his approbation of my plan of vengeance my choleric vanity challenged him to the lists and the combat was resolved upon as i was going i recollected the shortness of the period in which his answer had been composed and published and this did but remind me of the champion i had to encounter i found him as before tranquily pursuing his labours except that now he was writing engaged as i imagined on the grand work he had projected though his copper and engraving tools lay dispersed by his side he received me as usual with calmness but not without an evident mixture of pleasure irritable as my feelings were i had always experienced something infinitely more dissatisfactory in being angry with him than with any other person in his countenance there was a sedate undeviating rectitude that but for my impetuous disdain of all restraint would have inspired awe yet whenever his eye met the eye of another there was something so benevolent as almost to disarm ill humour replete with new arguments as i supposed but which in reality were only a repetition of those i had already adduced i burst upon him with a multitude of words defending my own defence of the articles and attacking his answer he made various ineffectual attempts to arrest my career and at last was obliged to suffer me to weary myself after which he calmly replied the best answer i can give to all you have urged is to request you will read the defence of the articles and my answer again with care either i am mistaken or you will find every thing you have said already confuted i endeavoured to divert him from this defence by reference but he continued to urge that he should only weaken his cause by answering desultory arguments in a desultory way which in the present case would be folly because his answer was already given in a clear and as he believed conclusive manner finding his purpose not to be shaken i asked him if he were aware that i was the author of the defence of the articles he answered that seeing the bishops name to the publication he could not but suppose the bishop himself had been intimately concerned in the writing of the work but from what i had formerly told him he had suspected me to be a fellowlabourer if so said i mr turl how did it happen that you felt no aversion to the confutation as you suppose of a man for whom you had professed a regard he replied you mr trevor are well acquainted with my answer socrates is my friend plato is my friend but truth is more my friend if i myself had written falsehood yesterday and now knew it to be such i would answer it to day would not you it was a home question and i was silent this subject ended he made some kind and cordial inquiries concerning my present pursuits and these furnished the opportunity of unburthening my heart i related to him with all the indignation which resentment inspired my whole history and ended with informing him of my determination to publish the vice and infamy of all the parties to the world on this a dialogue began which way will you publish them in a narrative that i am now writing a sense of duty has obliged me to tell you that in my opinion you have been guilty of several mistakes already you are now intent upon another how so the excess of your anger perverts your judgment and you cannot write such a narrative without keeping your passions in a vitiated state owing to the prejudices of mankind you will impeach your own credibility moderate men will think you rash the precise will call you a detractor and the partisans who are numerous of the persons you will attempt to expose will raise a cry against you that will infinitely overpower the equivocal proofs you can produce it will become a question of veracity and yours will be invalidated by the improbability if not of the guilt at least of the folly of your persecutors conduct you cannot reform them will do yourself much harm and the world no good you will not only misemploy your time for the present but impede your power for the future if such be the consequences of honestly speaking the truth what is the conduct that i am to pursue am i to be a hypocrite and listen with approbation while men boast of their vices glory in their false principles and proclaim the destructive projects they mean to pursue no is not silence approbation yes yet your system will not allow me to speak you accuse my system unjustly it is the manner of speaking to which it attends the precaution of speaking so as to produce good not bad consequences is the doctrine i wish to inculcate he that should sweep the streets of peashells lest old women might break their necks would doubtless have good intentions yet his office would only be that of a scavenger speak but speak to the world at large not to insignificant individuals speak in the tone of a benevolent and disinterested heart and not of an inflamed and revengeful imagination otherwise you endanger yourself and injure society what shall any cowardly regard to my own safety induce me to the falsehood of silence for is it not falsehood of the most contemptible and atrocious kind to forbear publishing such miscreants to the world it is this base this selfish prudence that encourages men like these to proceed from crime to crime had they been exposed in their first attempt their effrontery could never have been so enormous no i am determined were my life to be the sacrifice i will hold them up a beacon alike to the wicked and the unwary will paint them in the gross and odious colours that alone can characterize their actions and drive them from the society of mankind do you conceive you are now speaking in the spirit of justice or of revenge of both he who is resolved not to be convinced does not wish to hear his last argument answered with this short reply therefore i rose took my hat made some aukward apology was sorry we were fated to differ so continually in principle but each man must act from his own judgment was obliged to him nevertheless for his sincerity and good intention and once more took my leave more angry than pleased much in the same abrupt manner that i had formerly done the similarity indeed forced itself upon me as i was quitting the door and i knew not whether to accuse myself of pettishness obstinacy and want of candour or him of singularity and an inflexible sternness of opposition at all events my purpose of publishing my pamphlet as soon as it should be written was fixed and to that labour i immediately returned chapter vi story of miss wilmot concluded olivia not forgotten a gamingtable friend characterized modern magicians suspicious principles the friends absence and return allegorical wit and dangerous advice various causes induced me to take the first opportunity of again visiting miss wilmot her story had inspired compassion and respect she might be in want and to relieve her would give me pleasure beside which i had a number of questions to ask especially concerning this wakefield and some desire to know who and what the young lady who was so great a favourite with mary might be in the evening i saw miss wilmot and in offering her with as much delicacy as possible pecuniary aid she informed me that fortunately she had found a friend generous beneficent and tender not less prudent than kind and though very young possessed of a dignity of understanding such as she had never before met in woman miss wilmot spoke with so much enthusiasm that i whose imagination readily caught fire felt a redoubled wish to see this angel i hinted it to miss wilmot but with apologies and she replied that the young lady had expressly requested her visits might be private and her name concealed i inquired how they had first become acquainted and learned that it was in consequence of the friendly zeal of mary who had a countrywoman that lived servant in the family of this young lady and from whom she gained intelligence of the liberal and noble qualities of her mistress the first retreat of miss wilmot after leaving the house of the bishop was to a poor lodging provided by mary from this she was removed by the friendly young lady to her present asylum till she could find the means of maintaining herself and had since been supplied with necessaries through the same channel the favours she confers on me said miss wilmot are not so properly characterised by delicacy as by a much higher quality an open and unaffected sensibility of soul a benevolent intention of promoting human happiness and an unfeigned heart felt pleasure which accompanies her in the performance of this delightful duty the particulars i have now related continued she were all that remained to be told when i was interrupted by mary at our last meeting and you are now acquainted with my whole story every conversation that i had with miss wilmot confirmed the truth of her own remark that her intellect had been greatly awakened by the misfortunes in which her mistakes had involved her and particularly by the deep despondency of her brother he wakefield and the young lady were the continual topics of her discourse but her brother the most and oftenest i was several times a witness that the papers were daily perused by her with all those quick emotions of dread which she had so emphatically described the terror of his parting resolution was almost too much for her and it was with difficulty she preserved her mind from madness i saw its tendency and took every opportunity to sooth and calm her troubled spirit and my efforts were not wholly ineffectual in the mean time i did not forget that i was not possessed of the purse of fortunatus on the contrary i had a mighty task before me the image of olivia incessantly haunted me the ineffable beauty of her form the sweet and never to be forgotten sensibility that she displayed when i first saw her in the presence of andrews at oxford and the native unaffected dignity of her mind were my constant themes of meditation must i behold her in the arms of another the thought was horror yet how to obtain her if i studied the law preliminary forms alone would consume years from the church i was banished a military life i from principle abhorred even my half ripe philosophy could not endure the supposition of being a hireling cutthroat literature might afford me fame but of riches gained from that source there was scarcely an example from literary merit however men had obtained civil promotion it must not therefore be neglected of such neglect indeed my passionate love of letters would not admit with respect to law though infinitely too slow for the rapidity of my desires still it was good to be prepared for all events i therefore entered myself of the temple and thus began another snailpace journey of term keeping youth is a busy season and though occupations are forced upon it of a nature too serious for its propensities it fails not to find time for amusement in st jamessstreet near the palace was a billiardtable to which when an inmate with lord idford i had resorted it was frequented by officers of the guards and other persons who were chiefly supposed to be men of some character and fashion among them i had met a young gentleman of the name of belmont remarkable for the easy familiarity of his address an excellent billiard player and who had in a manner attached himself to me by a degree of attention that was engaging i thought indeed that i discovered contradictory qualities in him but the sprightliness of his imagination and the whimsicality of his remarks compensated for a looseness of principle which was too apparent to be entirely overlooked he frequently turned the conversation on the county of which i was a native having as he informed me and as his discourse shewed many acquaintance in that county since my return to town i had again met him and he had sought my company with increasing ardour flattered by this preference and often delighted with the flights of his fancy i returned his advances with great cordiality his appearance was always genteel but from various circumstances i collected that he was not at present rich his expectations according to his own account were great and his familiar habits of treating every man be his rank or fashion what it might seemed to signify that he considered himself their equal when we first met after my return to town he was desirous i should relate to him where i had been and what had befallen me and when he heard that i had visited the county ofhe became more pressing to know all that had happened to encourage me he gave me the following account of himself for my own part mr trevor i am at present under a cloud i shall sometime or another break forth and be a gay fellow once again nor can i tell how soon i love to see life and i do not believe there is a man in england of my age who has seen more of it perhaps you will laugh when i tell you that since we last parted i have been vagabondizing you do not understand the term it offends your delicacy i will explain he saw he had raised my curiosity and with a loquacity that sat easy on him and a vivacity of imagery in which as i have said he excelled he thus continued perhaps you will think a gentleman degraded by having subjected himself to the denomination of a vagrant though no you have wit enough to laugh at graybeards and their ridiculous forms and absurd distinctions know then there is a certain set or society of men frequently to be met in straggling parties about this kingdom who by a peculiar kind of magic will metamorphose an old barn stable or outhouse in such a wonderful manner that the said barn stable or outhouse shall appear according as it suits the will or purpose of the said magicians at one time a princes palace at another a peasants cottage now the noisy receptacle of drunken clubs and wearied travellers called an inn anon the magnificent dome of a grecian temple nay so vast is their art that by pronouncing audibly certain sentences which are penned down for them by the head or master magician they transport the said barn stable or outhouse thus metamorphosed over sea or land rocks mountains or deserts into whatsoever hot cold or temperate region the director wills with as much facility as my ladys squirrel can crack a nut what is still more wonderful they carry all their spectators along with them without the witchery of broomsticks these necromancers although whenever they please they become princes kings and heroes and reign over all the empires of the vast and peopled earth though they bestow governments viceroyalties and principalities upon their adherents divide the spoils of nations among their pimps pages and parasites and give a kingdom for a kiss for they are exceedingly amorous yet no sooner do their sorceries cease though but the moment before they were reveling and banqueting with marc antony or quaffing nectar with jupiter himself it is a safe wager of a pound to a penny that half of them go supperless to bed a set of poor but pleasant rogues miserable but merry wags that weep without sorrow stab without anger die without dread and laugh sing and dance to inspire mirth in others while surrounded themselves with wretchedness a thing still more remarkable in these enchanters is that they completely effect their purpose and make those who delight in observing the wonderful effects of their art laugh or cry condemn or admire love or hate just as they please subjugating the heart with every various passion more especially when they pronounce the charms and incantations of a certain sorcerer called shakspeare whose science was so powerful that he himself thus describes it i have oft bedimmd the noontide sun calld forth the mutinous winds and twixt the green sea and the azurd vault set roaring war to the dread rattling thunder have i given fire and rifted joves stout oak with his own bolt the strongbasd promontory have i made shake and by the spurs pluckd up the pine and cedar graves at my command have wakd their sleepers opd and let them forth by my so potent art i understand you said i delighted with the picture he had drawn your necessities have obliged you to turn player not altogether my necessities answered he it was more from a frolic and to know the world that is my study mr trevor but can you tell me why players by following their profession act in some places contrary to all law and are called strollers vagabonds and vagrants and in others are protected by the law and dignified with the high and mighty title of his majestys servants indeed i cannot said i he continued mark my words the day will come mr trevor when you will discover that there are greater jugglers in the world than your players wonderful as their art of transformation is the world is all a cheat its pleasures are for him who is most expert in legerdemain and cajolery and he is a fool indeed who is juggled out of his share of them but that will not i be he then turned the conversation to me and what had happened during my visit in the country i was beginning my short narrative but we were interrupted by an acquaintance who joined us and we two or three times met again in the billiardroom before any opportunity presented itself one evening however he followed me out and required me to discharge my promise accordingly i told him all that had occurred but not without those feelings of indignation which the subject always awakened he rather seemed diverted than to sympathize in my angry sensations and asked me whether i thought those men whom the world call swindlers blacklegs and other hard names were not at least as honest as many of their neighbours he paid most attention to my mothers story and i having characterized wakefield according to the traits my mother and miss wilmot had given me he observed that this wakefield must certainly be a cunning fellow and of no mean abilities in my opinion i replied he is an unprincipled scoundrel and indeed a greater fool than knave for with the same ingenuity that he has exerted to make all mankind his enemies he might have made them all his friends belmonts answer was remarkable you have this ingenuity yourself mr trevor talents which you have exerted in your own way have you made all men your friends i was silent and after a moments pause he addedcome come you have spirit and generosity i will tell you how you can serve me i have a relation from whom i could draw a good supply at this moment if i had but a small sum for travelling expences lend me ten guineas i will be back in a week and repay you the pleasantness of his humour and the manner in which he had gained upon me were sufficient to insure him a compliance with this request i had the money in my pocket gave it him and we bade each other adieu with a promise on his part that he would soon be in town again new moulted and full of feather i must not omit to notice that having had occasion to hint at miss wilmot in the story i had told him but without mentioning her name which he never indeed seemed desirous to know he put many questions relating to her he inquired too concerning her brother and though he gave no tokens of deep passion was evidently interested in the whole narrative his queries extended even to the bishop and the earl and he discovered a great desire to be minutely informed of all that related to me his interrogatories were answered without reserve for i understood them as tokens of friendship in less than a fortnight i met him again at the usual place for he had always been averse to visit me at my lodgings this i had attributed to motives of vanity for example his not having apartments perhaps such as he wished to invite me to in return his appearance the moment i saw him spoke his success his dress was much improved he sported his money freely and being engaged at play more than once betted ten pounds upon the hazard he was successful in his match in high spirits welcomed me heartily and was full of those flights in which his vigorous imagination was so happy life said he trevor putting on his coat after he had done play life is a game at calculation and he that plays the best of it is the cleverest fellow or rather calculation and action are husband and wife married without a possibility of divorce the greatest errors of mrs action proceed from a kind of headstrong feminine propensity which she has to be doing before her husband mr calculation has given her proper directions she often pours a spoonful of scalding soup into his worships mouth before the relative heat between the liquid and the papillary nerves has been properly determined at which in the aforesaid true feminine spirit she is apt while he makes wry faces to burst into a violent fit of laughter not but that mrs action herself has sometimes very just cause of complaint against her spouse as most wives have for example if in coming down stairs mr calculation have made an occasional error but of a unit and told her ladyship she had only one step more to descend when she had two she coming with an unexpected jerk in the increased ratio of a falling body is very much alarmed and when the tip of her rosecoloured tongue has happened on such occasions to project a little beyond the boundaries prescribed by those beautiful barriers of ivory called her teeth it has suffered a sudden incision nay sometimes amputation itself a very serious mischief for this is wounding a lady in a tender part what is error defect in calculation what is ignorance defect in calculation what is poverty disgrace and all the misfortunes to which fools are subject defect in calculation by this time we were in the street walking arm in arm toward the park and he continued his jocular allegory you tell me you have a mind to turn author and this makes me suspect you understand but little of the algebra of authorship could you but calculate the exact number of impediments doubts and disappointments attending the trade could you but find the sum of the objections which yourself your friends and your employers will raise not only against your book but against the best book that ever was or will be written the remainder would be a query the produce of which would be a negative quantity which would probably prevent both sir and madam from reading either the nonsense or the good sense the poetry or the prose the simple or the sublime of the rhapsodical metaphorical allegorical genius hugh trevor for in that case i suspect hugh trevor would find a more pleasant and profitable employment than the honourable trade of authorship i have read books much but men more and think i can bring my wit to a better market than the slow and tedious detail of an a b c manufactory i laughed and listened and he presently broke forth with another simile in what is the maker of a book better than the maker of a coat needle and thread pen and ink cloth uncut and paper unsoiled where is the preference except that the tailors materials are the more costly in days of yore the gentlemen of the thimble gave us plenty of staytape and buckram the gentlemen of the quill still give us a quantum sufficit of hard words and parenthesis the tailor has discovered that a new coat will sit more degage and wear better the less it is incumbered by trimmings but though buckram is almost banished from monmouthstreet it is still on sale in paternosterrow i once began to write a book myself and began it in this very style fable said i is the cloth and morality the lining a good diction makes an excellent facing satire ensures fashion and humour duration and for an author to pretend to write without wit and judgment were as senseless as for a tailor to endeavour to work without materials or shears to cut them periods may aptly be compared to buttons and button holes are like i could find no simile for button holes and thank heaven left off in despair and never wrote another line take my advice trevor quit all thoughts of so joyless and stupifying a trade every blockhead can sneer at an author the title itself is a sarcasm and job who we are told was the most patient of men uttered the bitterest wish that ever fell from lips oh that mine enemy had written a book beside you are a fellow of spirit fashion form and figure and if you will but keep company with me may learn a little wit how many fools are there with full purses which if you be not as great a fool as any of them you might find the means to empty he that is bound by rules which the rich make purposely to rob the poor of their due is like crows scared from picking up the scattered corn by rags and a manikin this discourse gave me no surprise it was what i imagined to be a free loose mode of talking that did not correspond with his principles of action i deemed it a love of paradox a desire to shew his wit and original turn of thought and was confirmed in the supposition by his ironical and ludicrous replies whenever i attempted a serious answer such was the history of the beginning of an acquaintance of which the reader will hear more chapter vii an important secret betrayed by mary transporting intelligence the reverse or rain after sunshine the reader entrusted with a secret strange behaviour of a false friend lovers vows i did not suffer a day to pass without either seeing or sending to inquire after miss wilmot so that our intercourse was continual one afternoon being in my own room after hearing as i thought footsteps and female voices on the stairs mary knocked at my door and entering as desired shewed marks of eagerness on her countenance the meaning of which a question from me immediately caused her to explain lord sir said she you cannot think what a hurry and flurry i be in and all about you me mary you shall hear sir my mistress is gone out to take a walk in the park as i avised her to divart her mellicholy and so the dear young lady has bin here miss i had forgotten i munna tell her name but if ever there wur an angel upon arth she is one she says such kind things to my dear mistress and does not blame her for her fault for thof she be as innocent herself as the child unborn she can pity the misfortins of her own sect when they a bin betrayed by false hearted men and all that she says is that we mun take care to be more becautioned for the time to come and then she says it in so sweet and yet so serus a manner that i am sure no christian soul if theyd a heard her would dare do other than as she says and as for a doing a good turn i do verily believe she would give the morsel out of her mouth afore a poor creature should be driven to sin and shame for want i interrupted her she had raised some strong surmises and i was impatientbut you forget mary you mentioned something concerning me oh lord yea a mort o questions a bin asked for she talks as familiarity to me as if she wur a poor body herself which gives me heart so that i be not afeard to speak whereof i could not help telling her a great many things about you as how when little more but a child you saved my life and consarning your goodness and kind offers to my dear mistress and how soft hearted and well spoken you wur even to poor me just for all the world as i said like her own dear good self whereupon it gladdened her heart to hear there wur another good creature as good as herself and so she asked ater your name which you know that being no secret i told her and then it wur if you had but a seen her her face wur as pale as my kerchief and i asked what ailed her ladyship and she replied in a faint voice nothing so that i thought there must for sartinly be a summut between you for she sat down and seemed to do so as if a struggling for breath and i ran for a smelling bottle whereupon she wur better and said she did not need it and so she asked how long you had lived in the house and whether you looked happy and i answered and said there wur not a kinder happier creature breathing so she asked again if i wur quite sure that you wur happy and i said i wur mortally sartin of it so then she fetched a deep sigh from the very bottom of her heart and said she wur glad of it very glad of it indeed for said she my good mary for she often calls me good which i be very sure is her kindness and not my desarts my good mary said she i dont wonder that you do love mr trevor for having a saved your life he once saved my life which says she i shall remember the longest day i have to breathe and it is she exclaimed i for i could hold no longer it is olivia benevolent angel and does she deign to think of me does she inquire after me am i still in her thoughts anan said mary i hope i a betrayed no secrets for surely i ha not mentioned a word of her name just as i was continuing to question mary farther miss wilmot returned i earnestly requested she would come into my apartment related the discovery i had made and spoke with all that enthusiasm which the revival of hope and the ardour of passion could inspire miss wilmot sympathized with my feelings and with a fervour that spoke the kindness of her heart hoped she should one day see a pair so worthy of each other blessed to the full accomplishment of their wishes but she confessed she had her fears for she thought that the remark that lovers best calculated to make each other happy were seldom united was but too true i prevailed on her to take tea with me mary waited and i put a thousand questions to her for my conversation was all on this subject i could think of nothing else o how pure was the delight of this discovery that olivia should quit the scenes of tumultuous joy and seek the forlorn and unfortunate purposely to mitigate their wants and administer consolation to their woes was knowledge inexpressibly sweet to the soul and that she should still remember me that my very name should raise such commotions in her bosom that she should delight to hear my praise and recollect the fortunate moment when i bore her from death with such affectionit was rapture unspeakable i learned from mary that she lived with her aunt a few streets distant and miss wilmot informed me that she constantly visited her twice and sometimes oftener each week how did my bosom burn with the wish that she might return that very evening or at least the next day in the impatience and ecstacy of hope i forgot all impediments let me but see her let me but know that she was in the house and i supposed the moment of perfect bliss would then be come happy evening never did seductive fancy paint more delicious dreams or raise up phantoms more flattering to the heart pains and pleasures dance an eternal round the very next day brought sensations of an opposite kind my mother had found no person of whom to purchase an annuity in the country for the money being her own by my free gift she had not thought proper to venture it with thornby lest under the pretext of monies advanced he should make she knew not what deduction she had therefore written to me soon after i came to london to find her a purchaser and after some delay which the necessity of consulting persons better informed than myself had occasioned i had advertised the week before and had entered into a negotiation terms were agreed upon and the rough copy of a deed for that purpose was brought me the same morning that the following letter arrived sir in spite of my caution your mother has played the fool once more she was too suspicious to trust the money in my hands though i warned her to beware of accidents i must say she is a very weak woman her husband mr wakefield has made his appearance and has trumped up some tale or another to impose upon her which i am sorry to find is no difficult thing he has got the money you gave her so what is to become of her i do not know she expects he will fetch her away within a month and keep her like a lady on the profits of some place at court which according to his account a friend was to procure for him if he could but raise five hundred pounds you may think how likely he is to keep his promise i told her my mind in plain terms and i believe she begins to be in a panic she dare not write to you on which i thought it best to let you know the truth at once for as i said before what is to become of her i do not know i am c nabal thornby the train of ideas which the strange contents of this epistle excited was painful in the extreme the idiot conduct of my mother tempted me to curse not her indeed but according to the narrow limits of prejudice god and her excepted all things else yet who but she was the chief actor in this scene of lunatic folly was there a woman on earth beside herself that would have been so grossly gulled as for her husband the bitterness of gall was not so choaking as the recollection of him the sight or sound of his name excited disgust too intense to be dwelt upon to suffocate him as a monster or a sooterkin seemed the only punishment of which he was worthy and here it is necessary i should inform the reader of a secret of which i was myself at that time and long continued to remain utterly ignorant belmont the man who had purposely thrown himself in my way industriously made himself my intimate informed me as i supposed of his private affairs and motives of action inquired minutely into mine wormed every intelligence i could give that related to myself out of me designedly attached me to him by intellectual efforts of no mean or common kind for he saw they delighted me and they were familiar to him belmont i say possessed of a pleasing person a winning aspect and an address that though studied with the deepest art appeared to be open unpremeditated and too daring for disguise this belmont was no other than the hated wakefield yes it was wakefield himself that by a stratagem which drove me half mad while it made every drop of blood in his body tingle with triumph had thus circumvented me he it was who borrowed the ten guineas from me by the aid of which he robbed me of five hundred and then returned to observe how i endured the goad laugh at my restive antics and revel in the plunder which he had purloined with so much facility from foolish trevor and his still more foolish mother but this was not the only trick he had to play me secure in the resources of an invention that might have been occupied in pursuits worthy of his powers his perverted philosophy taught him to employ these resources only for the gratification of passions which he thought it folly to control and to exult over men whose sordid selfishness he despised and whose limited cunning was the subject of his derision he professed himself the disciple of la rochefoucault and mandeville and his practice did not belie his principles from the tenor of his discourse i am persuaded that had he found me apt at adopting his maxims he would have unbosomed himself freely have initiated me in his own arts and by making me the associate of his projects have induced me to look back on the past rather with merriment than anger as it was he reserved himself to act with me as with the rest of mankind to watch circumstances and turn them to his own purposes whenever opportunity should offer this was the man who was the hero of the letter i had just received a letter that i could neither read nor recollect without being stung almost to frenzy yet that i could neither forget nor forbear to peruse during two hours i traversed my room and chafed with something like bursting anguish a few weeks ago when i had received my legacy of the lawyer i seemed to be encumbered with wealth reflection and the expence at which i now lived to the visible and quick consumption of a sum i then thought so ample had since taught me that i was in imminent danger of being reduced to beggary i had no profession nor any means of subsistence till a profession could be secured at least no adequate means unless by retiring to some humble garret and confining myself to the society of the illiterate the boorish and the brutal between whose habits and mine there was no congeniality the very day before olivia ecstatic vision had risen in full view of my delighted hopes and forgetting the tormenting distance which malignant fate had placed between us i almost thought her mine the recollection of her now was misery restless desponding agonizing when this thought occurred i was hastening to go and communicate the accursed news to miss wilmot but an idea started which after a moments reflection induced me to desist if i told her the story of wakefield must again be revived olivia too might be informed of circumstances concerning my silly mother which selfishness out of the question motives of delicacy ought to conceal such were my arguments at that time i had not then the same moral aversion to secrecy that i now possess i could not however any longer endure the present scene and to get rid of it hurried away to the billiard table where as usual i found the then supposed belmont he was not himself at play but was engaged in betting impatient to unburthen my heart for as far as my own affairs were concerned i had now no secrets for him i hurried him out of the room immediately that the game was ended the moment we came into the park i shewed him my letter and desired him to read while he perused it i saw he was more than once violently tempted to laugh well said he returning it and restraining his titillation is this all all answered i what more would you have could the maleficent devil himself do more to drive a man mad he looked in my face i returned the inquisitive gaze i saw emotions the very reverse of mine struggling to get vent his opposing efforts were ineffectual he could contain himself no longer and burst into a violent fit of laughter astonished at mirth so ill placed and offensive i asked what it meant the tone of my interrogatory was rouzing and recalled his attention pshaw trevor replied he with a glance of half contemptuous pity you are yet young you are but at the beginning of your troubles your over weening fondness for the musty morality of dreaming dotards or artful knaves who only made rules that they might profit by breaking them will be your ruin i tell you again and again if you do not prey upon the world the world will prey upon you there is no alternative what be bubbled out of your fortune by a whining old woman i am ashamed of you but that woman is my mother yes and a set of very pretty motherly tricks she has played you not that in the first instance it was so much your fault who were but a boy as that of your old fool of a grandfather it is now high time however that you should become a man my grandfather say rather it was the scoundrel wakefield you seem very angry with this wakefield and why he appears to me to be a fellow of plot wit and spirit instead of resentment were i you i should be glad to become acquainted with the man who so well perceives the stupidity and folly of the animals around him laughs at their apish antics and with so much facility turns their absurd whims to his own advantage acquainted intuitive rascal i would cut off his ears drag him to the pillory with my own hands he is unworthy a nobler revenge pshaw ridiculous what did your mother want but the gratification of her paltry passions which were but the dregs and lees of goatish inclination for with her the pervading headlong torrent of desire was passed did she think of morality she would have sacrificed the youth and high spirits of wakefield to her own salacious doating why should not he too have his wishes were his the most criminal or the least fitted for the faculties of enjoyment you have not heard me defend my mothers conduct but his villany to the young lady i formerly mentioned meaning miss wilmot deserves the execration of every man that is as she tells the story women poor simple creatures are always to be pitied never blamed but a little more experience trevor will tell you the devil himself is not half so cunning men are universally their dupes nay their slaves though called their tyrants do not men consume their lives in toils to please them who are the chief instigators to what you call vice and folly who are the mischief makers of the world who incite us to plunder rob and cut each others throats who but woman and is not a little retaliation to be expected poor dear souls cunning as serpents trevor but though fond of cooing not harmless as doves crocodiles that only weep to catch their prey i once was told of one that died broken hearted a great beauty and much bewept by all the maudlin moralizers that knew her the cause of her grief was a handsome fellow who of course was a cruel perjured villain the tale had great pathos and would have been very tragical had it but been true ages before that in which jove laughed at them lovers perjuries were the common topic of scandal and so continue to be i have often been reproached in the same way myself and i once took the trouble to write an apology for which as it will suit all true lovers all true lovers are bound to thank me here it is i mens vows are false annette i own the proofs are but too flagrant grown to love i vowd eternal scorn i saw thee and was straight forsworn ii in jealous rage renouncing bliss when damon stole a rapturous kiss i took with oaths a long farewell how false they were thou best canst tell iii by saints i vowd and powrs divine no love could ever equal mine yet i myself though thus i swore have daily lovd thee more and more iv to perjuries thus i hourly swerve then treat them as they well deserve thy own vows break at length comply and be as deep in guilt as i what think you was not this a valid plea are not women apt to take the advice here given them lovely hypocrites they delight in being forced to follow their own inclinations there was no resisting the playfulness of his wit and the exhilarating whim of his manner my ill humour soon evaporated and yielding to the sympathetic gaiety he had inspired i said to himyou are a wicked wit belmont but though i laugh do not imagine i am a convert to your mandevilian system it is false pernicious and destructive of the end which it pretends to secure do not abuse my system or me either replied he i tell you i am the only honest man of my acquaintance and the first effort of my honesty is as it ought to be that of being honest to myself i hear many men profess the same opinions but i find them acting on different principles you mistake you are young i tell you every mans actions are strongly tinged by the principles he professes my countenance became a little more serioussurely you do not avow yourself a rascal pshaw epithets are odious i do not know the meaning of the word nor do you our conversation continued it relieved me from a bitterness of chagrin from which i was happy to escape we dined together his flow of spirits and raillery were unabating i combated his opinions he laughed at my arguments rather than answered them and though i even then conceived him to be a very bad moralist i thought him a delightful companion chapter viii revenge not forgotten the visit delayed wilmot and his poetical powers dreadful intelligence an appalling picture a fruitless search followed by a surprising discovery stimulated by the ridicule of belmont though i never had a thought of abandoning my mother to want still i determined according to the proverb to let her bite the bridle instead of writing therefore i waited till she should write to me mean time my pamphlet was the grand object of present pursuit when i began it i imagined it would scarcely have been the work of a day certainly not of a week i was deceived to a man who has any sense of justice who fears to affirm the thing that is not yet is determined to be inexorable in revenge no task is so harrassing as that which i had undertaken page after page was written rewritten corrected interlined scratched blotted and thrown in the fire the work had been three times finished and three times destroyed it was a fourth time begun and still the labour was no less oppressive irritating and thorny it was in this state at the time that mary brought me the joyful intelligence relating to olivia i had watched with unremitting assiduity during those hours of the day when she had been accustomed to visit miss wilmot but my watchings were fruitless she came no more the fourth day after her last visit she sent a note to miss wilmot informing her that her aunt was going to bath for the recovery of her health to which place it was necessary that she should attend her the blow was violent and would have been felt more violently even than it was had it not been for an event which i must now relate the alarms of miss wilmot concerning her brother had not been lightly excited they might rather be called prophetic she had indeed strongly communicated her terror to me one morning i was meditating on the subject and recollecting those early days when gathering the first fruits of genius i was taught by him to distinguish and enjoy the beauties of its emanations and the sublimity of its flights his affection for me though but a boy had induced him to give me some short poetical compositions of his own i was reading them over with strong feelings partly of sorrow and partly of indignation at the folly and injustice of a world that could overlook such merit one of them in particular which i had always admired for the simple yet pathetic spirit of poetry in which it was written i was then perusing it was the following i ho why dost thou shiver and shake gaffergray and why doth thy nose look so blue tis the weather thats cold tis im grown very old and my doublet is not very new welladay ii then line thy worn doublet with ale gaffergray and warm thy old heart with a glass nay but credit ive none and my moneys all gone then say how may that come to pass welladay iii hie away to the house on the brow gaffergray and knock at the jolly priests door the priest often preaches against worldly riches but neer gives a mite to the poor welladay iv the lawyer lives under the hill gaffergray warmly fencd both in back and in front he will fasten his locks and will threaten the stocks should he ever more find me in want welladay v the squire has fat beeves and brown ale gaffergray and the season will welcome you there his fat beeves and his beer and his merry new year are all for the flush and the fair welladay vi my keg is but low i confess gaffergray what then while it lasts man well live the poor man alone when he hears the poor moan of his morsel a morsel will give welladay in that precise state of mind which associations such as i have described and a poem like this could excite when i was alike bewailing the madness and turpitude of mankind that could be blind to the worth of a man such as wilmot while glowing i say and thrilling with these sensations my breakfast was brought and with it a paper what shall i sayit contained what follows yesterday a middle aged man of a genteel and orderly appearance was seen to walk despondingly beside the serpentine river a gentleman who having met him remarked the agitation of his countenance suspected his design and concealing himself behind some trees at a little distance watched him and at last saw him throw himself into the water the gentleman who was a good swimmer jumped in after him but could not immediately find the body which after he had brought it out was conveyed to marylebone watchhouse a few shillings were found in his pocket but nothing to indicate his name place of abode or other information except a written paper containing the following melancholy account of himself this body if ever this body should be found was once a thing which by way of reproach among men was called an author it moved about the earth despised and unnoticed and died indigent and unlamented it could hear see feel smell and taste with as much quickness delicacy and force as other bodies it had desires and passions like other bodies but was denied the use of them by such as had the power and the will to engross the good things of this world to themselves the doors of the great were shut upon it not because it was infected with disease or contaminated with infamy but on account of the fashion of the garments with which it was cloathed and the name it derived from its forefathers and because it had not the habit of bending its knee where its heart owed no respect nor the power of moving its tongue to gloze the crimes or flatter the follies of men it was excluded the fellowship of such as heap up gold and silver not because it did but for fear it might ask a small portion of their beloved wealth it shrunk with pain and pity from the haunts of ignorance which the knowledge it possessed could not enlighten and guilt that its sensations were obliged to abhor there was but one class of men with whom it was permitted to associate and those were such as had feelings and misfortunes like its own among whom it was its hard fate frequently to suffer imposition from assumed worth and fictitious distress beings of supposed benevolence capable of perceiving loving and promoting merit and virtue have now and then seemed to flit and glide before it but the visions were deceitful ere they were distinctly seen the phantoms vanished or if such beings do exist it has experienced the peculiar hardship of never having met with any in whom both the purpose and the power were fully united therefore with hands wearied with labour eyes dim with watchfulness veins but half nourished and a mind at length subdued by intense study and a reiteration of unaccomplished hopes it was driven by irresistible impulse to end at once such a complication of evils the knowledge was imposed upon it that amid all these calamities it had one consolationits miseries were not eternalthat itself had the power to end them this power it has employed because it found itself incapable of supporting any longer the wretchedness of its own situation and the blindness and injustice of mankind and as while it lived it lived scorned and neglected so it now commits itself to the waves in expectation after it is dead of being mangled belied and insulted oh god what were my feelings while reading this heart appalling story it contained volumes and sufficiently spoke the strength of the mind that could thus picture its own sensations it must be my beloved wilmot it could be no one else or even if it were the man who thus could feel and thus could write was no less the object of admiration grief and a species of regret of the guilt of which every man partook it was an act of attainder against the whole world in the infamy of which each man had his share transfixed with horror as i was i still had the recollection to conceal the paper from the eye of miss wilmot and that instant to go in quest of the body the utmost speed and diligence were necessary she must soon hear of the fatal event and it was much to be dreaded that this would not be the last act of the tragedy according to the indication given in the paper i went immediately to the watchhouse but was surprised to find that the body was not there they had heard something of a man throwing himself into the serpentine river but could give no farther information i then ran to every bonehouse and receptacle in the various adjoining parishes but without success the only intelligence i could obtain was that the gentleman who leaped in after the man in order to have saved his life had taken the body home with him but no one could direct me where he lived the circumstance was distracting my terrors for miss wilmot increased i knew not what course to pursue at last i recollected that turl from having lived some years in london being acquainted with the manners of the place and possessing great sagacity might perhaps afford me aid personal knowledge of wilmot he probably had none for he quitted the grammar school at just before wilmot became its head usher but i knew not what better to do and to this as a kind of last hope i resorted and hastened away to his lodgings it may well be supposed my tone of mind was gloomy for a man like wilmot with virtues so eminent sensations so acute and a mind so elevated to be thus impelled to seek a refuge in death was a thought that almost made me hate existence myself and doubt whether i might not hereafter be driven to the same desperate expedient to escape the odious injustice of mankind the distraction too which would seize on miss wilmot haunted my thoughts for i was convinced that the intelligence whenever it should reach her would prove fatal full of these dismal reflections i arrived at the door of turl knocked and was desired to come in turl rose as i entered and with him a stranger who had been seated by his side a stranger and yet with features that were not wholly unknown to me he seemed surprised at the sight of me examined me fixed his eyes on me memory was very busy associating ideas poured upon me i gazed i remembered heavens and earth what was my astonishment what were my transports when in this very stranger i discovered mr wilmot living pale meagre dejected and much altered but living turl was the gentleman in the park who had observed the deep melancholy visible in his countenance had fortunately suspected his intention had brought him out of the water had discovered favourable symptoms and instead of either taking him home or to the watchhouse had conveyed him to st georges hospital where he immediately obtained medical aid that had preserved his life turl was the person whose courage humanity and wisdom had prolonged the existence of a man of genius and who was now exerting all his faculties to render that existence happy to the possessor and beneficial to the human race oh moment of inconceivable rapture why are not sensations so exquisite eternal chapter ix i secure miss wilmot against the danger of false alarm and return to hear the history of her brother eager as i was to contribute all in my power to tranquilize the mind of mr wilmot to renew my friendship with him and to learn his history from himself i yet made but a short stay and hastened home to his sister fortunately the tragic tale had not reached her and without relating circumstances that if abruptly told might have excited alarm i informed her that i had that moment parted from him and that now i had found him i should use my utmost endeavour to reconcile him to her once more to hear that he was still in being gave an undescribable relief to her mind it beamed in her countenance and called up thoughts that soon made her burst into tears having by this information secured her against the ill effects which might otherwise have followed i escaped further question from her for the present by truly telling her i was impatient to return to her brother i found the two friends still conversing for friends and sincere ones they were become the account given by wilmot of himself had been taken and sent to the newspaper without the knowledge of turl but he had read it and it was a sufficient index of the mind of the writer and the behaviour of turl through the whole affair as well as the sentiments he uttered in every breath were enough to convince mr wilmot of his uncommon worth on my return the latter was defending the right of man to commit suicide which turl denied not on the false and untenable ground of superstition but from the only true argument the immoral tendency of the act he was delicate though decisive in his opposition and only requested mr wilmot to consider whether to effect the good of the whole be not the true purpose of virtue ought not the good of the whole therefore to be its only rule and guide if so can the man who possesses that degree of activity without which he cannot commit suicide be incapable of being farther useful to society depressed and gloomy as his state of mind was mr wilmot testified great satisfaction at our rencontre and the interest which i unfeignedly took in his welfare soon revived all his former affection for me my veneration for his virtues love for his genius and pity for his misfortunes tended to calm his still fluttering and agitated spirits unfortunate as he himself had been or at least had thought himself in his love of literature and poetry it yet gave him pleasure to find that the same passion was far from having abated in me he called it a bewitching illusion turl affirmed it was a beneficial and noble propensity of soul we none of us had a wish to separate for the imagination of each was teeming with that sedate yet full flow of sentiment which as milton has so beautifully described melancholy can give mr wilmot had supposed his sister was guilty with the bishop and when i told her story with the addition of such probable circumstances as i myself had collected it afforded him very considerable relief to find that the suspicions to which appearances gave birth had been false i did not conceal the desire i had to know by what train of accidents he had been led into a state of such deep despondency and he thus kindly gratified my wish history of mr wilmot the narrative given by my sister which you mr trevor have already repeated precludes the necessity of any detail concerning my origin nor is origin in my opinion of the least moment except as it displays the habits and growth of mind and shews how the man became such as we find him to be at what period of my existence that activity of inquiry and those energetic aspirings began which to me were afterward the source of the extremes of joy and sorrow i cannot tell but i believe the quality of ardour though probably not born with us is either awakened in early infancy or seldom if ever attains strength and maturity i could not only read with uncommon accuracy and ease while very young but can remember i made efforts to reason with my father the major on what i read when i was little more than six years old he though a man rather of irritable feelings than profound research was not destitute of literature and encouraged a propensity in me that was flattering to himself as the father of a boy remarked for his promising talents which talents he supposed might lead to distinctions that he had been unsuccessfully ambitious to obtain he considered himself as one of the most unfortunate of men imagining personal bravery to be the essence of the military character he had eagerly cherished that quality and having given incontestible proofs that he possessed it in an eminent degree to be afterward overlooked was in his judgment too flagrant an instance of public as well as private ingratitude to be ever pardoned it was the daily subject of his thoughts and theme of his discourse and i have great reason to conjecture that the habitual discontent that preyed upon his mind and embittered his life especially the latter part of it communicated itself to me i was educated in the belief that the world is blind to merit continually suffers superior virtue to linger in indigence and neglect and is therefore an odious unjust and despicable world i own i have at some few intervals doubted of this doctrine and supposed in conformity to your opinion mr turl that failure is rather the consequence of our own mistakes impatience and efforts ill directed than of society but the ill success of my own efforts aided perhaps by the prejudices which i received from my father have preponderated and made me it may be too frequently incline to melancholy and misanthropy what can be said are not the rich and powerful continually oppressing talents genius and virtue is the general sense of mankind just in its decisions beside an appeal to the general sense of mankind is not always in our power and that the proceedings of individuals are often flagrantly unjust cannot be denied in the school where i was educated i was a frequent and painful witness of honours partially bestowed and prizes and applause awarded to others that were indubitably due to me when the rich and the powerful visited the seminary the sons of the rich and the powerful gained all their attention conscious as i could not but be of my own superior claims i was overlooked perhaps i felt the repetition of these and similar acts of injustice too severely yet are they not odious i own the remembrance of them ever has been and is intensely painful and the pain is almost unremittingly prolonged by what every man who is not wilfully blind must daily see passing in the world mr wilmot sighed deeply well well would i could forget it after many a bitter struggle in my boyish years to rise into notice few very few indeed of which were effectual i still continued the combat in due time as i was told my efforts were amply rewarded but how instead of being forwarded in those more noble and beneficial pursuits for which i think i had proved myself fitted the effusions of genius though known were never once remembered oh no i obtained with great difficulty and as an unmerited favour a charitable condescension of power that knew not very well if it ought to be so kind to a being so unprotected yes i obtainedthe office of usher the honour of mechanically hearing declensions conjugations and rules of syntax and prosody repeated by beings who detested the labour to which they were compelled was conferred upon me beings who looked on me not as a benefactor but as a tyrant and tyrants all teachers indubitably are under our present modes of education humbled and cowed as my genius was by the drudgery and obscurity to which it was consigned i yet had the courage to continue those labours by which alone mind is brought to maturity alive as i was to a sense of injustice i recollected that even if my powers were equal to all that i myself had fondly hoped from them there were examples of men with at least equal powers who had been equally ill treated equally did i say oh otway oh chatterton what understandings what hearts had those men who without an effort without moving a finger not to do you justice of that they were incapable but to preserve you from famine could suffer you to perish it was needless to repine i consoled and reconciled myself to my fate as well as i was able i pursued my studies read the poets of ancient and modern times with unabating avidity observed the actions and inquired into the motives of men and made unceasing attempts to develope the human heart excluded as it were by the pride luxury and caprice of the world from expanding my sensations and wedding my soul to society i was constrained to bestow the strong affections that glowed consciously within me upon a few my mother and sister had a large share of them to skreen them from the indigence obscurity and neglect to which without my aid they must be doomed was a hope that encouraged me in the bold project i had conceived i determined to dedicate myself to literature poetry and particularly to the stage essays of the dramatic kind indeed had been made by me very early at length i undertook a tragedy as a work which if accomplished with the degree of perfection that i hoped it would be must at once establish my true rank in society relieve the wants of my family and be a passport for me to every man of worth and understanding in the world how little did i know the world fond fool over credulous idiot what cares the world for the toils and struggles the restless days and sleepless nights of the man of genius i am ashamed to think i could be so miserably mistaken the ardour with which i began my work the deep consideration i gave to every character the strong emotions i felt while composing it the minute attention i paid to all its parts and the intense labour i bestowed in planning writing correcting and completing it were such as i believed must insure success surely mankind can be but little aware of the uncommon anxieties pains and talents that must contribute to the production of such a work or their reception of it when completed would be very different they would not suffer surely they would not as they so frequently do this or that senseless blockhead to frustrate the labour of years blast the poets hopes and render the birth of genius abortive my tragedy at length was written and by some small number whose judgment i consulted was approved never indeed with that enthusiasm which i perhaps the overweening author imagined it must have excited but it was approved i was a young man of some merit it was more than they had expected nay i have met with some liberal critics who have appeared modestly to doubt whether they themselves should have written better before i made the experiment i had supposed that every man whose wealth or power gave him influence in society would start up the moment it was known that an obscure individual the usher of a school had written a tragedy not only to protect and produce it to the world but to applaud and honour the author would secure him from the possibility of want load him with every token of respect and affectionately clasp him to their bosom the indifference and foolish halffaced kind of wonder as destitute of feeling as of understanding with which it was received by the persons on whom i had depended for approbation and support did more than astonish me it pained disgusted and jaundiced my mind the only consolation i could procure was in supposing that the inhabitants of the city were i resided were deficient in literary taste and that at a more polished place where knowledge literature and poetry were more diffused i should meet a very different reception experience only can cure the unhackneyed mind of its erroneous estimates london however and its far famed theatres were the objects at which my ambition long had aimed and thither after various doubts and difficulties it was decreed i should go the profits of my place i had dedicated to the relief of my family and my mothers great fear was that going up to london so ill provided i should perish there for want of this i was persuaded there could be no danger and at length prevailed the danger however was not quite so imaginary as i in the fervour of hope had affirmed it to be the plan i proposed was to get another ushers place in or near town till i could bring my piece upon the stage this i attempted and made various applications which all failed some because though i understood greek i could not teach merchants accounts or spoil paper by flourishes and foppery which is called writing a fine hand and others because as i suppose persons offered themselves whose airs or humility or other usherlike qualifications that had no relation to learning pleased their employers better than mine i soon grew weary of these degrading attempts and turned my thoughts to a more attractive resource while in the country i had frequently sent little fugitive pieces to be inserted in periodical publications and now on inquiry i found there were people who were paid for such productions i made the experiment and after a variety of fruitless efforts succeeded in obtaining half a guinea a week from an evening paper which i supplied with essays little poetical pieces and other articles much faster than they chose to print them in the interim the grand object for which i had left the country was not neglected it is a common mistake to imagine that to get a piece upon the stage it is necessary to procure a patron by whom it shall be recommended to this i was advised and in consequence of this advice wrote letters to three different persons whose rank in society i imagined would insure a reception at the theatre to the piece which they should protect i supposed that every such person who should hear of a poet who had written a tragedy would rejoice in the opportunity of affording him aid and instantly stand forth his patron in this spirit i wrote my three letters and received no answer to any one of them amazed at this i went to the houses of the great people i had addressed but my face was unknown not one of them was at home i could gain no admission when now and then suffered to wait in the hall i saw dancingmasters buffoons gamblers beings of every species that could mislead the head and corrupt the heart come and go without ceremony but to a poet all entrance was denied for such chosen society he was unfit the very rabble with which these pillared lounging places swarm looked on him with a suspicious and half contemptuous eye that insolently inquired what business had he there were the slaves and menials of maecenas such was it thus at the augustan court when the lord of the conquered world sat banqueting with virgil on his right hand and horace on his left why did i read and remember stories so seductive why did i foolishly place all my happiness in the approbation of the great vulgar or the small forgetting that approbation neither adds to virtue nor diminishes perhaps and indeed i fear my mind was warped yet surely the neglect and even odium in which the unobtruding man of genius is at present overwhelmed is a damning accusation against the rich and titled great it was long however before i entirely disdained these abject and fruitless efforts on one occasion i was fortunate enough as i absurdly thought to get introduced to a marquis it was an awful honour to which i was unused and instead of addressing him with the frothy and impertinent levity which characterized his own manners and which he encouraged in the creatures that were admitted to his familiarity i stood confounded expecting he should have read my play which i had transcribed for his perusal have understood the value of the poet who could write it and have been anxious to relieve that acuteness of sensibility which overclouded and hid the man of genius in the timid abashed and too cowardly author he spoke to me indeed nay condescended to repeat two or three of the newest literary anecdotes that had been retailed to him from the bluestockingclub and then civilly dismissed me to give audience to a dutch birdfancier who had brought him a piping bulfinch but i saw him no more he was never afterward at home i was one of a class of animals that a marquis never admits into his collection my tragedy when applied for by letter was returned with sorrow that indispensible engagements had prevented him from reading it but requested a copy as soon as it should appear in print for which should such a strange event have come to pass i suppose i should have been insulted with the gift perhaps of one guinea perhaps of five and thus a marquis discharged a duty which his rank and power so well enabled him to perform but patience the word poet shall be remembered with everlasting honour when the title marquis shallpshaw on another occasion an actress who strange to tell happened very deservedly to be popular and whom before she arrived at the dignity of a london theatre i had known in the country recommended me to a dutchess to this dutchess i went day after day and day after day was subjected for hours to the prying unmannered insolence of her countless lacquies this time she was not yet stirring though it was two oclock in the afternoon the next she was engaged with an italian vender of artificial flowers the day after the prince and the devil does not know who beside were with her and so on till patience and spleen were at daggers drawn at last from the hall i was introduced to the drawingroom where i was half amazed to find myself could it be real should i after all see a creature so elevated so unlike the poor compendium of flesh and blood with which i crawled about the earth why it was to be hoped that i should still she did not come and i stood fixed gazing at the objects around me longer perhaps than i can now well guess the carpet was so rich that i was afraid my shoes would disgrace it the chairs were so superb that i should insult them by sitting down the sofas swelled in such luxurious state that for an author to breathe upon them would be contamination i made the daring experiment of pressing with a single finger upon the proud cushion and the moment the pressure was removed it rose again with elastic arrogance an apt prototype of the dignity it was meant to sustainthough alone i blushed at my own littleness two or three times the familiars of the mansion skipped and glided by me in at this door and out at that seeing yet not noticing me it was well they did not or i should have sunk with the dread of being mistaken for a thief that had gained a furtive entrance to load himself with some parcel of the magnificence that to poverty appeared so tempting this time however i was not wholly disappointed i had a sight of the dutchess or rather a glimpse her carriage was waiting she had been so infinitely delayed by my lord and my lady and his highness and signora was exceedingly sorry would speak to me another time tomorrow at three oclock but had not a moment to spare at present and so vanished shall i say she treated me proudly and made me feel my insignificance no the little that she did say was affable the tone was conciliating the eye encouraging and the countenance expressed the habitual desire of conferring kindness but these were only aggravating circumstances that shewed the desirableness of that intercourse which to me was unattainable i say to me for those who had a less delicate sense of propriety who were more importunate more intruding and whose forehead was proof against repulse were more successful by such people she was besieged on such she lavished her favours till report said that she impoverished herself for a tale of distress whether feigned or real if obtruded upon her she knew not how to resist what consolation was this to me i was not of the begging tribe i came with a demand at sight upon the understanding which whoever refused to pay disgraced themselves rather than the drawer she mistook my character and the next day at three oclock instead of seeing me herself sent me ten guineas in a note by her french maitre dhotel which chinked as they slided from side to side and proclaimed me a pauper my heart almost burst with indignation yet coward that i was i wanted the fortitude to refuse the polluted paper i thought it would be an affront and still fed myself with the vain hope of procuring from her that countenance to my own labours which i imagined they deserved and which therefore i did not think it any disgrace to solicit the disgrace of reducing men of merit to such humiliating situations was not mine i went twice more and was both times interrogated in french by the insolent maitre dhotel so as to convince me that he thought my coming again so soon was a proof of no common degree of impudence oh euripides oh sophocles did not your sublime shades glide wrathful by and menace the wretch in whom your divine art had been so degraded how did i pray as i passed the scowling porter for the death of your great predecessor that some eagle would drop a tortoise on my head and instantly crush me to atoms i had been the more anxious after patronage because i wished the actress whom i have mentioned to play my heroine there was no tragedian whose powers were in the least comparable to hers but the difficulty of getting a piece on the stage at the theatre to which she belonged all the town told me was incredible it was a chancerysuit which no given time could terminate the manager was the most liberal of men the best of judges and the first of writers as void of envy as he was noble minded and friendly to merit yes friendly in heart and act when he could be prevailed on to act but his rare virtues and gifts were rendered useless extinguished by the killing vice of procrastination he never listened to a story that he did not sympathize with the teller of it the request must be a wild one indeed which he did not feel an instant desire to grant he would promise with the most sincere and honest intentions to perform but hurried away by new petitioners or projects of a more grand and important nature he would with still greater facility forget all who knew him uniformly affirmed a soul more expansive more munificent could not inhabit a human form yet from this one defect it was frequently his fate where he intended an essential benefit to commit an irreparable injury he encouraged hopes that were never realized retarded the merit he meant to promote and raised up personal enemies who impeded his own utility conspicuous and grand as this utility was and is it would otherwise have been unexampled i speak the sentiments of men who i believe were incapable of exaggeration for my own part i have read his works and i love him almost to adoring he is i know assaulted by an infinite number of affairs that all demand his attention many of them are totally beneath it yet are undertaken by him with a too ready compliance averse as he is to give the solicitor pain and continually desirous to make every creature happy he can do but one thing at once of the multitude of things to be done not half are present to the memory at any one time and of those that are remembered what can he do but select the most urgent the mistake has often been rather in the too ready promise than in the nonperformance if prevented by serious occupation by love of the chosen companions of his convivial hours or by habits of forgetful revery from reading my tragedy and being just to me i attribute the neglect to its true cause which certainly was not jealousy of or indifference to the man of talents how can he honour merit granting it to exist with which he is unacquainted yet let me not be misunderstood though i love his comprehensive benevolence of soul i wish it were less undistinguishingi cannot applaud or approve the errors into which it leads both himself and those he means to serve in a word i could find no mode of securing his attention i endeavoured to fix it by the intervention of the great who delighted in his social qualities did homage to his wit and were ambitious of his friendship but in these attempts i likewise failed hopeless therefore of aid from my favourite actress i sent my play to the other house how was i relieved after the delay i had endured and the continual anxiety in which i had been kept how delighted by hearing from the manager within a fortnight he appointed an interview received me with affability and immediately proceeded to the business in question he began with telling me he could have wished i had rather turned my thoughts to the comic than the tragic muse for tragedy was less fashionable and consequently less profitable both to the house and the author than comedy or opera i sighed and answered it was an ill proof of public taste when it could receive greater pleasure from the unconnected scenes of an opera than from the fable pathos and sublime emotions of tragedy but i feared the fault was less in the audience than in the poet and added that the first fortunate writer who should produce a tragedy such as had been written and such as i hoped it was possible again to write would find audiences not insensible to his merit he replied it may be so i can only answer that each author thinks himself the chosen bard you have described and that each is disappointed i am pleased sir continued he with many parts of your tragedy but i think it has one great fault it is too tragical it rather excites horror than terror whether the age be more refined or more captious more humanized or more effeminate than other ages have been i will not pretend to determine but you have written some scenes that would not at present be endured if you think proper to make such alterations as shall soften and adapt them to the present taste and if i approve them when made your piece shall then be performed i knew not what to reply the scenes to which he referred were conceived as i had imagined in the bold but true stile of tragedy i intended them to produce a great effect and was sorry to be informed as among other things i had been that ladies would faint fall into hysterics and be taken shrieking out of the boxes at hearing them i had no remedy but to submit reconsider and by lowering the tone of passion perhaps spoil my tragedy oh what a tormenting trade is that of author he that makes a chair a table or any common utensil brings his work home is paid for his labour and there his trouble ends it was quickly begun and quickly over it excited little hope but it met with no disappointment the author on the contrary has the labour of days months and years to encounter when he begins his difficulties are immeasurable and while as he proceeds they seem to disappear nay at the very moment when he sometimes thinks them all conquered he discovers that they are but accumulated every part every page every period have been considered and reconsidered with unremitting anxiety he has revised rewritten corrected expunged again produced and again erased with endless iteration points and commas themselves have been settled with repeated and jealous solicitude at length as he thinks his labour is over he knows indeed that no work of man was ever perfect but circumstanced as he is the eager prying of his own sleepless eye cannot discover what more to amend he produces the tedious fruits of incessant fatigue to the world and hopes the harvest will be in proportion to the unwearied and extreme care he has bestowed poor man mistaken mortal how could he imagine that the sensations of multitudes should all correspond with his own educated in schools so various under circumstances so contradictory and prejudices so different and distinct how could he suppose his mind was the common measure of man faultless perfect vain supposition extravagant hope the driver of a millhorse he who never had the wit to make much less to invent a mousetrap will detect and point out his blunders all satisfied no not one not a man that reads but will detail reprove and ridicule his dull witted errors well he finds he is mistaken he pants after improvement and listens to advice he follows it alters and again appears what is his success are cavilers less numerous absurd expectation do critics unite in its praise ridiculous hope if he would escape censure he must betake himself to a very different trade it was the month of february when my tragedy was returned the season was far advanced i had then been nearly twelve months held in suspence seeking the means of appearing before the public soliciting patronage and indulging hope my mother and sister depended much on my aid out of the small pittance which the newspaper essays afforded i at first made a proportionate deduction and lived that is contrived to exist on the remainder this could not long endure and i sought other channels of emolument i wrote a novel which i hawked about among the booksellers some of them printed nothing in that way others would venture to publish it and share the profits but not advance a shilling one of them offered me five guineas for the two volumes and told me it was a great price for he seldom gave more than three at last i was fortunate enough to obtain double the sum it was printed but being written in haste and in a state of mind entirely adverse to that fine flow which is the token the test and the triumph of genius its success was less than i expected still however it more than answered the hopes of the bookseller and i think i may safely affirm it had marks of mind sufficient to excite applause mingled with the censure of just criticism did it obtain this applause noa vulgar narrative of uninteresting incidentswas the laconic character given of it in that monthly publication in which from its reputed impartiality i most hoped for just and candid inquiry finding what a terrible animal a critic is i determined to become one myself i made the first essay of my talents for censure on such books as i could borrow and sent my remarks to the magazines into which they were immediately admitted thus encouraged i applied to the publisher of a new review and informed him of my course of reading and of the languages and sciences with which i was acquainted my proposal was graciously received and i was admitted of that corps which has certainly done much good and much harm to literature i entered on my new office with great determination but i soon discovered that to a man of principle who dare neither condemn nor approve a book he has not read it was a very unproductive employment it is the custom of the trade to pay various kinds of literary labour by the sheet and this among the rest thus it frequently happened that a book which would demand a day to peruse was not worthy of five lines of animadversion this is the true source of feeble and false criticism a task in itself most difficult and to which the chosen few alone are equal deep investigation scientific acquirement an acute and comprehensive mind a correct and invigorating stile and intelligence superior to prejudice and an undeviating conscientious spirit of rectitude are the rare endowments it requires its seat should be the summit of mental attainment for its office is to enlighten it has to instruct genius itself and its powers should be equal to the hardy enterprise in fine its object ought to be the love of truth it is the lust of gain i need not expatiate on the consequences they are selfevident poor as the trade is i exercised it with the scrupulous assiduity of which i knew it to be worthy my labour therefore was as great as my emoluments were trifling and though i made no progress toward fame and fortune my efforts were unremitting i mention these circumstances to shew that my failure in my attempts to gain what i believe to be my true rank in society did not originate either in indolence want of oeconomy or any other neglect of mine day or night i was scarcely ever without either a book or a pen in my hand with the most sedulous industry and caution i endeavoured to render justice as well to the works of others as to my own my uniform study was to increase knowledge diffuse good taste and as i fondly hoped promote the general pleasure and happiness of mankind but while i was anxiously caring for all no one seemed to care for me i and my learning taste and genius if i possessed them wandered through the croud unnoticed or noticed only to be scorned insulted by the vulgar for the something in my manner which pretended to distinguish me from themselves and contemned by the proud and the prosperous because of the forlorn poverty of my appearance among the fashionable and the fortunate where i might have hoped to find urbanity and the social polish of a civilized nation i could gain no admittance for i had no title kept no carriage and was no sycophant the doors of the learned were shut upon me for they were doctors or dignitaries in church physic or law of science they were all satisfied they had enough of profit promotion and the other good things of which they were in full pursuit i had none to give by my presence they would have been retarded offended at the freedom of my conversation and by my friendship disgraced they sought other and far different associates bowed to the earth as i was by this soulkilling injustice and wearied by these incessant toils i still did not neglect my tragedy for an hour i considered and reconsidered the objections that had been made i was convinced they were ill founded but i was not left to the exercise of my own judgment i had no alternative to lower the tone of passion was in my opinion to injure my tragedy but it must be done or must not be performed the manager urged arguments that were and perhaps could not but be satisfactory to any man in his situation his experience of public taste was long and confirmed the nightly expences of a theatre made it a most serious concern the risk of every new piece was great for the town was capricious to obtain all possible security against risk therefore was a duty the reluctance with which alterations were made occasioned them to be rather slow at last however i finished them as much to my own satisfaction as could under such circumstances be expected and a fair copy written as all the copies made of it were with my own hand was again sent to the manager a week longer than in the former instances elapsed before i heard from him and when i did hear the substance of his letter was that he had a new comedy in preparation which it being then the middle of march would entirely fill up the remainder of the season what could i do no blame was imputable to him for the delay it was no fault of his that i was pursued by the malice of poverty that i was tormented with the desire of effectually relieving the necessities of my family that i had written to my mother and sister in the elated moment of hope an assurance of being able to grant this relief in a very few weeks and that buoyed up by these calculations i had indulged myself in procuring a suit of clothes and other necessaries of which i was in extreme need on credit thou world of vice thou ironhearted senseless mass of madness and folly why did i ever dream that i had the power to arrest thy headlong course and fix thy bewildered wits thy garish idiot eye on me on my weak efforts my humble wishes my craving wants what signs of luxury what tokens of dissipation what innumerable marks of extravagant waste did i every where see around me at the moment that poverty was thus pinching me to the very bone here a vain mortal as insolent as uninstructed drawn by six ponies with a postillion before and three idle fellows behind pampered in vice that he might thus openly insult common sense and thus publicly proclaim the folly of his head to be as egregious as the insensibility of his heart was hateful there trifling and imbecile creatures who not satisfied with the appellation woman call themselves ladies and expend thousands on their routs maskedballs whipped creams and other froth and frippery procured from the achs and pains and blood and bones of the poor wretches more bent and weighed down by misery than even i was what need i to recall such pictures to your imaginations can you look abroad and not behold them are not the vices of unequal distribution to be met with in every corner nook and alley is not the despotism of wealth that is of that property which the folly of man so much reveres and worships every where visible does it not varnish vice generate crime and trample virtue and the virtuous in the dust is the deep sense which i have entertained of the relentless injustice of society all false impelled as i was by paltry yet pressing wants and debts that would admit of no delay i sought relief in endeavouring to raise money on the presumptive profits of my tragedy what can the wretch who is thus besieged thus hunted do but yield i had promised aid to my family and depending on that promise which had been much too confidently given my mother was in danger of having her trifling effects seized my sister whom i then tenderly loved of being turned loose perhaps into the haunts of infamy and myself of being thrown into a loathsome prison my first attempt was a very wild one and proved how little i yet knew of mankind i wrote a letter to a woman of great fame in the literary world the reputed writer of a work the praises of which had been often echoed and whose wealth was immense to such a person i thought the appeal i had to make must come with resistless force for a man of literature a poet capable of writing a tragedy that had already been deemed worthy at least of attention from the theatre and of the merits of which she so well could judge for such a man she would be all kindness all sensibility all soul what an incurable dolt was i thus repeatedly to degrade the character of bard and thus too in vain i blushno matter i minutely detailed the circumstances of my case to this female leader of literature and assiduously endeavouring to avoid every feature of meanness requested the loan of one hundred pounds appealing for the probability of reimbursement to her own conceptions of the rectitude of the mind that could produce the tragedy i sent and which i requested her first to read she herself would judge of the danger there might be of its condemnation if she thought it would fail i then should be anxious that she should run no risk but if not the loan would be a most essential benefit to me and perhaps a pleasure to herself fool that i was thus to estimate ladies pleasures whether she did or did not read my play i never knew but this learned lady this patroness of letters this beprosed and berhymed dowager who professed to be the enraptured lover of poetry wit and genius returned it with a formal cold apology that was insulting by its affected pity she was extremely sorry to be obliged to refuse me extremely sorry indeed it would have given her infinite pleasure to have advanced me the sum i required but she was then building a fine house which demanded all the money she could possibly spare why ay she must have a fine house with fifty fine rooms in it fortynine of which were useless while i my mother my sister and millions more might perish without a hovel in which to shelter our heads convinced at last of the futility of applications like these i sought an opposite resource if men would not lend money to benefit me they would perhaps to benefit themselves one of the actors with whom i became acquainted informed me that there was a jew who frequented all theatrical haunts knew i had a play in the managers hands and might possibly be induced to lend me the sum i wanted to this jew i addressed myself stated the merits of the case and fearful of making too high a demand requested a loan of seventy pounds his first question was concerning the security i had to give i had none the jew shook his head and told me it was impossible to lend money without security i replied that if making over the profits of my tragedy to the amount of the principal and interest would but satisfy him to that i should willingly consent again he shrugged his shoulders and repeated it was very dangerous jews themselves kind as they were could not lend money without security beside money was never so scarce as just at that moment indeed he had no such sum himself but he had an uncle in dukes place who if i could but get good personal security would supply me on paying a premium adequate to the risk i must avoid being too circumstantial i urged every incitement my imagination could honestly suggest he pretended to state the matter to his uncle the affair was kept in suspence and i was obliged to travel to dukes place at least a dozen times but at last i gave my bond for a hundred pounds for which i received fifty and paid two guineas out of it on the demand of the nephew for the trouble he had taken in negociating the business the uncle being the ostensible person with whom it was transacted determined to secure my mother from want as far as was in my power i remitted the whole sum to her except what was necessary to pay my immediate debts and blessed the jew extortioner as a man who compared to the learned lady abounded in the milk of human kindness by the continuance of my literary drudgery the time passed away to the middle of september the season at which the winter theatres usually open i now felt tenfold anxiety concerning my tragedy the bond i had given at six months would soon become due failure would send me to prison perhaps for life it would disgrace me would distract my family would cut short my hopes of fame and the grand progress which i sometimes fondly imagined i should make every way it would be fatal i trembled at its possibility success which had so lately appeared certain seemed to become more and more dubious during the summer i had heard nothing from the manager i now inquired at the theatre and was told he was at bath and would not be in town in less than a fortnight i waited with increasing fears haunted the playhouse and teazed the attendants at it with my inquiries of these i soon perceived not only the sneers but the duplicity for when the manager was returned to town and as i was told by a performer was actually in the theatre they affirmed the contrary he had been but was gone i plainly read the lie in their looks to each other at that time it was new to me and gave me great pain but i soon became accustomed though never reconciled to their manners which were characterized by that low cunning that supercilious mixture of insolence and meanness that is always detested by the honest and the open a set ofpshaw they are unworthy my remembrance finding the manager was now returned i immediately wrote to him and a meeting was appointed three days after at the theatre he then informed me there were still some few alterations which he was desirous should be immediately made after which the tragedy should be put into rehearsal and performed in about three weeks this was happy news to me i returned with an elated heart to make the proposed corrections finished them the same day and again delivered the piece into the managers hands he proceeded with a punctuality that delighted me the parts were cast and the performers called to the theatre to hear it read this was a new scene a new trial of patience a new degradation instead of that steady attention from my small audience which i expected that deep interest which i supposed the story must inspire suffusing them in tears or transfixing them in terror the ladies and gentlemen amused themselves with whispers winks jokes titters and giggling which when they caught my attention and fixed my eye upon the laughers were turned into an affected gravity that added to the insult no heart panted no face turned pale no eye shed a tear and if i were to judge from this experiment a more uninteresting soulless piece had never been written but the manager was not present and i was not a person of consequence enough to command respect or ceremony from any party i complained to him of the total want of effect in my tragedy over the passions of the actors but he treated that as a very equivocal sign indeed and of no worth there was another circumstance of which he informed me that to him and as it afterward proved to me was of a much more serious nature they had not been altogether so inattentive as i had imagined amid their monkey tricks and common place foolery their hearts had been burning with jealousy of each other neither men nor women were satisfied with their parts i had three male and two female characters of great importance in the play but rising in gradation of the first of these all the actors were ambitious and one of them who knew his own consequence and that the manager could not carry on the business of the theatre at that time without him threw up his part in vain did i plead write and remonstrate no reasons no motives of generosity or of justice to the manager the piece or the public could prevail and his aid though most essential could not be obtained had the part been totally beneath his abilities his plea would have been good but it was avowedly in the managers opinion and in the opinion of every other performer superior to half of those he nightly played that it could have disgraced or injured him partiality itself could not affirm and is the poet after having spent a life in that deep investigation of the human heart which alone can enable him to write a play whose efforts must be prodigious and if he succeed his pathos wit and genius rare is he after all his struggles to be at the mercy of an ignorant actor or actress who so far from deeply studying the sense frequently do not remember the words they ought to repeat every mister is discontented with the character allotted him each envies the other and mutters accusations against both author and manager sir wont speak the prologue it is not in his way and madam will have the epilogue or she will positively throw up her part one gentleman thinks his dialogue too long and heavy and tother too short and trifling this fine lady refuses to attend rehearsals another comes but has less of the spirit of the author at the fifth repetition than she had at the first of their parts individually they know but very little of the play as a whole they are absolutely ignorant on the first representation by which the reputation of a play is decided they are so confused and imperfect owing partly to their imbecility but more still to their indolence that the sense of the author is mutilated his characters travestied and his piece rather burlesqued than performed the reality of the scene depends on the passions excited in the actor listening almost as essentially as in the actor speaking but at the end of each speech the player supposes his part is over the arms attitude and features all sink into insignificance and have no more meaning than the face of punch when beating joan of the reality of this picture i soon had full proof my tragedy after a number of rehearsals during which all these vexatious incidents and many more were experienced by me was at length performed to say that the applause it received equalled my expectations would be false but it greatly exceeded the expectations of others it was materially injured by the want of the actor who had refused his part the reigning vice of recitation which since the death of garrick has again prevailed injured it more the tide of passion which should have rushed in torrents and burst upon the astonished ear was sung out in slow and measured syllables with a monotonous and funeral cadence painful in its motion and such as reminded me of the sloth and his horrid cry plaintive indeed but exciting strange disgust my success however was thought extraordinary the actors when the play was over swarmed into the greenroom to congratulate me the actresses were ready to kiss me good natured souls the greenroom loungers newspaper critics authors and pretended friends of the house flocked round me to wish me joy and stare at that enviable animal a successful poet one of them himself an approved writer of comedy offered me five hundred pounds for the profits of my piece and as far as money was concerned i thought my fortune was made doubts and difficulties were fairly over and the reward of all my toils was at last secure sanguine blockhead thus everlastingly to embitter my own cup of sorrow secure oh no the nectar of hope was soon dashed from my lips i must detail the causes of this reverse they were various and decisive it had been the custom on the appearance of every new play to give it what is called a run that is to perform it without intermission as many nights as the house should continue to be tolerably filled the managers of both theatres had at this time deemed the practice prejudicial and determined to reform it of this reform i was the victim my play was the first that appeared after the resolution had been taken and in the bills of the day which announced the performance of my tragedy for the saturday evening the public were advertised that another piece would be acted on monday ignorant of the true reason the town misinterpreted this notice into an avowal that no favourable expectations were formed of my tragedy and as the author was an obscure person whose name was totally unknown to the world none of that public curiosity on which popularity depends was excited this was but one of the damning causes my play appeared about the middle of october when the season continued to be fine the citizens were all at the watering places the court was at windsor the parliament had not met and the town was empty to add to all this one of the performers was taken ill on the second night another of them thought proper to ride over to egham races on the third where he got drunk and absented himself from the theatre so that substitutes were obliged to be found for both the parts in fine though some few struck as they affirmed with the merits of the play were just enough to attempt to bring it into public esteem it gradually sunk into neglect my third night after paying the expences of the house produced me only twenty pounds on the sixth night the receipts were less than the charges and it was played no more the overplus of the third night was little more than sufficient to defray the deficiences of the sixth and thus vanished my golden dreams of profit prosperity and fame the evil did not rest here i was in danger of all the misfortunes i had foreseen from the jew and the bond there was not only hardship and severity but injustice in my case and i determined to remonstrate to the manager my mind was sore and my appeal was spirited but proper it was an appeal to his equity he listened to me acknowledged i had been unfortunate and said that though the theatre could not and ought not to be accountable for my loss yet some compensation he thought was justly my due he therefore gave me a draft on his treasurer for one hundred pounds and wished me better success in future this it is true was of the most essential service to me it relieved me not only from imprisonment but from the degradation of having my honesty questioned it did not however restore me to the hope that should have rouzed me to greater exertions some new efforts indeed i was obliged to make for the time consumed in revising my tragedy and attending rehearsals had occasioned me to neglect other pursuits and i was again some few pounds in debt no dread of labour no degree of misery could induce me to leave these debts unpaid i therefore worked and starved till they were all discharged after which i returned to the country and became usher at the school where i first knew you mr trevor to paint the family distresses that succeeded the disgrace the infamy that attended them the wretchedness that afterward preyed upon me till i could endure no more were needless i was satisfied that i had a right to end a state of suffering and to be rid of a world that considers itself as burthened not benefited by such creatures as i am at torments after death concerning which bigotry and cunning have invented such horrid fables accusing and blaspheming a god whom they pretend to adore of tyranny the most monstrous and injustice the most abhorred at tales like these i laughed you mr turl say you can shew me better arguments moral motives that are indispensable why i ought to live these are assertions of which i must consider you have restored me to life prove that you have done me a favour of that i doubt my first sensation after recovering my faculties was anger at your officious pity shew me that it was ill timed and unjust if you have reduced me to the necessity of again debating the same painful and gloomy question if you cannot give that elasticity to my mind which will animate it to despise difficulty and steel it against injustice however good your intentions may have been i fear you have but imposed misery upon me chapter x remarks on the mistakes of mr wilmot by turl law or important truths discussed to which few will attend fewer will understand and very few indeed will believe the state of mind into which his mistakes had brought him rendered wilmot an object of compassion the tone in which he concluded testified the alarming errors into which he was still liable to fall for this reason though turl treated him with all possible humanity and tenderness he considered it as dangerous to him and scarcely less so to me on whom he perceived the strong impression the narrative had made to be silent with a voice and countenance therefore of perfect urbanity he thus replied do not imagine mr wilmot that i have not been deeply penetrated by your sufferings that i am insensible of your uncommon worth or that i approve the vices of society and the injustice and unfeeling neglect with which you have been treated thousands are at this moment subject to the same oppression but the province of wisdom is not to lament over our wrongs it is to find their remedy querulous complaint pardon me if my words or expressions have any illtimed severity indeed that is far from my intention querulous complaint is worthy only of the infancy of understanding the world is unjust and why because it is ignorant ought that to excite either complaint or anger would not the energies of intellect be more worthily employed in removing the cause by the communication of knowledge you bid me restore the elasticity of your mind can you look round on the follies and mistakes of men which you have the power to detect expose and in part reform and be in want of motive you demand that i should communicate to you the desire of life can you have a perception of the essential duties that you are fitted to perform and dare you think of dying you have been brooding over your own wrongs which your distorted fancy has painted as perhaps the most insufferable in the whole circle of existence how could you be so blind look at the mass of evil by which you are surrounded what is its origin ignorance ignorance is the source of all evil and there is one species of ignorance to which you and men like you have been egregiously subject ignorance of the true mode of exercising your rare faculties ignorance of their unbounded power of enjoyment you have been persuaded that this power was destroyed by the ridiculous distinctions of rich and poor oh mad world monstrous absurdity incomprehensible blindness look at the rich in what are they happy in what do they excel the poor not in their greater stores of wealth which is but a source of vice disease and death but in a little superiority of knowledge a trifling advance toward truth how may this advantage be made general not by the indulgence of the desires you have fostered the tendency of which was vicious but by retrenching those false wants that you panted to gratify and thus by giving leisure to the poor or rather to all mankind to make the acquirement of knowledge the grand business of life this is the object on which the attention of every wise man should be turned he that by precept or example shall prevail on community to relinquish one superfluous dish one useless and contemptible trapping will be the general friend of man he who labours for riches to countenance by his practice their abuse is labouring to secure misery to himself and perpetuate it in society who ought to be esteemed the most rich he whose faculties are the most enlarged how wealthy were you had you but known it at the moment your mind was distracting itself by these dirges of distress he that would riot in luxury let him wait the hour of appetite and carry his morsel into the harvest field there let him seat himself on a bank eat and cast his eyes around then while he shall appease the cravings of hunger not pamper the detestable caprice of gluttony let him remember how many thousands shall in like manner be fed by the plenty he every where beholds how poor and pitiable a creature would he be were his pleasure destroyed or narrowed because the earth on which it was produced was not what he had absurdly been taught to call his own you complain that the titled and the dignified rejected your intercourse how could you thus mistake your true rank how exalted was it compared to the ridiculous arrogance you envied were you now visiting bedlam would you think yourself miserable because its mad inhabitants despised you for not being as mighty a monarch as each of themselves but little depth of penetration is necessary to perceive that the lunatics around us are no less worthy of our laughter and our pity if i do not mistake you mr trevor are hurrying into the very errors that have misled your noble minded friend and instructor your active genius is busying itself how to obtain those riches and distinctions on which you have falsely supposed happiness depends you are in search of a profession by which your fortune is to be made beware notwithstanding that i am frequently assaulted by the same kind of folly myself i yet never recollect it without astonishment while turl confined the application of his precepts to wilmot i listened and assented with scarcely a doubt but the moment he directed them against me i turned upon him with all the force to which by my passions and fears i was rouzed what said i would you persuade me to renounce those pursuits by which alone i can gain distinction and respect in society would you have me remain in poverty and thus relinquish the dearest portion of existence olivia was full in my thoughts as i spoke of what worth would life be were i so doomed rather than accept it on such terms were there ten thousand serpentine rivers i would drown in them all turl glanced significantly first at me and then at wilmot do you consider the danger the possible consequences of the doctrine you are now inculcating mr trevor too much devoured by passion to attend to his reproof in the sense he meant it i retorted in a still louder key i can discover no ill consequences in being sincere i repeat were there millions of seas i would sooner drown in them all you are continually pushing your philosophy to extremes mr turl you should rather say mr trevor you are pushing your want of philosophy to an extreme the self denial you require is not in the nature of man the nature of man is a senseless jargon man is that which he is made by the various occurrences to which he is subjected those occurrences continually differ no two men therefore were ever alike but how are you to obtain the wealth and dignity you seek by honest means can you suppose me capable of any other alas how universal how dangerous are the mistakes of mankind your hopes are childish the law i understand is your present pursuit do you suppose it possible to practise the law in any form and be honest sirmr turlyou amaze me where is the dishonesty of pleading for the oppressed how little have you considered the subject how ignorant are you of the practice of the law oppressed do counsel ever ask who is the oppressed do they refuse a brief because the justice of the case is doubtful do they not always inquire not what is justice but what is law do they not triumph most and acquire most fame when they can gain a cause in the very teeth of the law they profess to support and revere who is the greatest lawyer not he who can most enlighten but he who can most perplex and confound the understanding of his hearers he who can best browbeat and confuse witnesses and embroil and mislead the intellect of judge and jury yet the mischiefs i have mentioned are but the sprouts and branches of this tree of evil its root is much deeper it is in the law itself and in the system of property of which law is the support pshaw these are the distempered dreams of reform run mad are they consider beware of the mischief of deciding rashly beware of your passions that are alarmed lest they should be disappointed it is you that decide prove this rooted evil of law suppose me unable to prove it are its consequences the less real but i will endeavour he who is told that to do justice is to conduce with all his power to the well being of the whole has a simple intelligible rule for his conduct he on the contrary who is told that to do justice is to obey the law has to inquire not what is justice but what is the law now to know the law were it practicable would be not only to know the statutes at large by rote but all the precedents and all the legal discussions and litigations to which the practitioners of law appeal innumerable volumes filled with innumerable subtleties and incoherencies and written in a barbarous and unintelligible jargon must be studied memory is utterly inadequate to the task and reason revolts spurns at and turns from it with loathing a short statement of facts will in my opinion demonstrate that law in its origin and essence is absolutely unjust to make a law is to make a rule by which a certain class of future events shall be judged future events can only be partially and imperfectly foreseen consequently the law must be partial and imperfect let us take the facts in another point of viewthe law never varies the cases never agree the law is general the case is individual the penalty of the law is uniform the justice or injustice of the case is continually different to prejudge any case that is to give a decided opinion on it while any of the circumstances remain unknown is unjust even to a proverb yet this is precisely what is done by making a law this is strange doctrine mr turl disprove the facts mr trevor they are indisputable and on them the following syllogism may indisputably be formed to make a law is publicly to countenance and promote injustice publicly to countenance and promote injustice is a most odious and pernicious action consequently to make a law is a most odious and pernicious action how unlimited are the moral mischiefs that result to make positive laws is to turn the mind from the inquiry into what is just and compel it to inquire what is law to make positive laws is to habituate and reconcile the mind to injustice by stamping injustice with public approbation to make positive laws is to deaden the mind to that constant and lively sense of what is just and unjust to which it must otherwise be invariably awake by not only encouraging but by obliging it to have recourse to rules founded in falsehood each case is law to itself that is each case ought to be decided by the justice or the injustice arising out of the circumstances of that individual case and by no other case or law whatever for the reason i have already given that there never were nor ever can be two cases that were not different from each other i therefore once more warn you mr trevor that law is a pernicious mass of errors and that the practitioners of it can only thrive by the mischiefs which they themselves produce the falsehoods they propagate and the miseries they inflict this would be dangerous doctrine to the preacher were it heard in westminster hall i am sorry for it i am sorry that man can be in danger from his fellow men because he endeavours to do them good chapter xi painful meditations a new project for acquiring wealth a journey to bath that the reader may judge of the arguments of turl i have been anxious to state them simply and not perplexed with the digressions commentaries cavils and violent opposition they met with from me striking as they did at the very root of all my promised pleasures how could i listen and not oppose destroying as they did all my towering hopes at a breath what could i do but rave when my arguments and my anger were exhausted i sat silent for a while sunk in melancholy revery at length i recovered myself so far as to endeavour to console mr wilmot offer him every assistance in my power and persuade him to an interview with his sister aided by the benevolent arguments of turl this purpose was with some little difficulty effected and i returned home to relate to miss wilmot what had happened in very bitterness of soul i then began to meditate on the prospect before me the sensations i experienced were at some moments agonizing could i even have renounced fame and fortune and patiently have resigned myself to live in obscure poverty yet to live as in such a case i must do without olivia would be misery to which no arguments could induce me to submit but how obtain her where were all my bright visions fled poor wilmot what an example did he afford of ineffectual struggles talents neglected and genius trampled in the dust was there more security for me turl indeed seemed to resign himself without a murmur and to be happy in despite of fate but he had no olivia to regret if he had happiness without her would be impossible to attempt to repeat all the tormenting fears that hurried and agitated my mind on this occasion were fruitless suffice it to say this was one of those severe conflicts to which by education and accident i was subject and it was not the least painful part of the present one that i could come to no decision i persuaded myself indeed that with respect to law turls reasoning was much too severe and absolute it was true i could not but own that law was inclined to debase and corrupt the morals of its practitioners but surely there were exceptions and if i pursued the law why should not i be one of them if therefore the happiness at which i aimed were attainable by this means i asserted to myself that i had heard no reasons which ought to deter me from practising the law in the mean time i had conceived a project that related to the immediate state of my feelings the acuteness of which i was obliged to seek some method to appease olivia was gone to bath with her aunt and thither i was determined to follow her full of this design i dispatched philip with orders that a post chaise should be ready at the door by nine oclock the next morning after which to rid myself as much as possible of the thoughts that haunted me i once more went in search of the false belmont i found him at the usual place engaged at play the betting was high he appeared to be overmatched and for a few games his antagonist who like himself was a first rate player triumphed my passions were always of the touchwood kind rouzed and tempted by the bets that were so plentifully offered the thought suddenly occurred how possible it was for a man of penetration who could keep himself perfectly cool as i was persuaded i could what was there indeed that i persuaded myself i could not do to make a fortune by gambling i did not indeed call it by the odious term gambling it was calculation foresight acuteness of discernment my morality was fast asleep so intent was i on profiting by this new and surprisingly certain source of wealth and so avaricious of the means that at a glance seemed to promise the gratification of all my desires i had not frequented a billiard table without have exercised my own skill learned the odds and obtained a tolerable knowledge of the game itself so fixed was my cupidity on its object that i began with the caution of a blackleg made a bet and the moment the odds turned in my favour secured myself by taking them hedged again as the advantage changed and thus made myself a certain winner i exulted in my own clearness of perception and wondered that so palpable a method of winning should escape even an idiot the experience however of a few games taught me that my discovery was not quite of so lucrative a nature as i had supposed the odds did not every game vary from side to side people were not always inclined to bet the odds and if i would run no great risk i even found it necessary to bet them sometimes myself every man who has made the experiment knows that the thirst of lucre when thus awakened in a young mind is insatiable impetuous and rash i was weary of petty gains and riches by retail the ardour with which i examined the players and each circumstance as it occurred persuaded me that there were tokens by which an acute observer might discover the winning party i had on former occasions remarked that players but rarely win game and game alternately even when they leave off equal but that success has a tide with a kind of periodical ebb and flow this said i may be attributed to the temper of the players the loser is too angry to attend with sufficient caution to his game he persuades himself that luck is against him strikes at random and does mischief every stroke after a while the winner grows careless loses a game and becomes angry and conquered in turn exulting in my prodigious penetration and fortified in my daring by reasoning so deep i determined to hedge no more bets belmont whose notice my sudden rage for betting had by no means escaped was at this time losing and i was backing his antagonist to one of the bets i offered he said done and though i felt a reluctance to win his money it seemed ungentlemanlike to refuse i won the first three bets and exulting in my own acuteness and certainty intreated him in pity to desist he refused and i pleaded the pain i felt at winning the money of a friend beside it was not only dishonourable but dishonest it was absolutely picking his pocket my triumph was premature from this time fortune veered and he began to win i was then willing to have taken the other side but could not procure a bet he bantering bade me not be afraid of winning my friends money it was neither dishonourable dishonest nor picking his pocket piqued by his sarcasms i continued till i had lost five and twenty guineas and then my vexation and pride which almost foamed at the suspicion of my own folly made me propose to bet double or quit i lost again again resorted to the same desperate remedy and met with the same ill success my frenzy was such that i a third time urged him to continue fortunately for me his antagonist would play no more and i was left to reflect that my calculations and avaricious arts to rob fools and outwit knaves were as crude as they were contemptible wrung as i was to the heart i was ashamed of having it supposed that the loss of my hundred guineas in the least affected me belmont insisted that i should sup with him and when i attempted to decline his invitation bantered me out of my refusal by asking if i had parted with my hundred guineas to purchase the spleen during supper i informed him of my intended journey to bath and he immediately proposed to accompany me telling me that he had himself had the same intention on this we accordingly agreed and i left him early and retired to bed but not to rest the quick decay of my small substance the helpless state in which i found myself the impatience with which i desired wealth and power and the increasing distance at which i seemed to be thrown from olivia by this last act of folly kept me not only awake but in a fever of thought the next day we set off and arrived at bath the same evening where the first inquiries i made were at the pumproom to learn where olivia and her aunt were lodged so inconsiderate and eager were my desires that i endeavoured to obtain apartments in the same house but ineffectually they were all let i was recommended to others however in milsomstreet in which i fixed my abode there was not room for belmont and he got lodgings on the south parade chapter xii desperate measures olivia and her aunt a rash accusation and its strange consequences affairs brought to a crisis before i proceed to the history of my bath adventures it is necessary to take a brief retrospect of the state of my affairs the total of my expences from the time that i received the four hundred and fifty pounds of thornby to my arrival at bath was about two hundred and forty pounds including the sum i had lost at billiards the money i had paid for printing my pamphlet the last sheet of which i corrected before i left town thirty pounds that in consequence of a letter from my mother i remitted to her and twenty for the purchase of a lottery ticket for among other absurd and vicious ways of becoming rich that suggested itself to my eager fancy the quick decay of my very small inheritance lay corroding at my heart and prompted me to a thousand different schemes without the power of determining me to any my general propensity however was more to the desperate which should at once be decisive than to the slow and lingering plans of timid prudence in reality both seemed hopeless and therefore the briefest suffering was the best at some short intervals the glow of hope which had lately been so fervid would return and those powers of thought that seemed to be struggling within me would promise great and glorious success but these were only flashes of lightening darting through a midnight sky the texture of which was deep obscurity darkness visible to one point however i was fixed that of using every endeavour to learn the true sentiments of olivia respecting me and if any possible opportunity offered of declaring my own to effect this i resolved since i knew not what better method to take that i would watch the few public places to which all the visitors at bath resort i therefore immediately subscribed to the upper and lower rooms and traversed the city in every direction people not confined to their chamber are here sure to be soon met with and on the second morning after my arrival i discovered olivia seated at the farther end of the pumproom she had an old lady who proved to be her aunt by her side and a circle round her in which were several handsome fellows who my jealous eye instantly discovered were all ambitious of her regard the moment i had a glimpse of her i was seized with a trembling that shook my whole frame and a sickness that i with difficulty subdued i approached stopped turned aside again advanced again hesitated and was once more almost overcome by a rising of the heart that was suffocating and a swimming of the brain that made my limbs stagger my eyes roll and deprived me of sight it was sometime before i could make another attempt at length i caught her eye with the rapidity of lightening her cheek was suffused with blushes and as instantaneously changed to a deathlike pale it was my habitual error to interpret every thing in my own favour and the conviction that she was suffering emotions similar to my own was transport to me for some minutes i mingled with the croud fearful of a relapse on my own part and on hers but keeping her in sight and presenting myself to her view till i was rouzed by an apparent motion of the aunt to rise i then advanced but still in an ague fit of apprehension i attempted to bow and in a faltering and feeble voice pronounced her name hoped she was well andi could proceed no farther my disease was infectious she sat a moment severely struggling with her feelings and then returned a kind of inarticulate complimentary answer what is the matter olivia said the aunt how strangely you look child who is the gentleman olivia made another effort it is mr trevor madam the grandson of the rector of oh ho the young oxonian that my nephew hector tells the comical story about of the methodist preacher and of his throwing you into the water and then taking you out again the tone form and features of the old lady with this short introductory dialogue gave me a strong but no encouraging picture of her character her voice was masculine her nose short her mouth wide her brow bent and bushy and the corners of her eyes and cheeks deeply wrinkled i attempted to enter into conversation but my efforts were aukward the answers of the aunt were broad coarse and discouraging and olivia though embarrassed i accused of being cold the manner of the old lady clearly indicated that she suspected my design and an endeavour in me to prolong the conversation by turning it on my native county drew from her the following animadversions i have heard a great deal about your family mr trevor and of the ridiculous opposition which your grandfather pretended to make to my late brother mowbray your mother i think was twice married and as i have been told both times very imprudently so that the proud hopes which the rector entertained of raising a family were all overthrown but that is always the case with clandestine matches many families of much greater consequence than ever yours was mr trevor have been brought low by such foolish and wicked doings young girls that have indulged improper connections and secret lovers have involved themselves and all their relations in ruin by their guilty proceedings you are but a petty instance of the base and bad consequences of the crimes of such foolish young hussies come niece they both rose to go the dialogue that had just passed had no listeners though of that circumstance the aunt was evidently regardless the circle round olivia had presently dispersed as good manners required when i a stranger came up the repugnant and ominous behaviour of the aunt did but increase the impetuous haste that i felt to know the worst and addressing myself to olivia i asked with some eagerness if i might be permitted to pay her my respects while she continued at bath the aunt fixed her eye on me look you said she mr trevor you are a handsome young fellow and i do not want handsome young fellows about my niece i see too many of them they have little fortune and less shame they give me a deal of trouble no good can come of their smirking and smiling their foppery and their forward prate my niece i believe has much more prudence than is usual with the young minxes of the present day but no matter for that i am sure there is no prudence in setting gunpowder too near the fire i have heard her talk of your taking her out of the water in a manner that if i did not know her i should not quite like so i must plainly tell you sir as i can see no good that can come of your acquaintance i shall take care to prevent all harm not that there is much fear for she knows her duty and has always done it neither can you have entertained any impertinent notions it would be too ridiculous though what my nephew and mr andrews told me i own did seem as if you could strangely forget yourself but at once to cut matters short i now tell you plainly and down right her choice is made yes sir her choice is positively made and so though i do not suppose you have taken any foolish crotchets and improper whims into your head for that would be too impertinent yet as you knew one another when children and so forth it was best to be plain with you at once because though such ridiculous nonsense was quite impossible i hear on all hands you are a bold and flighty young gentleman and that you have no little opinion of yourself dumb founded as i was by this undisguised refusal this hard unfeeling reprimand i made no attempt to reply or follow the flushings of olivias face indeed were continual but what were they more than indignant repellings of her aunts broad surmises had they been favourable to me why did she not declare them with the openness of which she had so striking an example she curtsied as she went but it was a halfsouled compliment that while i attempted to return my heart resented they disappeared and i remained feeling as if now first made sensible of the extreme folly the lunacy of all my actions the dialogue i had just heard vibrated in my brain burning and wasting it with the frenzy of agonizing recollection i was a forward prating fop of little fortune and less shame bold and flighty with no little opinion of myself again and again i was ridiculous and impertinent my crotchets whims and nonsense were impossible nor was this all there was another piece of intelligence an additional and dreadful feature of despair the name of andrews detested sound racking idea her choice is made positively made excruciating thought why then welcome ruin sudden and irrevocable ruin as soon as i could recover sufficient recollection i hurried home where i remained in a trance of torment and disposed to a thousand acts of madness that were conceived and dismissed with a rapidity of pain that rendered my mind impotent to all except the inflicting torture on itself at last the agony in which i sat was interrupted by the appearance of belmont we had agreed to go to lansdown races he told me it was now time took me by the arm and hurried me away reckless of where i went or what i did i obeyed the course was at no great distance a carriage was not to be procured and we walked the steepness of the hill the heat of the day and above all the anguish of my heart threw me into a violent heat the drops rolled down my cheeks and i put my handkerchief lightly into my hat to prevent its pressure lost in a revery of misery i acted instinctively and breathed the dust heard the hubbub and saw the confusion around me without perceiving them after the first heat there was a battle toward which i was dragged by belmont in the tumult and distraction of my thoughts i scarcely knew what happened and feeling in my pocket for my handkerchief i missed it a croud and a pickpocket was an immediate suggestion neither coolness nor recollection were present to me i saw a man putting up a red and white handkerchief which i supposed to be mine and springing forward i caught him by the collar and exclaimed rascal you have robbed me in an instant the mob flocked round us and the supposed pickpocket was seized duck him duck him was the general cry and away the poor fellow was immediately hurried half awakened by the unpremeditated danger into which i had brought him i began to repent belmont who had lost sight of me came up and asked what was the matter a fellow has picked my pocket said i of what of my handkerchief your handkerchief is it not under your hat i snatched it off examined and there the handkerchief wasi was struck speechless the man whom i had falsely accused made a violent resistance the mob was dragging him along rending his clothes off his back and halftearing him in pieces the state of my mind was little short of frenzy in a tone of command i bade belmont follow made my way into the thickest of the croud and furiously began to beat the people who were illusing the prisoner calling till i was hoarse let him alone he is innocent i am to blame my efforts were vain a mob has many hands but no ears my blows were returned fifty fold i was inveloped by one mob myself while the poor wretch was hauled along by another not all my struggles could save him i could not get free and the man as belmost afterward informed me was half drowned after which he escaped and nobody knew what was become of him these were but a part of the accidents of the day my mind was maddening and i was ripe for mischief belmont in the evening went to the hazard table and i determined to accompany him to which he encouraged me the impetus was given and as if resolved on destruction i put all my money except a ten pound note to pay my bath debts in my pocket though ignorant of the cause of them belmont discovered my inclinations he took care to be at the place before the company assembled an accomplice as i afterward learned was present who displayed guineas and bank notes sufficient to convince me that he was my man if i could but win them i was as eager as they could desire and to increase my ardour was occasionally suffered to win a rich stake my success was of short duration i soon began to lose and foam with rage in the midst of this scene hector mowbray and tall andrews came in who unknown to me were at bath they saw me close my accounts and by their looks enjoyed my fury the whole company which now began to be numerous understood that i left off play because i had no more money to lose the pigeon was completely plucked this was the climax of misery at which i seemed ambitious to arrive during six hours i sat in a state of absolute stupor and echoed the uproar and blasphemy that surrounded me with deep but unconscious groans i do not know that i so much as moved till the company was entirely dispersed and i was awakened from my torpor by the groom porter i then languidly returned to my lodging exhausted and unable longer to support the conflicting torture end of volume iii volume iv chapter i the pains and penalties of illicit attempts to become rich the sleep of a gamester morning meditations the pungency of extreme grief acts as a temporary opiate for a short time it lulls the sufferer to insensibility and sleep but it is only to recruit him and awaken him to new torments when i reached my lodgings i appeared to myself to have sunk into a state of quiescent resignation the die was cast my doom was irrevocable and despair itself seemed to have lost its charm the animation the vigour of misery was gone i was reduced to an inevitable posthorse kind of endurance and had only now to be thankful if i might be permitted to exist from an audacious and arrogant confidence in my own strength i had suddenly yet by perceptible gradations declined though with excruciating pangs at every step till i now at last found myself in a state of sluggish and brute imbecility staggering home in this temper i undressed myself went to bed with stupid composure and felt like a wretch that had been stretched on the rack and having just been taken off was suffered to sink into lifeless languor because he could endure no more i was mistaken my sleeping sensations soon became turbulent oppressive fevered terrific yet cumbrous and impossible to awake from and escape it was seven in the morning when i returned to my lodging when i went to bed my heaviness was so great that i seemed as if i could have slept for centuries and so multifarious and torturing were the images that haunted me that the time actually appeared indefinitely protracted a month a year an age yet it was little more than two hours the moment struggling nature had cast off her horrible nightmares and i had once more started into identity the anguish of the past day and night again seized me pains innumerable and intolerable rushed upon me each new thought was a new serpent mine was the head of medusa with this difference my scorpions shed all their venom inward confusion of mind is the source of pain but confusion is the greatest in minds that are the seldomest subject to it and with those the pain is proportionably intense the conflict was too violent to be endured without an endeavour to get rid of it i rose traversed my room i know not how long and at last rushed into the street with a sort of feeling that when in the open air the atmosphere of misery that enveloped me would be swallowed up and lost in the infinite expanse the hope was vain it wrapped me round like a cloak it was a universal caustic that would not endure to be touched much less torn away i groaned i gnashed my teeth i griped my hands i struck myself violent blows i ran with fury in circles in zigzag with sudden turns and frantic bounds and finding myself on the banks of the avon plunged headlong in i acted from no plan or forethought therefore was far from any intention to drown myself and being in the water i swam as i had run like a mad or hunted bull that unpremeditated sensation which enforces immediate action is what i suppose philosophers mean by instinct if the word ever had any definite meaning thousands of these instinctive experiments are no doubt injurious to the animals that make them but their number being unlimited some of them are successful the benefit is remembered they are repeated and a future race profits by the wisdom that becomes habitual i am well persuaded that my immersion in the stream was assuaging and gamesters hereafter or the faculty themselves may if they please profit by the experiment i have no distinct recollection of coming out of the water though i remember walking afterward two or three hours till my cloaths were again entirely dry my feelings in the interval were somewhat similar to those of the preceding evening declining from frantic agitation to stupidity and torpor chapter ii an unexpected rencontre and a desperate contest victory dearly bought man is or which is the same thing his sensations are continually changing and it may be truly affirmed that he is many different animals in the course of a day a very unexpected yet very natural incident again rouzed me to a state of activity during my ramble i had strayed among the new buildings below the crescent i know not whether i had any latent hope or wish of having a distant sight of olivia walking there as is customary for air and exercise though i was certainly far too much degraded in my own opinion to intend being seen myself even by her much less by any of those proud beings those ephemera of fortune with whom while i despised their arrogance not to associate not to be familiar nay not to treat with a sort of conscious superiority was misery we all practise that haughtiness ourselves which in others is so irritating to our feelings and for which we pretend to have so sovereign a contempt as i passed a number of workmen my moody apathy though great did not prevent me from hearing one of them exclaim with a loud and suddenly angry surprize by g that is he i was at some little distance i heard the steps of a man running speedily toward me i turned round he looked me full in the face and with no less eagerness repeatedyes dmn me if it is not dick will come here run i stood fixed i did not recollect ever to have seen the exact figure before me but i had a strong and instantaneously a painful impression of the same form in a different garb it was the man whom i had accused the day before of picking my pocket the poor fellow who had been so unmercifully ducked and ill treated by the mob his impatience of revenge was furious without uttering another word he made a desperate blow at me i was unprepared and it brought me to the ground his foot was up to second it with as violent a kick but fortunately the generous spirit of my opponent and the laws of mob honour were mutually my shield he recollected the cowardice as well as the opprobrium of kicking a combatant when down and in the tone of rage commanded me to get up i was not slow in obeying the mandate nor he in repeating the assault i warded several of his blows which were dealt with too much thoughtless fury to be dangerous but again and again called on him to stop for a moment and hear me i felt i had been the cause of much mischief to the man and had no alacrity to increase the wrong my behaviour was not that of fear and his companions at length got between us and for a moment prevented the battle we were at the bottom of the hill the beginning of the fray had been seen and the crowd was collecting in every direction the beaus descended from the crescent and left the belles to view us through their operaglasses and pockettelescopes while they came to collect more circumstantial information the mowbray family had just arrived at this public promenade hector and tall andrews joined the mob the aunt and olivia remained on the walk the story of the false accusation the ducking and the injuries done to my antagonist ran varied and mangled from mouth to mouth a general sensation of rage was excited against me and hector and andrews very charitably gave it every assistance in their power not satisfied with this they proposed the lex talionis and calledduck him duck him they took care however to turn their backs imagining that amid the hubbub i should not distinguish their voices my antagonist though but a journeyman carpenter had too much of the hero in him to admit of this mean revenge his anger could only be appeased by chastising me with his own arm and proving to me as well as to the crowd how unworthy he was of that contemptible character which my accusation had endeavoured to fix upon him he was therefore determined to oblige me to fight i never remember to have felt greater repugnance than i now had to defend myself by committing more hurt and injury upon this indignant but brave fellow i tried to expostulate nay to intreat but in vain my remonstrances were construed into cowardice and fight i must or suffer such disgrace as my tyrophilosophy was ill calculated to endure my antagonist was stripped in form and as the diversion of a battle is what an english mob will never willingly forego i found partisans who determined to see fair play encouraged instructed me clapped me on the back and partly by intreaty partly by violence stripped off my coat they were vexed at my obstinate refusal to part with my waistcoat and shirt with their usual activity they soon made a ring and i stood undetermined and excessively reluctant not very willing to receive but infinitely averse to return the blows he now once more began to deal the carpenter was an athletic and powerful man famous for the battles he had fought and the victories he had gained his companions who evidently had an affection for him and who knew his prowess had no supposition that i could withstand him for five minutes though the hopes of those who were the most eager for the sport had been a little raised by the alertness with which i rose after being at first knocked down and the skill with which i then stood on my defence the doubts that pervaded my mind imparted i suppose something of that appearance to my countenance which is occasioned by fear for my adversary approached me with looks of contempt and as i retreated bade me stand forward and face him like a man the crowd behind seconded him and fearing it should be a runaway victory was rather willing to press upon and push me forward than to recede and give me any play hector and andrews were all the while very active as instigators my indecision occasioned me to receive several severe blows without returning one till at length i was again extended on the ground by a very desperate blow near the ear which for a few seconds deprived me of all sense and recollection this was no longer to be endured as soon as i recovered i sprang on my feet condescended to strip and became in turn the assailant the joy and vociferation of the mob were immense they thought it had been all over and to see me now rise stand forward and fight as i did with so much determination and effect was to them rapture they had discovered a hero their education had taught them for such is education that the man who has the power to endure and to inflict the most misery is the most admirable for six successive rounds i had completely the advantage during which my brave foe had received five knockdown blows for that is the phrase his companions and friends were astonished the beau pugilists were vociferating their bets five pounds to a crown in my favour the carpenter was as hardy as he was courageous he collected himself i had become less circumspect and he threw in another dangerous blow near my temple with the left hand that again felled me insensible to the earth i now recovered more slowly and less effectually i had been severely breathed by the violence of exertion the laws of pugilistic war will not suffer a man to lie after being knocked down more than a certain number of seconds hector had his stopwatch in his hand and tall andrews joined him to enforce the rule in all its rigour i was lifted on my feet before i had perfectly recovered my recollection and was again knocked down though with less injury while down i received a kick in the side of which my partisans instantly accused andrews meaning to do me mischief he did me a favour the wrangling that took place gave me time to recover and being again brought in face of my opponent i once more proposed a reconciliation and stretching out my arm asked him to shake hands but no the ducking was too bitterly remembered he would beat me or never go alive from the ground for a moment the generous thought of acknowledging myself vanquished suggested itself but rising vanity and false shame spurned at the proposal therefore since he was so desperate i had no resource but in being equally savage accordingly i bent my whole powers to this detestable purpose brought him twice more to the ground and on the third assault gave him a blow that verified his own prediction for he fell dead at my feet and was taken up lifeless from the place agony to agony vice to vice such was my fate where when how was it to have an end were not my own personal sufferings sufficient accuse an innocent man of theft deliver him over to the fury of a mob and not contented with that meet him again to fight beat murder him and without malice without evil intention nay with the very reverse abhorring the mischief i had done him and admiring the intrepidity and fortitude he had displayed nor did it end here the intelligence that was instantly sent round was horror indeed he had left a wife and seven children chapter iii the kind behaviour of old friends a joyful recovery more misfortunes patience per force never were sensations more truly tragical than mine yet as is frequent they had a dash of the ridiculous which resulted from the machinations of my good friends hector and andrews to inspire others with the contempt in which they held or rather endeavoured to hold me and to revenge the insults which they supposed themselves to have received from me were their incentives they knew i had been stripped of my money at the gamingtable they mingled with the partisans of the carpenter and informing them that i was a pretended gentleman advised them to have me taken before a magistrate for that the law would at least make me provide for the widow and children perhaps it would hang me as i deserved they farther proposed a subscription to begin with me and accordingly they came up to me as by deputation with the murdered mans hat the mortification they intended me had its full effect i was pennyless and the epithets which generous souls like these appropriate to such upstart intruders upon their rights and privileges as myself were muttered with as much insolence as they had the courage to assume i was not yet tamed i could not endure this baiting i hated almost abhorred andrews he dared to pretend love to olivia he had brought me into disgrace with her nay was soon to rob me of her everlastingly and recollecting the kick he had bestowed upon me when down i called him a scoundrel and accompanied the coarse expression with a blow in a moment the mob were again in agitation expected another battle admired my hardy valour and called for a ring andrews knew better he saved them the trouble and shuffled away followed though scouted even by hector himself for his cowardice mowbray remembered the battle of the rats and by comparison found himself a very hero the moment i was permitted i enquired to what place the poor carpenter had been taken and followed with infinite terror but with a faint degree of hope some affirming that he was dead others that he was not i was attended by several of my admirers it would be vain to attempt any picture of what my feelings were when coming into his dwelling i found him alive sitting surrounded by his wife children and companions i fell on my knees to him i owned all the mischief i had done him i conjured him for gods sake to forgive me i was half frantic and the worthy fellow in the same free spirit with which he had fought stretched out his hand in token of his forgiveness and friendship his unaffected magnanimity prompted me instantly to execute a design which i had before formed stay where you are my good friends said i to the people that stood round him i will be back in a few minutes the little reparation that i can make i will make to shew you that it was from error and not ill intention that i have done this brave man so much injury so saying i ran out of the house directed my course to my lodgings and hastened to my trunk to take out the tenpound note which i had reserved to pay my bath debts my passions were too much in a hurry to admit of any enquiry how these debts were to be paid when i should have given the banknote to the carpenter i was determined not to enquire but to appease my feelings rescue my character and bestow it on him where were my troubles to end the persecuting malice of fortune was intolerable philip the footman whom i had hired but scarcely ever employed had disappeared having previously broken open my trunk and taken with the ten pounds such of my linen and effects as he could carry under his cloaths and in his pockets without being seen this was a stroke little less painful than the worst of the accidents that had befallen me yet so harassed was my mind and so wearied with grieving that i did not feel it with half the poignancy act however i must but how i had left the carpenter and his family in suspense must i talk of favours which i could not confer or mention remuneration that would but seem like mockery this was painful but not so painful as falsehood i therefore returned related the story of the robbery and added that my intentions were to have endeavoured to afford some small recompence for the unintentional injury i had committed i was sorry that at present this accident had deprived me of the power but i hoped i should not always be so very destitute i certainly should neither forget the debt i had incurred nor the noble behaviour of the man who had suffered so much from me at present i was very unfortunate but if ever i should become more prosperous i should remember my obligation and in what manner it would become me to see it discharged i was heard with patience and with no disappointment my auditors though poor were far from selfish beside as i had not previously declared what i had intended i had excited little expectation my vanquished opponent whose name was clarke was soothed by the justice i did him in defending his innocence and praising his courage and said i had given him the satisfaction of a man and that was all he asked he rather sympathized with my loss than felt a loss of his own and gave various indications of a generous spirit such as is seldom to be found among persons who would think themselves highly disgraced by any comparison between them and a poor carpenter i own i quitted him with a degree of esteem such as neither the lord nor the bishop i had once been so willing or rather so industrious to revere had the good fortune to inspire having said every thing i could recollect to remove the doubts which the whole transaction might have excited against me i was eager to return to my lodging and consider what was best to be done the probability of tracing my footman and recovering the bank note a considerable portion of which by the bye was due to him for wages suggested itself i recollected that when i rose after my two hours sleep he had brought the breakfast and had manifested some tokens of anxiety at perceiving the perturbation of my mind i had hastily devoured the bread and butter that was on the table and drank a single bason of tea after which he enquired as i went out when i should be back and i had answered in a wild manner i did not know perhaps never from the degree of interest that he had shewn the robbery appeared the more strange and the remembrance of his enquiring and compassionate looks made me the less eager to pursue and have him hanged though at that time i considered hanging as a very excellent thing beside i had not the means of pursuit i had no money he had probably taken the london road and profiting by the first stagecoach that passed was now beyond my reach but how was i to act how discharge my debts what was to become of me i could find no solution to these difficulties i was oppressed by them i was wearied by the excess of action on my body as well as mind i sunk down on the bed without undressing or covering myself and fell into a profound sleep chapter iv a fever bad men have good qualities more proofs of compassion a scandalous tale does not lose in telling farewell to bath the emptiness of my stomach for i had eaten nothing except the bread and butter i mentioned since the preceding day at dinner the heats into which my violent exertions had thrown me and the sudden reverse of cold to which my motionless sleep subjected me produced consequences that might easily have been foreseen i awoke in the dead of the might and found myself seized with shivering fits my teeth chattering a sickness at my stomach my head intolerably heavy and my temples bruised with the blows i had received and having a sensation as if they were ready to burst to all this was added the stiffness that pervaded the muscles of my arms and body from the bruises falls and battering they had received it was with difficulty i could undress myself and get into bed where after i had lain shaking with increasing violence i know not how long my agueish sensations left me and were changed into all the soreness pains and burning that denote a violent fever during this paroxysm i felt consolation from its excess which persuaded me that i was now on my death bed i remembered all the wrongs which i conceived myself to have suffered with a sort of misanthropical delight arising from the persuasion that in my loss the world would be punished for the vileness of its injustice toward me perhaps every human being conceives that when he is gone there will be a chasm which no other mortal can supply and i am not certain that he does not conceive truly young men of active and impetuous talents have this persuasion in a very forcible degree all that i can remember of this fit of sickness till the violence and danger of it were over is that the people of the house came to me in the morning i knew not at what hour and made some enquiries a delirium succeeded which was so violent that at the beginning of my convalescence i had absolutely lost my memory and could not without effort recollect where i was how i had come there or what had befallen me the first objects that forcibly arrested my attention and excited memory were the honest carpenter clarke and his wife sitting by my bedside and endeavouring to console me the particulars which i afterward learned were that belmont had come the first day of my illness had seen me delirious had heard the account of my having been robbed and had left a twentypound note for my immediate necessities so true is it that the licentious the depraved and the unprincipled are susceptible of virtue and desirous of communicating happiness the most ignorant only are the most inveterately brutal but nothing less than idiotism or madness can absolutely deprive man of his propensity to do good i was further informed that a sealed paper addressed to mr trevor had been received and opened in the presence of the physician containing another twentypound bankbill but the paper that inclosed it was blank and that clarke unable to go immediately to work and reflecting on what he had heard from me concerning the destitute state in which i a stranger in bath was left by the robbery of my servant had walked out the next day had come with fear and diffidence to enquire after me and that finding me in a high fever his wife had been my first nurse her own large family indeed prevented her from watching and continuing always with me and therefore another attendant was obliged to be hired but she was by my bed side the greatest part of every day and her husband the same till he was again able to work after which he never failed to come in the evening he was a generous fellow i had won his heart by my desire to do him justice and my condescension excited a degree of adoration in him when he found that i was really what the world calls a gentleman he had visited me before belmont had left the money and hearing the landlady talk of sending me to the hospital had proposed to take me to his home that he and his wife might do a christian part by me and i not be left to the mercy of strangers and here as they are intimately connected with my own history it is necessary i should mention such particulars as i have since learned concerning olivia hector and andrews had been busy in collecting all the particulars they could relating to me from the mob among whom the strangest rumours ran of which these my fast friends were predisposed to select the most unfavourable and to believe and report them as true all of these they carried to olivia and her aunt and the chief of them were that i had falsely accused a man of theft had seized him by the collar dragged him to the water and had been the principal person in ducking him to death the brother of this man had discovered who i was and had followed me with his comrades to have me taken before a magistrate but i had artfully talked to the people round me had got a part of the mob on my side and had then begun to beat and ill use the brother they added that i had stripped like a common bruiser of which character i was ambitious that the brother had fought with uncommon bravery that he had been treated with foul play by me and my abettors and that in conclusion i had killed him that in addition to this i had prevented a subscription for the widow and nine young children which had been proposed by them that i had insulted them struck at andrews and challenged him to box with me for this their charitable endeavour to relieve the widow and her children and that having lost my last guinea at the gaming table the night before in their presence i should probably run away from my lodgings or perhaps turn highwayman for which they thought me quite desperate enough it may well be imagined what effect a story like this would produce on the mind of olivia corroborated as it was though not proved in every incident by the circumstances which she herself had witnessed from the crescent by those which she gathered on enquiry from other people by her own experience of my rash impetuosity and these all heightened by the conjectures of an active imagination and a heart not wholly uninterested she hoped indeed that i had not actually killed two men but she had the most dreadful doubts the impression it made upon her did not escape the penetration of the aunt and she determined to quit bath and take olivia with her the very next day terrified by the possibility that the predictions of hector and andrews should be fulfilled olivia ventured secretly to instruct her maid to search the book in the pump room and find my address and afterward to send her with the twentypound bankbill hoping that this temporary resource might have some small chance of preventing the fatal consequences which she feared had they returned to london by the aid of miss wilmot and mary she might have made further enquiries but the cautious aunt directed her course to scarborough i was excessively reduced by the fever according to the physician and apothecary my life had been in extreme danger and eight weeks elapsed before i was able to quit bath the expences i had incurred amounted to between eight and nine and twenty pounds i was fully determined to bestow the ten pounds i had originally intended on clarke thus after distributing such small gifts among the servants as custom and my notion of the manners of a gentleman demanded the only choice i had was either to sell my cloaths or with four and sixpence in my pocket to undertake a journey to london on foot i preferred the latter sent my trunk to the waggon returned for the last time to my lodging inclosed a ten pound note in a letter in which i expressed my sense of the worth of clarke and my sorrow for the evil i had done him and sending it by the maidservant i followed and watched her to his dwelling chapter v the pain of parting the prospect before me poor men have their affections and friendships during my recovery i had conversed freely on my own affairs with clarke and his wife they gradually became acquainted with my whole history and discovered so much interest in the pictures i drew and entered so sympathetically and with such unaffected marks of passion into all my feelings that i found not only great ease but considerable delight in narrating my fears hopes and mishaps clarke had a strong understanding and was not entirely illiterate his wife was active cleanly and kind their children were managed with great good sense the three eldest were put out two to service and the other an apprentice and large as their family was they had by labour and economy advanced a considerable step from the extreme poverty to which such persons are too often subject when i went to take leave of them i could perceive not only that they were both very much affected but that clarke had something more on his imagination he had a great respect for my gentility and learning and was always afraid of being too familiar at some moments he felt as it were the insolence of having fought with me at others a gleam of exultation broke forth at his having had that honour he had several times expressed an earnest wish that he might be so happy as to see me again and when i assured him that he should hear from me his feelings were partly doubt and partly strong delight just as i was prepared to bid them farewell he gave a deep sigh and said he thought he should soon come to london he wished he knew where i might be found and if he should leave the country it would be a great favour done him if he might but be allowed to come and ask me how i did if i would allow him that honour it would make his heart very light he had been many years in his present employ and perhaps his master would be sorry if he were to leave him but he had given him fair notice at one time he did not believe he ever should have left him but he thought now he should be much happier in london his tone was serious there was a dejectedness in his manner and with it as was evident much smothered emotion in his heart i was affected and taking his hand earnestly assured him that if ever fortune should smile on me i would not forget what had happened at bath his parting reply was god be with you wherever you go perhaps you may see me again sooner than you think for this was the temper in which we took leave previous to my sending the maid with the tenpound note and as i passed within sight of his door i felt the regret of quitting a human being whose attachment to me was manifestly so strong and affectionate but i had no alternative and i pursued my road winter was advancing the weather was rainy the roads were heavy the cloudy sky sympathised with the gloom of the prospect before me i had wasted my patrimony quarrelled with my protectors renounced the university had no profession no immediate resource and had myself and my mother to provide for by what means i knew not the experience of wilmot seemed to prove how precarious a subsistence the labours of literature afford and wilmot was indisputably a man of genius i had not quite concluded against the morality of the practice of the law but i remembered in part the objections of turl and they were staggering had it been otherwise where would have been the advantage i had entered of the temple but i had neither the means of keeping my terms nor the patience to look forward for precarious wealth and fame to so distant a period all this might have been endured but oliviawhere was sheperhaps at that moment the wife of andrewsor if not grant she were never to be his she never could be mine yet mine she must be mine she should be i would brave the despotism of her odious enslavers i would move heaven and earth i would defy hell itself to separate us such were the continual conflicts to which i was subject and while the fogs of despondency rose thick and murky around me with them continually rose the ignis fatuus of hope dancing before my eyes and encouraging me step after step to follow on considering how wild and extravagant the desires of youth are it is happy for them that they calculate so ill and are so shortsighted their despair would else be frequently fatal i did not forget as a supposed immediate means of relief that my pamphlet against the earl and the bishop was printed and i thought the revenge more than justifiable it was a necessary vindication of my own honour and claims i was indeed forty pounds in debt twenty to belmont and twenty more to i knew not whom though i suspected and partly hoped partly feared it was olivia i hoped it because it might be affection i feared it lest it should be nothing more than pity for one whom she had known in her childhood but whom now he was a man she might compassionate but must contemn to have been obliged even to olivia on these terms was worse than starving such were my meditations through the day which was a little advanced when i left bath i was eager to perform my journey and had walked at a great rate a little before twilight i heard a distant call two or three times repeated at last i turned round saw a hat waving and heard my own name i stopped and the person approached it was clarke i was surprised and enquired the reason of his following me he was embarrassed and began with requesting i would go a little slower for he had run and walked till he was half tired and he would tell me clarke was an untaught orator he had very strong feelings and a clear head which are the two grand sources of eloquence you know said he how much mischief i have done you for it cannot be denied i struck you first and knocked you down when you was off your guard i set every body against you i refused to shake hands with you over and over when you had the goodness to offer to forgive me and last of all you may thank me for the fever which brought you to deaths door you forgave me this as well as the rest but that was not all that would not content you because i had been used ill without any malice of yours nothing would satisfy you but to strip yourself of the little modicum that you had and give it to me so that i am sure you have hardly a shilling to take you up to london and when you are there you are not so well off as i am you have no trade i can turn my hand to twenty things you have never been used to hard work and how you are to live god almighty knows for i am sure i cannot find out though i have been thinking of nothing else for weeks and weeks past why should you suppose i have no money because i am sure of it i asked and found out all that you had to pay the servants too told me how openhearted you was so that you had given away all you had shame on em for taking it say i you are not fit to live in this world and then to send me ten pounds who have a house and home and hands to work but ill be damned if i keep it nay but indeed you must i will not i will not i would not forswear myself for all the money in the world and i have sworn it again and again so take it nay here take itif you dont ill throw it down in the road and let the first that comes find it for ill not forswear myself so pray now i beg for gods sake you will take it i found it was in vain to contend with him he was too determined and had taken this oath in the simplicity of his heart that it might not be possible for him to recede i therefore accepted the money but i endeavoured having received it to satisfy his oath to persuade him to take a part of it back again my efforts were fruitless he had three half crowns he told me in his pocket which would serve his turn till he could get more and he had left five guineas at home so that there was no fear his wife and children should want happy enviable state of independance when a man and his wife and family possessed of five guineas are so wealthy that they are in no fear of want having complied because i found though i could equal him in bodily activity i could not vanquish him in generosity i requested him to return to the place we just had passed through and take up his lodging he replied to be sure he was a little tired for he had set out a good hour after me and i had come at a rare rate not but that he could keep his ground though i was so good a footman but that it did not become him to make himself my companion companion said i why are not you going back to bath no i have taken my leave of it i shall go and set up my rest in london i have not been sharking to my master i thought of it some time since and gave him fair notice and more than that i got him another man in my room which is all he could demand and i hope he will serve him as honestly as i have done what would you forsake your wife and children forsake my wife and children there was a mixed emotion of indignant sorrow and surprize in his countenance i did not think mr trevor you could have believed me to be such a base villain i do not believe it i never could believe it i spoke thoughtlessly i saw you were too happy together for that to be possible forsake my dear sally and our bill and bet and no id sooner take up my axe and chop off my hand there is not another man in england has such a wife i have seen bad ones enough and for the matter of that bad husbands too but thats nothing if you will do me the favour i should take it kind of you to let me walk with you and keep you company now night is coming on to the next town and then you may take some rest and wait for the stage in the morning i shall make my way and find you out i suppose fast enough in london are you then determined to go to town yes it is all settled i told sally and she did cry a little to be sure but she was soon satisfied she knows me and i never in my life found her piggish god be her holy keeper why then come along well go together if i ride you shall ride if you walk so will i will you god bless you you know how to win a mans heart there is not so good or so brave a fellow i mean gentleman upon the face of the earth damn me if there is i beg your pardon indeed i do but you force it out of one one cant remember to keep ones distance with you however i will try to be more becoming the manner of clarke was more impressive than his words though they generally speaking were not unapt we pursued our way together mutually gratified by what had passed perhaps there is no sensation that so cheers and sooths the soul as the knowledge that there are other human beings whose happiness seems knitted and bound up with our own willing to share our fate receive our favours and whenever occasion offers to return them ten fold and the pleasure is infinitely increased when those who are ambitious of being beloved by us seem to feel and acknowledge that we have more amply the power of conferring than even of receiving happiness chapter vi a foolish guide and a gloomy night the fears and dangers of darkness casual lights lead to error and mishap while we had been discussing the above points we had sat down and rose to pursue our journey as soon as we had brought them to a conclusion we were on the borders of a forest as we proceeded we came up with a countryman who enquiring where we were going told us that by striking a little out of the road we might save half a mile we had nine miles to travel to the inn at which the stage coaches stopped and were very willing clarke especially to shorten the way the countryman said he was going part of the road and that the remainder was so plain it could not be mistaken accordingly we put ourselves under his guidance the sun had been down by this time nearly an hour and a half the moon gave some light but the wind was rising she was continually obscured by thick swiftflying clouds and our conductor advised us to push on for it was likely to be a very bad night in less than a quarter of an hour his prophecy began to be fulfilled the rain fell and at intervals the opposing clouds and currents of air aided by the impediments of hills and trees gave us a full variety of that whistling roaring and howling which is heard in high winds the darkness thickened upon us and i was about to request the countryman to lead us to some village or even barn for shelter when he suddenly struck into another path and bidding us good night again told us we could not miss our road we could not see where he was gone to and though we repeatedly called we called in vain he was too anxious to get shelter himself to heed our anxiety and was soon out of hearing so long as we could discern the path we were in appeared to be tolerably beaten but we now could no longer trace any path for it was too dark for the ground to have any distinct colour we had skirted the forest and our only remaining guide was a hedge on our left in this hedge we placed our hopes we followed its direction i know not how long till it suddenly turned off at an angle and we found ourselves as far as we could conjecture from the intervening lights and the strenuous efforts we made to discover the objects around us on the edge of some wild place probably a heath with hills and consequently deep vallies perhaps streams of water and precipices we paused we knelt down examined with our eyes and felt about with our hands to discover whether we yet were in a path but could find none we continued our consultation till we had begun to think it advisable to return once more guided by the hedge yet this was not only very uncertain but the idea of a retrograde motion was by no means pleasant while we were in this irresolute dilemma we thought we saw a light that glimmered for a moment and as suddenly disappeared we watched i know not how long and again saw it twinkle though as we thought in something of a different direction clarke said it was a will othe whisp i replied it might be one but as it seemed the only chance we had my advice was to continue our walk in that direction in hopes that if it were a light proceeding from any house or village it would become more visible as we approached we walked on i know not how far and then paused but discovered no more of the light we walked again again stood still and looked on every side of us either for the light or any other object but we could see nothing distinctly the obscure forms around us had varied their appearance and whether they were hills or clouds or what they were we could not possibly discover though the first we still thought was the most probable by this time we had no certain recollection of which way we had come or to what point we were directing our course we were continually in doubt now pausing now conjecturing now proceeding we continued to wander we knew not whither sometimes it appeared we went up hill and sometimes down we had stepped very cautiously and therefore very slowly had warned each other continually to be careful and had not dared to take twenty steps at a time without mutually enquiring to know if all were safe we continued environed as it were by the objects that most powerfully inspire fear by the darkness of night the tumult of the elements the utter ignorance of where we were or by what objects surrounded and the dejectedness which our situation inspired thieves and assassins might be at our back and we could not hear them gulphs rocks or rivers in our front or on either side and we could not see them the next step might plunge us headlong we knew not whither these fears were not all imaginary finding the ground very uneven on a sudden and stumbling dangerously myself i stood stilli did not hear my companioni calledi received no answer i repeated in a louder tone clarke where are youstill no answer i then shouted with all the fear that i felt and heard a faint response that seemed to be beneath me and at a prodigious distance it terrified yet it relieved we had spoken not three minutes before i stood silent in hopes he would speak again but my fears were too violent to remain so long i once more called and he replied with rather a louder voice which lessened the apparent distance take care youll dash yourself to pieces are you hurt said i i hope not much returned he for gods sake take care of yourself can you walk i shall be able presently i believe how can i get to you i dont know stay where you are and i will try for god in heavens sake dont youll certainly break your neck i suppose i am in a chalk pit or at the bottom of a steep crag i will crawl to you on my hands and knees good god you will surely kill yourself nothing can be more dangerous than to lie here on the wet ground we must only take care to keep within hearing of each other while i spoke i began to put my crawling expedient in practice still calling to clarke every half minute and endeavouring to proceed in the direction of his voice i found the rough impediments around me increase till presently i came to one that was ruder than the rest i crawled upon it sustained by my knees and right hand and stretching forward with my left i groped but felt nothing i cautiously laid my belly to the ground and stretched out my other arm still it was vacancy i stretched a little more violently feeling forward and on each side and i seemed to be projected upon a point my head and shoulders inclining over a dark abyss which the imagination left unfathomable i own i felt terror and the sensation certainly was not lessened when making an attempt to recover my position and go back my support began to give way my effort to retreat was as violent as my terror but it was too late the ground shook loosened and with the struggle i made carrying me with it toppled headlong down what the height that i fell was i have no means of ascertaining for the heath on which we were wandering abounds with quarries and precipices but either it was in fact or my fears made it prodigious had this expedient been proposed under such circumstances as the only probable one of bringing me and clarke together again who would not have shuddered at it yet though it is true i received a violent shock i know of no injury that it did me as soon as i recovered my presence of mind i replied to clarke whose questions were vehement he having heard me fall after mutual enquiry we found we were both once more upon our legs and had escaped broken bones though they had been severely shaken clarkes much the most violently but where were we now how should we discover perhaps in a stone quarry or lime pit perhaps at the edge of waters it might be we had fallen down only on the first bank or ridge of a quarry and had a precipice ten fold more dreadful before us while we were conjecturing the stroke of a large clock brought whizzing in the wind struck full upon our ear we listened with the most anxious ardour the next stroke was very very faint a different current had carried it a different way and with all our eager attention we could not be certain that we heard any more yet though we had lost much time and our progress had been excessively tedious it could not be two oclock in the morning it might indeed very probably be twelve the first stroke of the clock made us conjecture it came from some steeple or hall tower at no very great distance the second carried our imaginations we knew not whither we had not yet recovered courage enough to take more steps than were necessary to come to each other and while we were considering during an intermitting pause of the roaring of the wind we distinctly heard a cur yelp encouraged by this we immediately hallooed with all our might the wind again began to chafe and swell and seemed to mock at our distress still we repeated our efforts whenever the wind paused but instead of voices intending to answer our calls we heard shrill whistlings which certainly were produced by men could it be by good men by any but night marauders intent on mischief but disturbed and alarmed they were signals indubitably for we shouted again they were again given and were then repeated from another quarter at least if they were not they were miraculously imitated by the dying away of the wind in a little while we again heard the cur yelp and immediately afterward a howling which was so mingled with the blast that we could not tell whether it were the wind itself the yelling of a dog or the agonizing cries of a human voice but it was a dreadfully dismal sound we listened with perturbed and deep attention and it was several times repeated with increasing uncertainty confusion and terror what was to be done my patience was exhausted danger itself could no longer detain me and i told clarke i was determined to make toward the village or whatever the place was from whence dangerous and doubtful as they were these various sounds proceeded finding me resolute he was very earnest to have led the way and when i would not permit him he grasped me by the hand and told me that if there were pitfalls and gulphs and if i did go down unless he should have strength enough to save me we would go down together chapter vii difficulties and dangers in succession a place of horrors its inmates a dialogue worthy of the place as we were cautiously and slowly taking step by step and as new conjectures crossed us stopping to consider we again saw a dancing light but more distinctly though as we imagined not very near we repeated our calls but whether they were or were not heard they were not answered we ventured however to quicken our pace for we continued at intervals to catch the light presently we saw the light no more and a considerable time again elapsed which was spent in wandering as this or that supposition directed us till at last suddenly and very unexpectedly we perceived lines and forms that convinced us they appertained to some house or mansion and as it appeared to us a large one we approached it examined shouted and endeavoured to discover which was the entrance but all was still all dark all closed we continued our search on the outside till at length we came to a large gate that was open which we entered and proceeded to some distance till we arrived at a door that evidently belonged to an outhouse or detached building it was shut and feeling about we found that the key was in the lock we had little hesitation in profiting by the accident we had been shelterless too long and the circumstances pleaded too powerfully for us to indulge any scruples and accordingly we entered we had no sooner put our heads within the door but we found ourselves assaulted with a smell or rather stench so intolerable as almost to drive us back but the fury of the elements and perhaps the less delicate organs of clarke who seemed determined to profit by the shelter we had obtained induced us to brave an inconvenience which though excessively offensive at first became less the longer we continued groping about we discovered some barrels and lumber behind which there was straw here we determined to lie down and rest our bruised and aching bones our cloaths had been drenched and dried more than once in the course of the night and they were at present neither wet nor dry we had scarcely nestled together in our straw before we again heard the yelping of the cur and presently afterward the same dismal howls repeated to these at no great distance succeeded the shrill whistling signals our imaginations had been so highly wrought up that they were apt at horrible conjectures and for my part my own was at that moment very busily employed in conjuring them up in the very midst of this activity we heard the voices of men walking round the building they again whistled with a piercing shrillness and though we heard nothing distinctly yet we caught tones that were coarse rude and savage and words that denoted anger and anxiety for the perpetration of some dark purpose no doubt corresponding to the fierce and threatening sounds we heard they approached one of them had a lanthorn he came up to the door and finding it open boisterously shut it with a broad and bitter curse against the carelessness of some man whose name he pronounced for leaving it open and eternally damning others for being so long in doing their business we were now locked in and we soon heard no more of the voices in spite of all these alarms the moment they ceased our condition comparing it with the tempest and difficulties without seemed to be much bettered and we once more prepared ourselves for sleep while fear gave place to fatigue our rest was of short duration we began indeed to slumber but i was presently disturbed by clarke whom i found shaking in the most violent agitation and horror that i ever witnessed in any human being i asked what is the matter he replied with a groan i was awakened from wild slumbers of my own and strongly partook of his sensations but endeavoured however to rouze him to speech and recollection again and again i asked what have you heard what ails you it was long before he could utter an articulate sound at last shaking more violently as he spoke and with inexpressible horror in his voice he gasping saida dead hand where i felt iti had hold of itit is now at my neck for a moment i paused not daring to stretch out my arm and examine i trembled in sympathy with him at length i ventured never shall i forget the sensation i experienced when to my full conviction i actually felt a cold dead hand between my fingers i was suffocated with horror i struggled to overcome it again it seized me and i sunk half entranced at this very instant the shrill sound of the whistle rung piercing through the dismal place in which we were imprisoned it was answered the same hoarse voices once more were heard but in tones fifty fold more dire one terror combated the other and we were recalled to some sense of distinguishing and understanding we lay silent not daring to breathe when we heard the door unlock our feelings will not readily be conceived while the following dialogue passed what a damned while you have kept us waiting such a night as this what ails the night it is a special good night for our trade what the devil have you been about about doing our business to be sure and doing it to some purpose i tell you is not the night as bad for us as for you who had the best of it do you think what had you to do but to keep on the scout how came you to leave the door open and be dmnd to you who left the door open jack dingyface we left the key in it indeed for such lubbers as you to pass in and out while we had all the work to do and all the danger to boot who do you call lubber bullcalf we have had as much to do as yourselves there has been an alarm given for we have heard noises and hallooing all night for my part i dont much like it we shall be smoked nay it is my belief we are already and i have a great mind to decamp and leave the country you are always in a panic who is to smoke us well mark my words it will come upon us when we least think of it think of hold up the lanthorn come heave in the sackwe were dmnd fools for taking such a henhearted fellow among us lift the sack an end why dont you lend a hand and keep it steady while i untie it do you think a dead man can stand on his legs dmn my body the fool is afraid he should bite you are a hardened dog randal blst me come tumble the body out lay hold here heave this way so that will do we may leave him he will not run away his journey is over he will travel no farther tonight he cant say however but we have provided him with a lodging dmn me where do you expect to go to to bed its high time i never heard such a dare devil dog in all my life dont let that trouble you for you will never be like me what is that what is what i saw a head where behind the tub what then is there any wonder in seeing a head or a body either in this place nay but a living head a living ass i am sure i saw the eyes move ah whitelivered lout i wonder what the devil made such a quaking pudding poltroon think of taking to our trade come i am hungry let us go into the kitchen and get some grub and then to bed pimping simon here will see his grandmothers ghost if we stay five minutes longer chapter viii the scene continued and our terrors increased an interesting dialogue that unravels the mystery the beginning of a new acquaintance here to our infinite ease they quitted us went through an inner door that led to the house locked it after them and left us not only with the dead hand not only with the dead body but in the most dismal human slaughterhouse that murder and horror ever constructed or ever conceived such were our impressions and such under the same circumstances they would have been perhaps of the bravest man or mankiller that ever existed alexander and caesar themselves would have shook lying as we lay hearing what we heard and seeing what we saw for by the light of the lanthorn we beheld limbs and bones and human skeletons on every side of us i repeat horror had nothing to add the dancing lights we had seen the shrill signals and the dreadful howls that we had heard were now no longer thought mysterious it was no ignis fatuus but the lanthorn of these assassins no dog or wolf baying the moon but the agonizing yells of murder the men were four in number the idea of attacking them several times suggested itself nor was it so much overpowered by the apprehension of the arms with which i concluded such men must be provided as that my mind was rendered irresolute by the dreadful pictures real and imaginary which had passed through my mind clarke brave as he was had lost all his intrepidity in this golgotha this place of skulls the very scent of which knowing whence it proceeded was abhorrent no it was not their arms nor their numbers but these fears that induced me when he that saw my eyes move was in danger of giving the alarm to close them and profiting by the fellows sympathetic terror counterfeit the death by which i was environed here then we were and must we here remain to sleep was impossible must we rise and grapple with the dead trample on their limbs and stumble over their unearthed bones in endeavouring to get out neither could we tell what new horrors were in store for us who had not heard of trap doors sliding wainscots and other murderous contrivances and could they be now forgotten impossible all the phantoms memory could revive or fancy could create were realized and assembled of the two i certainly had more the use of my understanding than clarke but i was so absorbed in the terrors which assailed me on every side that i was intent on them only and forgot while the lanthorn glimmered its partial and dull rays to consider the geography of the place or to plan the means of escape till the moment the men were departing when i caught a glimpse of what i imagined to be a window facing me as soon as our fears would permit us we began in low and cautious whispers to communicate our thoughts clarke was pertinaciously averse to rise and hurtle in the dark with the bones of the dead by the intervening medium of the straw he had pushed away the terrific hand and was determined he said to lie still till daylight should return and prevent him from treading at random on the horrible objects around him or stumbling over and being stretched upon a corpse i had as little inclination to come in contact with dead hands cadaverous bodies and dissevered joints as he could have yet was too violently tormented to remain quiet and suffer myself to be preyed on by my imagination had i resigned myself to it without endeavouring to relieve it by action it would have driven me frantic i half rose sat considering ventured to feel round me and shrunk back with inexpressible terror from the first object that i touched again i ruminated again ventured to feel and again and again shivered with horrible apprehensions use will reconcile us to all situations experience corrects fear emboldens ignorance and renders desire adventurous the builder will walk without dread on the ridge of a house while the timid spectator standing below is obliged to turn his eyes away or tumble headlong down and be dashed to pieces in imagination repeated trials had a similar effect on me they rendered me more hardy and i proceeded as nearly as i could guess toward the window touching treading on and encountering i knew not what subject every moment to new starts of terror and my heart now sinking now leaping as the sudden freaks and frights of fancy seized upon me after the departure of the desperadoes we had heard various noises in the adjoining house among others the occasional ringing of a chamber bell while i was thus endeavouring to explore my way arrested by terror at every step as i have been describing we again heard sounds that approached more nearly and presently the innerdoor once more opened and a livery servant bearing two lighted candles came in followed by a man with an apron tied round him having a kind of bib up to his chin and linen sleeves drawn over his coat the master for so he evidently was had a meagre wan countenance and a diminutive form the servant had evidently some trepidation do not be afraid matthew said the master you will soon be accustomed to it and you will then laugh at your present timidity unless you conquer your fears you will not be able to obey my directions in assisting me and consequently will not be fit for your place and you know you cannot get such good wages in any other i will do my best sir said the servant but i cant say but for the first time it is a little frightful mere prejudice matthew i am studying to gain knowledge which will be serviceable to mankind and that you must perceive will be doing good yes sir reach me those instrumentsnow lift up the body and turn the head a little this waywhy do you tremble are you afraid of the dead not much sir lift boldly then yes sir as the servant turned round half stupefied with his fears he beheld me standing with my eyes fixed watchful and listening with my whole soul for the interpretation of these enigmas the man stared gaped turned pale and at last dropped down overcome with his terrors the master was amazed and perceiving which way the servants attention had been directed looked round his eye caught mine he stood motionless his pale face assumed a deathlike hue and for a few moments he seemed to want the power of utterance clarke had remained astonished and confounded a silent spectator of the scene but there was now light and though the objects of horror were multiplied in reality they were less numerous to the imagination seeing the fear of the servant observing his fall and remarking the gentle and feeble appearance of the master armed though he was with murderous instruments clarke was now rising determined to come to action his proceeding disturbed our mutual amazement he was on his legs and as i perceived advancing with hostile intentions the dialogue i had heard and the objects which i had distinctly seen and examined had by this time unravelled the whole mystery i discovered that we were in the dissectingroom of an anatomist clarke was clenching his fist and preparing to direct a blow at the operator and i had but just time to step forward arrest his arm and impede its progress be quiet said i clarke we have been mistaken for gods sake who are you gentlemen said the owner of the mansion recovered in part from his apprehensions by my pacific interference we are benighted travellers sir answered i who got entrance into this place by accident and have ourselves been suffering under false but excessive fear pray sir be under no alarm for we are far from intending you injury he made no immediate reply and i continued fear i find though she has indeed a most active fancy has no understanding otherwise among the innumerable conjectures with which my brain has been busied within this hour the truth would certainly have suggested itself but instead of supposing i was transported to the benignant regions of science i thought myself certain of being in the purlieus of the damned in the very den of murder my language manner and tone of voice relieved him from all alarm and he said with a smile this is a very whimsical accident you would think so indeed sir replied i if you knew but half of the horrible images on which we have been dreaming but it was distress that drove us to take shelter here and if there be any village or if not even any barn in which we could take a little rest till daylight we should be exceedingly obliged to you for that kind assistance which from your love of science and from the remarks i have heard you make to your servant i am persuaded you will be very willing to afford by this time the servant was recovered from his fright and on his legs go matthew said the master and call up one of the maids and turning to me he added be kind enough to follow me sir with your companion i doubt if you could procure either lodging or refreshment within three miles of the place and i shall therefore be very happy in supplying you with both we obeyed i highly delighted with the benevolent and hospitable manner of our host and clarke most glad to escape from a scene which no explanation had yet reconciled to his feelings or notions of good and evil chapter ix a review of emotions and mistakes repose after fatigue singular thoughts concerning property benevolence on a large scale a proposal accepted which greatly alters the face of affairs sketches of war the hero the raptures of a poet projects and opinions relative to law thoughts on the science of surgery in the relation of this adventure i have given a picture not of things as they were afterward discovered to be but as they appeared to us at the time reflected through the medium of consternation and terror we had been powerfully prepared for these by the previous circumstances our imaginations had been strongly preyed upon by our distress by the accidents of falling and by the mingled noises we had heard proceeding from the churchyard robbers from the villagedogs and curs disturbed by them and us and from the whistling roaring and howling which are so common to high gusts of wind and so almost distracting to a mind already in a state of visionary deception and alarm there was indeed enough to excite that wild and uncontroulable dread which rushed upon us every moment mingled as they were with darkness ignorance and confusion the succeeding objects were actually horrible thus the discourse and dialect as well as the voices of the men employed to furnish dead bodies were gross and rude and the timidity and prejudices of those who probably were young in the employment contrasted with the jokes vulgar sarcasms and oaths of the boisterous and hardened adepts though habitual to such people gave a colouring to the preceding circumstances that so confirmed and realized our fears as not to allow us the leisure to doubt to repeat such coarse colloquies and vulgar ribaldry is no pleasing task except as a history of the manners of such men and of the emotions with which on this occasion they were accompanied these indeed made the repetition necessary it is likewise true that in their own opinion these men were more or less criminal and guilt always assumes an audacity and fierceness which it does not feel they were not intentionally acting well but were doing that which they supposed to be a deed of desperate wickedness for selfish purposes had the consent of any one of them when dying been asked to have his body dug up and dissected he would have heard the proposal with detestation consequently they deceived us the more effectually for they had the manners of that guilt which as far as intention was concerned they actually possessed add to this the spectacle of a dissectingroom seen indistinctly by the partial glimmerings of a lanthorn whoever has been in such a place will recognise the picture here preparations of arms pendent in rows with the vessels injected there legs feet and other limbs in this place the intestines in that membranes cartilages muscles with the bones and all their varieties of clothing in every imaginary mangled form these things ought not to be terrible but to persons of little reflection and not familiarized to them they always are escaped from this scene restored as it were to human intercourse and encouraged by the kindness of our host whose name was evelyn our pulses began to grow temperate and our imaginations to relax and gravitate toward common sense we took the refreshment that was brought us and conversed during the meal with mr evelyn partly on the incidents of the night and partly in answering a few questions which he put with a feeling that denoted a desire rather to afford us aid than to gratify his own curiosity after which as we were weary and he disposed to pursue his nocturnal researches we immediately retired to rest clarke was full to overflowing with cogitation but for the present it was too large or rather too confused for utterance and it soon overpowered and sunk him into sleep for my own part my mind was too much alive to be immediately overcome by fatigue i lay revolving in thought the incidents of the night which led me into reveries on the singular character of mr evelyn on my own forlorn state on the bleak prospect before me and on olivia this last train of thinking was not easily dismissed at length however both mind and body were so overwearied that i fell into an unusually profound sleep from which i did not awake till clarke who had risen two hours before came between nine and ten oclock and rouzed me to inform me that breakfast was waiting and that our host expected my company while i was dressing he told me that mr evelyn had been making many enquiries concerning me and apologized himself with marks of apprehension lest he should have done wrong while he owned that he had answered these interrogatories by relating such particulars as he knew we then went down and among other conversation at breakfast mr evelyn remarked that he understood from clarke we had no urgent business which would make a day sooner or a day later of any material consequence and he therefore particularly requested we would delay our departure till the next morning the reason he gave was a kind expression of interest which what he had heard from my companion had excited and a desire not of inquisitive prying but evidently of benevolence to be as fully informed of my history as i should think proper to make him there was something soothing both in the request and in his manner which induced me to readily comply poor clarke excepted i seemed as if no human being took any concern in my fate and to discover that there was yet a man who was capable of sympathizing with me was like filling a painful vacancy of the heart and afforded something of an incoherent hope of relief not that i was prepared to ask or even to accept favours i had rather entertained a kind of indignant sense of injury against any one who should presume to make me his debtor or to suppose i was incapable of not rather enduring all extremities than so to subject and degrade myself as in my own apprehension i should do by any such condescension after breakfast mr evelyn desired me to walk with him that we might converse the more freely when alone he then repeated what clarke had told him gave a strong and affecting picture of the overflowing kindness and compassion with which my companion had related all he knew and proceeded afterward to speak of himself in the following terms i am a man mr trevor engaged in a trust which i find it very difficult conscientiously to discharge i have an estate of fifteen hundred a year and am a creature whose real wants like those of other human creatures are few i live here surrounded by some hundreds of acres stored with fruits corn and cattle which the laws and customs of nations call mine but what is it that these laws and customs mean that i am to devour the whole produce of thus much land the thing is impossible why impossible you may convert a hundred head of oxen into a service of gold plate liveries laces equipage gilding garnishing and ten thousand other modes or fashionable wants which if not gratified render those that have them miserable would eat up all that ten thousand acres if you had them could yield are you an epicure you may so stew distill and titillate your palate with essences that a hecatomb shall be swallowed at every meal the means of devouring are innumerable and justified by general usage general usage may be an apology but not a justification happiness is the end of man but it cannot be single on the contrary the more beings are happy the greater is the individual happiness of each for each is a being of sympathies and affections which are increased by being called into action it is the miserable mechanism of society which by giving legal possession of what is called property to the holders puts it absolutely and unconditionally in their disposal why the miserable mechanism are you a friend to the agrarian system by no means i was incorrect the mechanism is defective enough but i rather meant to have said the miserable moral system of society which allows every man to exercise his own caprice and thinks him guilty of no crime though he is in the daily habit of wasting that which might render numbers happy who are in absolute want this is an evil of which the world has for ages been complaining but for which i see no remedy you mean no remedy which laws or governments by the inflicting of pains and penalties can afford at which to do them justice they have been much too often aiming but have as continually failed and you imagine sir you are possessed of a more effectual prescription i dare not prescribe it would be an arrogant assumption of wisdom but i may advise a regimen which has numerous probabilities in its favour yet what i must advise has been so many thousand times advised before that it seems impertinence to repeat it if not mockery to tell the rich that they seek enjoyment where it is not to be found that the parade by which they torment themselves to gain distinction renders them supremely ridiculous that their follies while they are oppressive and hateful to the poor are the topics of contempt and scandal even in their own circles and that the repetition of them inevitably proves that they bring weariness disgust ruin pain and every human misery is mere commonplace declamation but there is one truth of which they have not been sufficiently reminded they are not as they have too long been taught to suppose themselves placed beyond the censure of the multitude it is found that the multitude can think and have discovered that the use the wealthy too often make of what they call their own is unjust tyrannical and destructive this memento will come to them with the greater force the oftener they are made to recollect that the spirit of enquiry is abroad that their voluptuous waste is daily becoming more odious and that simplicity of manners a benevolent economy a vigorous munificence and a comprehensive philanthropy can alone redeem them and preserve that social order which every lover of the human race delights to contemplate but of which they arrogate to themselves the merit of being the sole advocates it is the moral system of society that wants reform this cannot be suddenly produced nor by the efforts of any individual but it may be progressive and every individual may contribute though some much more powerfully than others the rich in proportion as they shall understand this power and these duties will become peculiarly instrumental for poverty by being subjected to continual labour is necessarily ignorant and it is well known how dangerous it is for ignorance to turn reformer let the rich therefore awake let them encourage each other to quit their pernicious frivolities and to enquire without fear or prejudice how they may secure tranquillity and promote happiness and let them thus avert those miseries at which they so loudly and so bitterly rail but into which by their conduct a majority of them is so ready to plunge the intentions of those among them who think the most are excellent to assert the contrary is equally false and absurd but when they expect to promote peace and order by irritating each other against this or that class of men however mistaken those men may be and by disseminating a mutual spirit of acrimony between themselves and their opponents they act like madmen and if they do not grow calm forgiving and kind the increasing fury of the mad many will overtake them they are like the brethren of dives they pay but little regard to moses and the prophets well mr trevor you will own at least that since i can talk with all this seeming wisdom a small share of the practice will be becoming in me and what you and all mankind would expect i may but not all mankind there are some who pretend to be so learned in what they call the depravity of human nature that after having heard you speak thus admirably in favour of virtue they would think it more than an equal chance that you are one of the wickedest of men oh with respect to that some of my very neighbours do not scruple to affirm that i am so but i repeat i have what i consider as a large estate in trust and it is a serious and a sacred duty imposed upon me to seek how it may be best employed i seldom am satisfied with the means which offer themselves and am therefore always in quest of new i wonder at that sir with your system have you no poor in the country o yes enough to grieve any penetrable heart but i know no task more difficult than that of administering to their wants without encouraging their vices of these wants i consider instruction as the greatest and to that i pay the greatest attention food cloathing and disease are imperious necessities and to leave them unprovided would be guilt incredible to speculation did we not see it in hourly practice but the poor are so misled by the opinions they are taught to hold and the oppressions to which they are subject that by relieving these most urgent wants we are in danger of teaching them idleness drunkenness and servility i do them the little good that i can most willingly but i consider the diffusion of knowledge by which that which i call the moral system of mankind is to be improved as the most effectual means of conferring happiness are you of that opinion i certainly am then i cannot but think you intend to promote this beneficial plan i scarcely know my own intentions they are unsettled incoherent and the dreams of delirium rather than the system of a sage such as you have imagined i wish we had been longer acquainted and were intimate enough to induce you to relate your history and confide your thoughts to me as to a friend or if you please as to one who holds it a duty to offer aid whenever he imagines it will answer a good end to offer aid is kind but there are very few cases in which he that receives it is not mean and degraded you however are actuated by a generous spirit and as you are inclined to listen i will very willingly inform you of the chief incidents of a life that has already been considerably checkered and the future prospects of which are sufficiently gloomy after this preface i began my narrative and succinctly related the principal of those events with which the reader already is acquainted nor did the state of my feelings and the strong sense of injury which was ever present to my imagination when i came to recapitulate my adventures since i first left college suffer me to colour with a negligent or a feeble hand some of the incidents necessarily induced me to mention olivia and betray my sentiments in part which the questions of mr evelyn put with kindness delicacy and interest that was evidently unaffected induced me at length wholly to reveal with all the tenderness and the vehemence of passion i was encouraged or rather impelled to this confidence by the emotions which mr evelyn betrayed in his countenance voice and manner his hopes his fears and his affections were so much in unison with my own his eye so often glistened and his cheek so frequently glowed that it was impossible for the heart not to open all its recesses and pour out not only its complaints but its very follies of all the pleasures in which the soul of man most delights that of sympathy is surely the chief it can unite and mingle not only two but ten millions of spirits as one could a world be spectators of the sorrows of lear a world would with one consent participate in them so omnipotent is the power of sympathy it is the consolation of poverty it is the cordial of friendship it is the essence of love pride and suspicion are its chief enemies and they are the vices that engender the most baneful of the miseries of man mr evelyn remained after i had ended for some time in deep meditation now and then casting his eyes toward me and then taking them away as if fearful of offending my sensibility and again falling into thought at length fixing them more firmly and with an open benignity of countenance he thus broke silence i have been devising my noble young friend allow me to call you so by what means i should best make myself understood to you and how most effectually prevail on you to contribute to my happiness and to those great ends for which souls of ardour like yours are so highly gifted i have already sketched my principles concerning the use and abuse of property one of those rare occasions on which it may be excellently employed now presents itself you are in pursuit of science by which a world is to be improved to the best of my ability i follow the same track but i have the means which you want you have too little i have too much it is my province and if you consent as i hope and trust you will it will be my supreme pleasure to supply the deficiency i am acquainted with the delicacy of your sentiments but i am likewise acquainted with the expansion of your heart and with its power of rising superior to the false distinctions which at present regulate society i might assume the severe tone of the moralist and urge your compliance with my request as a duty but i would rather indulge what may perhaps be the foible of immature virtue and follow the affectionate impulse which binds me to you as my friend and brother beside these are vibrations with which i am persuaded your warm and kindred heart will more readily harmonize in youth we willingly obey impetuous sensations but reluctantly listen to the slow and frigid deductions of reason when they are in contradiction to our habits and prejudices i therefore repeat you are my friend and brother and i conjure you by those generous and magnanimous feelings of which your whole life proves you are so eminently susceptible not to wound me by refusal do not consider me as the acquaintance of a day for by hearing your history i have travelled with you through life and seem as if i had been the inmate of your bosom even from your years of infancy no far from being strangers we have been imbibing similar principles similar views and similar affections our souls have communed for years and rejoice that the time at length is come in which that individual intercourse for which they may most justly be said to have panted is opened if you object if you hesitate if you suspect me you will annihilate the purest sensations which these souls have mutually cherished you will wrong both yourself and me there was an emanating fervor in the look deportment and the very gestures of mr evelyn that was irresistible it surpassed his language it led me out of myself it hurried me beyond the narrow limits of prejudices and prepossessions and transported me wherever it pleased i was no longer in mortal society surrounded by selfishness cunning and cowardly suspicions he had borne me on his wings and seated me among the gods whose ministers were wisdom and beneficence i burst into exclamation i own it you are my friend you are my brother i accept your offers i will receive your benefits but i will retaliate i paused i felt the egotism of my own thoughts but could not subdue the torrent i continued inwardly to vow with the most vehement asseverations that i would repay every mark of kindness he should bestow fifty fold the heart of man will not rest satisfied with inferiority and has recourse to a thousand stratagems a thousand deceptions to relieve itself of any such doubts which it entertains with impatience and pain my own enthusiasm however was soon inclined to subside and i became ready to tax myself with that meanness and degradation which i had felt and expressed at the beginning of the discussion of this the quick penetration of mr evelyn seemed to be aware and he so effectually counteracted these emotions that at length i abandoned all thoughts of resistance or of betraying those jealousies which would now have appeared almost insulting to a man who had displayed a spirit so disinterested this subject being as it were dismissed our conversation recurred to my present affairs and future prospects and while we discoursed on these that which might well at this period be called the malady of my mind exhibited itself though i had as it were lost sight of olivia though i knew not but she might at that time be a wife and though whatever her condition might be i had sufficient reason to fear that if she thought of me it was with pain not with love still that she must and should be mine was a kind of frantic conclusion with which i always consoled myself but for this purpose riches presented themselves as of the first necessity and riches themselves would be useless unless obtained with the rapidity rather of enchantment than by the ordinary progress of human events i did not conceal this weakness from my friend and ventured to propose a plan on which i had previously been ruminating though i had foreseen no means of putting it in practice every man had heard of the fortunes acquired in the east and of the wealth which had been poured from the lap of india the army there was at all times open to men like myself youthful healthy and of education tis true i had been of opinion that there were strong moral objections to this profession but these my more prevalent passions had lulled me into a forgetfulness of and i stated this as the most probable scheme for the accomplishment of my dearest hopes mr evelyn anxious not to wound me where i was most vulnerable began by soothing my ruling passion and then proceeded to detail the physical chances of a ruined constitution of death and of failure and afterward to represent with unassuming but with stedfast energy the moral turpitude first of subjecting myself to the physical evils he had recited and next of hiring myself to enmity against nations i had never known and of becoming the assassin of people whom i had never seen and who had not had any possible opportunity of doing me an injury or even of giving me an offence the objections i started partly to defend the opinions i had begun with and partly because i felt myself loth to relinquish a plan by which my imagination had been flattered soon became very feeble but the interesting nature of the subject prolonged the discussion till it was nearly dinner time in the course of this enquiry mr evelyn delineated the contemptible yet ridiculous arts which are employed to entrap men into the military service pourtrayed the inevitable depravity of their morals and gave a history of the feelings worthy of fiends which are engendered while they are trained to fix their bayonets load their pieces level them discharge them at men they had never seen before strike off the heads of these strangers with furious dexterity stab the ground in full gallop on which they are supposed to have fallen and to lie helpless and commit habitual and innumerable murders in imagination that they may be hardened for actual slaughter he afterward gave an enlightened and animated sketch of the abject condition of those who command these men of the total resignation which each makes of his understanding to that of the next in rank above him and of the arrogant the ignorant the turbulent the dangerous and the slavish spirit which this begets he finished the picture with a recapitulation of the innumerable and horrid miseries which everlastingly mark the progress of war which he painted with such force and truth that i recoiled from the contemplation of it with abhorrence my feelings had been so agitated by this discourse that my imagination was thoroughly rouzed my former ideas concerning the enormous vices of war had not only been revived but increased and though i began with debating the question i soon ceased to oppose so that my thoughts were rather busied in filling up the picture and collecting all its horrors than in apologizing for or denying their existence this was the temper of mind in which mr evelyn attending to his own concerns left me for a short time and my heart was so agonized by the recollection that this was a system to which men were still devoted and of which they were still in the headlong and hot pursuit that i then immediately and perhaps with less effort than i ever made on a similar occasion produced the following poem the hero all hail to the hero whom victory leads triumphant from fields of renown from kingdoms left barren from plains drenchd in blood and the sacking of many a fair town his goredripping sword shall hang high in the hall revered for the havoc it spread for the deaths it has dealt for the terrors it struck and the torrents of blood it has shed his banners in haughty procession shall ride on jehovahs proud altars unfurld while anthems and priests waft to heaven his praise for the slaughter and wreck of a world though widows and orphans together shall crowd to gaze as at heavens dread rod and mutter their curses and mingle their tears invoking the vengeance of god though while bloated revelry roars at his board where surfeiting hecatombs fume desolation and famine shall howl and old earth her skeleton hordes shall intomb all ghastly and mangled from fields where they fell with horrible groanings and cries what though when he slumbers the dead from their graves in dread visitation shall rise yet he among heroes exalted shall sit and slaves to his splendor shall bend and senates shall echo his virtues and kings shall own him their saviour and friend then hail to the hero whom victory leads triumphant from fields of renown from kingdoms left barren from plains drenchd in blood and the sacking of many a fair town i was too full of my subject and poet like too much delighted with the verses i had so suddenly produced not to shew them immediately to mr evelyn he seemed to do them even more than justice he read them again and again and each time with a feeling now of compassion now of amazement and now of horror that shewed how strongly the picture had seized upon his soul the associations of misery which his imagination added were so forcible that tears repeatedly rolled down his cheeks to this more soothing trains of thought succeeded the pain of the past and the present was alleviated by a prospect of futurity our minds rose to a state of mutual rapture excited by a foresight that the time was at length come in which men were awakening to a comprehensive view of their own mad and destructive systems that their vices began to be on the decline and no longer to be mistaken for the most splendid virtues as they had formerly been and that truth was breaking forth upon the world with most animating force and vigour there have been few moments of my life in which i have experienced intellectual enjoyment with a pleasure so exquisite clarke himself unused as his thoughts had been to explore the future and wrest happiness to themselves by anticipation partook of our emotions and seemed in a state similar to those religious converts who imagine they feel that a new light is broke in upon them it was a happy afternoon it was a type of those which shall hereafter be the substitutes of the wretched resources of drinking obscene conversation and games of chance to which men have had recourse that they might rouze their minds being rather willing to suffer the extremes of misery than that dullness and inanity which they find still more insupportable this incident united me and mr evelyn more intimately and powerfully than all that had passed the warmth with which he spoke of the benefits that society must receive from talents like mine dilated my heart every man is better acquainted with his own powers and virtues than any other can possibly be and when they are discovered acknowledged and applauded instead of being denied or overlooked as is more generally the case the pleasure he receives is as great as it is unusual our conversation after dinner reverted to the plans i was to pursue the law necessarily came under consideration and mr evelyn not having considered the subject under the same points of view as turl had done was strongly in favour of that profession he foresaw in me a future judge whose integrity should benefit and whose wisdom should enlighten mankind he conceived there could be no function more honourable more sacred or more beneficial an upright judge with his own passions and prejudices subdued attentive to the principles of justice by which alone the happiness of the world can be promoted and by the rectitude of his decisions affording precedent and example to future generations he considered as a character that must command the reverence and love of the human race my imagination while he spoke was not idle i helped to fill up the picture it placed me on the judgment seat it gave me the penetration of solomon the benevolence of zaleucus and the legislative soul of alfred as usual it overstepped the probable with wonderful ease and celerity not only the objections of turl disappeared but the jargon of the law its voluminous lumber with which i had been disgusted when reading the civilians at college and all my other doubts and disgusts vanished our inquiries accordingly ended with a determination that i should continue my journey to town should keep my terms at the temple and should place myself as is customary under one of the most eminent barristers this necessarily brought me to consider the expence and the moment that subject recurred i felt all the pain which could not but assault a mind like mine i had nurtured not only the haughtiness of independance but the supposition that in my own extraordinary powers and gifts i possessed innumerable resources and at moments had encouraged those many extravagant flights with which the reader is already well acquainted however after all that had passed and for the reasons that had been sufficiently urged i found it necessary to submit though by the concession my soul seemed to be subdued and its faculties to be shrunk and half withered it was an oppressive sensation that could not be shaken off yet that must be endured such at least was my present conclusion in the course of the evening mr evelyn at my request stated his reasons for pursuing his own course of studies and instanced a variety of facts which convinced me of the benefits to be derived from the science of surgery of the rash conclusions to which modern theorists and enquirers have been led and of the necessity there is that some practitioner equally well informed with themselves but aware of the evil of false deductions should demonstrate the mischief of hasty assertion and that things which are only conjectural ought not to be given as indubitable of this nature he considered their hypotheses relating to the brain the nervous system the lymphatic fluid and other subjects concerning which many curious but hitherto equivocal facts have been the discovery of modern research mr evelyn not only read all the best authors but went to london every winter and assiduously maintained an intercourse with the most able men attended their lectures was present at their operations and fully informed himself of their differences both in opinion and practice but his frame was delicate a too long abode in london always occasioned pulmonary symptoms and experience taught him that his native air was more healthful and animating than any other the difficulties attending his studies were greatly increased by his residence in the country but they were surmounted by his precaution and by the general favour which his benevolence secured to him among the neighbouring people though there were not wanting some who considered him as a very strange if not a dangerous and a wicked man it is curious yet an astonishing and an afflicting speculation that men should be most prone to suspect and hate those who are most unwearied in endeavouring to remove their evils that a surgeon must be acquainted with the direction site and properties of the muscles arteries ligaments nerves and other parts before he can cut the living body with the least possible injury and that this knowledge can only be acquired by experience is a very plain proposition it is equally selfevident that a dead body is no longer subject to pain and that it certainly cannot be more disgraced by the knife of a surgeon than by the gnawing of worms when will men shake off their infantine terrors and their idiotlike prepossessions chapter x the departure ejaculations present pleasures and future hopes a strange dialogue in the dark and a generous and beautiful defender the pleasure i this day received in the company of mr evelyn was uncommon the friendship with which he had inspired me was pure and the respect that my heart paid to his virtues was profound but eagerness of pursuit was my characteristic my plan being formed every moment of delay would have been torment and he entering into all my thoughts and sympathising with all my wishes prompted me to follow my bent it was therefore agreed that i and my companion should depart by one of the coaches which would pass an inn at some distance in the morning a messenger was accordingly dispatched to take places in the first vacant coach arrangements for moneymatters were made with every possible delicacy by my friend the night passed away day returned and we departed i will leave the reader to image to himself the crowding sensations that pressed upon my heart on this occasion the tumult of thought which incidents so sudden and unexpected produced and the feelings which mutually passed between me and my noble benefactor i shall live said i to acknowledge this in my old age i shall have a story to tell a man to describe and a friend to revere that will astonish and render common hearers incredulous but this was the language of my heart not of my tongue that was dumb a pressure of the hand with eyes averted was all the utterance i had a child and its mother were the only passengers beside ourselves the coach which was to be in london at ten that night rolled along they were asleep i was silent and poor clarke was full of ejaculation if there be a good man on gods earth that gentleman is one he will find his road to heaven safe enough he will be among the sheep and sit on the right hand of god i hope i shall be in his company though that cant be i am unworthy i may think myself happy to sit far enough lower down not that i can say for i find the best people have the least pride perhaps as it is in earth so it may be in heaven god send us all safe there together for my part i think that within these few weeks i am a different kind of a creature but what can a poor carpenter do he must not speak to gentlefolk unless in the way of his work so he can have no sociability but with his poor neighbours and though some of them to be sure be as goodmeaning people as any on earth they are no better learned than himself so they can teach him nothing but i have happened on good luck so i have no right to complain and i am very sure in my own mind that there is good luck in store for us all for providence else would not have brought us and guided us where it did by such marvellous means so that while we thought we were breaking our necks and falling into the hands of murderers and being frightened out of our senses by the most shocking sights i must say that ever were seen we were all the while going straight on as fast as we could to good fortune so that it is true enough that man is blind but that god can see what pleasure does the mind of man take in solving all its difficulties how impatient is it that any thing should remain unexplained and how ready to elevate its own ignorance into mystery and miracle to have remained longer silent while the honest heart of my companion was thus overflowing with kindness would have been no proof of the same excellent and winning quality in myself i encouraged his hopes in which i was very ready to participate my own pleasing dreams revived in full force and i presently ranged my cloudconstructed castles which i built pulled down and rebuilt with admirable facilty and lorded it over my airy domains at will tis a folly to rail at these domains for there are no earthly abodes that are half so captivating nothing worth mentioning happened on the road till we came to the last stage but one where we changed horses at which time it was quite dark our female companion and her child had been set down at hungerford and two new passengers both ladies as soon as the horses were put to were shewn to the carriage they had a footman who mounted the box and we soon learned from their discourse that they had been waiting for the nephew of the elder lady who was to have taken them in his phaeton but that they had been disappointed they had been on a visit and had been brought to salthill in a gentlemans carriage which they had sent back while the coach had stopped i had fallen into a doze but awoke when it began to move again and when i heard the voices of females conversing the old lady spoke most and complained of the rudeness of her nephew in subjecting them to the inconvenience of a stagecoach or of waiting they knew not how long till posthorses should come in which as they were informed would be tired and unfit for more work it happening that there was a great run at that time on the bath road the reader will presently understand that they were people of real fashion and the eldest lady spoke of persons and things which denoted that high life was familiar to her this gave clarke a new opportunity of wondering how he a poor carpenter came into such company which he directly expressed to me with the simplicity and undisguise that are common to such characters the old lady who had before signified her chagrin at the expedient to which her nephew had reduced her did not find her pride soothed when she learned that she was in company with carpenters for it soon appeared that she considered me and my companion as familiar acquaintances of the same rank her young friend was likewise led into this error and when the former began to express her disgust too freely to accord with the feelings of the latter she interrupted her with saying ayez la bonte madame de parler francois be kind enough madam to speak french the old lady complied and a conversation ensued which certainly will neither surprise nor move the reader so much as it did me should he ask how i as a man of honor could suffer them to remain in the deception of imagining i did not understand them let him wait till he knows enough to surmise what the emotions were that were in a moment kindled in my bosom at first indeed they were but dark and improbable conjectures but dark as they were they shook my whole frame the dialogue that ensued soon testified that the old lady was in no very complacent temper of mind her beginning sentences expressed dissatisfaction were sarcastic and evidently glanced at her young companion whose replies were mild and conciliating but not satisfied with indirect reproach her assailant still speaking french continued her interrogatories to the following effect and are you still determined miss to persist in your obstinate refusal of his lordship let me intreat you dear madam not to enter on that subject again oh to be sure you very kindly intreat me to torment myself as much as i please so that i do not trouble you how can you madam accuse me of such cruelty is it just am i indeed of such a nature yes indeed are you miss however you may flatter yourself it is nothing but perversity that can make you trifle with the honor and happiness of your familynow you are silent your fine spirit no doubt disdains to reply what can i say say that you are a headstrong girl acknowledge your fault and consent to be the wife of a peersilent again i could wish madam not to make you more angry no indeed there is no occasion for that you have been doing nothing else for many weeks past for my part i cannot conceive what your objection can be had that desperado been living for whom since his death you have acknowledged what you call your weak prepossession i should have known very well to what cause to attribute your stubbornness but as it is i cannot conceive either your motives or your meaning nothing however is to be wondered at in a young lady of your character no prudent person would have dared to indulge a thought in favour of a mad adventurer whose actions were as rash as they were insolent whose family was mean yet had dared to oppose and even make ridiculous attempts to rival that from which you are descended and who yet was himself an outcast of that family it is cruel madam to disturb the ashes of the dead this was the first word of retort that had escaped the chidden sufferer and this was uttered in a voice half suffocated with passion cruel indeed every thing is cruel that contradicts the wishes of young ladies whose melting tenderness is ruinous to themselves and to every body that ought to be most dear to them you must pardon me madam for again and again repeating in my own defence that there is no part of my conduct which can justify such an accusation how miss is an avowed partiality for a fortunehunter no proof is it no stain on the character of a modern young lady is it no insult to her family it was a partiality which had never been avowed till death had put an end to hope it was produced and counteracted by very extraordinary circumstances but however strong it might be at some moments which i acknowledge it was for i disdain falsehood it was not indulged i needed no monitor to shew me there were too many reasons why it ought not to be i have not patience a runagate a vagabond a gambler a prize fighter one of the lowest and most contemptible of adventurers who had betrayed his patrons who had flown in the face of his benefactors who was capable of every kind of malice and mischief and who had not a single virtue madam i cannot listen to such an assertion as that however i may offend you without continually protesting it is unfounded and that you have been greatly misinformed i scorn to apologise for his mistakes but i know that he had virtues which those who have given you this character of him are never likely to possess how he could be guilty of the crimes of which he has been accused i cannot conceive even when a boy i have heard him express sentiments which i shall never forget and which have since been confirmed by his actions you were acquainted with none of them you speak from report and from report which i am sure was false and wicked his heart i know to have been compassionate his principles such as no mean mind could have conceived and his courage blameably great though it saved my life tears half choaked her utterance but for him i should have been where he now is a different train of events might have taken place and he perhaps might have been living i owe him my life and you must forgive me if i cannot sit patiently and hear his memory traduced without the least occasion for her sobbing could not be stifled since he is dead you can no longer think him dangerous oh olivia gracious god what were the throbs the thrillings the love the indignation the transports of my soul how did a few moments raise and allay in me the whirlwind of the passions how did my frame tremble and madden and shiver and burn how were my lips at once bursting with frenzy and locked in silence it was my guardian angel that protected me that pleaded for me that awed me to patience and that repaid by her seraphic praise the virtue she had inspired oh yes it was olivia it was she herself that had the justice the fortitude and the affection to assert the dignity of truth to controvert an overbearing aunt whom she revered for this aunt had her virtues and to speak in defiance of that hypocrisy which inculcates the silence that intends to deceive and which teaches females that sincerity is an unpardonable vice chapter xi false conclusions rectified a lovers reveries the dangers of a stagecoach in a dark night and a fog the discovery of more old acquaintances and the journey pursued it has been truly remarked that the most serious and even the most dignified emotions are sometimes mingled with the most ludicrous when the divine olivia had ended there was a momentary pause and clarke meditating no doubt on the advantages of which he had been deprived and to the enjoyment of which every man feels he has a right directing his remark to me suddenly exclaimedwhat would i give now if i understood all that these ladies were saying as well as you do estce donc que monsieur scait parler francoiswhat sir can you speak french said the aunt with a burst of surprise yes madam answered i in a low and tremulous voice gesu maria chi lavrebbe pensato parliamo italiano signora good god who could have thought it let us speak italian miss continued she but suddenly recollecting herself addedperhaps sir you speak that language too yes madam a dead silence ensued which was only once or twice interrupted by an exclamation of discontent from the aunt each became busied with their own thoughts mine were distracted by doubts and apprehensions concerning the manner in which i ought to act i could come to no determination to be seen by the aunt would not only have wounded her pride and if possible have rendered her more implacably my mortal enemy than she had been but it would have subjected olivia toward whom my heart was bursting with affection to a series of new assaults and persecutions nay the sudden sight of me might overpower her and even have dangerous effects such at least were the whisperings either of my tenderness or my vanity and yet to miss this opportunity to acquaint her with none of those overwhelming sensations that were all thankfulness love and adoration and not so much as to inform her that i was still living still perhaps capable of all the good that she had ever supposed of me was in every view of it tormenting how had she struggled to conceal her emotions when she mentioned my death and that i had saved her life should i deserve this tenderness if i could leave her to grieve a moment longer such unkindness were not only unworthy of me but might be dangerous it might even risk her compliance to the proposed match and here a torrent of painful anxieties and surmises rushed upon me the hateful subject was brought fully to my recollection andrews was no longer the rival i had to dread a lord had entered the lists a peer of the realm had sued for olivia who could he be was it likely that she should long withstand the solicitations of her aunt endure her bitter upbraidings and suffer the rude taunts of her brother while rank and splendor were courting her acceptance while coronets were crouching at her feet and supplicating her compassion which of our ancient barons could he be how should i learn was he young handsome courteous engaging had he the virtues and the high qualities which imagination is so apt to attach to the word noble another train of conjecture seized upon my thoughts how did it happen that they should believe me dead who were the authors of this false report it must surely be intentional deceit perhaps of the aunt perhaps of hector invented to induce her to comply with their wishes and ally them to the peerage i must not suffer it to continue the aunt appeared to believe it and that olivia had no doubt of it was certain my fears confirmed me in the suspicion that it was a family artifice i was at length awakened from these reveries by the aunt who expressed her surprise and impatience at the slow driving of the coachman it seems it had continued for some time though not remarked by me and it was not long before the coach stopped when i perceived that we were in an uncommonly thick fog olivia was still silent but the aunt was alarmed by the voices of men and as the darkness and mist prevented all danger of my being known i opened the coachdoor and jumped out and clarke followed my example i found on enquiry we were passing cranfordbridge at the beginning of hounslowheath that a broadwheeled waggon had approached and that the coachman unable to distinguish the road had alighted to lead his horses lest we should be overturned he had trusted the reins to the footman who remained on the box by the caution of the coachman the waggon was safely passed and he thought proper to mount his box again but he durst not venture to drive fast and as i was alarmed for the safety of olivia i and clarke continued beside the horses we had not gone fifty yards before we were again entangled with a timber carriage the driver of which embarrassed by the fog had turned it across the road the waters which lie in the hollows on the hounslowside of the bridge had been greatly increased by the late tempests and heavy rains the coach horses began to snort with more vehemence for they had for some time been disturbed with fright and one of them running against the projecting timber plunged and terrified the rest so that the two forehorses quitting the road dashed into the water dragged the coach after them in despite of the driver and the nearwheels were hurried down the bank it fortunately happened that the declivity was not steep enough immediately to overturn the coach otherwise olivia and her aunt would probably have lost their lives bewildered by the fog neither i nor clarke could act with that promptitude which we desired i however got to the horses heads myself above the knees in water and stopped them just in time i called to clarke to come to me and as i knew him to be both strong and determined i committed the horses to him and ran to support the carriage lest it should overturn the coachman sensible of his danger took care to alight on the offside the footman did the same and i with an air of authority which the circumstances inspired ordered them to come to me and support the coach they obeyed i hastened round to the other side opened the door first took out the aunt and then accomplished the wish of my heart i held the lovely olivia once more in my arms and once more pressed her to my bosom without the least alarm to her delicacy for how many rapturous moments are lovers indebted to accident mine indeed would have been a single bliss and therefore unworthy the name had not the tenderness and the truth of olivia so lately been manifested but this addition made the transport undescribable to be in my arms yet not to know me but to suppose me dead to feel my embrace and to have no suspicion that it was the embrace of love to be once more safe and i myself once more her protector oh imagination strong as thou art thy power is insufficient for the repetition of such a scene for the complete revival of such ecstacy i was unwilling to part with my precious burthen which i had no longer any pretence to retain pray sir put me down said the angel with a sweet a gentle and a thankful voice we are very safe now for which both i and my aunt are infinitely indebted to you i could make no reply but i pressed her hand with something of that too ardent rashness of which the aunt had accused me the old lady too did not forget her acknowledgments she had no doubt now that i was a gentleman my behaviour proved it she should be very proud to thank me in a more proper place for my civilities and would endeavour to repay the obligation if i would do her the favour to call in hertfordstreet olivia was not one of those who think only of themselves having been so good sir said she as to take us out of danger perhaps you could be serviceable to the poor coachman let me first see you back to the inn ladies some accident may happen in the mean time the horses are unruly we will stay here till all is safe the advice was just and it came from olivia i obeyed and hastened to the coachman who was busied in loosing the traces and relieving the horses from the carriage this was presently done and the coach was left till proper aid and more light could be obtained i then returned to olivia and when the coachman came up the aunt enquired if their danger had been great i dont know madam what you may call great answered he but if that gentleman had not stopped the cattle and if the near wheels had gone one yard nay two feet farther i should have had an overturn and then how either you or i could have got out of that gravel pit is more than i can tell for my own part i know i thank him with all my heart and the other gentleman too for it is not often that your gentleman are so handy instead of helping they generally want somebody to help them i hope theyll be civil enough to take a glass with me by g they shall go to the depth of my pocket and welcome if that be the case replied the aunt we are all very much obliged to them indeed but i will take care never to travel in a fog again just as this was passing we heard at a distance and as if coming from the inn a shouting of hollo hoix coachee coach where are you all i declare said the aunt that is my nephews voice this is very lucky he will now take us in his phaeton surely madam exclaimed i you would not trust yourself and this young lady in a phaeton such a night as this when you see the most experienced drivers are liable to such accidents if the lady does continued the coachman as he was going why i shall suppose she does not value a broken neck of a farthing we then proceeded back to the inn and were presently joined by hector whom the aunt immediately began to rate while she was thus employed i endeavouring to disguise my voice as i had before done in the few sentences i had uttered and addressing myself to olivia said i should be exceedingly concerned madam if i thought you would suffer mr mowbray to drive you home till day light shall appear i certainly shall not sir answered she but do you know my brother madam you are acquainted with his name and i dont recollect that it has been mentioned i hesitated hector turned upon us we were approaching the light and with a suddenness which fear and passion inspired knowing that mowbray did not understand italian i said in an under voiceil signer hugo trevor non e morto bellissima signora mr trevor is not dead dearest ladyat the same instant i snatched her hand pressed it was about to raise it to my lips but recollecting myself turned short round and added addio clarke was at my back and i plucked him by the coat and whisperedcome with me but what of olivia was she dead to feeling at this strange mysterious moment did no rushing torrent of ideas suddenly overwhelm her the man whose loss she had lamented not in his grave that man again her saviour her guardian genius in the dark hour of dread and danger acquainted in a way the most extraordinary with her thoughts and favourable wishes or as she was too severely inclined to term it her passion and its folly a witness that she did not credit all which malice could urge against him nor listen in base silence when her perhaps too partial heart pleaded in his behalf nay more that man the protector of her aunt by whom he had been so often and so bitterly reviled that man travelling in obscurity in familiar society with a carpenter yet braving peril in her behalf and shunning the thanks which the uncommon services he had rendered might boldly make him claim avoiding them most certainly because of the mean condition to which he was reduced faithful in his affection for such his behaviour spoke him but unfortunate depressed despised sinking under poverty languishing away his youth or crushed by accumulating disastersdid no such fears no such tender recollections assail her bosomi have described her ill indeed if that could be supposed i must pursue my narrative for how can i picture what most indubitably must have passed in her heart since i feel myself so very incapable of delineating my own this adventure did not entirely end here i wished to have gone forward on foot to hounslow without delay but clarke interceded for a glass of brandy he said the water had chilled him and he was still more importunate with me to take the same preventative i had no fear for myself for i had no such feeling but as i did not think i had any right to trifle with his health i returned with him taking the precaution to go through the passage to the kitchen door here just as we came to the threshold who should be coming in face of us carrying a pair of candles but my quondam servant philip the instant he beheld me he turned pale trembled set down the lights stood aghast for a moment and then took to his heels though not so terrified i was almost as much surprised as he and suffered him to escape before i had the presence of mind to know how to act as however it was my plan to avoid being known myself for the present i thought proper to make no other enquiry than to ask whose servant he was and was answered that he came with the ladies who had just returned from the coach various conjectures instantly crossed my imagination all of which were associated with the sudden flight from bath the robbery he had committed the seeming honesty and even affection of his character previous to that event his now being in the service of olivia for i understood him to be her own valet and the story of my death but though my curiosity was greatly excited the present was not the time in which these mysteries could be unravelled we therefore took clarkes prescription against cold and leaving cranford bridge pursued our road to hounslow where we arrived about eleven oclock and put up at an inferior inn lest any accident should bring us again in company with the aunt and the nephew chapter xii meditations on what had passed the condolence of clarke arrival at london the meeting of former friends law arrangements it may be well supposed that the incidents of this night were not easily driven from my imagination while we were walking the care we were obliged to take and the gloom around us prevented any thing from escaping me sufficiently marked to attract the notice of my companion but when we were seated in a room with lights and my mind was no longer diverted by other objects the reveries into which i fell the interjections that broke from me the hasty and interrupted manner in which i ate and drank the expressions of extreme joy which altered my countenance at one moment and the solemn seriousness which it assumed the next with my eyes fixed while the tears rolled down my cheeks at last so agitated poor clarke that he exclaimedfor gods sake mr trevor what is the matter with you my silence for i was unable to speak did but increase his alarmare you taken ill what has befallen you wont you open your mind to me if i could do you any good i hope you dont think i should be backward are you unhappy no no i am very glad of that but something uncommon i am sure has happened to you though it may not be fit perhaps that i should hear what and i dont want to be a busy body though i must say i should be more at ease if i was quite sure that all was right thats all i have no other curiosity all is not right but yet i hope it will be i know not by what means it seems indeed impossible and perhaps it is and yet i hope i hope i hope well well i am glad of that we should all hope we are bid to hope god help us if we did not perhaps i cant give you any help i suppose that is beyond me i am sorry for it but what can a poor carpenter do in the way of befriending a gentleman a poor carpenter can have a kind heart and i do not know whether that is not the most blessed thing on earth did you ever hear me repeat the name of olivia yes when you were lightheaded i heard the name many a time and often and the nurse said you raved of nobody else but we could none of us find out who she was though i must say i have often enough wished to ask but that i did not think it became me to seem to be at all prying that is the lady you have been in company with tonight it is she whom you have helped me to save i was sufficiently indebted to you before but what am i then at present well that to be sure is accidental enough i could not have thought it how oddly things do fall out but i am glad of it with all my heart i could not see much of her to be sure though i looked with all the eyes i had but i thought somehow she seemed as fine a young creature as i had ever beheld since the hour i was born which the mildness of her voice did but make the more likely i thought to myself i never in my days heard any living soul so sweetspoken so that i must say things have fallen out very strangely i always said to my sally there must be something between you and the gentlewoman the name of which was on your tongues end so often while you were down in the fever and i am glad to the heart that you have happened on her again so unexpectedly though i can see no good reason now you have found her why you should be in such a hurry to get away the unaffected participation of clarke in all my joys and sorrows the questions which his feelings impelled him to put and the fidelity of his nature as well as the impulse which passion gave me to disburthen my mind were all of them inducements to speak and i informed him of many of those particulars which have already been recited the more intimately he became acquainted with my history the more powerfully he seemed imbued with my hopes and fears and the better satisfied i was with the confidence i had reposed in him i am unable to paint the honest indignation of his feelings and phraseology at the injustice which he as well as i supposed had been done me the depression of his countenance when i dwelt on the despair and wretchedness which the almost impossibility of my obtaining olivia inspired and the animation with which he seemed as it were to set his shoulders to the wheel when my returning fervor led me to the opposite extreme and gave me confidence in my own powers and the strenuous exertions on which i was resolved the conversation continued long after we retired to rest so that our sleep was short for we were up again very early before it was light and continued our journey to london where we arrived a little after nine in the morning i immediately proceeded to the lodging of miss wilmot whom i found where i had left her and who was truly rejoiced to see me clarke had never been in london i therefore took him with me gave a proper account of him to miss wilmot and we all breakfasted together while mary waited whose features as well as her words sufficiently testified the unexpected pleasure of the meeting and who artlessly related the apprehensions of herself and my few friends at not hearing from me my first enquiries were concerning wilmot and turl and i was delighted to learn that wilmot whom i left in a sickly state of mind that was seriously alarming had been awakened by turl to a more just sense of human affairs and had recovered much of the former vigour and elasticity of his talents his sister told me that he was at present engaged in a periodical publication and had beside composed a considerable part of a comedy of which turl as well as herself conceived the greatest hopes the reader scarcely need be told that this intelligence gave me great pleasure it led me to revolve mighty matters in my own mind created emulation and inspired me with increasing confidence and alacrity yes said i exultingly genius may safely encounter and dare difficulties let it but confide in itself and it will conquer them all while we were conversing wilmot came in i must leave the imagination to paint the welcome we gave each other i was surprised at the change which had taken place in his form and physiognomy and at the different aspect they had assumed not that the marks of melancholy were quite eradicated but when i considered his whole appearance he was scarcely the same person i produced surprise in him of a contrary kind there was neither the wonted freshness of my complexion nor the fashionable ease of my air and dress which he had remarked but a few months before and he took the first private opportunity that offered to enquire with great earnestness if there were any means by which he could be of service under the general selfishness which our present institutions inspire such questions are wonderfully endearing i answered him that i had found a friend whose principles were as liberal and enlarged as they were uncommon and that i would take an early occasion to give him an account of my present designs and the posture of my affairs he informed me that the severe application of turl had enfeebled his health and had induced him to reside for a few weeks at a small place by the seaside that he might enjoy the benefits of bathing and the fresh breezes for which purpose he had left london the week before that neither wilmot nor turl himself considered his case at present as the least dangerous but that they had both agreed this was a prudent step and that he had received a letter from turl informing him of his safe arrival and that he thought he had already derived benefit and animation from the journey turl was not a man to be known and to be thought of with apathy the intelligence wilmot gave me softened as it was by the circumstances attending it produced a very unpleasant feeling the possibility of the loss of such a man so wise so benevolent and so undaunted in the cause of truth was a sensation for which i have no epithet wilmot perceived what passed in my mind and again assured me of his thorough persuasion that there was not any danger we passed as much of the morning together as wilmot could spare from his occupations after which we parted and each proceeded on his own concerns i to enquire after a dwellingplace and he to his literary engagements while clarke instructed by mary went in search of a lodging for himself through those streets that were most likely to afford him one at a reasonable rate mr evelyn had a relation of a younger branch of the family in the law whose name was hilary to whom i was recommended and from whom i received the utmost attention in consequence of the letters i brought this gentleman was an attorney of repute a practitioner of uncommon honesty assiduous and capable as a professional man a firm defender of freedom even to his own risk and detriment a sincere speaker a valuable friend and in every sense a man of worth and principle happy at all times to oblige he willingly undertook the task assigned to him by mr evelyns recommendation and in pursuance of his advice i hired an apartment in the neighbourhood of queenssquare bloomsbury that i might be within a convenient distance of the inns of court yet not entirely buried in the noise and smoke of the disagreeable part of the town i likewise informed mr hilary of my determination not to be a dumb barrister and having from my appearance and mode of enunciation as well as from the letters of mr evelyn conceived rather a high opinion of my talents he applauded my plan in pursuance of which he recommended me to place myself with counsellor ventilate a man of high situation in the law i readily consented and it was agreed that he should speak to that gentleman immediately on the subject and appoint a meeting chapter xiii more meditations relating to olivia concluding with a loveletter doubts concerning its conveyance it cannot be supposed that olivia was out of my thoughts knowing her kindness toward miss wilmot i carefully took the first opportunity to inform the latter of the chief incidents that had passed and to concert with her some means if possible of obtaining an interview miss wilmot no longer received any pecuniary aid from olivia wilmot considered it as a duty to provide for his sister and had too lofty a sense of independance to admit the repetition of these favours yet how far that pride of heart which teaches us not only that we should not submit to receive pecuniary assistance from any human being except from our relations but that these relations can accept of no relief however much they may be in need of it without tarnishing our honor is a question which deserves to be seriously examined not but at that time it squared very aptly with my opinions it may be further remarked of relations that as they sometimes think they ought only to receive aid from each other so they most of them imagine that from each other they may unblushingly extort all they can the generous wilmot indeed was in no danger of this last mistake but though money was no longer a motive for intercourse between the gentle olivia and miss wilmot there was no danger that either of the friends would forget the other and the latter was too sincerely interested in the happiness both of me and olivia not to be willing to promote that happiness by every means in her power what these means should be was the difficulty we had to solve to use any kind of stratagem would offend the delicate and justlyfeeling olivia to come upon her by surprise even if the opportunity should offer itself would not be a manly and dignified proceeding i had always thought highly of that courage which mild as her manners were she never failed to exert on trying occasions her defence of me in the coach was a proof that i had not overestimated her fortitude it likewise shewed that she was under mistakes concerning me that were dangerous should they remain unexplained and that whenever i thought of them which was but too often excited my utmost indignation bold however as she was in my defence when she supposed me dead very different sensations might assail her when she should be convinced if she still doubted that i was living her submission to her aunt seemed to be unlimited as long as she supposed that to comply would be less productive of harm than to resist but i had witnessed that she would not consent to actions of great moment which her heart disapproved these facts made it improbable that she would grant me an interview without her aunts knowledge what then was to be done a letter that should fully explain my thoughts my plans my determination and my hopes and fears appeared to be the most eligible mode were i to prompt her to a clandestine correspondence i was well aware that i should highly and justly offend her she would consider it as little less than an insult her conduct was open her mind superior to deceit and to be ignorant of this would be to shew myself unworthy of her the lover should disdain to excite his mistress to any action which he would disapprove in a wife and this was a rule not to be infringed by him who should aspire to the nobleminded olivia to write then i resolved and in such a manner as to open my whole soul to her awaken her affections call forth her admiration agitate her with pity and love and ensure her perseverance alas i took the pen in hand but was miserably deceived i had undertaken an impossible task thought was too rapid too multifarious too complicate and the tracing of letters and words infinitely too slow and frigid at last however after repeated attempts i determined on sending the following with which when written i was very far from satisfied but of that i despaired to the woman whom my soul adores how shall i address myself tumultuous thoughts hopes that vanish and fears that distract are ill fitted for such a talk governed by feelings which will admit of no controul i can only claim your pardon on the plea of inability to preserve that silence which it is temerity or something worse to break my thoughts will have passage will rush into your presence will expose themselves to the worst of calamities your reproof and anger distracted as i am by a dread of the dangers that may result from my silence i persuade myself that these dangers are more immediate and threatening though scarcely more painful than your disapprobation you have supposed me dead though by what strange accident i cannot divine under that supposition it was my miraculous fortune my ecstatic bliss to hear you with a purity of heart and a dignity of sentiment such as none but a heart like yours could conceive or express avow a former partiality in favour of one who whatever may be his other faults would gladly resign his life to secure your happiness of one who in his overweening affection has fondly and foolishly cherished the persuasion that this happiness is inseparable from his own nay who partly hopes and partly believes so blind is his egotism that he is the only man on earth who fully comprehends your wonderful worth and matchless virtues and who is pursuing the fixed purpose of his soul that of finally deserving you from the conviction that he through life will be invariable in that admiration that tenderness and that unceasing love without which the life of olivia might perhaps be miserable these may be the dreams of vanity and folly yet if i do not mistake they are the dreams of all lovers they are indeed the aliment or rather the very essence of love what delight can equal that of revelling in imagination on the happiness we can bestow on those who have bliss so ineffable to bestow upon us what then if i were to see this olivia mated with a man so dull of faculty as soon to lose all sense of the wondrous treasure in his possession who never perhaps had any discriminating knowledge of its worth and who shall be willing to barter it for any vile and contemptible gewgaw that may allure his depraved taste or sickly appetite is there no such man are these fears wholly groundless at what an immeasurable distance do i seem cast from the enjoyment of that supreme bliss to which perhaps the frenzy only of imagination could make me aspire there is but one means by which i can be happy either i am to be the most favoured of mankind or i am nothing either i rise into godlike existence or i sink unknown and never to be remembered either we are made for each other ori dare not think on the reverse it is too distracting yet i have no hope what i now write is presumption is madness and why it is not your beauty your virtues or the supreme qualities of your mind that would raise this gulph of misery between us no avarice vanity and prejudice are my enemies it is they that would sacrifice you at their altars that you will persevere in your refusal is my only hope how shall i palliate what i cannot defend my behaviour while i overheard you and your aunt in vain do i plead that i was asleep when you came into the coach and that i first discovered you by the sound of your voice and the turn of the conversation that i dreaded exciting any sudden alarm in you perhaps it was a vain dread and that when i ought most to have spoken when i became the subject of the discourse i was then chained in silence by unconquerable emotions yet to be a listener indeed indeed it is a thing that my soul disdains but i have done many such things not knowing while they passed what it was that i did my destiny now is to study the law and to this my days and nights shall be devoted but the distance at which i see myself from the goal is a thought which i am obliged by every possible effort to shut out of my memory i am in want of consolation but since your society is denied me i know not where it may be found i own there are moments in which i am fearfully agitated yet i do not solicit an answer let me rather perish than prompt you to an action of the propriety of which even i am obliged to doubt since it cannot i suppose be done without concealment oh that you knew every thought of my heart you would then perceive the burning desire i have to make myself every way worthy of that unutterable bliss to which i aspire madman i aspire with what contempt would such daring be treated by those whom custom and ties of blood have taught you to revere i confess this is a thought which i cannot endure yet i can less endure to relinquish my impossible hopes could you conceive what these contradictory and tormenting sensations are you would perhaps be induced to pardon some of the extravagant acts which i heard you so mildly yet so justly censure to be yours then is the end for which i live and yet my pride and every other feeling revolts to think i should entreat you to accept a pauper either in wealth or principle well then i will not waste my time in complaint let me become worthy of you or let me perish fool that is impossible but if fall i must i will endeavour to make my ruin respectable suffer me to inform you that i have lately acquired a friend whose virtues are beyond my praise and who has urged me to accept his aid in forwarding my studies and pursuits as an act of duty incumbent on us both our acquaintance has been short and so considering the serious nature of the subject was the debate that led to this conclusion yet his arguments seemed unanswerable and i hope i have not yielded too lightly oh that it was allowed me to consult your exquisite sense of right and wrong but wishes are vain thus far i have intruded yet know not how to end my only hope that you will take no offence at what i have written is in the conscious respect that my heart feels for you which i think cannot have misguided my pen and the knowledge that you are too just lightly to attribute mean or ill motives to me how languid is all that i have written am i so impotent that i can present none of the images that so eternally haunt me that wing me into your presence furnish me with innumerable arguments which seem so allpersuasive melt me in tenderness at one moment supply me with the most irresistible elocution the next and convince you while they inspire me with raptures inexpressible are they all flown all faded all extinct where is the fervor that devours me i would pray for your happiness i would supplicate heaven that no moment of your bliss should be abridged shall it then be disturbed by me oh no unless authorised by hopes as different as they are wild and improbable pardon but this and you shall never more be subject to the like importunity from hugh trevor having written my letter i had to devise the means of having it delivered if it were addressed directly to her what certainty had i that it would not be opened by the aunt nay was not that indeed the most probable and would it in that case ever be seen by olivia in my apprehension certainly not i had then to chuse whether i would send a messenger who should wait about the house and take some opportunity to deliver it clandestinely or commit it to the care either of mary or miss wilmot the messenger was a very objectionable expedient it was mean and liable to detection the medium of mary was something of the same kind and the friendship and intelligence of miss wilmot rendered her intervention much the most desirable it was a delicate office to require of her but she could speak the truth she could say that it was to relate some facts which olivia might even desire to know that it contained nothing which i myself should wish her to conceal if she thought fit to shew it that it did not invite her to any improper correspondence and that it was the only one which under the present circumstances i meant to obtrude upon her that miss wilmot might be convinced i had neither deceived myself nor her in this account which i should instruct her to give of it i hastened with it to her lodgings and requested her to read it before it was sealed having ended she was so well satisfied with the propriety both of writing and delivering it that she readily undertook the latter office and with her i left it hoping that olivia would soon call would read it in her presence and that i should quickly learn what might be the sensations it should produce chapter xiv counsellor ventilate and the law raptures excited by the panegyric of blackstone dialogues legal and political with characteristic traits meantime the appointed interview between me and counsellor ventilate took place this gentleman was characterized by those manners and opinions which the profession of the law is so eminently calculated to produce he had a broad brazen stare a curl of contempt on his upperlip and a somewhat short supercilious nose his head was habitually turned upward his eye in the contrary direction as if on the watch in expectation to detect something which his cunning might turn to advantage and his halfopened mouth and dropping jaw seemed to say what an immense fool is every man i meet his whole manner and aspect appeared to denote that he was in a continual revery and that he imagined himself in a court of law browbeating a witness interrogating an idiot or detailing cases and precedents to shew the subtlety with which he could mislead and confound his hearers a splithair distinction without a difference gave him rapture and whenever it happened to puzzle which was but too often he raised his left shoulder and gave a hem of congratulation to himself denoting his conviction that he was indisputably the greatest lawyer in the world and if the greatest lawyer he was as certainly according to his own creed the greatest man for the rest of mankind if put in competition with lawyers what were they what but poor silly imbecile creatures one standard by which he delighted to measure his own talents was the length to which he could drawl out a reply was there a man to be found who could speak eight hours unceasingly he would surpass him when his turn came nine should not suffice he would be more dull contradictory and intolerable than his rival by an hour at least he would repeat precedents twist sentences misconstrue maxims and so perplex and entangle his own intellect that his hearers had no way of getting rid of the pain he excited except by falling asleep or determining not to listen it must be owned however he had some charity for them for to sleep he gave them a very sufficient provocative being one of the retainers of government he had a seat in the house of commons where he used to rise in his place and address the speaker with no less logic love of justice and legislative wisdom than he was wont to display when pleading in the courts it was in vain that he exposed himself to the ridicule of this most discerning body not less witty than virtuous of shame he was incapable he would again and again rise in his place totally forgetful of past flagellation and again and again convince mr speaker and the honorable members persisting to labour in the hope of making them all as profound reasoners as himself no matter that the thing was impracticable he would get up and do his duty and sit down and receive his own applause to mention shame in this case was indeed absurd how should a man blush at reproof which he cannot comprehend his skull was so admirably fortified by nature that it was equally impenetrable to the heavy batteries of argument or the skirmishing artillery of wit let the cannon roar he heard it not he was abstractedly contemplating those obscure depths in which he remained for ever seated and where he had visions innumerable though he saw nothing one favourite and neverfailing object on these occasions was to instruct the house in law and here the devil who is himself a kind of lawyer for he devours his best friends the devil i say chose these opportunities to vent his choicest malice he did not set a lawyer to confound a lawyer that were but a stale device he humbled him out of the mouths of men who had occasionally read lawbooks it is true but who had read them without a lawyers obliquity and had enquired what was the simple unadulterated intention of their authors now law which in all its stages has a quibble in either eye that may mean good or may mean ill is every where except in a court of justice capable of a good interpretation this is not a rule without an exception but in many cases at least law has something intentionally beneficial in its principle for this beneficent vitalspark every body but a lawyer is in search and it is what every body but a lawyer is delighted to find no wonder therefore that a lawyer should meet discomfiture and confusion when he pretends to discuss the abstract nature of justice in any place except in these aforesaid courts of justice thus it happened that mr ventilate was on all such occasions confounded in that honorable house of which he was an honorable member which indeed when we remember who were his opponents was less miraculous than the immaculate conceptionpshaw i mean the transmigrationsof vishnoo much of the conceit and ridicule of the character of mr ventilate was apparent even to my eye at our first meeting but he was a person of great practice and had the reputation of a sound lawyer which signifies a man who has patience to read reports and a facility at quoting them beside i was in haste and rather inclined to leap over an obstacle than to go round it accordingly our arrangements were made and the next day i attended at his chambers with a firm and as i supposed not to be shaken determination to become one of the greatest lawyers the world ever beheld the first book i was advised to read as a historical introduction to and compendium of law was blackstones commentaries this author had acquired too much celebrity for any man of liberal education to be ignorant of his fame i therefore began and continued to read him with all the prepossession that an author himself could wish in his favour the panegyric he makes on english laws and the constitution of britain gave me delight and animation the reproof he bestows on gentlemen who are ignorant of this branch of learning and on the perplexities introduced into our statutelaw by such illjudging and unlearned legislators and his praise of the capacity they would acquire for administering justice to which sacred function they are so often called were this ignorance removed gave dignity to the study i was about to pursue then the account given of servius sulpicius who according to my learned author left behind him about a hundred and fourscore volumes of his own compiling how wonderfully did it move my admiration i previously knew that in most countries which are denominated civilized law was voluminous but i had never till then imagined that one man could himself compile a hundred and fourscore volumes and as it seems could compile them at his leisure too for his chief business was that of oratory beside which it lives on record that being a firm patriot he was a wise and indefatigable senator but it appears that sulpicius could devour law with greater ease than milo or perhaps even than cacus himself could oxen neither was it recorded that this prodigy of legal learning began young and should i then despair of equalling him no no get me into one of my trances and had he compiled as many thousands of volumes i should scarcely have suspected that i could not compile as fast as he as i read on how did i deplore the quarrel between vicarius and his opponents or in other words between the pandects and the common law of england with the ignorance that had nearly been the result how rejoice in the institution of those renowned hotbeds of law the inns of court by the aid of which had not the rage for enacting laws kept pace with the rage for studying them there were hopes that the whole kingdom would in time have been so learned in the science that every man might indeed have become his own lawyer how did i regret that i had not studied commonlaw while at college how sympathetic with my author when he exclaimsthat a science which distinguishes the criterions of right and wrong which teaches to establish the one and prevent punish or redress the other which employs in its theory the noblest faculties of the soul and exerts in its practice the cardinal virtues of the heart a science which is universal in its use and extent accommodated to each individual yet comprehending the whole community that a science like this should ever have been deemed unnecessary to be studied in a university is a matter of astonishment and concern how did i bless the memory of mr viner who had found a remedy for this evil by establishing an oxford professorship and how promise to make myself master of his abridgment till i had every case it contained at my tongues end what were four and twenty volumes in folio compared to sulpicius it was a trifle the eulogium that i next came to on a university education how grateful was that to my heart i was not as my oracle described though one of the gentlemen of bright imaginations to be wearied however unpromising the search neither was i to be numbered among those many persons of moderate capacity who confuse themselves at first setting out and continue ever dark and puzzled during the remainder of their lives the law being itself so luminous there was no fear of that with me i met indeed with one overwhelming assertion such knowledge as is necessary for a judge is hardly to be acquired by the lucubrations of twenty years but this to be sure must be meant of dull fellows as to the limits of genius they were unknown my pleasure revived in full force when i arrived at my authors definition of law which he states to bea rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a state commanding what is right and prohibiting what is wrong what will you say to that friend turl exclaimed i putting down the book and pausing can any thing be more provident more wise more desirable in short i found the writer so clearly understood and satisfactorily explained the nature of law and the benefits arising from it that for my own part i began to be ashamed of my former stupidity it was all so selfevident that it seemed disgraceful not to know it as it were by intuition i was in that precise temper of mind which renders conviction an easy task for i was in haste to be rich and famous and the desire of wealth and fame are two of the strongest provocatives to faith that the sagacity of selfishness has ever yet discovered while i was in the midst of all these admirings my attention was roused by a dialogue that passed between two of my senior fellowpupils whose names were rudge and trottman which the former thus began that was a d rascally cause we were concerned in yesterday rascally enough but we got it i cant say but i was sorry for the poor farmer sorry ha ha ha you remind me of an unfleshedrecruit or a young surgeon who has just begun to walk the hospitals frequent the courts and you will soon learn to forget commiseration and attend to nothing but law docking of entails gives the lawyer as little concern as the amputation of limbs does the surgeon they are both of them curious only about the manner and dexterity of the operation i suppose it will ruin the man he was a fool for making it a criminal prosecution he should have brought an action for damages it is an aggravating thing for a man to have his daughter seduced be beaten himself because he was angry at the injury and when he sues for redress not only be unable to obtain it but find his fortune destroyed as well as his daughters character and his own peace the law knows nothing concerning him or his fortune character peace or daughter it is and ought to be dead to private feeling it must consider nothing but the public benefit nor must it ever condescend to vary from its own plain and literal construction that is strange for its origin seems to have been in those very feelings to which it is so dead undoubtedly but it provides for such feelings each under its individual class and if a man seeking redress shall seek it under a wrong head that is his fault and not the fault of the law it is a fault however that is daily committed ay to be sure or there would be but few lawyers how so why if a man doing wrong was certain or almost certain of being detected and exposed the chances would be so much against offenders that offences would of course diminish then the prosperity of lawyers seems to result from the blunders which they themselves commit no doubt it does and as the blunders are innumerable their prosperity must be in proportion there seems to be something wrong in this though i cannot tell what or why ha ha ha you have no cause to complain you are a lawyer and your own interest must teach you that every thing is right except indeed that the classes or heads i mentioned and consequently the blunders are not numerous enough but thank heaven we have a remedy for that for our statutebooks are daily swelling why yes some people say they are pregnant with mischief of which it is further asserted that they are daily delivered ay certainly and to the great joy of the parents who are they enquire for the father at st stephens and for the mother at westminsterhall i assure you they are both enraptured at their own offspring the old lady sits in state and daily praises her babes with the most doating loquacity and she does this with so grave a face that it is impossible to forbear laughing when you hear her she is so serious so solemn so convinced that every thing she utters is oracular and so irascible if she does but so much as smell a doubt concerning the beauty and perfection of her brats that there is no scene in the world which tickles my imagination so irresistibly as to watch her maternal visage during her eulogiums while the bigwigs are nodding approbation or the contortions of her physiognomy when any cross incident happens to impede the torrent of her fondness with all due respect to her motherly functions she is a very freakish and laughable old lady you have a turn for ridicule but i confess if i thought your picture were true i do not believe my sensations would be so pleasant as yours appear to be and why in the name of common sense how can one laugh at the mistakes and miseries of mankind for a very simple reason because it is the only way that can render them endurable none but a fool would cry at what cannot be corrected the colloquy between my companions here took another direction less interesting to me and left me to pause and ruminate this picture said i is satirical i own but surely it is unjust blackstone beyond all doubt understood the science profoundly and his account of it is very different indeed i turned back to the passage i have quoted it distinguishes the criterions of right and wrong teaches us to establish the one and prevent punish or redress the other employs in its theory the noblest faculties of the soul and exerts in its practice the cardinal virtues of the heart it is universal in its use and extent is accommodated to each individual and yet comprehends the whole community how just how ennobling how sublime is this praise to compare it to the doatings of an old woman is extremely false nay is pernicious for by exciting laughter it misleads the judgment my companions being silent i was impelled to address myself to trottman i wonder sir said i that you should be such an enemy to law i an enemy you totally mistake i am its fast friend and with good reason i find it a very certain source of ease and affluence even to the most stupid blockheads if they will but drudge on and of riches honours and hereditary fame to men of but very moderate talents i may surely expect to come in for my share and therefore should be a rank fool indeed were i its enemy i leave that to innovating fanatics let them dream and rave and write while i mind my own affairs take men as they are and ever must be profit by supporting present establishments and look down with contempt on the puppies who prate philosophy and bawl for reform i was stung conscious of the turn my own thoughts had taken i suspected that he had divined this from some words which i might have dropped and that his attack was personal i therefore eagerly repliedyour language sir is unqualified i meant no offence if you are a reformer i beg your pardon i never quarrel about what i have heard certain pompous gentlemen call principles then all those persons who differ in opinion from you are puppies and pompous gentlemen oh dear no sir only all those that are absent the company you know according to the received rule is excepted there was something impudently humble and satirical in his look while he uttered this yet so contrived as to make the man appear a pettish angry blockhead who should take offence at it and i certainly was not inclined to quarrel with my new comrades the first day of our acquaintance beside trottman was a little insignificant man in appearance potbellied of a swarthy complexion but with keenness cunning and mockery in his eye and whose form and figure as well as his turn of mind must have made it ridiculous to have quarrelled with him i therefore waited for some more fortunate opportunity to repay him in his own coin for i was as unwilling to be vanquished by wit and satire as by force of argument or of arms rudge whose temper was more placid but who had an enquiring mind said you do not know my friend trottman yet mr trevor he cares but little who has the most reason so that he may have the most laughter life is a journey added trottman and if i can travel on terra firma with a clear sky and a smiling landscape let those that please put to sea in a butchers tray and sail in quest of foul weather yes sir but the search of ease is the loss of happiness and to fly from danger is the likeliest way to meet it that is when you either seek or fly without a guide and who is this guide to safety it is what you appear to hold in contempt principle ha ha ha right the blind leading the blind conjure up one phantom to seek for another how prodigiously we improve from what you have said i am not surprised that you should consider principle as a phantom but you only quarrel with the word for as principle can mean nothing more than a rule of action deduced from past experience and influencing our present conduct you certainly like other men act from principle it is a moral duty to shun pain and keep your fingers out of the fire not if i want to sear up a wound you are excellent at a shifting blow but why would you apply the cautery because principle guided by experience has previously told you that to cauterize is in some cases the way to heal but empirics who cauterize without healing are daily multiplying upon us were that granted it is but empiric opposed to empiric men have been groaning under their sufferings for ages and since ages have proved that the old prescriptions were insufficient i can neither see the danger nor the blame of following new zeal may be purblind and perhaps could not see a guillotine but her neck might chance to feel it then you think a guillotine a more terrible thing than a halter an axe or perhaps even a rack it will do more work in less time and you suppose it to be principle or if you please innovation that has given this machine its momentum suppose is there any doubt infinite i imagine it to be given if we may be allowed to personify neither by innovation nor establishment but by the rashness and ill temper with which these heroines have mutually maintained their positions innovation struck the ball at first too impetuously but establishment took it at the rebound and returned it with triple violence brunswickian manifestoes and exterminating wars were not ill adapted to raise the diabolical spirit of revenge an endeavour to starve a nation which it was found difficult to exterminate by fire and sword was not a very charitable act in madam establishment her swindling forgeries were little better and that her turn should come to be starved and swindled is not miraculous though it is deplorable heaven avert her claims to the guillotine my antagonist had no immediate reply and rudge exclaimed with some satisfaction why trottman you have met with your match not i indeed answered he peevishly i am only lost in a labyrinth of words and am waiting for principle to come and be my guide but i am afraid she carries a dark lanthorn which will but blind those that look i suspect sir said i you are less at loss for a joke than an argument and that you prefer bushfighting for my own part i love the fair and open field of enquiry as this is a field that has no limits nor any end to its cross roads i am content as you say to sit down under my hedge and be quiet no no i did not say that for i see you love to draw a sly bow at passengers i have now and then brought down a gull or an owl have you shot any of those birds today i felt no compunction in making this triumphant retort to his sneer and here our dialogue ended though it was a kind of declaration of war i mean a war of words which as we became more acquainted was occasionally waged with some asperity but in one respect trottman was my superior to sneer was habitual to him but it was always done in a manner which seemed to indicate that he himself had no suspicion of any such intent so that he continually appeared to keep his temper and never triumphed so effectually as when he could provoke me to lose mine on which occasions his additional conciliatory sarcasms accompanied with smiles denoting the enjoyment of his victory never failed to make me feel my own littleness and this is a lesson for which i consider myself as very highly in his debt i now pursued my reading and employed the rest of the day in beginning to copy the manuscript precedents that were to capacitate me for the practice of law for the number of which that were in his possession mr ventilate was famed my ardour however had felt some trifling abatement by the very different picture and panegyric of the law as given by trottman opposed to that i had been contemplating but i had this very powerful consolation that as trottman knew very little of what i supposed to be the true principles of politics it was highly probable he was no better acquainted with those of law chapter xv former resentments revised doubts protracted conjectures on the sincerity of a delicate yet firm mind above a fortnight passed away during which i received no word of intelligence concerning olivia at some moments i felt great affliction from this suspense at others i collected myself and determined to pursue my plan with all the vigour in which it had been conceived in the interval i wrote several times to mr evelyn to this i was prompted from the very nature of my engagements and situation beside which i had not forgotten my pamphlet against the earl and the bishop that lay ready for publication though the acrimony of my feelings was much abated the propriety of making the world acquainted with this affair was one of the subjects of my correspondence with mr evelyn to whom i had the candour to state my own opinions and sensations on one part and on the other the objections that had been urged by turl in the history i had given mr evelyn of myself i was impelled as well by inclination as necessity to delineate the character of turl with which he could not but be charmed and with his arguments and dissuasions on this subject with these the ideas of mr evelyn entirely coincided he wrote delightful letters full of animation feeling and friendship and his persuasion therefore had the greater effect wilmot concurred in the opinion of both and being thus pressed by the men whom i most loved and revered i endeavoured to consign my resentment and its effusions to oblivion and to dismiss the subject entirely from my mind at length my suspense concerning olivia found some though far from a satisfactory relief as she had paid no visit to miss wilmot the latter of course had found no opportunity to deliver my letter one evening however as i was sitting after tea with miss wilmot and her brother a note came of which the following were the contents miss mowbray presents her kind and tenderest respects to miss wilmot and informs her that she has been in town for some short time assures her that her not having called is far indeed from any decline of former friendship the sincerity of which is invariable but that there are motives which prevent her for the present from the enjoyment of that satisfaction she would have been most happy to have communicated her thoughts to miss wilmot in person but she is the slave of circumstances which for family reasons and indeed from other motives she is forbidden to explain and to which she is obliged to submit she confides in the goodness and friendship of miss wilmot who she is well assured will not misinterpret that which is unavoidable and cherishing the hope of a more favourable opportunity wishes her all possible happiness requesting that if by any means in her power it can be increased miss wilmot will acquaint her with those means that she may have the wishedfor occasion of proving the ardour and sincerity of her affections hertfordstreet nov th miss wilmot gave me this note to read and the commentary i immediately made was that finding i was alive the fear of a rencontre with me was the obstacle to her visits they agreed that this was a very probable supposition but how far the aunt was any way concerned in it was matter of more uncertain conjecture miss wilmot knew that olivia had informed her aunt of the visits she was before accustomed to make and as her ideas concerning sincerity were delicately strict it was more than probable that she had disdained to conceal any of the circumstances with which she herself was acquainted i therefore thought it almost indubitable that she had been no less frank on the present occasion than was habitual to her on others and time afterward discovered that my conclusions were right with what unequal weapons exclaimed i do the lovers of truth and the adherents of hypocrisy contend they do indeed replied wilmot but contrary i believe to your supposition the former have infinitely the advantage for the latter systematically deceive themselves what was to be done was i to pursue some covert mode of conveying my letter should i send it openly or ought i to let it remain and patiently wait the course of events which by endeavouring to forward i might but retard wilmot who though he had too much sympathy to communicate all his fears had but little expectation judging from the failure of his own plans of the success of mine advised me to the latter and perplexed as i was with doubt and apprehension i followed this advice end of volume iv volume v chapter i a cursory glance at law fictions legal suppositions endless the professional jargon of an attorney an enquiry into the integrity of barristers and the equity of decisions at law a and b or a case stated a digression from law to philosophy in the mean time my application to the law was incessant and consequently my intercourse with lawyers daily increased i endeavoured to load my brain with technical terms and phrases to understand technical distinctions and to acquaint myself with the history of law fictions and the reasons on which they had been founded to these subjects my attention had been turned by mr hilary who being a solicitor was well acquainted with the value of them to the man who meant to make himself a thorough lawyer the consideration of this branch of law staggered my judgment trottman and hilary were intimate the latter had invited us and other friends to dinner and as i found the acuteness of trottman useful to me in my pursuits i took this and every occasion to put questions which he was very ready to answer as it happened my enquiry on the subject of law fictions brought on the following dialogue which was supported by trottman entirely in his own style according to your account then said i in answer to a previous remark in banco regis the king is always supposed to be present no doubt what question can there be of that one invisible kind of being can as easily be supposed as another and i hope you will not dispute the actual presence of that pleasant gentleman called the devil in any one of our courts by no means as for his majesty he god bless him by the nature of his office is hic et ubique here there and every where he is borne in state before each corporation mayor whether mr or my lord and reposes peacefully in front of mr speaker or the lord high chancellor investing them by his sacred presence with all their power how so how so do you forget the mace upon the table authority then has that virtue that like grace divine into a wafer it can be transfused into wood yes a lords white wand a generals baton a constables staff it is thought necessary i grant in some of these cases that the block should be carved and gilded well the position is that in banco regis the king is always present so says the law but the law it appears tells a lie and from all that i have heard i wish it were the only one that it told could the law hear sir it would take very grave offence at your language it only assumes a fiction john doe and richard roe who are the pledges of prosecution are two more of its supposes or lies i beg pardon i should have said fictions why yes considering that john doe and richard roe never made their personal appearance in any court in the kingdom were never once met in house street or field in public or in private nay had never yet the good luck to be born they have really done a deal of business they resemble legion entering the swine they plunge whole herds into the depths of destruction or if you will they are a kind of real yet invisible hobgoblins by whom every human being is liable to be haunted it must however be allowed of them that they are a pair of very active and convenient persons to lawyers but god help the rest of mankind are there many of these fictions more than i or any man i believe can at one time remember from the little i have read this appears to be a very puzzling part of the profession not at all if we will take things as we find them and neither be more curious nor squeamish than wise i will state the process of a suit to you and you will then perceive how plain and straightforward it is we will suppose a the plaintiff b the defendant a brings his action by bill action you know means this actio nihil aliud est quam jus prosequendi injudicium quod sibi debelur or a right of prosecuting to judgment for what is due to ones self b is and was supposed to be in the custody of the marshal observe supposed to be for very likely b is walking unmolested in his garden or what not b we will say happens to live in surrey kent or any other county except middlesex and is supposed to have made his escape though perhaps he may have broken his leg and never have been out of his own door and then the latitat supposes that a bill had issued and further supposes that it has been returned non est inventus and moreover supposes it to have been filed b lives in kent you know and this latitat is addressed in supposition to the sheriff of the county greeting though as to the sheriff he neither sees hears nor knows any thing concerning it and informs him that b notwithstanding he is confined to his bed by a broken leg runs up and down in supposition and secretes himself in the sheriffs county of kent on which i beg your pardon i cannot follow you through all this labyrinth of supposes no then you will never do for a lawyer for i have but just begun i should carry you along an endless chain of them every link of which is connected and which chain is frequently strong enough to bind and imprison both plaintiff and defendant certainly or the law would be as dead in its spirit as it is in its letter i fear i shall never get all the phrases and forms of law by rote why no if you did heaven help you it would breed a fine confusion in your brain you would become as litigious and as unintelligible as our friend stradling mr stradling said hilary is one of my clients an unfortunate man who being a lawprinter has in the way of trade read so many lawbooks and accustomed himself to such a peculiar jargon as to imagine that he is a better lawyer than any of us so that he has halfruined himself by litigation he is to dine with us and will soon be here i will provoke him continued trottman to afford you a sample of his gibberish you may then examine what degree of instruction you suppose may be obtained from a heterogeneous topsyturvy mass of law phrases but why irritate your friend you mistake he has it so eternally on his tongue that instead of giving him pain to shew the various methods in which he supposes he could torment an antagonist at law it affords him the highest gratification our friend hilary here is better qualified for the task of instruction but he feels some of your qualms and is now and then inclined to doubt that there is vice in the glorious system which regulates all our actions i deny that it regulates them said hilary if people in general had no more knowledge of right and wrong than they have of law their actions would indeed be wretchedly regulated this was a sagacious remark it made an impression upon me that was not forgotten it suggested the important truth that the pretensions of law to govern are ridiculous and that men act as hilary justly affirmed well or ill according to their sense of right and wrong mr stradling soon after came and trottman very artfully led him into a dispute on a supposed case which trottman pretended to defend and aggravated him by contradiction till stradling roundly affirmed his opponent knew nothing of conducting a suit at law the volubility of this gentleman was extraordinary and the trouble i thought myself obliged to bestow at that time on the subject could alone have enabled me to remember any part of the jargon he uttered in opposition to trottman which in substance was as follows give me leave to tell you friend trottman you know nothing of the matter and i should be very glad i could provoke you to meet me in westminsterhall if i had you but in the courts damn me if you should easily get out i tell you once more i would not leave you a coat to your back you lord help you i would traverse your indictment demur to your plea bring my writ of error nonsuit you sir i would ca sa fi fa you i would bar you i would latitat you replevin you refalo you i would have my non est inventus my alias and pluries and pluries and pluries ad infinitum i would have you in trover in detinue i would send your loving friend richard roe to you i would eject you i would make you confess lease entry and ouster i would file my bill of middlesex or my latitat with an ac etiam nay i would be a worse plague to you still i would have my bill filed in br i would furnish you with a special original for cp you talk i would sue out my capias alias and pluries at once and outlaw you before you should hear one word of the proceeding bless me thought i what innumerable ways there are of reducing a man to beggary and destruction according to law trottman thus provokingly continued my dear mr stradling your brain is bewildered you go backward and forward from one supposition to another and from process to process till you really dont know what you say if i were your opponent in any court in the kingdom i should certainly make the law provide you a lodging for the rest of your life bring your action thats all bring your action and observe how finely i will nonpros you or reduce you to a nolle prosequi you think yourself knowing pshaw i have nonsuited fifty more cunning fellows in my time and shall do fifty more god help them thought i i have laid many a pert put by the heels you pretend to carry an action through the courts with me why sir i have helped to ruin three men of a thousand a year and am in a fair way at this very hour of doing as much for a baronet of five times the property i listened in astonishment and do you take a pleasure in remembering this said hilary pleasure answered stradling staring why do you think mr hilary i should have taken a pleasure in ruining myself what did i do but act according to the laws of my country and if men will oppose me and pretend to understand those laws better than i do let them pay for their ignorance and their presumption let them respect the law or let their brats go beg the law i find sir said i has no compassion compassion indeed no sir compassion is a fool and the law is wise in itself i hope it is but i own i doubt the wisdom of its practice but this practice you must know said trottman with a wink to stradling mr trevor means to reform oh replied stradling then i suppose when the gentleman is at the bar he will never accept a brief till he has first examined the equity of the case that sir i replied is my firm intention ha ha ha mr trevor you are a young man you will know better in time and do you imagine sir that i will ever hire myself to chicanery and be the willing promoter of fraud if i do may i live hated and die despised ay ay very true i dont remember that i ever met with a youth who had just begun to keep his terms who did not profess much the same and which is well worthy of remark those that have been most vehement in these professions have been most famous when they came to the bar for undertaking and gaining the rottenest causes you shall find however sir that i shall be an exception to this rule excuse me mr trevor for not too hastily crediting hasty assertions i know mankind as well as i know the law however i can only tell you that if your practice keep pace with your professions you will never be lord chief justice do the judges then encourage barristers who undertake the defence of bad and base actions to be sure they do they sometimes shake their heads and look grave but we know very well they defended such themselves or as i tell you they would never have been judges if two men have a dispute one of them must be in the wrong and who is able to pronounce which except the law my dear mr stradling said trottman you are again out of your depth when two men dispute it almost always happens that they are both in the wrong and this is the glorious resource of law and the refuge of its counsellors and its judges trottman and stradling were accustomed to each others manner and notwithstanding the language they used nothing more was meant than a kind of jocular sparring which would now and then forget itself for a moment and become waspish but would recollect and recover its temper the next sentence i replied to trottmanit is true that when two men dispute it generally happens they are both in the wrong but one is always more in the wrong than the other and it should be the business of lawyers to examine and of the law to decide upon their different degrees of error what sir exclaimed stradling if you were counsel in a cause for plaintiff a instead of exposing the blunders and wrongs of defendant b would you enquire into those of your own client i would enquire impartially into both and if you knew any circumstance which would infallibly insure plaintiff a nonsuit you would declare it to the court i would declare the truth and the whole truth heres doctrine heres law no said trottman it is not law it is reform it ought to be law as an advocate i am a man who hire out my knowledge and talents for the avowed purpose of doing justice and am to consider neither plaintiff nor defendant but justice only otherwise i should certainly be the vilest of rascals heyday thundered stradling and after a pause addedit is my opinion those words are liable to a prosecution mr trevor and by g if you were to be cast in any one of our courts for them it would be no fault either of the bench or the bar if the sentence of the law which you are defaming did not shut you up for life my friend trevor mistakes the nature of the profession he is studying added trottman he forgets that the question before a court is not what is this that or the other which he may think proper to call justice but what is the law to be sure sir continued stradling it is that which as a lawyer you must attend to and that only i will cite you an example said trottman a was a gentleman of great landed property b was an impertinent beggarly kind of sturdy fellow his neighbour a had an estate in the county of that lay in a ringfence a meadow of nine acres excepted which belonged to b this meadow it was convenient for a to purchase and he sent his steward who was an attorney to make proposals b rejected them the steward advised a to buy the estate that belonged to c but that was farmed by b the advice was followed the lease of b expired the following year and a new one was denied by a unless b would sell his meadow b consented a bought the meadow but determined to have his revenge for this purpose a refused payment and provoked b to commence an action the law he knew very well was on the side of b but that was of little consequence plaintiff b brought his action in trinity term defendant a pleaded a sham plea asserted plaintiff had been paid for his meadow by a firkin of butter all a lie you know long vacation was thus got over and next term defendant files a bill in chancery to stay proceedings at law plaintiff b files his answer and gets the injunction dissolved but a had his writ ready and became plaintiff in error carried it through all the courts from kb to the exchequerchamber and from the exchequerchamber as a very well knew that b had no more money a brought error into parliament by which b was obliged to drop proceedings his attorney of course would not stir a step further and the fool was ruined he was afterward arrested by his attorney for payment of bill in arrear and he now lies in prison on the debtorsside of newgate how you stare mr trevor added stradling every word true we all know a great lord who has carried i cannot tell how many such causes and were the judges said i acquainted with the whole of these proceedings how could they be ignorant of them judgment had passed against defendant a in all the courts and did they afford the plaintiff no protection they protect why mr trevor you imagine yourself in turkey telling your tale to a cady who decides according to his notions of right and wrong and not pleading in the presence of a bench of english judges who have twice ten thousand volumes to consult as their guides which leave them no opinion of their own it is their duty to pronounce sentence as the statutebooks direct or as in the case i have cited according to precedent time immemorial and this is what you call law ay and sound law too why then damn the you do right to stop short sir it appears to me that i am travelling in a cursed dirty as well as thorny road said i with a sigh why to own the truth added trottman you must meet with a little splashing and unless you can turn back and look at it with unconcern i should scarcely advise you to proceed i shall certainly reconsider the subject a pair of lawyers like a pair of legs are apt to bespatter each other but they nevertheless remain good friends and brothers if you send your spaniel into a muddy pool you ought to take care when he comes out that he does not shake the filth he has collected over his master i wonder sir that you should continue one of a profession which you treat with such unsparing severity and i sir do not wonder at your wonderings life is a long road and he must have travelled a very little way indeed who expects that it should be all a bowlinggreen pursue your route in which direction you will law trade physic or divinity and prove to me that you will never have occasion to shake off the dust from your feet in testimony against it and i will then pause and consider you are of the sect of the perfectibles and you of the cast of the standstills oh no i conceive myself to be among children at a fair riding in a roundabout like the globe they inhabit men are continually in motion but they can never pass their circle and do you suppose you know the limits of your circle within a trifle the experience of states empires and ages has decided that question with tolerable accuracy but what if a power should have arisen of which you have not had the experience of states empires and ages except of a very small number and what if this partial experience as far as it goes should entirely overthrow your hypothesis i know that in argument your if is a very renowned potentate if the moon should happen to be a cheese it may some time or another chance to fall about our ears in a shower of maggots but what is this mighty power that has done so much in so short a time and from which you expect so many more miracles it is the art of printing when knowledge was locked up in egyptian temples or secreted by indian bramins for their own selfish traffic it was indeed difficult to increase this imaginary circle of yours but no sooner was it diffused among mankind by the discovery of the alphabet than in a short period it was succeeded by the wonders of greece and rome and now that its circulation is facilitated in so incalculable a degree who shall be daring enough to assert his puny standard is the measure of all possible futurity i am amazed sir that a man of your acuteness your readiness of wit and your strength of imagination can persist in such an affirmative the argumentum ad hominem very sweet and delectable thank you sir every thing is subject to change why not therefore to improvement that change is inevitable there are proofs look where you will that which is called innovation must consequently be indispensible examine the history of your own science when england was infested with wolves we are told that king edgar imposed an annual tribute of thirty wolves heads on the welsh princes that the breed might be extirpated had this tribute been levied after the race was partly destroyed the law would have counteracted its own intention for in order to pay the tax the tributary princes must have encouraged the breed and once more have stocked the country with wolves stradling was little better than infected with what have been lately stigmatised by the appellation of jacobinical principles and exclaimed with great exultationyour remark is very true sir and it is an example that will serve admirably well to illustrate another point placemen and pensioners a race more ravenous and infinitely more destructive than wolves have been propagated for the support of the executive government and the breed increases so rapidly that it will very soon devour its feeders and next itself with all my heart let me but see that vermin extirpated and i shall die in peace very right mr stradling said trottman with great gravity placemen and pensioners are vile vermin and so will remain till your party comes into office if ever i could be brought to accept of place or pension may i i believe you for i am well persuaded your virtue will never be put to the trial otherwise i should imagine it would find as many good arguments i mean precedents in favour of the regular practice in politics as in law here our dialogue paused dinner was announced and law politics and patriotism were for a while forgotten by all except myself in the enjoyments of venison and old port chapter ii more painful doubts and further enquiries unexpected encouragement and warm affections from a character before supposed to be too cold hope strengthened and confirmed desultory as the conversation i have recited had been it left a very deep impression upon my mind it was roundly asserted by every lawyer to whom i put the question that the whole and sole business of a counsellor was the defence of his client right or wrong it was his duty to gain his cause and with respect to the justice of it into that generally speaking it was impossible that he should enquire briefs were frequently put into his hand as he entered the court which he was to follow as instructed it did now and then happen that a cause was so infamous as to put even the hacknied brow of a barrister to the blush but it must be a vile one indeed and even then when he threw up his brief though paid before he began to plead it was matter of admiration to meet so disinterested an example of virtue in an advocate it was in the practice of the law that i hoped to have taken refuge against the arguments of turl which averse as i had been to listen proved even to me that in principle it was not to be defended the train of thinking that followed these deductions was so very painful that i was obliged to fly from them and seek advice and confirmation in the friendship of wilmot before i should write on the subject to mr evelyn for the latter task indeed my mind was not yet sufficiently calm collected and determined my chief consolation was that the subject had thus been strongly brought to the test of enquiry before the expiration of the month which according to agreement i was to be with counsellor ventilate previous to the payment of my admissionfee of which as it was a heavy one thus to have robbed the charities of mr evelyn would have given me excessive anguish i know not whether i was sorry or glad when i came to wilmots lodging to find turl there he had returned from his bathing excursion having been called back sooner than he expected by his affairs he was cheerful and in excellent spirits his complexion was clear his health improved and his joy at our meeting was evident and unaffected he even owned that hearing i had devoted myself to the law he had returned thus soon the more willingly once again to argue the question with me for that he felt himself very highly interested in the future employment of talents of which he had conceived extraordinary hopes and that he thought it impossible they should be devoted to such a confusing study were there no other objection to it as that of the law without being not only perverted and abused but in a great degree stifled after an avowal like this it required an effort in me to summon up my resolution and honestly state the doubts and difficulties that had arisen in my own mind it was happy for me that my friends were men whose habitual sincerity prompted me to a similar conduct i therefore took courage opened my heart and while describing my own sensations was impelled to confess that the practice of the law could with great difficulty indeed be reconciled to the principles of undeviating honesty i most sincerely rejoice said turl that these doubts have been suggested to you by other people rather than by me for i am very desirous you should not continue to think me too prone to censure and in addition to them i would have you take a retrospect of your plan to induce you to despond is a thing which i would most sedulously avoid but to suffer you to delude yourself with the hopes of sudden wealth and when i say sudden i would give you a term of ten years from the practice of the law unless you should plunge into that practice with the most unqualified disregard to all that rectitude demands would be to act the cowardly disingenuous hypocrite and entirely to forget the first and best duties of friendship should you askwhat path then am i to pursue i own i am totally at a loss for an answer the choice must be left to yourself you are not ignorant that it is infinitely more easy to point out mistakes which have been and still continue to be committed daily than to teach how they may be entirely avoided of this i am well assured if you will confide in and exert those powers of mind that you possess they must lead you to a degree of happiness of the enjoyment of which i am sorry to say but few are capable from my own experience and from that of all the young men i meet who are thrown upon the world i find that the period which is most critical and full of danger is the one during which they are obliged unsupported to seek a grateful and worthy way of employing their talents my own resource has been that of cheerfully submitting to what are called the hardships of obscure poverty and of consoling myself not only with a firm persuasion that by this course in time i shall infallibly change the scene but that till this time shall come i am employing myself on the subjects which can best afford me present satisfaction that is in endeavours however narrow and feeble to enlarge the boundaries of human happiness and by means like these to find a sufficiency for my own support i know not that i ought to advise you to pursue a similar plan though i can truly say i am unacquainted with any other which is equally promising how to answer or appease the imperious demands of your present ruling passion i cannot devise neither can i say that i am convinced it is blameable except in its excess that you should desire to obtain so rare and inestimable a treasure as that of a woman who not to insist upon her peculiar beauty is possessed of the high faculties with which she whom you love is affirmed to be endowed is an ambition which my heart knows not how to condemn as unworthy there is something in it so congenial to all my own feelings that to see you united to her would give me inexpressible pleasure you will perhaps be surprised to hear me own that notwithstanding the obstacles are so numerous that i have no perception of the manner in which they are to be overcome i yet rejoice with you that you have discovered such a woman that she has assuredly a rooted affection for you and that you have thus obtained one advantage over all your friends a strong and unconquerable motive to outstrip them in your efforts shall i add that desperate as your case seems to be i participate in your sanguine hopes i do not deem them entirely romantic but share in that which the phlegmatic would call the frenzy of your mind and halfpersuade myself that you will finally be victorious then summon up your fortitude do not suffer the failure of illconcerted plans either to lessen your ardour or give it a rash and dangerous direction be cool in decision warm in pursuit and unwearied in perseverance time is a never failing friend to those who have the discernment to profit by the opportunities he offers let your eye be on the alert and your hand active and firm as circumstances shall occur and i shall then say i scarcely know what it is that you may not hope to achieve wilmot stood with his head resting on his arm leaning against the mantlepiece when turl began his eye was cast down a compassionate melancholy overspread his countenance and a deep sigh broke from him unperceived by himself as our mutual friend proceeded his attitude altered his head was raised his eye brightened his features glowed his soul was wrapt in the visions which were raised by turl and unconscious of his own existence or that he spoke his interrupting ejaculations now and then involuntarily burst forththat is truewell argueddo you think soindeedi am glad of thatdont despond trevor dont despondtis folly to despond just as he repeated the last sentence tis folly to despond so full a remembrance of his former trains of thought came over him and there was so divine a mixture of hope and melancholy in his face which seemed so to reproach himself and to encourage me that divided as my feelings were between the generous emanations of turl and these torrents of affection from a man who had suffered so deeply i seized the hand of each pressed them both to my heart instantly dropped them again covered my face fell against the wall and sobbed with something like hysteric passion of all the pleasures of which the soul is capable those of friendship for man and love for woman are the most exquisite they may be described asthe comprehensive principle of benevolence which binds the whole human race to aid and love each other individualized and put into its utmost state of activity selfishness may deride them and there may be some so haunted by suspicion or so hardened in vice as to doubt or deny their existence but he that has felt them in their fullest force has the best as well as the grandest standard of human nature and the purest foretaste of the joys that are in store for the generations that are to come this is the spirit that is to harmonize the world and give reality to those ideal gardens of paradise and ages of gold the possibility of which as the records of fable shew could scarcely escape even savage ignorance what clue shall i give the reader to my heart that shall lead him into its recesses and enable him to conceive its entire sensations that turl from whom i imagined i had met so much discouragement whose scrutinizing eye led him to examine with such severity and whose firm understanding possessed such powers of right decision that he should not only sympathize with me but partake in my best hopes and countenance me in my souls dearest pursuit that turl should feel and act thus was a joy inconceivably great and unexpected he now no longer appeared to me as one to whom though i could not but revere him i durst not confess myself but as a generous anxious and tender friend my former flashes of hope had usually been succeeded by a gloomy despair that made me half suspect myself to be frantic but after this concession and encouragement from turl they seemed instantly to spring into consistency probability and system turl highly approved my forbearance and caution respecting the letter i had written and was so anxious to convey to olivia this farther coincidence of opinion not only induced me to persevere in my plan but afforded me a degree of grateful satisfaction and selfrespect that was exceedingly consolatory chapter iii more traits of the character of mr evelyn a new project of a very flattering nature borough interest and a patriotic baronet it may well be supposed that turl was induced to enquire and i to explain the means by which i should have been enabled to pursue the study of the law for he had heard of my misfortunes and the dissipation of my finances this brought the behaviour and character of mr evelyn in review and the admiration of turl with the terms of affection and respect in which he spoke of that gentleman was additional delight he had never entertained any serious doubt he said but that such men existed perhaps many of them yet to discover a single one was an unexpected and to say the truth a very uncommon pleasure but mr evelyn was to be made acquainted with my change of sentiment and of my being once more destitute of any plan for my future guidance it was necessary that he should not deem me a man of unsettled principles frivolous in propensity and fantastic in conduct for though perhaps my pride would have felt gratification at no longer considering myself a dependent on the favourable opinion or calculations which another might form concerning me and my good or ill qualities yet i could not endure to sink in his esteem i therefore applied myself immediately in the most assiduous manner to collect and state such facts as i had gathered relative to the practice of the law and that the argument might be placed in the clearest light possible i begged of turl to take that part of the subject which related to its principles upon himself thus provided i wrote to mr evelyn and my letter was fortunate enough to produce its desired effect nor was he satisfied with mere approbation his anxious and generous friendship would not suffer him to rest and he immediately made a journey to town to consult with me since this project was rejected what should be my new pursuit his behaviour verified all the assertions of his former discourse concerning the hopes that he had conceived of my talents he considered nothing within the scope of his fortune as too great a sacrifice if it could but promote the end he desired for this purpose he not only consulted with wilmot and turl but led me into such conversations as might best display the bent of my genius and afford him hints on which to act and now he was induced to form a design such as i little expected and which required of me the acceptance of obligations so great as well might stagger me and render it difficult for me to consent he had remarked that my enunciation was clear and articulate my language flowing my voice powerful and my manner prepossessing such were the terms which he used in describing these qualities in me the youthful manliness of my figure he said added to the properties i have mentioned was admirably adapted for parliamentary oratory my elocution and deportment were commanding and principles such as mine might awe corruption itself into respect and aid to rouse a nation and enlighten a world mr evelyn like myself was very much of an enthusiast he did not immediately communicate the project to me which was indeed first suggested to him by accidental circumstances but previously examined whether it was as he supposed it to be possible to be carried into effect sir barnard bray had the nomination of two borough members one of which he personated himself and disposed of the other seat as is the custom to a candidate who should be of his party and consequently vote according to his opinion he had long been the loud and fast friend of opposition no man was more determined in detecting error more hot in his zeal or more vociferous in accusation than sir barnard his dear and intimate friend the right honourable mr abstract excepted who was indeed pepper or rather gunpowder itself mr evelyn was the cousin of this patriotic baronet it happened just then to be the eve of a general election and as the last member of sir barnard had been so profligate or so patriotic as the worthy member himself repeatedly and solemnly declared he was as to vote with the minister who had previously given him a place and promised to secure his return for a treasury borough mr evelyn knowing these circumstances was persuaded that the baronet would be happy to find a representative for his constituents whose eloquence added to his own should avenge him on the minister if not tumble him from the throne he had usurped mr evelyn and the baronet were on intimate terms for sir barnard took a particular pleasure in every man who perfectly agreed with him in opinion and though this definition would not accurately apply to mr evelyn yet on the great leading points in politics they seldom differed as to morals as a science sir barnard on many occasions would affect to treat it with that commonplace contempt which always accompanies the supposition of the original and unconquerable depravity of man of the verity of which the baronet had a rooted conviction in this hypothesis he was but confirmed by his burgagetenure voters by the conduct of the members he had himself returned and by certain propensities which he felt in his own breast and which he seriously believed to be instinctive in man beside if mr evelyn differed at any time in opinion with a disputant the suavity of his manners was so conciliatory that opposition from him was sometimes better received than agreement and coincidence from other people this suavity by the by is a delightful art would it were better understood and more practised chapter iv sage remarks on the seduction of young orators the influence of the crown and the corruption of our glorious constitution old and new nobility poor old england necessary precautions the man with an impenetrable face full of the project he had conceived mr evelyn visited the baronet who happened to be in town and proposed it to him in the manner which he thought might most prepossess him in my favour sir barnard listened attentively and paused it happened that he had lately been meditating on the danger of introducing young orators into parliament for he had found by experience that they are so marketable a commodity as to be almost certain of being bought up the trick he had himself been played was bitterly remembered and he had known and heard of several instances during his parliamentary career of a similar kind yet he could not but recollect that when he and his former spokesman had entered the house arm in arm there was a sort of buzz and a degree of respect paid to him which had instantly diminished as soon as this support was gone there is something of dignity in the use of crutches and he that cannot walk alone commands attention from his imbecility i do not know what to think of this plan said the baronet i find your flowery speakers are no more to be depended upon in the present day than the oldest drudges in corruption you know cousin how i hate corruption it is undoing us all it will undo the nation the influence of the crown is monstrous the aristocracy is degraded by annual batches of mundungus and parchment lords and the constitution is tumbling about our ears the old english spirit is dead the nation has lost all sense and feeling the people are so vile and selfish that they are bought and sold like swine to which for my part i think they have been very properly compared there is no such thing now as public virtue no no that happy time is gone by every man is for all he can get and as for the means he cares nothing about them there is absolutely no such thing as patriotism existing and to own the truth damn me if i believe there is a man in the kingdom that cares one farthing for those rights and liberties about which so many people that you and i know pretend to bawl this is a severe supposition indeed it implicates your dearest and most intimate friends only recollect sir barnard what would your feelings be if the same thing should be asserted of you of me truly no no cousin evelyn i think i have been pretty tolerably tried the minister knows very well he could move the monument sooner than me i love the people and am half mad to see that they have no love for themselves why do not they meet why do not they petition why do not they besiege the throne with their clamors they are no better than beasts of burthen if they were any thing else the whole kingdom would rise as one man and drive this arrogant upstart from the helm i say mr evelyn i love the people i love my country i love the constitution and i hate the swarms of mushroom peers and petty traders that are daily pouring in upon us to overturn it was it weakness of memory was it the blindness of egotism or was it inordinate stupidity that sir barnard should forget as he constantly did that his father had been a common porter in a warehouse had raised an immense fortune by trade had purchased the boroughs which descended to his son and had himself been bought with the title of baronet by a former minister was it so very long ago that sir barnard with such a swell of conscious superiority should begin to talk of the antiquity of his family but above all how did he happen not to recollect that the disappointment which now preyed upon and cankered his heart was the refusal of a peerage i really can give no satisfactory answer to these questions i can only state a fact which daily occurs in a thousand other instances mr evelyn brought the baronet back to the point and remarked to him that at the present period when the minister was so powerful in numbers to bring in a mere yes and no member with himself would be a certain mode of not serving the country the constitution and the people whom he so dearly loved that the safety which is derived from a mans insignificance is but a bad pledge and that he thought himself very certain i was as dear nay and as incorruptible a lover of old england or at least of the welfare of mankind as sir barnard himself shew me such a man cousin exclaimed the baronet and i will worship him i will worship him mr evelyn i will worship him but i am persuaded he is not to be found i have learned from too fatal experience that i am certain of nobody but myself small as the number in opposition is if they were but all as soundhearted as i am and would set their shoulders to the wheel and lay themselves out for the good of their country as i do i say it mr evelyn and take my word for it i say true we should overturn the minister and his corrupt gang in six months nay in half the time however as you are so strongly persuaded of the soundness of the gentlemans principles whom you recommend let me see him and talk to him and then i will tell you more of my opinion there is one point sir barnard on which i suppose i need not insist it is so obvious what is that cousin you being as you state a man of principle and incapable of being biassed to act against what you conceive to be the good of the nation you must expect that every man who resembles you in patriotism and fortitude will act from himself and will resist any attempt to control him oh as to that we need say nothing about it those things are never mentioned nowadays they are perfectly understood but who is your young friend is he a man of property no he will be the more manageable thought sir barnard where will he get a qualification i will provide him with one you say he is a gentleman as i understand the term he certainly is for in addition to those manners and accomplishments which are most pleasing to the world he not only possesses a good education but a sense of justice which makes him regard every man as his brother and which will neither suffer him to crouch to the haughty nor trample on the poor why that is very good very right i myself will crouch to no man and as for modesty and humility in the youth of the present day why they are very rarely found and so i shall be happy to meet with them nay but mr trevor delivers his sentiments with rather an unguarded freedom and with peculiar energy or indeed he would be ill qualified to rise in the assembly of which i wish to see him a member and undauntedly oppose the arrogant assertions that are there daily made arrogant g confound me mr evelyn if i am not sometimes struck dumb with what i hear in that house there is that scotchman in particular who will get up after our allies have been defeated our troops driven like sheep from swamp to swamp where they die of the rot and our ships carried by hundreds into the enemys ports and will roundly assert notwithstanding these facts are as notorious as his own political profligacy that our victories are splendid our armies undiminished and our trade protected and flourishing beyond all former example he makes my hair stand on end to hear him and when i look in his face and see the broad familiar easy impudence with which he laughs at me and all of us for our astonishment why as i tell you damn me if i am not dumbfounded i am struck all of a heap i have not a word i am choaked with rage and amazement compared to him your brothelkeeper is a modest person were but our fortresses as impenetrable as his forehead curse me if they would ever be taken he is bombproof the returns that lie on the table can make no impression upon him and you may see him sneer and laugh if they are pointed to in the course of an argument in short cousin evelyn the nation is ruined i see that clear enough our constitution will soon be changed to a pure despotism barracks are building soldiers line our streets our commission of the peace is filled with the creatures of a corrupt administration constables are only called out to keep up the farce and we are at present under little better than a military government though mr evelyn would have been better satisfied had sir barnards sense of national grievances been equally strong but less acrimonious yet he was pleased to find that these grievances were now more than ever become a kind of commonplace bead roll of repetitions of which their being so familiarly run over by the baronet was sufficient proof for a people that are continually talking of the evils that afflict them are not as sir barnard and others have supposed dead to these evils the nation that remarks discusses and complains of its wrongs will finally have them redressed chapter v serious doubts on serious subjects personal qualms and considerations an interview with sir barnard fears and precautions or a burnt child dreads the fire what farther passed in the conversation i have recited was of little moment except that an appointment was made on the following day for me to be introduced to the baronet thus far successful mr evelyn returned and as he was a man of a firm and ingenuous mind he thought it adviseable to hold a consultation with me and my friends on the prosecution of his plan that personal considerations might in no degree influence the enquiry he first proposed the question without intimating to what it might lead ofhow far it became a virtuous man to accept a seat on those conditions under which a seat only can be obtained among the representatives of the people without wearying the reader with the arguments that were adduced let it suffice to inform him that we all agreed it was a very doubtful case that in this as in numerous other instances manners customs and laws obliged us to conform to many things which were odiously vicious and that to live in society and rigidly observe those rules of justice which would best promote the general happiness was speaking absolutely a thing impossible whether the greatest political characters would best fulfil their duties by refusing to submit to the corrupt influence of elections to testoaths and to the mischiefs of ministerial management within the walls or whether they ought to comply with them and exert their utmost faculties in pointing out these evils and endeavouring to have them redressed was a point on which we all seemed to think the wisest men might suspend their judgment in one thing we appeared to be entirely agreed which was that such pernicious practices were in all probability more frequently exposed and brought into public discussion through the medium of an assembly like this than they would be did no such assembly exist neither must i detail what afterward passed before i was brought to accept the proposal of mr evelyn it would be tedious this proposal did not confine itself to the single act of giving me a seat in parliament and of furnishing me with a qualification it insisted that the qualification should be a real and not a fictitious deed to accept the actual possession of three hundred ayear as a bounty for which i could make no return was i own humiliating to my pride it made the question continually recurwhether it did not give me the air of an impostor a kind of swindler of sentiment a pretender to superior virtue for the purpose of gratifying vice it seemed at a blow to rob me of all independence and leave me a manacled slave to the opinions not only of mr evelyn but by a kind of consignment of his relation the baronet and even to both their humours in fine it was a most painful sacrifice and required all the amenity and active friendship of mr evelyn to bring to my mind not only my duties but the power that i should have at any time of resigning my seat returning the deeds and sheltering myself in my primitive poverty to this i added a condition without which my refusal would have been absolute it was that i should give a deed of mortgage bearing interest to the full value of the lands assigned i shall forbear to dwell on sensations that were very active at the moment which on one hand related to all that concerned mr evelyn my obligations and something like dependence and on the other to my sudden promised elevation toward the sphere in which my ambition was so eagerly desirous to move neither will i insist on that which caused my heart to beat yet more high the approach that i thus made to the lovely object of all my wishes leaving this endless train of meditation i proceed to relate events as they occurred i attended mr evelyn according to appointment and paid my respects to his cousin sir barnard having engaged myself thus far i own i was sufficiently piqued to desire to make a favourable impression in which i was almost as successful as i myself had hoped at the first sight of me the baronet was prepossessed and when we entered into conversation and he gave me an opportunity of uttering my sentiments concerning men and measures i painted so forcibly that he was almost in raptures the only circumstance in which i failed was my frequent interruption and impatience when he in turn began to declaim i had the vice of orators i heard no mans arguments or language that pleased me so well as my own i could not listen without an irritating anxiety that was for ever prompting me to supply a word suggest a thought or detect a blunder and to a man who loves to make a speech it is intolerably mortifying to hear himself corrected and cut short in the middle of a sentence however i was sufficiently guarded not to give any offence that was strong enough to be remembered and sir barnard was so thoroughly engrossed by the idea of the conspicuous figure which he and his new member should make in the house that he was absolutely impatient to secure me being fully persuaded that he had discovered a treasure of which now at a general election he was in considerable danger of being robbed the only precaution he took was to draw from me repeated asseverations that i would not desert the cause of the people by which as i afterward found he understood his own private opinions and not that which he had literally expressed on this head he seemed never satisfied and the terms in which he spoke both of the member who had deserted him and of all political tergiversation whatever were the bitterest that his memory could supply chapter vi a dinner party and fortune in good humour the opera house and small talk sagacious female discoveries olivia and the art of fascinating an old acquaintance suddenly seen and dreaded though despised timely recollection the opera great room and more discoveries these points settled the baronet proposed to introduce me to his friends and connections particularly of the political kind for this purpose he began with inviting me and mr evelyn to dine with him on the friday following when he was to have a mixed party of ladies and gentlemen but chiefly of such as agreed with him on public affairs when the day came i was presented to the company by the baronet with encomiums and seated on the left of lady bray a scotch lord was on her right it being her ladyships custom to divide the ladies and gentlemen a young fellow properly introduced if he be new in the circles of fashion and possessed of a tolerable figure is in no danger of being ill received i had not indeed learned to be an adept at small talk a qualification which contemptible as it is will supply the want of every superior requisite whether of mind or person but i had an aptitude to oblige be attentive and speak the moment i found i had any thing to say i had laid no plan on this occasion not having then read or not remembering i know not which lord chesterfields sage reflections on the necessity of a statesmans being well with the ladies it happened however that on this occasion i was received with distinguished marks of approbation by the dear angels from several of whom i received visitinginvitations music and the opera were among the topics on which they conversed i was found to be an amateur and lady bray was one of the dilettanti had concerts at her own house and a box at the opera to both of which she said i should at all times have free admission this was too pleasing an offer to be refused and i willingly agreed to attend her ladyship the following evening and hear the charming music of i zingari in fiera by paisiello the opera season began rather early that year many families were not yet come to town we had little delay from the string of coaches and had her ladyship not provided against the misfortune by taking care to go more late than usual we should have been so unfashionable as to have heard the first act as it was we arrived before it was over the thing on which her ladyship bestowed her immediate attention was to examine by the aid of her operaglass which of the subscribers were in their boxes and how many of her particular friends were among them politeness induced me to accompany her in this excursion of the eye for not to have listened to the names titles and ages of her friends with the births deaths marriages creations and presentations at court of them and their families of which materials small talk is chiefly if not wholly composed would have been the very highest defect in good breeding why yes listen i did as long as i was able till my eyes tongue and faculties were all riveted to one spot her ladyships box was near the centre she had carried my eye from box to box completely along one side and had proceeded to about three of the opposite when she directed her glass to one with the owners of which she had no acquaintance but she knew the names of all for she had them engraved on her fan that name was mowbray and the persons in it were hector his aunt and olivia i was silent gazing entranced her ladyship had talked i know not how long and i had neither answered nor heard one word bless me said she mr trevor why you are absolutely in a revery all of a sudden that miss mowbray i find is a very dangerous young lady for i am told that all the men are positively mad after her and here are you absolutely struck speechless what not a word yet i beg ten thousand pardons why this seems like love at first sight you are not acquainted i suppose with the mowbrays yes my lady from my infancy oh oh why then to be sure you are intimate with this beauty who absolutely eclipses us all i assure you she is positively the belle of the day i hear she has the very first offers but you are not silly enough to act the dying swain what no answer well well i see how it is but as we never read in any of the morning papers of gentle youths who break their hearts for love in the present ungallant age you are in no great danger though i think i never saw any creature look more like what i should suppose one of your true lovers to be than you did just now for beside your speechless attitude which was absolutely picturesque and significant you were positively pale and red and red and pale almost as fast as the ticking of my watch and even yet you are absolutely provoking i cannot get a word from you your ladyships raillery quite overpowers me i declare i am positively surprised at what i have seen had a stranger been all of a sudden struck the wonder would not have been absolutely so great but it is positively unaccountable in you who are a familiar acquaintance of the family i cannot boast of that honor no indeed why do not you visit the mowbrays i do not what you are a dangerous man and are forbidden the house well i declare i shall absolutely know your whole history in five minutes without your having positively told me a word your ladyship has a lively imagination i have heard that the aunt is a very cautious chaperon but i tell you what i will be your friend the mowbrays are lately become intimate with two families where i visit and i will absolutely take you with me on one of their public nights i will positively this proposition was so grateful and my thanks were so much more prompt than my recollection that her ladyship was quite confirmed in her surmises and not a little pleased with her own talent at discovery her accusation however was very true all she could positively say could not absolutely draw my attention from the box of olivia whose turns and motions i was anxiously watching hoping that some lucky accident would guide her eye toward me nay i partly hoped and partly feared the same of the aunt my emotions being now influenced by the respectable station which i at present seemed to occupy and now by the remembrance that even this might turn to my disadvantage in the jealous apprehensions of the old lady busied as my thoughts were and absorbed in anxious attention this anxiety was soon overcome by a much more powerful feeling a gentleman entered olivias box my eyes were instantly turned on him recollection was roused my heart beat it surely was he i could not be mistaken my operaglass was applied and my fears confirmed it was indeed the earl of idford here then in a moment the enigma was solved the peer who had aspired to the hand of olivia and who tempted her with all his opulence and all his dignity could be no other than lord idford he had long been intimate with hector and now comes without ceremony and joins the family see how the aunt smiles on him nay mark olivia is attentive to him her lips move her eyes are directed to his she is conversing with him and at her ease while i am racked by all the terrors that jealousy can raise what can she not cast one look this way is she fascinated by a reptile is there no instinctive sympathy that should make her tremble to betray the dearest interests of love in the very presence of the lover does she act complacency and sit calm and unruffled has she no foreboding that i will dart upon that insect that thing which being less than man presumes because it is called lord thinks she that i will not crush tear tread him to dust he the defrauder of my fair fame who plundered me of the first fruits of genius by infamous falsehood who joined in plotting my destruction by arts which the basest cowards blush at is he the fiend that comes to snatch me from bliss and plunge me into pangs and horrors unutterable from these ravings of the mind i was a little recovered by the very serious alarm which the wild changes of my countenance produced in lady bray i apologised pleaded indisposition but presently was lost again in revery fortunately a gentleman of her ladyships acquaintance came into the box and left me to continue my embittered meditations olivia was now attentive to the music and the lord had only her aunt and hector apparently to bestow his conversation upon this was some relief and so far allayed the fever of my mind as to call me back to self examination and to question my own conduct for the earl i could not but have the most rooted contempt i could not compare myself with him and entertain a doubt concerning who ought to be preferred but what reason had i to accuse olivia what did these angry emotions of my soul forebode perhaps that my habitual irritability were she mine would make her miserable what was the end of existence happiness had i not a right then to be happy yes but so had she so had her aunt nay so had that rival odious and despicable as he was whose appearance had raised this tempest in my soul but was constraint was force justifiable in this aunt or in this insignificant this selfish lord force it is said is the law of nature and it is that law which impels the ravenous tiger to spring upon the lamb and suck its blood to appease his craving appetite but if so if selfgratification were a defensible motive the detestable norman robber the monster who inhabited a cave and seized on every stray virgin to deflower murder her and prey on her remains was justifiable in the agitated mind dreams like these are endless while they were passing i stared with fixed attention toward olivia and had she not been almost motionless my passive trances could not have continued the first dance was over the second act had begun more visitors came to pay their respects to lady bray and i endeavoured to recollect myself and shake off a behaviour that might well be construed inattention if not ill manners and might injure me even in that point on which i was then so deeply intent i uttered two or three sentences and her ladyship complimented me on being once more awake the persevering attention of olivia to the scene for it was impossible to forbear glancing at her every moment contributed to calm my fears it did more it was a most beneficial lesson to me it called me again to the consideration of that impetuosity of temper which was so dangerous in me into what acts of frenzy and desperation might not these fevers of the soul hurry me what in the present instance could i urge to justify such excess had i not heard the reproaches of her aunt for her having refused the hand of this lord if this lord it should happen to be when he entered the box what had she done that should excite such frantic ecstacies in me what except return those civilities without which it is impossible for man or woman to be amiable did she now coquet prattle and display her power tempted as she was by such a public scene of triumph was not her demeanour as chastely cautious as my own exigent heart could desire every question that the facts before me suggested was an aggravating reproof of my headlong passions and luckily for me my thoughts took that train which was most corrective and healthful they led me too to dwell with a melting and mild rapture on the endearing virtues of olivia dignified yet not austere firm yet not repulsive circumspect yet capable of all those flowing affections without which circumspection is but meanness nor were these visionary attributes such as the disordered imagination of a lover falsely bestows they were as real as those personal beauties by which they were embellished to aspire to the possession of a woman so gifted and to be the lunatic which my own reproaches at this moment pictured me was to demand that which i did not deserve to be worthy of her it was fit i should resemble her i endeavoured to obey these admonitions i schooled myself concerning my remissness to lady bray i recovered my temper became attentive talked rather pleasantly and reestablished myself in her good graces in which i could perceive i had somewhat declined by the folly of my behaviour to remind the reader on every occasion of the progress of intellect and the benefits derived from experience would be to weary his patience insult his understanding and counteract my own intentions it would suppose in him a total absence of observation and reasoning yet to be entirely silent might lead the young and the inattentive to imagine i had in the beginning proposed a mode of instruction which as i proceeded i had either forgotten abandoned or had not the power to execute if such will attend to the alteration in my conduct they will perceive that i like every other human being could not but reflect more or less on the motives that actuated me and profit by the lessons i received though rooted habits and violent passions were the most difficult to cure after the curtain dropped i accompanied lady bray into the great room and perceived among the throng at some little distance olivia and her aunt attended by the peer i had foreseen the possibility of this and had reasoned that there might be more danger in an abrupt rencontre of this kind than in meeting olivia and her terrible aunt at the house of lady brays friend as her ladyship had promised me where i should receive her countenance and that of the family to which i should be introduced i therefore endeavoured to direct her ladyships attention from the place where the mowbray party was and succeeded in my endeavours soon afterward i saw hector with a knot of fashionable youths among whom i was rather surprised to discover my at that time unknown fatherinlaw belmont i had no inclination to be noticed by this groupe and as lady brays carriage was presently afterward stopping the way i had the good fortune to escape unperceived or at least unaccosted by both parties chapter vii a debt discharged a tavern dinner and a dissertation the man of the world ridiculing the man of virtue or is honesty the best policy fools pay for being flattered security essential to happiness a triumphant retort and difficult to be answered vice inevitable under a vitiated system a dangerous attack or an exhibition of one of the principal arts of a gambler a few cant phrases to the friendship of mr evelyn i had so far subjected myself and the spirit of independence which i was very properly ambitious to cherish as for the present to accept the aid he was so desirous to bestow i was something like compelled to be his debtor but was unwilling to be the debtor of any other man on earth and as he had enabled me to appear in the style i have described and furnished me with money i was determined to seek out belmont and discharge the debt which his bounty had conferred after he had previously plundered me at bath he had sunk in my esteem i now considered him as a professed gambler but i remembered this action as that which it really was an effort of benevolence to aid a human being in distress thus actuated i went the next day to the billiardtable which he had been accustomed to frequent where i once more found him at play he met me not only unabashed but with something like cordiality he had so accustomed himself to his own hypothesis that selfgratification is the law of nature and had so confused a sense of what true selfgratification is with such an active faculty of perverting facts and exhibiting pictures of general turpitude that he had very little sense of the vice of his own conduct and was therefore very little subject to selfreproof he behaved to me with the utmost ease and good humour and when his match was over proposed that we should dine together at the thatchedhouse for a moment i questioned the propriety of assenting but seeing him now as before familiar with the officers of the guards and people of whose company no one was ashamed and recollecting where and how i had seen him the evening before i did not long hesitate beside which i was prompted not only by the pleasure which his conversation gave but by an increase of curiosity to be better acquainted with who and what he really was as soon as we were alone i discharged my conscience by repaying him the twenty pounds this gave occasion to the following dialogue i perceive trevor you are still the same you pique yourself on paying your borrowings had it been a debt of honour indeed i should not have been surprised for those are debts that must be discharged otherwise it would introduce a very inconvenient practice indeed i believe as you say it would be inconvenient beyond description to youwhat do you call yourselvesoh i recollect sporting gentlemen is the phrase it would be inconvenient i say to you sporting gentlemen whom when we sporting gentlemen are absent you call blacklegs rooks grecians and other pleasant epithets some such word i could perceive was quivering on your tongue you remember the plucking you had at bath and though you are too much ashamed of having been duped to mention it yet it remains on your mind with a feeling of resentment that is natural but it is foolish is it foolish to have a sense of right and wrong where is that sense to be found who has it i have continually a sense if so you please to call it that there is something which i want and by that i am impelled to act true but locke i think tells us that crime consists in not taking sufficient time to consider before we act and begging his pardon wise as in a certain sense i allow you this locke was in the instance you have cited he was an ass if i do not mistake he has before proved to me that i cannot act without a motive and then he bids me stop when i am in such a hurry that no motive occurs to my memory according to this an actual murderer is not a more guilty man than he who only dreams that he commits murder make what you will of the inference but it is accurate they are both dead asleep to any ideas except those that hurry them forward that is in plain english there is no such thing as vice might you not as well have said as virtue speaking absolutely i do not pretend to deny what you assert but you will not tell me that the man who robs me and leaves me bound to a tree in danger of starving has not done me an injury will you be kind enough to shew me who it is among those who have any thing to lose that does not rob men who enjoy the pleasures of life rob those who are deprived of them of their due and according to my apprehension the latter have a right to make reprisals upon my soul belmont you have a most inveterate habit of confounding every thing that should guide and regulate mankind you shift the question confound terms and are the most desperate gladiator of vice i ever encountered your dangerous genius is a mine where the ore is rich indeed but the poisonous vapour that envelopes it deadly each to his system we have both the voyage of life to make you place that very sober and discreet person called honesty at the helm by the single direction of whom you expect to attain happiness which is just as rational as to hope to circumnavigate the globe with one wind i take a different course it is my maxim to shift my sails and steer as pleasure and interest bid acting as you do i cannot wonder that you should make a jest of honesty upon my honour i treated sir honesty with every possible decorum till i found that the insidious rascal was making a jest of me not that i am quite certain i am not more truly the friend of this very respectable person than those who pretend they are always in his company for i neither cant with madam morality nor pray with dame methodism though i cannot but think i am almost as religious as moral ay and as charitable too as your devotees and sabbathkeepers who go to church to pray and be saved and leave their servants to stay at home roast the meat and be damned i must again repeat you have the most active fertility at embroiling all order and system i have any where met with ha ha ha order and system are very pretty words but you make a small mistake it is not i that embroil i find confusion already established and since i cannot correct it give me a reason why i ought not to profit by the chaotic hubbub but i say you can correct it you are one of the men who might have been best fitted for the task i know not what i might have been but i feel that i am not the first right of man ay and to talk in your own idiom the first moral duty too is to be happy and he is an idiot that having a banquet spread before him forbears to taste because he himself is not the purveyor what matters it to me how it came there why am i to be excluded have i not as exquisite a relish as he that provided for the bill of fare let dull fools puzzle their brain concerning moral fitness which they have not elevation enough of mind to understand give me enjoyment let me eat the pine apple while they are discussing the moral fitness of feasting on such luxuries this doctrine would subject the world to your appetites and pleasures and is not that a noble doctrine it is the wish and passion of the world to be gulled and gulled let it be let it have its enjoyments give me mine one man is my banker and is assiduously careful to keep cash at my command which he transfers to me in the most gentlemanlike and honourable manner imaginable namely by a box and dice another is my steward and he lays out my grounds stocks my park with deer builds me palaces erects me hothouses and torments heaven and earth to furnish my table with delicacies for all of which i pay him in the current coin of flattery it is true i permit him to call these things his own but the real enjoyment of them is notoriously mine he poor egotist talks bombast and nonsense by wholesale i applaud and smile at his folly while he imagines it is at his wit the poor man is amused with fine speeches unsubstantial flatteries cringes bows and hypocritical tokens of servility which are so many jests upon him thus is he mocked with the shadow while i banquet upon the substance i bask in arbours and groves without once having given myself a thought concerning planting or pruning i feast on the fish without so much as the trouble of catching them and still less of constructing the pond by the provision he makes that is by avarice and extortion he nurtures a brood of sycophants and slaves wife children friends servants all have the same character only differently shaded except that if any of them can become his tyrants and tormentors they all are ready for the task i have studied the noble arts both of tickling and tormenting by which i have subjected this very selfimportant race to my will and pleasure for a man whose acuteness has carried him so very far i am amazed that it did not impel him to advance one step farther happiness is what i and all men desire as certainly as you do but that happiness is of a strange kind and held by a frail and feeble tenure that is agitated by innumerable fears that if the means on which it depends be detected is wholly destroyed and that when lost finds infamy and misery its certain substitutes mark what i say and mark it deeply there can be no happiness without security and there can be no security without sincerity therefore hypocrites of every class are acting contrary to their own intentions they are providing misery for themselves as well as for others instead of the substantial pleasures of which they are in search indeed the lord have mercy then upon all establishments legal political and ecclesiastic let me farther observe to you that the system of general enjoyment which you propose is something if i may so call it more than rational it is dignified it is sublime i feel with you that he is a poor circumscribed egotist who can enjoy nothing but that which he calls his own let me taste every blessing which the hand of nature presents let me banquet with you on her bounties but let me not embitter the delicious repast by fraud that enslaves me to an eternal watchfulness depredation that puts even my life in jeopardy and a system founded in lies and everlastingly haunted by the spectres of selfcontempt our dialogue was interrupted by the entrance of the waiters when we had dined belmont began to enquire concerning my prospects and affairs i expect said he you will be less communicative and open hearted now than you formerly were you have discovered what i never attempted to conceal that my present dependence is on the exercise of talents which your gravity despises especially since they have laid you under contribution this misfortune however had you possessed them despicable as they are you would have escaped yes just as the man who hanged himself last night escaped a headache this morning i will own to you i cannot take the pleasure in your company or think of you with that friendship which i formerly felt for though i find your conversation no less animating like strong liquors it leaves an unwholesome heat behind however i have no objection to inform you that fortune has given me a momentary respite from persecution how soon she may think proper to stretch me on the rack again is more than i can foresee though i greatly suspect her of cruelty and caprice she seems at present to be in one of her best humours and has given me a kind of promise to make me one of the sage legislators of this happy land what do you mean that i shall be a member of the new parliament belmont burst into a violent fit of laughter at first i was at a loss to conjecture why and especially why it should be so long and so unaffected but i soon learned it was a burst of triumph which he could not restrain i congratulate you mr trevor said he with a momentary gravity on your noble and moral pursuitsthe lecture you have been reading as well as those i have formerly heard you read now come upon me with invincible forcethere is no resisting precept thus exemplified by practicehow loud how lofty how sovereign is the contempt in which you hold hypocrisyhow severe will the laws be that you will enact against petty depredatorsi foresee you will hang not only those that handle a card or a dicebox but those that make themthen what honours what rewards what triumphs will you decree to your own wholesale marauders your great captains chosen empowered and paid by yourself and sages no less moral and disinterestedwith what gusto will you send him to swing who commits a single robbery and with what sublime oratory will you exalt the prowess of the man who has plundered starved and exterminated nationsa daniel come to judgment oh wise young judge how do i honor thee i remained speechless a few moments and entirely disconcerted i was irritated though i knew not precisely at what i attempted to answer but was so confused that i talked absolute nonsense after some time however i recollected that my purpose in going into parliament was to counteract all these abuses i then recovered my faculties and urged this plea very emphatically still the moral dignity and virtue of the honourable house i was about to enter dwelt with such force on the imagination of belmont that i could get no reply from him except sarcasms such as those i have repeated with the same intervening fits of laughter as the images suggested themselves to his mind and here lest the reader himself should be misled like belmont i must remark that no mistake is more common and i believe none more pernicious than that of imagining that because man has not attained absolute and perfect virtue the very existence of virtue is doubtful hence it happens that he who in any manner participates in the vices of a nation or a body of men is reproached as if loaded with the whole guilt hence likewise because men without exception are more or less tainted with error all pretensions to superior moral principles are laughed at as false and ridiculous this is the doctrine at least which the people who most offend these principles are the most zealous in propagating belmont had no refuge against selfreproach but in cherishing such trains of thought that the vices which are the most despised in society instead of being the most despicable are virtues if compared to actions that find honor and reward is a truth too glaring to be denied that the cant with which these master crimes are glossed over and painted as just expedient ay and heroic actions that this diabolical cant should be and is adopted by men even of the highest powers is a fact that astonishes and confounds it impels us continually to askare they cowards are they hypocrites or is the world inhabited by none but lunatics and that men even of such uncommon genius as belmont should be entangled and bewildered by the destructive incongruity of those who assume to themselves the highest wisdom because they possess the highest stations in society is a proof how incumbent it is on such as are convinced of these melancholy truths to declare them openly undauntedly and with a perseverance that no threats or terrors can shake when we had taken as much wine as belmont could prevail on me to drink and he was very urgent he asked if i played piquet i answered in the affirmative you no doubt then play it well i do not think it a game of much difficulty it is my opinion i am your master at it that may be though you do not think it is will you try what with a man who avows he does not scruple to take every advantage have you not eyes are you a metaphysician a wit and a senator so easily deceived a man may lose his temper and with it his caution so you think yourself able to instruct the world but not to keep your mind calm and circumspect for half an hour had i a sufficient motive i should suppose i have strength enough for such an exertion then try the exercise will be wholesome shew your skill and acuteness here is your twentypound bill win and take it or own that you have no confidence in yourself i have that confidence which assures me i shall one day or other convince you that i understand the road to happiness better than yourself yet you are cursedly afraid of me you scarcely can sit still you blame your own rashness in venturing to spend the afternoon with me and now you would as soon handle burning coals as a pack of cards in my company and what is it you find so omnipotent in yourself that it should induce you to all this vapouring i tell you again you dare not oppose your penetration to mine you pretend to despise me yet own i am your master a child is not in more fear of the rod than you are of me he saw he had sufficiently piqued me and rang the bell for cards they were brought he shuffled cut them and continued to banter me what card do you chusethe knave of heartsthere it is he shewed it with a flirt of the cards at the bottom of the pack his brother of diamondslook you have itof spadespresto it is here you have three knaves on your side you see i will keep the fourth and drive you out of the fieldcome for twenty i see your aim and am devilishly tempted to shew you that you are not half so cunning as you think yourself i know you are but you dare not you cannot shake off your fears the wit the metaphysician the young senator suspects he is only a halffledged bird cut for deal sir why will you venturethe nine the sudden recollection of mr evelyn the money i had received from him the generous confidence he had reposed in me and the guilt of daring to abuse that confidence fortunately seized me with a kind of horror i snatched up the cards dashed them in the fire and in a moment recovering myself saidyou shall find sir that whether i can or cannot master you i can master myself come you do not go out of this room without the chance of losing twenty guineas for twenty done answered i impetuously which he in an instant echoed with done done and again bursting into laughter held out his hand and bade me pay my losings i immediately discovered without his explanation that he had entrapped me by the equivocal sense of the word chance and i drew out my purse to pay him with a strong feeling of indignation that i should be so caught however as it was not his intention to profit by so bald and barefaced a quirk he only laughed and exclaimedhow much the young gentleman is his own master but i will not pick your pocket if at any time i should want twenty pounds i shall have a fair claim to ask it as a loan would you but really act like a man of honour there would be no need of such an artifice perhaps not for the first time but if my poor honor were starving and could not repay its borrowings i am afraid my honor would irrevocably be lost i therefore prefer since in either case lose it i must to lose it and eat but the birds are now beginning to flock together and i must begone to the pigeonhouse the rookery i do not understand the terms the plucking office the crab and nick nest the pip and bone quarry the rafflearium the trumpery the blaspheming box the elbow shaking shop the wholesale ague and fever warehouse in plain english to an assembly of gamblers where i shall meet with much the same degree of honesty virtue wisdom and all that as is to be found in certain other assemblies chapter viii bad company painful as well as dangerous a short note exciting much expectation a question that shocks and surprises clarke and olivia or the overflowing of a full and friendly heart various mistakes rectified the reading of the letter and the emotions it produces resolutions worthy of virtuous love i left the tavern in no very pleasant temper of mind impatient that i should be unable to convince and reform a man of such extraordinary acuteness as belmont vexed that he on the contrary should persuade himself that he was my master and should actually irritate me to a dangerous excess of vanity and disgusted that vice and virtue should be so confused in the minds of men as to render their boundaries almost undiscoverable such i mean was the impression that belmont had left upon my mind by repeating the stale but dangerous maxim thatmen are vicious by nature and therefore that to profit by their vices is no more than just when i arrived at my lodgings which were now in albemarlestreet for i had changed them i found the following note from miss wilmot come to me immediately i have something to tell you which you little expect belmont and my chagrin were forgotten in an instant and away i hurried brim full of agitation conjecture and impatience i found miss wilmot alone and her first words wereoh mr trevor you are a happy man i stood panting or rather gasping with hope and made no reply she thus continued miss mowbray has been here good heavens she has acted like herself i know not how i shall tell you the story so as to do her justice for the love of god proceed as nearly as i can recollect her words she began in this manner i cannot tell my dear friend addressing herself to me what you will think of my conduct at one moment i suspect it to be wrong and at the next blame myself for not having taken my present step sooner i have surely been grossly misled this indeed i have long suspected and it cannot but be my duty to enquire have you lately seen mr trevor i never fail to see him every day i have a letter from him for you which he has disdained to take any clandestine means of conveying to you here it is before i date think about his letter answer me one question is he a murderer a murderer in the name of god what can induce you to make such an enquiry i have been assured that he has caused the death of two men one of whom he killed himself where when how at bath by delivering one over to the fury of the mob and by afterward provoking insulting and fighting with the other heavens and earth it is false wickedly false nay but do you know his story perfectly i have heard it not only from himself but from the man whom i suppose you have been told he has murdered what man nay you shall hear and see you shall have the whole history from the persons own mouth is he alive is he in london i will send for him he will be here in a few minutes you will then hear what this man has to say he almost adores mr trevor i immediately dispatched mary for mr clarke who works not far off as i suppose you know and who came running the moment he heard that the lady you are in love with enquired for him mary informs me that his heart leaped to his eyes it was her own phrase when he was told she wanted to question him concerning you that he sprang up clapped his hands and exclaimedi am glad of it i am glad of it the time is come all shall be known he shall be righted i will take care of that he shall be righted he entered the room breathless and the moment he saw miss mowbray he could not forbear to gaze at her though bashfulness made him continually turn his eyes away she addressed him with that mildness of manner which is so winning in her and saidi have taken the liberty sir to send for you to ask a few questions he replied with a burst of zeali am glad of it madam i am glad of it from my heart and soul i wish you knew all i could tell you about mr trevor but it is quite unpossible that i should remember it one half only this i will say and dare the best man in england to deny it there is not such another brave and kindhearted gentleman walks the earth i have had proof enough of it he knows for all he is a gentleman ay and a true gentleman too for he has parts and learning and a christian soul which does not teach him to scorn and make a scoff of the poor he knows that a man is a man even though he should only happen to be a poor carpenter like myself god in heaven bless him say i the enthusiasm of your generous humble friend overpowered miss mowbray she burst into tears and hid her face her passion was catching and i followed her example clarke continued on that night that he had the good hap to save your life and the life of that old cankered lady which as i find from all that passed she must be though he talks of her too kindly by half why the stopping of the frightened horses just do you see in the jaws of destruction and propping the coach was all his doing he knew better what he was about than the coachman himself and then if you had seen him as i did after all was over i thought i had loved my sally dearly and so i do but what am i i thought too i durst have stood up to the boldest man that ever stood on shoe leather and perhaps i durst but i find i am nothing in any case to he for which he never despises me but insists upon it that i am as good a man as he in any way and as for you madam he would jump into burning lakes rather than a hair of your head should be singed i know it for i have seen it i know it too said miss mowbray sobbing then with an effort to quell her passion she asked in a firmer tone pray sir tell me did not you work at bath yes madam the greatest part of my life you appear to know of a battle that mr trevor fought yes yes madam i know it pretty well i shall remember it as long as i live for more reasons than one was there a man killed no madam god be praised i should have died in my sins unprepared and wicked as i was being possessed with passion he god bless him for all he is a gentleman begged my pardon like a man and held out his hand and prayed over and over that i would forget and forgive but as i tell you i was possessed i could be nothing else because in the way of hard fighting i despised a gentleman but he gave me to know better as obstinate as i was for even after he had beaten me once why he begged and prayed as he had done at first to make it all up but as i said before the evil one had taken hold of me and i refused to give in till i was carried as dead as a stock off of the place then it was you that was reported to have been killed why yes madam because it could be nobody else nay but was not there a poor man ducked to death no god be thanked once again it was not quite so bad as that though the hotheaded fools and rabble that got hold of me did use me ill enough i must say for which i was so angry with mr trevor and it was therefore that old nick put it into my head that i would beat him for i cannot deny but the ducking did dwell upon my memory were you then the same person that was so ill treated at lansdown races yes madam for which though i used to be angry enough before time at pickpockets i will take special care never to have a hand in ducking any body as long as i live and is there no truth whatever in the story that two men were killed by the ungovernable passion and malice of mr trevor killed by mr trevor madam no no he is not that sort of man he would rather be killed himself than be the death of any christian soul specially if he was a poor body i can say that for him why he fought like a mad man to save me from the mob when they were hustling me and dragging me along but while one part of them gathered round him the other had got far enough off with me it being all a mistake about a handkerchief which he told them and though i heard him and saw him beat about just as if he had been a lion to save me i could not forget how i had been used when i met him the next day but i hope god will forgive me which i do believe he will for mr trevor has shewn him the example i beg pardon god forgive me i only mean that though mr trevor is a good gentleman the lord of heaven must be a better and even more charitable and melting in his heart which to be sure is very strange because i do not altogether understand how it can be then it seems your brother is still living brother madam i never had any brother nor any thing of that kind except my wifes sisters which i love because i love she what strange tales i have been told that i dare be sworn you have madam from what i have heard because there was the shamabraham friends of mr trevor one of which kicked him when he was down is it possible it is as true as god is in heaven madam do you know his name he was as tall as a maypole and then after he had done this cowardly trick why he durst not stand up to mr trevor like a man and so madam finding as you have been told a parcel of trumpery tales i hope in god you will be kind enough not to believe one of them now that you see they are all false for if there be a gentleman on the face of the earth that loves a lady to desperation why mr trevor is he as you would have been satisfied if you had set by his bedside when as he was down in the fever like as i and my sally did and had heard him rave of nobody but you and then if you had seen him too the night after he took you out of the coach and then went on to hounslow which as he said seeing it was parting with you was worse than tearing his heart out of his body but he was so afraid of doing you harm and of setting that cross old lady to scold you for he would suffer death rather than anger you so that while i have breath to draw i shall never forget when we came to the inn how he looked and stood quite lost and changing colour and while his face was as set as stone the tears kept trickling down his cheeks at which i was put into a panic for i did not at that time know what it was about nor who we had been in company with which was the more surprising when i came to hear for which as he knows you to be so good a lady i am sure you must see all these particulars just in the same light miss mowbray had heard sufficient her heart was bursting it was with difficulty she could check her feelings and she made no reply your unassuming but intelligent friend understood her silence as an intimation to him to withdraw zealous as you hear he was in your behalf this thought put an end to his loquacity but as he was retiring miss mowbray drew out her purse and said to himlet me beg you sir to accept this as a recompense forfor having aided in saving the lives of me and my aunt as she stretched out her hand he looked up at her as long as he durst and then turning his eyes away saidwhy as for money madam i thank you as much as if i had it but if i was to take it what would that seem but as if i had been telling a tale only to please you when i declare in the face of my maker it is every word truth and a great deal more and as for saving your lives i was as willing i own as another but i was not half so quick in thought as mr trevor because as the coachman said if he had not catched hold of the horses in that very instant nick of the moment it would have been all over so i hope madam you will not take it amiss that i am not one of the sort which tell tales to gain their own ends here he instantly left the room by which he intended to shew that he was determined clarke was no sooner gone than miss mowbray burst into the most passionate and i really believe the most rapturous flood of tears that the heart of woman ever shed and how melting how overflowing with affection the heart of woman is mr trevor i think you know good god how pure how expressive how beaming was the pleasure in her eyes though she sobbed so violently that she had lost all utterance how did she press my hand gaze at me then bury her face in my bosom and struggle with the pleasure that was becoming dangerous in its excess after some time her thoughts took another turn she instantly recovered the use of speech and exclaimedoh my friend i almost hate myself for the injustice which i as well as others have done mr trevori who had heard from his lips a thousand sentiments that ought to have assured me of the generous and elevated virtues by which his actions were directed he has twice saved my life and yet because on some occasions he has happened to act differently from what i have supposed he ought to have acted i have taken upon me to treat him with coldness that was affected with reproof when i owed him thanks and with rudeness such as i supposed became my sex for me he has risked his life again and again without hesitation while i have sat in timid silence and countenanced calumnies which it was impossible i could believe though i seem as if i had endeavoured to believe them from the disgrace which i knew would justly light on me should these calumnies prove false false i could not but think them false they have proved and i am unworthy of him i have presumed upon the prejudices which i knew would protect me in the opinions of the foolish and gain me their applause and have treated him with a haughtiness which he ought to despise has he deserved it has he been guilty of one mean or seductive art that might induce me to betray a duty and gratify him at the expence of myself and others has he entered into that base warfare of the sexes by which each in turn endeavours to deceive the thought suddenly struck her and interrupting herself she hastily askedwhere is the letter you mentioned i will read it i know i shall read my own condemnation but i will read it i presented the letter and replied mr trevor instructed me to tell you when i delivered it that it contains nothing which he wishes you to conceal should you think fit to shew it that it does not invite you to any improper correspondence and that it is the only one which under his present circumstances he means to obtrude upon you evidently overcome by the generous rectitude of your conduct and more dissatisfied with her own she broke the seal and began to read she hurried it once over with great eagerness and trepidation she then paused debating whether she should unburthen her mind immediately of a crowd of thoughts but finding they crossed and disturbed each other she began again and read aloud interrupting herself by remarks as she proceeded my reproof and angeryes yes i have taught him to treat me like a sultana he punishes me justly without intending it you have supposed me deadhere addressing herself to me she addedit was his servant philip who being hired by a gentleman that came to scarborough brought us this false intelligence his story was that he saw mr trevors distraction on the morning after he had lost his money at a gamingtable to which rashness as it should seem he was driven by despair that mr trevor ran into the fields in a fit of frenzy and threw himself into the avon that he philip who had followed as fast as he could hastened to the place but never saw him more and that consequently and beyond all doubt he was there drowned philip according to his own account hurried into the water and used every means in his power to find the body but not being successful he returned to his masters lodgings took some trifles that had been given him and left bath by the morning coach for london having nobody in bath to give him a character and being less likely there to meet with another place i informed miss mowbray that this was part of it true and part false for that philip had taken a tenpound note which more than paid him his wages and that the other things which he carried away had not been given him indeed exclaimed miss mowbray i am exceedingly sorry to hear it for after his second master left scarborough and he was hired by my aunt to wait on me he behaved with great diligence and honesty yet this accounts in part for his running away which he did that very night after i suppose he had discovered it was mr trevor at cranfordbridge and i have never seen or heard of him since i am persuaded he thought mr trevor dead for after i had heard my brothers account of the battle i thought the time and the circumstances contradictory and repeatedly questioned philip who persisted in declaring he saw mr trevor jump into the river and drown himself philips account was that he had himself been out on errands early in the morning at which time he supposed the battle must have been fought and though there were many contradictory circumstances the positiveness with which the two tales were told led me to believe that the chief incidents of both were true and as i say the flight of philip from cranfordbridge persuades me that he actually had believed mr trevor dead i am sorry the poor fellow has done this wrong thing and been frightened away for i never before heard a servant speak with so much warmth and affection of a master as he did of mr trevor she then continued to read and made many observations which expressed dissatisfaction with herself and were favourable to you till she came to where you inform her that you had begun to study the law by this i find said she the story i have just heard is false i asked what story is that pray she replied i was last night at the opera where i saw mr trevor with lady bray having so lately met with him under circumstances so different and apparently disadvantageous you may imagine that the joy i felt and the hope i conceived were not trifling my aunt saw him likewise but as she was not so familiar with his person as to have no doubt she first watched and then questioned me though as she upbraidingly told me she needed only to have enquired of my looks i ought perhaps first to have informed you that i had thought it my duty to use the utmost sincerity undeceive her and declare all that i knew of what had passed at cranfordbridge i performed this task on that very night while her heart was alive to the danger she had escaped and when she expressed a lively regret that the person from whom she had received such signal aid had disappeared except his silence in the coach she said every thing bespoke him to be a gentleman well bred well educated courageous and as active as he was bold when she was told that the gentleman of whom she had been speaking with so much warmth had a peculiar motive for being silent and that this gentleman was no other than mr trevor she was very much moved the recollection of the manner in which she had been treating his character and of the alacrity with which he had afterward saved her life was exceedingly strong and far from unmixed with pain before she was aware of herself she exclaimed this mr trevor is a very extraordinary young man unfortunately for mr trevor our servant philip had absconded and a train of suspicions immediately arose in her mind it might be a conspiracy among them a desperate and unprincipled contrivance to effect a desperate and unprincipled purpose in this supposition she confirmed herself by every possible surmise each and all resting upon the assumed league between philip and mr trevor i vainly urged that the sudden disappearing of both entirely contradicted such a conjecture that mr trevor if he were capable of an action like this must be as wicked as he was mad and that i had every reason to believe him a man of the most generous and elevated principles as you may suppose these arguments from me only subjected me to reproof sarcasm and even suspicion my aunt fortified herself in her opinion and behaved with a more jealous watchfulness than ever she even terrified me with the dread of that which i could not credit the possibility that what she affirmed might be true but that i might do every thing in my power to prove that one part of her surmises was false i determined cautiously to avoid for the present seeing or even hearing any thing concerning mr trevor and this was my inducement for writing the note which you received my mind however suffered a continual conflict i debated on the propriety of listening to the daily defamation of mr trevor when there were so many presumptive facts in his favour and not endeavouring to prove that it was false and i accused my conduct of apparent hypocrisy of assuming a calm unconcern which my heart belied the sight of him at the opera renewed my selfreproaches in full force and likewise fortunately awakened my aunts curiosity accordingly one of our morning visits today has been to a friend of lady brays and there we learned that mr trevor had been introduced by sir barnard to his lady and their common friends as a young gentleman coming into parliament and supposed to be possessed of extraordinary talents this i find by his letter is untrue and there still appears to be some mystery which perhaps as you see him so often you may be able to unravel i immediately requested her to look at the date of the letter by which she saw it had been written several weeks and afterward made her acquainted with all the particulars i knew concerning your beginning and renouncing the study of the law and your new political plans most carefully remembering to give your noble minded friend mr evelyn his due share of what i had to relate oh how did her eyes swim and her features glow while i stated what i had heard of his sentiments and proceedings yes she has a heart a heart to match your own mr trevor she then read the remainder of the letter but with numerous interruptions all of them expressing her admiration of your conduct by criminating her own when she had ended she spoke to me nearly as follows i am now my dear friend determined on the conduct i mean to pursue oh how it delights my heart that mr trevor accords with me in opinion and advises me to that open sincerity after which i have long been struggling and which i am at length resolved to adopt i mean to inform my aunt of all that i know as well as of all that i intend i will tell her where i have been shew her this letter repeat every thing i have heard and add my fixed purpose not to admit the addresses of any man on earth till my family shall authorise those of mr trevor for that or for the time when i shall be unconditionally my own mistress however distant it may be i will wait tell mr trevor that my heart is overwhelmed by the sense it feels of his generous and noble conduct and it exults in his manly forbearance which so cautiously guards my rectitude rather than his own gratification that i will obey his injunction and that we will have no clandestine correspondence but that our souls shall commune they shall daily sympathise and mutually excite us to that perseverance in fidelity and virtue which will be their own reward and the consolation and joy of our lives if my aunt my brother or any of their acquaintance should again calumniate mr trevor i will forewarn them of my further determination to inform him and enquire into the facts but i hope they will neither be so unjust nor so ungenerous at least i think my aunt will not when she hears the truth knows my resolution and remembers cranfordbridge of misinterpretation from mr trevor i am in no fear had he one sinister design he never could have imagined the conduct he has so nobly pursued but to suppose the possibility of such a thing in him would be a most unpardonable injustice the man who should teach me to distrust him as a lover could never inspire me with admiration and confidence as a husband but different indeed has been the lesson i have learned from mr trevor oh that mr evelyn what a godlike morality has he adopted how rational how full of benefit to others and of happiness to himself but mr trevors friends are all of this uncommon stamp and i own that to look into futurity and to suppose myself excluded by prejudice and pride from the enjoyment of such society is perhaps the most painful idea that can afflict the mind i am almost afraid of owning even to you my kind and sympathising friend the torrent of emotions i feel at the thought of the pure pleasures i hope for hereafter from a life spent with a partner like mr trevor heightened by the intercourse of the generous benevolent and strongminded men who share his heart to detail all that farther passed between olivia and miss wilmot with the particulars which the latter related to me would but be to repeat sensations and incidents that are already familiar to the reader and with respect to my own feelings those he will doubtless have anticipated what could they be but rapture what could they inspire but resolution the power to endure and the will to persevere chapter ix the study of oratory remarks on fashionable manners and their consequences a public dinner emotions at the meeting of quondam acquaintance amenity without doors and anger within compatible a discovery made by the baronet the contending passions of surprise resentment and pity ravages committed by vice an awful scene or a warning to gluttony previous to this event i should have imagined it impossible to have increased my affection yet if admiration be the basis of love as i am persuaded it is my love was certainly increased i now seemed to be setting forward on a journey of the length of which i was indeed wholly ignorant but the road was made plain and the end was inexpressible happiness i should therefore travel with unwearied alacrity but that i might shorten this unmeasured length of way it was necessary i should be as active in pursuit as i was ardent in my passion and the stimulus was a strong one oratory accordingly olivia excepted became the object that seemed the dearest to my heart demosthenes and cicero were my great masters they and their modern competitors were my study day and night no means were neglected that precept or example as far as they came within my knowledge could afford and the additional intercourse which i thus acquired with man his motives actions and heart was a school of the highest order i did not however entirely confine myself to the society of the dead the living likewise constituted a seminary in which i found frequent opportunities of gaining instruction impelled by curiosity and ambition i was not remiss in cultivating an acquaintance among those people of fashion to whom i gained access but as the tribe that bestow on themselves this titillating epithet have a light and versatile character as they abound in praises that are void of discrimination and promises that are unmeaning and affect at one moment the most winning urbanity and at the next the most supercilious arrogance though they gave me much pleasure they likewise gave me exquisite pain the more i became acquainted with them the more i was amazed that the man who had been talking to me in the evening on terms of the utmost apparent equality if i met him the next morning did not know me some of them would even gaze full in my face as if to enquirewho are you sir but in reality to insult me the looks of these most courteous and polished people seem to say in the name of all that is highbred how does it happen that persons of fashion do not unite to stare every such impertinent upstart out of their company of all the insolence that disturbs society and puts it in a state of internal warfare the insolence of fashion wounds and imbitters the most it instantly provokes the offended person to enquirewhat kind of being is it that takes upon him to brave insult and despise me has he more strength more activity more understanding than myself in numerous instances he is imbecile in body more imbecile still in mind and contemptible in person nay he is often little better than a driveller he whom the hauteur of fashion has compelled to reason thus will soon be led to further and more serious inferences nothing can reconcile men so as to induce them to remain peaceable spectators of enjoyments beyond their attainment except that unaffected benevolence which shall continually actuate the heart to communicate all the happiness it has the power to bestow this only can so temper oppression as to render gradual and orderly reform practicable but i am talking to the winds this wavering between extreme civility and rudeness was conspicuous in the behaviour of the bray family toward me her ladyship at one moment would overlook me i being present as if no such person had been in existence or as if he were not half so worthy of attention as her lapdog for as a proof on the lapdog it was lavished yet at another i was absolutely the most charming man on earth i had positively the most refined taste good breeding and all that that she had ever known with sir barnard i was sometimes an oracle to me his discourse was directed to my judgment his appeals were made and my opinions were decisive in other fits he would not condescend to notice me if i interfered with a sentence he would pursue the conversation as if an objection made by me were unworthy of an answer and perhaps if i asked him a question he would affect to be deaf and make no reply these are arts which render the condition of a supposed inferior truly hateful and as they were severely felt they were severely remembered and now and then retaliated in a spirit which i cannot applaud if the history of such emotions were traced through all their consequences and if men were aware how much the principal events of their lives are the result of the petty ebullitions of passion that branch of morals which should regulate the temper of mind tone of voice and expression of the countenance would become a very serious study this remark is as old as adam and yet it relates to a science that is only in its infancy how fatal the want of such a necessary command of temper had been to me the reader already knows and though at moments i was painfully conscious of the defect and it was become less obtrusive it was far from cured it still hovered over and influenced my fate as will be seen the old parliament was not yet dissolved it had met and was sitting but the defection of sir barnards member was of late date and as the baronet had his motives for not wishing to provoke the honorable member whom he had made too violently there was a kind of compromise and the apostate was suffered to keep his seat during the short remainder of the term sir barnard however as i have said delighted in his prop it was as necessary to him as his cane and i generally accompanied him when he visited any kind of political assemblies it happened that there was an annual dinner of the gentlemen who had been educated at of which dinner sir barnard was appointed one of the stewards that he might acquit himself of this arduous task with eclat i was of course presented with a ticket and attended as his aid de camp the company was numerous and the stewards and the chairman met something more early than the rest to regulate the important business of the day when i entered the committee room with the baronet the first person that caught my eye was the earl of idford i shrunk back i had a momentary hesitation whether i should insult him or instantly quit the company and disdain to enter an apartment polluted by his presence i had however just good sense enough to recollect that a quarrel in such a place nobody knew why would be equally ridiculous and rash and that to avoid any man was cowardly the thought awakened me and collecting myself i advanced with a firm and cool air habit and perversity of system had done that for his lordship to which his fortitude was inadequate he was at least as cool and as intrepid as myself and bowed to me with the utmost ease and civility to return his bow was infinitely more repulsive than taking a toad in my hand yet to forbear would have been a violation of the first principles of the behaviour of a gentleman i therefore reluctantly and formally complied i hope the reader remembers how earnestly i condemn this want of temper in myself his lordship took not the least notice of the coldness of my manner but with simpering complacency hoped i had been well since he had had the pleasure of seeing me my reply was another slight inclination of the head tinctured with disdain on which his lordship turned his back with a kind of openmouthed nonchalance that was truly epigrammatic and fell into conversation with sir barnard who had advanced toward the fire with all the apparent ease of the most intimate friendship though since his lordship had changed sides they had become in politics at least the most outrageous enemies this brought a train of reflections into my mind on the behaviour of political partisans toward each other and on the efforts they make after they have been venting the most cutting sarcasms in their mutual parliamentary attacks to behave out of doors as if they had totally forgotten what had passed within or were incapable if not of feeling of remembering insult what is most remarkable the men of greatest talent exert this amenity with the greatest effect for they utter and receive the most biting reproaches yet meet each other as if no such bickerings had ever passed it is not then in characters like these hypocrisy no it is an effort to live in harmony with mankind yet to speak the truth and tell them of their mistakes unsparingly and regardless of personal danger in other words it is an attempt to perform the most sacred of duties but the manner of performing it effectually has hitherto been ill understood sir barnard had witnessed the short scene between me and his lordship and presently took occasion to ask me in a whisper how and where we had become acquainted i replied i had resided in the house of his lordship ay indeed said the baronet in what capacity my pride was piqued and i answered as his companion and as i was taught to suppose myself his friend but i was soon cured of my mistake by what means by his lordships patriotism by the purity of his politics i spoke with a sneer and the baronet burst into a malicious laugh of triumph but unwilling that the cause of it should be suspected it was instantly restrained what concern had you continued he in his lordships politics i have reason to believe i helped to reconcile him to the minister you mr trevor how came you to do so unprincipled so profligate a thing it was wholly unintentional i do not understand you i wrote certain letters that were printed in the what mr trevor were you the author of the three last letters of themistocles i was the baronets face glowed with exultation i knew said he with a vehement but under voice he never wrote them himself i have said it a thousand times and i am not easily deceived every body said the same there is no calculating how much the knowledge of this circumstance raised me in sir barnards opinion and consequently elevated himself in the idea he conceived of his own power had he indeed got hold of the author of themistocles why then he was a great man a prodigious senator the wish of his heart was accomplished he could now wreak vengeance where he most wished it to fall and fall it should without mercy or remission his little soul was on tiptoe and he overlooked the world though we had retired to the farthest corner of the room and his lordship pretended to be engaged in chit chat with persons who were proud of his condescension i could perceive his suspicions were awakened his eye repeatedly gave enquiring glances and while it endeavoured to counterfeit indifference by a stare it was disturbed and contracted by apprehension malignity hatred and revenge are closely related and of these passions men of but little mental powers are very susceptible it is happy for society that their impotence impedes the execution of their desires i was odious in the sight of lord idford in every point of view for he had first injured me which as has been often remarked too frequently renders him who commits the injury implacable and he had since encountered a rival in me which was an insult that his vanity and pride could ill indeed digest still however he was a courtier a man of fashion a person of the best breeding and therefore could smile a smile is a delightful thing when it is the genuine offspring of the heart but heaven defend me from the jaundiced eye the simpering lip and the wrinkled cheek that turn smiles to grimace and give the lie to open and undisguised pleasure it was a smile such as this that his lordship bestowed upon me when i and the baronet joined his group addressing himself to me with a simper that anticipated the pain he intended to give he saiddo you know mr trevor that your friend the bishop of is to dine with us you will be glad to meet each other i instantly replied with fire in my eyes i shall be as glad to meet that most pious and right reverend pastor as i was to meet your lordship agreeably to rule he bowed and gave the company to understand he took this as a polite acknowledgment of respect but his gesture was accompanied with a disconcerted leer of smothered malice which i could not misinterpret it was sardonic and to me who knew what was passing in his heart disgusting and painful i had scarcely spoken before my lord the bishop entered and with him as two supportersheavens whothe president of the college where i had been educated and the tutor whose veto had prevented me from taking my degrees in the life of every man of enterprise there are moments of extreme peril in an instant and as it were by enchantment i saw myself surrounded by the cowardly servile dwarfdemons for so my imagination painted them who had been my chief tormentors or rather by reptiles the most envenomed with which i was shut up as if i had been thrown into their den and by which if i did not exterminate them i must expect to be devoured but these feelings were of short duration my heart found an immediate repellent both to fear and revenge in my eyes good god what were the figures now before me such as to excite pity in every bosom that was not shut to commiseration for the vices into which mankind are mistakenly hurried and for their deplorable consequences what a fearful alteration had a few months produced in the bishop especially he had been struck by the palsy and dragged one side along with extreme difficulty his bloated cheeks and body had fallen into deep pits and the swelling massy parts were of a blackred hue so that the skin appeared a bag of morbid contents his mouth was drawn awry his speech entirely inarticulate his eye obscured by thick rheum and his clothes were stained by the saliva that occasionally driveled from his lips his legs were wasted his breast was sunk and his protuberant paunch looked like the receptacle of dropsy atrophy catarrh and every imaginable malady my heart sunk within me poor creature what would i have given to have possessed the power of restoring thee to something human resentment to thee alas had i not felt compassion such as never can be forgotten i surely should have despised should have almost hated myself the president was evidently travelling the same road his legs which had been extremely muscular instead of being as round and smooth in their surface as they formerly were each appeared to be covered with innumerable nodes that formed irregular figures and angles what they were swathed with i cannot imagine but i conjecture there must have been stiff brown paper next to the smooth silk stocking which produced the irregularities of the surface the dullness of his eyes the slowness of their motions his drooping eyelids his flaccid cheeks his hanging chin and the bagging of his cloaths all denoted waste want of animation lethargy debility and decline the condition of the tutor was no less pitiable he was gasping with an asthma and was obliged incessantly to struggle with suffocation it was what physicians call a confirmed case while he lived he was doomed to live in pain where is the tyrant that can invent tortures equal to those which men invent for themselves these were the guests who were come to feast to indulge appetites they had never been able to subdue though their appetites were vipers that were eating away their vitals how strongly did this scene bring to my recollection pope on the ruling passion i could almost fancy i heard the poor bishop quoting mercy cries helluo mercy on my soul is there no hopealasthen bring the jowl the present man is but the slave of the past what induced the president and the tutor when the bishops more ablebodied footmen had rather carried than conducted him up stairs officially to become his supporters as he entered the room was it unmixed humanity or was it those servile habits to which their cunning had subjected them and by which they supposed not only that preferment but that happiness was attainable humanity doubtless had its share for it is a sensation that never utterly abandons the breast of man and as it is often strengthened by a consciousness that we ourselves are in need of aid let us suppose that the president and the tutor were become humane though feelings of acrimony towards these persons were entirely deadened in me by the spectacle i beheld yet i knew not well how to behave i was prompted to shew them how placable i was become by accosting them first but this might be misconstrued into that servility for which i had thought of them with so much contempt beside the bishop and the president if not the tutor were in the phraseology of the world my superiors and etiquette had established the rule that if they thought proper to notice me they would be the first to salute his lordship however eased me of farther trouble on this head by asking the bishophave you forgotten your old acquaintance mr trevor my lord what answer this consecrated right reverend father returned i could not hear he muttered something but the sounds were as unintelligible as the features of his face or the drooping deadness of his eyes the president however hearing this thought proper to bow though very slightly till the earl added with a significant emphasis on the two last wordssir barnard is become mr trevors particular friend which was no sooner pronounced than the countenances of both the bishops supporters changed to something which might be called exceedingly civil in the tutor and prodigiously condescending in the president this was a memorable day and if the event which i have now to relate should be offensive to the feelings of any man or any class of men i can only say that i share the common fate of historians who though they should relate nothing but facts never fail to excite displeasure if not resentment and persecution in the partisans of this or that particular opinion faction or establishment the dinner was served it was sumptuous or rather such as gluttony delights in the persons assembled i am sorry to say it were several of them gluttons and encouraged and countenanced each other in the vice to which they were addicted dish succeeded to dish and one plateful was but devoured that another and another might be gorged fatal insensibility to the warning voice of experience incomprehensible blindness the poor bishop was unable to resist his destiny i had a foreboding of the mischief that might result from a stomach at once so debilitated and so overloaded i wished to have spoken i was tempted to exclaimrash man beware i could not keep my eyes away from him till at length i suddenly remarked a strange appearance that came over his face and almost at the same instant he dropped from his chair in an apoplectic fit the description of his foaming mouth distorted features dead eyes the whites of which only were to be seen his writhings his no i must forbear the picture i witnessed could give nothing but pain mingled with disgust and horror if i suggest that poor oppressed nature made the most violent struggles to empty and relieve herself there will perhaps be more than sufficient of the scene of which i was a spectator conjured up in the imagination the bishop had been a muscular man with a frame of uncommon strength and the paroxysm though extreme did not end in death medical assistance was obtained and he was borne away as soon as the crisis was over but the festivity for which the company had met was disturbed many of them were struck with terror dreading lest they had only been present at horrors that soon or late were to light upon themselves they departed appalled by the scene they had witnessed and haunted by images of a foreboding black and distracted kind from these sir barnard himself was not wholly free though he had been less guilty of gormandizing than many of his associates and for my own part this incident left an impression upon me which i am persuaded will be salutary through life chapter x a few reflections a word concerning friends and the duties of friendship news of thornby or the equity of the dying the decease of my mother a curious letter on the obsequies of the dead the real and the ideal being unlike to each other how different is the same man at different periods of his existence how very unlike were the bowing well bred earl of idford and the asthmatic tutor of this day to the lord saddog and his jack whom but a few years before i first met at college the president too at that time was quite as much in form as in office one of the pillars of the university and the bishop what a lamentable change had a short period produced happy would it be for men did they recollect that change they must and that if they will but be sufficiently attentive to circumstances they may change for the better time kept rolling on and i had variety of occupation neither my studies my fashionable acquaintances nor those whom i justly loved as my friends were neglected mr evelyn continued for some time in town attending to his anatomical and chymical studies wilmot had completed his comedy it had been favourably received by the manager and was to be the second new piece brought forward turl with equal perseverance was pursuing his own plans and though i heard nothing more from olivia my heart was at ease i knew the motives on which she acted and had her assurance that if i should be again defamed i should now be heard in my own defence i was careful not to forget honest clarke nor was the kindhearted mary neglected the good carpenter had sent for his wife and family up to town and mary was happy in the friendly attentions of miss wilmot and in the orderly conduct and quick improvement of her son one of my pleasures and duties as i conceived it to be was to introduce turl and wilmot to such of my higher order of acquaintance as might afford both parties gratification there is much frivolity among people of rank and fashion but there is likewise some enquiry and sound understanding and where these qualities exist in any eminent degree the friends i have named could not but be welcome it is the interest of men of all orders to converse with each other to listen to their mutual pretensions with patience to be slow to condemn and to be liberal in the construction of what they at first suppose to be dangerous novelty turl was peculiarly fitted to promote these principles and wilmot in addition to the charms of an imagination finely stored was possessed as the reader may remember of musical talents and those of no inferior order days and weeks passed not unpleasantly away for hope and olivia were ever present to my imagination and of the ills which fortune had in reserve i was little aware while business and pleasure thus appeared to promote each other it came to my knowledge that an advertisement had appeared in the papers stating that if hugh trevor the grandson of the reverend rector of were alive by application at a place there named he might hear of something very much to his advantage i cannot enumerate the conjectures that this intelligence immediately excited for they were endless i searched the papers found the advertisement and hastened to the place to which it directed me the information i there received was not precisely what my elevated hopes had taught me to expect but it was of considerable moment i learned that my grandfathers executor mr thornby was dead that his nephew wakefield had taken possession of the property he had left but that he had done this illegally for the person who caused the advertisement to be put into the paper was an attorney who had drawn and witnessed the will of thornby which will was in my favour and which moreover stated that the property bequeathed to me was mine in right of a will of my grandfathers which will thornby had till that time kept concealed whether the testament he had produced immediately after the death of the rector were one that thornby had forged or one that my grandfather had actually made but had ordered his executor to destroy did not at present appear the account i gave of it in a preceding volume and of the manner in which it was procured was the substance of what i learned from the conversation of my mother and thornby at the time a deathbed compunction had wrested from the deceased an avowal of his guilt and the facts were explicitly stated in the preamble of his will in order to prevent the contest which he foresaw might probably take place between me and his nephew he seemed to have been painfully anxious to do justice at last and save his soul when he found it must take flight the business was urgent and if i meant to profit by that which was legally mine it was necessary as i was advised immediately to go down and examine into all the circumstances on the spot i was the more surprised at what i had heard because it was but very lately that i had sent a remittance to my mother which she had acknowledged and which must have been received after her husband had taken possession of his uncles effects but when i recollected the character that had been given me of wakefield as far as the transaction related to him my surprise was of short duration with respect to my mother i heard with no small degree of astonishment that she had been applied to in order to discover where i might be found and that she had returned evasive answers which as it was supposed had been dictated by her husband under whose control partly from fear and partly from an old womans doating she was completely held to say that i grieved at such weakness in one whom i had so earnestly desired to love and honor with more than filial affection would be superfluous but my surprise would have instantly ceased had i known who this wakefield was with whom my mother had to contend reproach from me however in word or look had i been so inclined she was destined never to receive the career of pain and pleasure with her was nearly over on the same day that i made the enquiries i have been repeating a letter arrived written not by her but at her request which informed me that if i meant to see her alive i must use all possible speed for that she had been suddenly seized with dangerous and intolerable pains which according to the description given in the letter were such as i found from enquiry belong to the iliac passion and that she was then lying at the last extremity two such imperious mandates requiring my presence in my native county were not to be disobeyed and i departed with the utmost diligence at the last stage after a journey of unremitted expedition i ordered the chaise to drive to the house of the late thornby where on enquiry i was informed that my mother lay i found her in a truly pitiable condition quicksilver had been administered but in vain and she was so thoroughly exhausted that the sight of me produced but very little emotion her medical attendant pronounced she could not survive fourandtwenty hours and advised that if there were any business to be settled between us it should be proceeded upon immediately had this advice been given to persons of certain habits assuredly it would not have been neglected and perhaps it ought not to have been by me but whether i was right or wrong i could not endure to perplex and disturb the mind of a mother in her last agonies the consequence was she expired without hearing a word from me concerning her husband thornby or the property to which i was heir and without making any mention whatever herself of the disposal of this property i was indeed ignorant of what degree of information she could afford me her conduct had been so weak that to remind her of it at such a moment would as i supposed have been to inflict a severe degree of torment this as the reader will learn in time was not the only shaft by which my tranquillity was to be assaulted my mother though she was there was yet another death infinitely more heartrending hanging over my head the recollection is anguish that cannot end cannot did i say absurd mortal live for the living and grieve not for the dead unless grief could bid them rise from their graves i must proceed and not suffer my feelings thus to anticipate my tale knowing that wakefield was no other than belmont the reader will not be surprised that he should think proper to elude under these circumstances the discovery which a meeting must have produced my mother actuated by a conviction that death was inevitable had sent for me without his privity so that i afterward learned he was in the house when i drove up to the door and seeing me put my head out of the chaise immediately made his escape through the garden a man less fertile in expedients would have found it difficult to forge a plausible pretext to evade being present and meeting me at the funeral but he by pursuing what wore the face of being and what i believe actually was very rational conduct dexterously shunned the rencontre the following letter which he wrote to me will explain by what means sir persons of understanding have discovered that the obsequies of the dead may be performed with all due decorum and the pain as well as the very frequent hypocrisy of a funeral procession which is attended by friends and relations avoided they therefore with great good sense hire people to mourn or send their empty carriages with the blinds up which perhaps is quite as wise and no doubt as agreeable to the dead he that would not render the duties of humanity while they can succour those that are afflicted may justly be called brutal but those duties being paid what remains is more properly the business of carpenters gravediggers and undertakers than of men whose happiness is disturbed by useless but gloomy associations and who may find better employment for their time i for example have business at present that calls me another way i therefore request you will give such orders concerning the funeral as you shall think proper and as i have no doubt you will agree with me that decency and not unnecessary pomp which cannot honor the dead and does but satirise the living will be most creditable to mrs wakefields memory the expence as it ought will be defrayed by me i am sir your very obedient humble servant f wakefield had such a letter been written by a man who had pretended fondness for his wife it might perhaps have been construed unfeeling if not insulting to her memory but as the case was notoriously the reverse the honest contempt of all affectation which it displayed i could not but consider as an unexpected trait in the character of such a man as i supposed wakefield to be there is a strange propensity in the imagination to make up ideal beings and annex them to names that when mentioned have been usually followed with certain degrees of praise or blame these fanciful portraits are generally in the extreme they are all virtue or all vice all perfection or all deformity though it is well known that no such unmixed mortals exist my mind having acquired the habit rather to doubt than to conclude that every thing which is customary must be right funeral follies had not escaped my censure but the thing which excited my surprise was that a man like wakefield who i concluded must have thought very little indeed since he both thought and acted on other occasions so differently from me should in any instance reason like myself and some few others whom i most admired convinced however as i was that he now reasoned rightly i wanted in this case the courage to act after his example it would be a scandal to the country for a son pretending to filial duty to be absent from his mothers funeral the reader will doubtless remember that town and country are two exceedingly distinct regions chapter xi more alarming intelligence an honest youth with a printers notions concerning secrecy the weak parts of law form the strongest shield for villany a journey back to town enoch ellis and glibly again appear on the scene of action a few of the artifices of a man of uncommon cunning delineated a momentary glance at a mountain of political rubbish by artful deductions a man may be made to say any thing that an orator pleases this scandal i was notwithstanding my discretion destined to afford in addition to the arguments of wakefield accident supplied a motive too powerful to be resisted i have mentioned my intention to suppress the pamphlet which i had written in the fever of my resentment against the earl the bishop and their associates the edition which had been printed for publishing had lain in the printers warehouse till the time that i had determined against its appearance the child of the fancy is often as dear to us as any of our children whatever and i was unwilling that this offspring of mine should perish beyond all power of revival i therefore had the edition removed to my lodgings and stowed in a garret a copy however had been purloined and probably before the removal this copy came into the possession of an unprincipled bookseller who regardless of every consideration except profit and perceiving it to be written with vehemence on a subject which never fails to attract the attention of the public namely personal defamation had once more committed it to the press as it happened it was sent to be reprinted by the person with whom the son of mary was bound apprentice and the whole was worked off except the titlepage which fell into the hands of the youth desirous of shewing kindness to mary it may well be supposed i had not overlooked her son his mother had taught him to consider me as the saviour of both their lives and as such he held me in great veneration these favourable feelings were increased by the praise i bestowed on him for his good conduct and the encouragement i gave him to persevere richard for that was his name suspected it could be no intention of mine to publish the pamphlet because he had been employed to stow it in the garret and as he was an intelligent lad and acquainted with the tricks of the publisher for whom he knew his master was at work he hastened in great alarm to communicate his fears first to his mother and then by her advice to miss wilmot the latter immediately informed her brother he saw the danger wrote to me to return without delay doubting whether even i should have the power to prevent the publication and proceeded himself immediately to the printer to warn him of the nature of the transaction the man was no sooner informed of mr wilmots business than he became violently enraged with his apprentice richard accused him of betraying his masters interest and the secrets of the printinghouse which ought to be held sacred and affirmed that he had endangered the loss of his business richard was present was aware of the charge which would be brought against him and was prepared to endure it with considerable firmness though he had been taught to believe that such complaints were founded in justice wilmot could obtain no unequivocal answer from the master either that he would or would not proceed he consequently supposed the affirmative was the most probable and therefore that he might neglect nothing in an affair which he considered as so serious he hastened from the printer to the publisher here in addition to the rage of what he likewise called having been betrayed he met with open defiance vulgar insolence and vociferous assertions from this worthy bookseller that the laws of his country would be his shield the fellow had been frequently concerned in such rascalities and knew his ground he was one of the sagacious persons who had found a cover for them where law pretends to regulate and define every right the wrong which it cannot reach it protects this is a branch of knowledge on which a vast body of men in the kingdom and especially in the metropolis depend for their subsistence and a very tempting trade it is for our streets our public places and our courts of justice as well as other courts swarm with its followers at which places they appear in as high a style of fashion that is of effrontery as even the fools by whom they are aped or the lawyers and statesmen themselves by whom they are defended this i own is a bold assertion and is perhaps a hyperbole yes yes it is comparing mole hills to mountains but let it pass wilmot in his letter to me did not confine himself to a bare recital of facts fearful lest they should escape my recollection he urged those strong arguments which were best calculated to shew not only what my enemies might allege but what just men might impute to me should this intemperate pamphlet appear which in addition to its original mistakes would attack the character of the bishop a man whose office in the eye of the world implied every virtue and how immoderately would its intemperance and imputed malignity be exaggerated should it appear precisely at the moment when i knew disease had deprived him of his faculties had rendered him unable to defend himself and to produce facts which i might have concealed or give another face to truth which i might have discoloured these arguments alarmed me in a very painful degree i was averse to quit the place before my mother was interred especially as my reasons for such an abrupt departure could not be made public but i was still more averse to an action which in appearance would involve me in such a cowardly species of infamy accordingly i made the best arrangements in my power leaving orders that the funeral should be conducted with every decency and after a very short conversation with the attorney who had witnessed the will of thornby and given me the information i have already mentioned i travelled back to london with no less speed than i had hurried into the country i arrived in town on thursday night and the pamphlet was advertised for publication on the following monday the advertisement being purposely written to excite curiosity repeated the subject of the pamphlet which asserted my claims to the letters of themistocles and to the defence of the thirtynine articles the acrimony of which charge was increased by a personal attack on the earl of idford the bishop and their associates when i came to my lodgings i found two notes one from a person stiling himself a gentleman employed by the earl and another from mr ellis on the part of the bishop each requesting an interview answers not having been returned these agents had come themselves and being informed that i was in the country but was expected in town before the end of the week they left a pressing message desiring an answer the moment of my arrival eager as i was to ward off the danger that threatened me i considered the application that was made especially on the part of the earl as fortunate i understood that the only means of suppressing the pamphlet would be by an injunction from the lord chancellor and this i imagined the influence of the earl might essentially promote for which reason i immediately wrote in reply to these agents and appointed an interview early the next morning the place of meeting was a private room in a coffeehouse and though my eagerness in the business brought me there a few minutes before the time named ellis and his coadjutor had arrived before me they acted in concert and had met to compare notes i found the purveyor of pews and paradise still the same always inclined to make himself agreeable the other agent was seated in a dark corner of the room with his back to the light so that i did not recognise him as i entered how much was i surprised when as he turned to the window i discovered him to be the loquacious mr glibly the man whose principles were so accommodating whose tongue was glossy but whose praise was much more sickening and dangerous than his satire the civilities that were poured upon me by these wellpaired gentlemen were overwhelming it was like taking leave of a frenchman under the ancient regime there was no niche or chink for me to throw in a word so copious was the volubility of glibly and so eager was the zeal of ellis from the picture i before gave of the first the reader will have perceived that he was a man of considerable intellect though not of sufficient to make him honest his usual mode in conversation was to render the person to whom he addressed himself ridiculous by excessive praise and to mingle up sarcasm and panegyric in such a manner as to produce confusion in the mind of the object of it who never knew when to be angry or when to be pleased and laughter in every body else at first the most witty and acute would find amusement in his florid irony but they could not but soon be wearied by its methodical and undeviating mechanism which denoted great barrenness of invention in the present instance he had a case that required management a patron to oblige and an opponent to circumvent he had therefore the art to assume a tone as much divested of sneering as habit would permit and began by insinuations that were too flattering to fail of their effect yet not quite gross enough to offend my person my appearance my parliamentary prospects my understanding my friends and connections all passed in review while his praise was carefully tempered and as i imagined very passably appropriate hence it certainly promoted the end for which it was given it opened my heart and prepared me for that generous effusion which rather inclines to criminate itself than to insist on every trifle that may be urged in its favour apt however as he was at detecting vanity in others he was as open to it himself i might almost say as any man on earth he began with a profession of his friendship for the earl of idford in which he assumed the tone of having conferred a favour on that noble lord and i will not deny that he was right all his acquaintance were friends and perhaps he had the longest list of any man in london for the effrontery of his familiar claims upon every man he met from whom he had any thing to hope or fear was so extraordinary as to render an escape from him impossible he had parroted the phraseology of the haut ton and its arrogant apathy till the manner was so habitual to him that he was unconscious of his own impudence thus in conversing on this occasion of the earl who had deputed him the only appellation he had for his patron was idford i told idford what i thought on the subject for i always speak the truth and never deceive people unless it be to give them pleasure and then you know they are the more obliged to me glibly said idford to me i know you will act in this business without partiality for i must do him justice trevor and assure you that idford is a good fellow i do not pretend that he is not sensible of the privileges which rank and fashion give him he is vain thinks himself a great orator a fine writer a wise senator and all that i grant it how should it be otherwise it is very natural he would have been a devilish sensible fellow if he had not been a lord but that is not to be helped you and i in his place should think and act the same we should be as much deceived as silly and as ridiculous it is all right things must be so but idford is a very good fellow he is upon my honor the surgeon that has a difficult case will not only make preparations and adjustments before he begins to probe lacerate or cauterize but will sometimes administer an opiate to stupefy that sensibility which he apprehends is too keen glibly pursued much the same method and having exhausted nearly all his art till he found he had produced as great a propensity to compliance and conciliation as he could reasonably hope he proceeded to the business in question you no doubt guess my dear trevor why my friend ellis here and i desired to meet you i do to say the truth knowing as i do the soundness of your understanding the quickness of your conception and the consequences that must follow which acute as you are you could not but foresee i was amazed when i read your advertisement it is prodigiously surprising indeed added ellis eager at every opportunity to throw in such touches as he thought would give effect to the colouring of his friend and leader why said i do you call it my advertisement i mean of a pamphlet which it seems has been written by you but is going to be published without my consent are you serious said glibly staring it is not my custom to deceive people mr glibly not even to give them pleasure i am prodigious glad of that exclaimed the holy enoch prodigious glad indeed but you have owned it was written by you continued glibly i know no good that can result from disowning the truth and especially in the present instance my dear fellow truth is a very pretty thing on some occasions but to be continually telling truth as you call it oh lord oh lord we should set the whole world to cutting of throats to be sure we should cried ellis to be sure we should that is my morality exactly men are men my dear fellow a lord is a lord a bishop is a bishop each in his station things could not go on if we did not make allowances to tell truth would be to overturn all order i am willing to make allowances for all men are liable to be mistaken i approve that sentiment very much mr trevor interrupted enoch it is prodigious fine it is my own all men are liable to be mistaken i have said it a thousand times it is prodigious fine but i cannot conceive added i that to overturn systems which are founded in vice and folly would be to overturn all order you may call systematic selfishness systematic hypocrisy and systematic oppression order but i assert they are disorder my dear fellow nothing is so easy as to assert but we will leave this to another time i dare say that in the main there is no great difference between us you wish for all the good things you can get and so do i one of us may take a more round about way to obtain them than the other but we both intend to travel to the same goal i own when i heard of your brouillerie with my friend idford i thought you had missed the road but i find you have more wit than i supposed you are now guided by another fingerpost perhaps it might have been as well not to have changed the treasury bench is a strong hold and never was so well fortified it is become impregnable it includes the whole power of england scotland and ireland both the indies countless islands and boundless continents with all the grand outworks of lords spiritual and temporal governors generals admirals custos rotulorum and magistracy bodies corporate and chartered companies excise and taxation board and bankruptcy commissioners contractors agents jobbers moneylenders and spies with all the gradations of these and many more distinct classes understrappers innumerable an endless swarm a monstrous mass can it be conjured away by angry breath no no it is no house of cards for an individual to attempt to puff it down would be ridiculous insanity a mass indeed making ossa like a wart yet the rubbish must be removed and it is mine and every mans duty to handle the spade and besom but men want to work miracles and because the mountain does not vanish at a word they rashly conclude it cannot be diminished they are mistaken political error is a pestilential cloud dense with mephitic and deadly vapours but a wind has arisen in the south that will drive it over states kingdoms and empires till at last it shall be swept from the face of the earth my dear fellow you have an admirable genius but you have mistaken its bent depend upon it you are no politician though you are a very great poet fine phrases grand metaphors beautiful images all very admirable and you have them at command you are born to be an ornament to your country you have a very pretty turn very pretty indeed and so which is the point that i was coming to concerning this pamphlet it relates i think to certain letters that appeared signed themistocles and to a defence by my lord the bishop of the thirty nine articles added ellis eager that he and his patron should not be omitted you my dear fellow had some part in both of these publications i do not know what you mean by some part the substance of them both was my own ay ay you had a share a considerable share you and idford were friends you conversed together and communicated your thoughts to each other did not you i grant we did i knew you would grant whatever was true you are the advocate of truth and i commend you idford mixed with political men knew the temper of the times was acquainted with various anecdotes and gave you every information in his power i know you are too candid to conceal or disguise the least fact you would be as ready to condemn yourself as another you have real dignity of mind it gives you a certain superiority a kind of grandeur of real grandeur it is your principle it ought to be no doubt and i am sure you will own that i have stated the case fairly i told you mr ellis that i knew my friend trevor he has too much integrity to disown any thing i have said i dare believe were he to read the letters of themistocles over at this instant he would find it difficult to affirm of any one sentence that the thought might not possibly have been suggested in conversation by my friend idford i say might not possibly for you both perceive i am very desirous on this occasion to be guarded it certainly is a difficult thing answered i for any man positively to affirm he can trace the origin of any one thought and recollect the moment when it first entered his mind my lips were opening to proceed but glibly with great eagerness prevented me i knew my dear fellow that your candor was equal to your understanding mr ellis who hears all that passes will do me the justice to say that i declared before you came what turn the affair would take i was again going to speak but he was determined i should not and proceeded with his unconquerable volubility purposely leading my mind to another train of thought i am very glad indeed that the advertisement which appeared was not with your approbation on recollection i cannot conceive how i could for a moment suppose it was your own act a man of the soundest understanding may be surprised into passion and may write in a passion but he will think again and again and will be careful not to publish in a passion and the delay which has taken place might have proved to me that you had thought and had determined not to publish your countenance when you disowned the advertisement just now convinces me that i do you no more than justice by supposing this of you here the artful orator thought proper to pause for a reply and i answered i own that i wrote in a spirit which i do not at present quite approve i know it what you have said and what you have allowed have so much of liberality cool recollection and dispassionate honesty that they are as i knew they would be very honourable to you prodigiously indeed said enoch glibly continued your behaviour in this business entirely confirms my good opinion of you and i give myself some credit for understanding a mans true character especially the character of a man like you my good friend ellis and i are entirely satisfied what has passed has removed all doubts and difficulties we are with you and shall report every thing to your advantage i wish you to report nothing but the truth i know it my dear fellow that is what we intend so without saying a word more on that subject we will now consider what is best to be done i understand that the edition about to be published is pirated and i suppose you will join us in an application to the lord chancellor for an injunction most eagerly that was my reason for wishing to see you so immediately after my arrival in town imagining that an application from lord idford and the bishop would be more readily attended to than if it came from a private and unknown individual to be sure it would mr trevor said enoch an application from an earl and a bishop is not likely to be overlooked they are privileged persons they are the higher powers every thing that concerns them must be treated with tenderness and reverence and humbleness and every thing of that kind the spirit moved me to begin an enquiry into privileges and the tenderness and humility due to earls and bishops particularly to such as the noble and reverend lords in question but glibly guessed my thoughts and took care to prevent me as to those subjects my dear ellis said he trevor thinks and acts on a different system from you and me and the rest of the world we must not dispute these points now but away as fast as we can and put the business for which we met in a train the publication must be stopped it would injure all parties and as you my dear friend turning to me justly think at present would be disgraceful to its author after what had been urged by turl and wilmot and the reasoning that had followed in my own mind i knew not how to deny this assertion though it was painfully grating but the reader will easily perceive that this and other strong affirmations such as i have related were designedly made by glibly he artfully gabbled on that he might lead my mind from attending to them too strictly and that he might afterward if occasion should require state them with the colouring that he should give as things uttered or allowed by me it ought not to be thought strange that i was deceived by glibly barefaced as his cunning would have appeared to a man more versed in the arts which overreaching selfishness daily puts in practice he confessedly came in behalf of a party concerned and as such a liberal mind would be prepared to expect a bias from him rather in favour of his client his face was smiling his tones were soft and smooth the words candor honesty and integrity were continually on his tongue he affected to be a disinterested arbitrator and allowed that his friend idford as he called him might or rather must be tainted with the vices of his station and class could a youth unhacknied in the world feeling that treachery was not native to the heart of man not suspecting on ordinary occasions that it could exist could such a tyro in hypocrisy be a fit antagonist for such an adept deceit will frequently escape immediate detection but it seldom leaves the person upon whom it is practised with that clearness of thought which communicates calm to the mind producing unruffled satisfaction and cheerful good temper chapter xii a lawyer and his poetical wife and daughters or the family of the quisques praise may give pain a babbler may bite more of the colouring of cunning a traders ideas of honesty and the small sum for which it may be sold we quitted the coffeehouse glibly in high spirits and enoch concluding things had been done as they should be but for my own part i experienced a confusion of intellect that did not suffer me to be so much at my ease i had an indistinct sense of being as passive as a blind man with his dog instead of taking the lead as i was entitled to have done i was led hurried away like a man down a mountain with a high wind at his back or traversing dark alleys holding by the coatflap of a guide of whose good intentions i was very far from having any certainty we proceeded however to the house of a solicitor in chancery who transacted business for the earl here glibly attentive to the plan he had pursued began by informing mr quisque the lawyer that he had come at the request of his dear friend trevor to entreat his aid in an affair of some moment mr trevor is a young gentleman my dear quisque that you will be proud to be acquainted with a man of talents a poet an orator an author a great genius an excellent scholar a fine writer turns a sentence or a rhyme with exquisite neatness very prettily i assure you i mention these circumstances my dear quisque because i know you have a taste for such things and so has mrs quisque and the two miss quisques and all the family i now and then see very pretty things of their writing in the ladys magazine an elegy on a robin redbreast the drooping violet a sonnet and others equally ecstatic quite charming rapturous elegant flowery sentimental some of them very smart and epigrammatic it is a family my dear trevor that you must become intimate with your merit entitles you to the distinction you will communicate your mutual productions you will polish and suggest charming little delicate emendations to each other before you favour the world with a sight of them the broadest and coarsest satire was never half so insulting to the feelings as the commonplace praise of glibly the barrenpated ellis caught one of the favourite diminutives of glibly and finished my panegyric by adding that he must say his friend mr trevor was a prodigious pretty genius who but must have been proud of such an introduction to the family of the quisques by such orators such eulogists and such friends acquainted with glibly and accustomed to hear him prate mr quisque seemed to listen to him without surprise pleasure or pain it was what he expected it was the man a machine that had no more meaning than a dutch clock repeating cuckoo as it strikes among gliblys acquaintance or as he called them his dear friends this was a common but a very false conclusion he had not adopted his customary cant without a motive the man who can persuade others that he gabbles in a pleasant but ridiculous and undesigning manner will lead them to suppose that his actions are equally incongruous and void of intention he will pass upon the world for an agreeable harmless fellow till his malignities are too numerous to escape notice and then where he was before welcomed with the hope of a laugh he will continue to be admitted from the dread of a bite a lawyer however feels less of this panic than the rest of mankind because he can bite again the cat o mountain will not attack the tiger glibly returned to the business in hand and again repeated that he was come at the request of his dear friend trevor to procure an injunction that should prevent the publication of a pamphlet which had been written against his friend idford and my lord the bishop of added enoch who is the author of it demanded quisque i am sir answered i for which my friend trevor is very sorry added glibly i instantly retorted a denial i never said any thing of the kind mr glibly but i should be very sorry indeed if it were published nay my dear fellow according to your own principles if i do not mistake them that which ought not to be published ought not to be written the remark was acute it puzzled me and i was silent he proceeded it is a business that admits of no delay i should be extremely chagrined extremely upon my honor that my dear friend trevor should commit himself to the public in this affair he that wantonly attacks the characters of others does but strike at his own i again eagerly replied the attack from me sir was not wanton it was provoked by acts of the most flagrant injustice glibly as eagerly interrupted me my dear fellow why are you so warm i was only delivering a general maxim i made no application of it and i am surprised that you should the traps of glibly were numberless and not to be escaped words are too equivocal and phrases too indefinite for men like him not to profit by their ambiguity to them a quirk in the sense is as profitable as a pun or a quibble in the sound they snap at them as dogs do at flies it is no less worthy of observation that though some of his actions seemed to laugh severity of moral principle out of countenance he continually repeated others which had his conduct been regulated by them would have ranked him among the most worthy of mankind after farther explanation from quisque it was admitted that the interest of all parties made it necessary for him to act with great diligence speed and caution through the whole of this scene glibly was consistent with himself in giving it such a turn and complexion as to make it requisite for the preservation of my character above the rest to prevent the pamphlet from being published if whenever i detected his drift i urged the true motives by which i was actuated he always immediately admitted them praised them and allowed them to be superlatively excellent but never failed to give them such an air as should suit the project he had conceived and allow of such an interpretation in future as would exculpate my opponents and criminate myself but he effected this with such fluency and so glossed over and coloured his intention that like profound darkness it was every where present but neither could be felt nor seen my own activity in this affair which if i meant to render my interference effectual was inevitable contributed to the same end i accompanied the whole party quisque being one to the shop of the publisher here i detailed the consequences as well to myself as to the earl and the bishop and vehemently denounced threats if the villany that was begun should be carried into execution not all the quieting hints of my assistants could keep my anger under i lost all patience at every word my utmost indignation was excited by so black a business the situation was not a new one to the dealer in the alphabet he was an old depredator and had before encountered angry authors and artful lawyers he was cool collected and unabashed not indeed entirely but sufficiently so to excite astonishment he affirmed the copyright to be his own would prove he had obtained it legally and would face any prosecution that we could bring he knew what he was about and was not to be frightened he had printed one edition and had no doubt that several would be sold he was an honest tradesman and must not be robbed of his profits what would the country be if it were not for trade it ought to be protected ay and would be too the law was as open to an industrious fair trader as to any lord in the land let him too be no loser and then it would be a different thing but as for big words they broke no bones and he knew his ground the hints of the honest trader were too broad to be misunderstood and quisque repliedi think you mean sir that you wish to be repaid the expence you have sustained the fellow answered with the utmost effrontery i have a right sir to be indemnified for the loss of my profits on the sale of the work anger and argument were equally vain there were two ways of proceeding silence and safety might be purchased or the law might be let loose on a knave who set it at defiance the one was secure the other problematical and replete with the danger which we wished to avert quisque asked him what was the sum that he demanded his reply was more moderate than from appearances we had reason to expect it was one hundred pounds glibly desired he would permit us to consult five minutes among ourselves he withdrew and the fluent agent remarked the sum was a trifle but trifling as it was he had no doubt but feelings of delicacy and honor would dictate that it ought to be jointly paid by the three parties principally concerned he had urged a motive which i knew not how to resist and i gave my assent by this manoeuvre he gained the point which he intended he implicated me as paying to suppress a pamphlet which according to his interpretation i at present allowed to be defamatory and unjust the money however was paid and the copies of the pamphlet were delivered and being determined if possible to avoid such another accident those that i had caused to be printed were dislodged from their garret both editions a single copy of each excepted were taken into the fields by night and burned and thus expired a production which had aided to drain my pocket waste my time and inflame my passions end of volume v volume vi chapter i a new and bold project conceived and executed by wakefield the difficulty of making principles agree with practice discussed fair promises on the part of an old offender the hopes they excite and the fears that accompany them the affair of the pamphlet being removed from my mind i had leisure to attend to the other difficulty that had lately crossed me by the possession which wakefield had illegally taken of effects which he asserted to be his in the double right of being heir to his uncle and the husband of my mother but which if my information were true appertained to me it may well be supposed i communicated all my thoughts to friends like evelyn wilmot and turl and endeavoured to profit by their advice law had lately undergone a serious examination from us all and it was then the general opinion among us that though it was impossible to avoid appealing to it on some occasions yet nothing but the most urgent cases could justify such appeals enquiries that were to be regulated not by a spirit of justice but by the disputatious temper of men whose trade it was to deceive and by statutes and precedents which they might or might not remember and which though they might equivocally and partially apply in some points in others had no resemblance such enquiries ought not lightly to be instituted neither ought the habitual vices which they engender both in lawyer and client nor the miseries they inflict upon the latter in particular and by their consequences upon all society to be promoted in the course of the conversation at the tavern when i dined and spent the afternoon with the false belmont this subject among others had occurred having told him that i had quitted all thoughts of the law he enquired into my motives and being full of the subject and zealous to detail its whole iniquity i not only urged the reasons that most militate against it both in principle and practice but in the warmth of argument declared that i doubted whether any man could bring an action against another without being guilty of injustice i considered crime and error as the same the structure of law i argued was erroneous therefore criminal and i protested against the attempting to redress a wrong already committed by the commission of more wrong the death of thornby happened immediately after this conversation took place and it is not to be supposed that a man like my young but inventive fatherinlaw could forget or fail in endeavouring to profit by such an incident one morning while at breakfast i received a note from him signed belmont in which he requested me again to dine and spend the afternoon with him alleging that an event had taken place in which he was deeply interested adding that he had been lately led to reflect on many of the remarks i had made and that he hoped the period was come when he should be able to change the system to which i was so inimical for one that better agreed with my own sentiments but that my advice was particularly necessary on the present occasion the note gave me pleasure that a man with such powers of mind and charms of conversation should have only a chance of changing from what he was to what i hoped was delightful and that he should call upon me for advice at such a juncture was flattering i answered that an engagement already formed prevented me from meeting him on that day but i appointed the next morning for an interview dining i declined as a hint that i disapproved the attempt he had made to entrap me the engagement i had was to accompany lady bray to one of the families acquainted with the mowbrays and where it was expected we should meet olivia and her aunt this expectation which kept my spirits in a flutter the whole day and increased to alarm and dread in the evening was disappointed whether from any real or a pretended accident on the part of the aunt who sent an apology was more than i had an opportunity to know i kept my appointment on the following morning and was rather surprised when we met at perceiving that the still pretended belmont like myself was in deep mourning i began to make enquiries to which he gave short answers and turning the interrogatories upon me asked which of my relations was dead my mother oh i remember mrs wakefield are you still as angry with her husband as ever i really cannot tell though i have what most people would think much greater cause indeed what has he done more taken possession of property which is mine by what right is it yours it was bequeathed me by my grandfather and since that by his executor the uncle of this wakefield i think you told me yes a lawyer one thornby who was induced by deathbed terrors to restore what he had robbed me of while living that is he lived a knave and died a fool and a fanatic i suspect that he died as he had lived knavery and fanaticism are frequently coupled and how do you intend to proceed i do not know i have not yet consulted a lawyer consulted a lawyer you surprise me when last i saw you i was half convinced by you that a man cannot justly seek redress at law its sources you proved to be corrupt its powers inadequate and its decisions never accurate therefore never just this was your language you reprobated those accommodating rules by which i endeavoured to obtain happiness and urged arguments that made a deep impression upon me now that selfinterest gives you an impulse are your principles become as pliant as mine which you so seriously reproved i paused and then repliedi imagine you take some delight in having found an opportunity of retorting upon me and of laughing at what you still consider as folly indeed you mistake i hope by reminding you of your own doctrine to induce you to put it in practice the virtue that consists only in words is but a vapour surely you will allow this is an extreme if not a doubtful case i do not mean to commence an action till i have considered it very seriously but i presume you do not require infallibility of me or if you do it is what i cannot expect from myself i have frequently been led to doubt whether principles the most indubitable must not bend to the mistakes and institutions of society this doubt is to me the most painful that can cross the mind but it is one from which i cannot wholly escape your tone i find is greatly altered how strenuous how firm how founded were all your maxims when last we met and so i am persuaded the maxims of truth will always remain then why depart from them another of them which i likewise recollect to have heard from you is that the laws which pretend to regulate property whether by will entail or any other descent are all unjust for that effects of all kinds should be so appropriated as to produce the greatest good i do not see how that can be denied but this is strongly to the point in my favour as i suppose for the institutes of society render the application of the principle impracticable and therefore i think the property may have a greater chance of being applied to a good purpose if allotted to me than if retained by this wakefield whose vices are extraordinary you believe him to be a man of some talent all that know him affirm his understanding would be of the first order were it worthily employed then would it not be a good application of the property in contest if it should both enable and induce him so to employ his understanding oh of that there is no hope how do you know i believe you have thought the same of me but you may chance to be mistaken and now i will tell you a secret i am in the very predicament of this wakefield a relation is dead who has left his property away from me by what right is more than i can discover at least in the spirit of those laws which pretend to regulate such matters for their spirit is force lands wrested from the helpless they consign to the robber i am in possession and doubt whether even according to your code i ought to resign i certainly ought not according to my own i will acknowledge to you that i think well of the man who claims the property i withhold but i cannot think so well of him as of myself for i cannot be so well acquainted with his thoughts as with my own i know my own wants my own powers and my own plans i should be glad to do him good but i should be sorry to do myself ill you accuse me of having fallen into erroneous habits of making false calculations and of tasting pleasures that are dangerous and of short duration i have ridiculed your arguments but i have not forgotten them neither has the enquiring spirit that is abroad been unknown to or unnoticed by me early powers of mind gave me the early means of indulgence i revelled in pleasure squandered all i could procure and was led by one successful artifice to another till i became what i can certainly no otherwise justify than by the selfish spirit of the world in this i find the rule is for each to seize on all that he can with safety and to swallow hoard or waste it at will i have attempted to profit by vice which i knew not how to avoid but if there be a safer road to happiness i am no idiot i am as desirous of pursuing it as you can be the respect of the world the security from pains and penalties and the approbation of my own heart are all of them as dear to me as to you i have thought much have had much experience and have the power of comparing facts and sensations as largely perhaps as another i will not deny that to trick selfishness by its own arts to laugh at its stupidity and to outwit its contemptible cunning are practices that have tickled my vanity and have perhaps formed one of my chief sources of pleasure but habit and pleasure led me to extend such projects and to prey upon the wellmeaning and the kind with almost as much avidity as on those of an opposite character however though i did not want plausible arguments in my own justification i cannot affirm that my heart was wholly at ease new thoughts have occurred other prospects have been contemplated and my dissatisfaction has increased you cannot but have remarked that in the course of human life most men undergo more than one remarkable change the sober man becomes a drunkard the drunkard sober and the spendthrift sometimes a rational economist though perhaps more frequently a miser yet though i am disposed to alter my conduct supposing me to possess the means of bidding defiance to mankind i have no inclination to subject myself to their neglect their pity or their scorn be it want of courage or want of wisdom i have not an intention to shut myself out from society if i may be admitted on fair and liberal terms i am content but i honestly tell you admitted i will be i have shut the door of dependency upon myself were i so inclined offices of trust would not be committed to me and to live rejected in poverty and wretchedness pointed at and pretended to be despised by the knaves and fools with whom the world is filled is a condition to which i will never submit consequently the property of which i have possessed myself i am in either case determined to use every effort to keep if i am suffered to keep it quietly my present inclinations are what i have been describing if contention must come we must then have a trial of skill upon the opposite system i listened to this discourse attentive to every sentence anxious for the next and agitated by various contradictory emotions i saw the difficulties of the supposed case and knew not what to answer or what to advise that a man like this should become what he seemed half to promise was a thought that consoled and expanded the heart but that it should depend upon so improbable an event as that of another renouncing a claim which the law gave him to property in dispute was a most painful alternative my sensations were of hope suddenly kindled and as suddenly killed after waiting some time without any reply from me he added let us suppose mr trevor a whimsical or if you please a strange coincidence between the man with whom you have been so angry and myself i mean wakefield what if he felt some of the sober propensities toward which i find a kind of a call in myself he is not to be trusted in him it would be artifice or at least nobody would believe it could be any thing else mark now what chance there is in a world like this for a man whom it has once deemed criminal to reform oppressed insulted and pursued by the good what resource has he but to associate with the wicked he that with the fairest seeming and the most specious pretences affirming time after time that though he had deceived before he now was honest he that shall yet again and again repeat his acts of infamy cannot complain if no man should be willing to trust his happiness to such keeping i find what i am to expect from you the very same will be said of me no you have not been equally unprincipled and vile these are coarse or at least harsh terms however i take them to myself and affirm that i have how can you make such an affirmation how do you know a man may calculate on probabilities and this is a moment in which i do not wish to conceal the full estimate which i make of my own conduct from you being therefore seriously and speaking to the best of my judgment as culpable as wakefield let my course of life hereafter be what it will i find i am to expect no credit for sincerity from you you do not know wakefield neither it seems do you there is something in your countenance in your conversation and in the free and undisguised honesty even of your vices that a man like wakefield cannot possess have you forgotten that though i can be open and honest i can be artful do you not remember billiards hazard and bath yes but wakefield would be incapable of the qualities of mind which you are now displaying with you i feel myself in the company of a man of a perverted but a magnanimous spirit with all your faults i could hug you to my heart but wakefield who made women and men alike his prey to whose devilish arts the virtue and happiness of an amiable i may say a charming woman were sacrificed and the life of one of the first of mankind was endangered that he should resemble you and especially that he should resemble you with your present inclinations oh would that were possible there is generosity in the wish it denotes a power in you of allaying one of the most active fiends that torment mankind the spirit of revenge it is a spirit i own to which i have been too subject and which i could wish to exorcise for ever put it to the test let us suppose you should discover as much of promise in wakefield as you imagine you do in me i should then put him to the test i should demand of him to repair the wrongs he has done miss wilmot what if you should find him already so disposed impossible or if he were it would be with some design ay perhaps a proposition that you should leave him quietly possessed of the disputed property and having obtained that he would desert his second wife as he had done his first there is some difference between a young woman and an old one beside if your account be true mrs wakefield though she was your mother was very inferior to miss wilmot you forget that he seduced this lady and deserted her i have heard or read of a man who after being divorced even from a wife became more passionately in love with her than ever wakefield is incapable of love you frame to yourself a most black and deformed being of this wakefield and you suppose a degree of sympathy between yourself and him which cannot exist why not his wit person and manners i have heard you describe as winning i only gave the picture which i had from an affectionate though a most injured woman i recollect the story perfectly when you repeated it notwithstanding my raillery i was more moved than you had reason to imagine i am persuaded that wakefield himself had he listened to it would have felt a few uneasy sensations i fear not why so is he made of materials totally different from other men dissect him and i imagine you will find he has a heart but of what quality better than you at present seem to give him credit for what grounds have you for thinking so favourably of him very excellent dont be surprised i know the man is it possible where is the wonder knaves of other classes associate and why should not gamblers it may be then you are deputed to speak in his behalf i wrote to you and introduced this conversation for that very purpose i know him as intimately as i can know any man i would speak of him as of myself of his defects as of my own and i declare it as my opinion that if he might be permitted to enjoy his uncles property in peace he would change his system to this property he supposes he has the best claim he is thornbys heir at law and as to the manner in which the wealth he left was acquired if a general inquisition were made into the original right to every species of property he is persuaded that ninetynine rich men in a hundred would be turned into the streets to beg what you have related has greatly surprised me you have pleaded and continue to plead his cause very powerfully but have you no consideration for me granting all you have supposed in his favour possible am i so situated as to justify a romantic renunciation of claims which if asserted may aid me to accomplish my dearest hopes to a man like you perhaps i could be contented to resign these claims i need not say perhaps i am certain i could were i thoroughly persuaded you would forsake a life of artifice and plunder and were i myself only concerned but that is not the case i have an object to accomplish so dear to my heart that it swallows up lesser considerations and will not allow me to neglect any honest means by which it may be promoted wealth to me is indispensible wealth that shall place me on a level with a rich and proud family with which i have to contend i have an impulse such perhaps as you have never felt there is a woman in the world endowed with such qualities that to say i passionately love her is a most impotent expression of what i feel for to tenderness and ardour of affection must be added all that simplicity purity and grandeur of soul can inspire to think of life without her is to think of a world sterile desolate and joyless of a night to which day shall never succeed and of existence arrested and chained in motionless despondency which might be very pitiful or very sublime just as you please but which would be very absurd granted but this is the fever of my mind the disease to which should my hopes be disappointed i feel myself dangerously impelled the interpretation of all which is that though you have discovered principles which if pursued would secure to yourself and mankind in general certain happiness and that though you can deal forth their dogmas and point out the path which others indubitably ought to take yet when your own passions are concerned you act like the rest of the world and you do this not blindly as they do but with your eyes open at the moment that you are reminded of your maxims and acknowledge their truth your accusation is premature i have hitherto done nothing more than express my feelings and my doubts but these doubts spurred on by these feelings assure me that you will proceed against wakefield you may think yourself assured i conceive myself to be uncertain i would willingly condemn myself to great punishment were it to promote any plan of the goodness of which there should be a conviction i can even suppose cases in which i would not only devote my life for that in comparison appears to be a trifle but would resign the woman whom my soul adores sacrifices like these however cannot be expected on light occasions the good to be obtained ought to be evidently greater than the evil to be endured he paused a moment to collect his ideas and then replied if mr trevor you are the man of that eminent virtue which i have sometimes thought you and to which by your discourse to me you have certainly made very lofty pretensions i would advise you to reflect on what i shall once more state i know that this wakefield of whom you think so ill and who has been quite as guilty as you have supposed is now inclined to be a different man i would have you consider first to whom does the property in justice belong i think you will find that to be doubtful next supposing it to be legally yours may you not nevertheless be defrauded of it by law and lastly appeal to your own principles and ask yourself whether it be not better that you should have a chance of doing the good which you conceive would be done by recovering such a man as wakefield to that respect in society by which his talents might be well employed or whether it can be consistent with your own sense of right to take methods which you acknowledge to be precarious and unjust in order to dispossess him and to appropriate that to yourself to which if you are impartial you will perhaps find it difficult to prove even to your own satisfaction that you have a clear and undoubted claim through this whole scene instead of diverting my attention from the argument by gay raillery witty allusions or a recurrence to the depravity of man and the practice of the world he kept closely to the question preserved the tone of earnest discussion and having uttered what i have last repeated took his leave with that serious air which he had thus unexpectedly assumed and maintained chapter ii the plan of wakefield pursued and the hopes and fears of an affectionate woman news of philip an artless exculpatory tale quitting the place meditating on the scene that had passed surprised at every part of it at the interested manner of the man at the intimate knowledge which he professed to have of wakefield at the promises and the threats which he appeared to make in his name at the coincidence not only of their characters if his account were true but at their similar incidents of fortune and corresponding inclinations to reform astonished while i recollected these various particulars instead of returning immediately to my lodgings i called on miss wilmot when i came to the door i had scarcely decided with myself whether it were advisable to relate what had passed to her which as she was personally in question i thought myself bound to do whenever it could be done with safety or whether if related at present it might not excite hopes that would be disappointed and anxieties prejudicial to her peace she no sooner saw me than she exclaimedi am very glad you are come mr trevor i have two unexpected affairs on which i wish to consult you one of them relates to myself and i will begin with that because you are not only concerned in it but are appealed to in a very remarkable manner i have received two extraordinary letters by both of which i have been not a little affected pray read this first it is from mr wakefield the promises it contains the style it assumes and the appeal it makes are so strange as to appear either like miracle or romance she then gave me a letter and i read as follows should you imagine lydia that because i have long forborn all intercourse with you i have forgotten you be assured you are mistaken i have treated you so shamefully and deceived you so often that i have little right to expect you should believe my professions be moved by my intreaties or remember me with any other feelings than those of hatred yet to deal sincerely with you this is what i do not expect i have had such proofs of the kindness of your heart and the strength of your affection that my confidence is still entire it is the more unshaken because my own intentions are direct of which the plainness with which i shall deliver my thoughts will i imagine be some proof i once more repeat i have behaved to you like a spare me the word it is enough to recollect that i have been the thing i could plead the extreme vivacity of my youth my ungovernable passions and the dangerous temptation of critical moments but that i will not exhibit any feature of pitiful apology or endeavour to extenuate what i cannot defend you are intimate with mr trevor you know that his mother my late wife is dead and you have heard of a will said to have been left by my uncle i feel but little scruple in affirming that i imbibed many of the vices of my early youth from being placed under this uncles care that such a man should die like a coward and endeavour to disinherit a relation to save his soul supposing this disinheritance to be true would be no miracle it would only be an act of contemptible stupidity i will not here enter into any enquiries of a legal kind for i will be open enough to own that being in possession both in right of my wife and as the heir of my uncle of the property he left and determined as i am to assert my claims which i think paramount to those of any other person i will not commit myself even to you on the contrary i write this letter purposely that you may shew it to mr trevor you will ask my motive for this and perhaps will be surprised at my answer by certain whimsical accidents i have become acquainted with mr trevors principles i believe or i rather know him to be possessed of a heart and understanding equally excellent i wish to appeal to them both when he shall read this he will have had a conversation relating to me which may have led him to expect the language i am about to use in an argument concerning property he cannot forget that he lately delivered himself thus if i strictly adhere to the principle of justice i must not singly consider my own wishes which may create innumerable false wants and crave to have them gratified i must ask is there no being within my knowledge who may be more benefited by the enjoyment of that which i am desirous to appropriate to myself than i can if so what right have i to prefer self gratification to superior utility mine is a case in point again property is left for which he may be induced to contend and which should he do so will probably be dissipated in law if not it may with no less probability be decided by law to be mine he affirms that to contend at law is immoral do you and he listen to what i have now to say i am desirous of totally changing my conduct i have a heart more capable of affection than you lydia have reason to suppose and i love you my ambition at present is to do you much more good than i have ever done you harm i am once more at my own disposal and unless that ardent love which you formerly bore me be entirely changed which i do not believe it is i am now sincerely desirous to make you my wife but i will not deceive you i can only be such a husband as you desire on condition of being left in quiet possession of that which i believe to be my own i have ruined my character offices of emolument are not easily obtained but if they were i am not a man to be trusted i will not live a beggar deprived of all the blessings in which the fools around me wallow till they turn them into curses i wish to live happily unmolesting and unmolested but if i must either prey or be preyed upon i am still resolved rather to act the fox than the goose i know you will condemn this determination but i am speaking openly and telling you what my intentions are without entering into their defence supposing mr trevor to be convinced that the law will decide the property contested in his favour the sacrifice demanded of him is perhaps too great to be expected from any man yet from what i have heard and what i know this is the sacrifice that i do expect i expect it from his abhorrence of pretending to seek justice by the aid of law i expect it from that principle which decides in favour of the greatest good and i expect it from the earnest desire i have heard him express that you might be restored to that happiness which for a time you have lost should he or you conclude that the motives i now urge originate in that artifice of which i have been very justly accused i ought perhaps to feel no surprise and shall certainly make no complaint but believe me or believe me not i have spoken with a sincerity of heart for which i am likely to gain but little credit such i feel at this moment are the misfortunes to which cunning subjects itself i am a man but little subject to fear yet i own the fear of being thought still to possess nothing better than this cunning assaults me obliges me to omit the tender epithets that are in my thoughts and without addition to sign myself f wakefield while i read the eyes of miss wilmot were fixed upon my countenance whenever i looked toward her i could perceive the strong emotions of hope and fear by which she was agitated when i had ended i saidmr wakefield is indeed an extraordinary man be his intentions honest or base the strength and clearness of his mind and his knowledge of the human heart when we recollect how these faculties have been employed are truly astonishing if this be a plan of artifice it is little less than miraculous yet who can believe it to be any thing else miss wilmot heaved a deep sigh and attempted to speak but she only stammered her utterance failed and her eyes were cast on the floor hope and despair were combating and the latter was the strongest she wished to confide she wished to plead for the possibility of his being sincere but the mischief he had inflicted the deceit he had practised and a remembrance of the picture she had formerly given me of him rushed upon her mind and her spirits sunk look up lovely lydia said i taking her hand and revive there is there must be hope the man who could write this letter cannot be all villain the struggle of the passions was violent a momentary wildness such as i had formerly witnessed flashed in her eyes she started from her seat griped my hand then bursting into tears exclaimedoh mr trevor and dropped down again upon the chair eager to relieve a heart so overcharged i again addressed her if said i the property left by mr wakefields uncle can really be employed to so noble a purpose as that of reclaiming him and making you happy let me perish rather than endeavour to counteract such blessings let me be the thing he so much dreads a beggar but let me obey the purest passions of the heart when they are sanctioned by the best principles of the understanding till this instant she had forgotten that if i consented to enrich him i must rob myself but the thought no sooner occurred than she cried no it must not be it cannot be to require it of you is infamous it debases him and would make me hate myself were i to participate in such an action you judge too severely i replied i am not so unfortunately circumstanced as he is my character is not lost i am not shut out of society i have friends plans and prospects and granting him to be sincere his arguments as far as they relate to him and me are i suspect unanswerable of that sincerity i would fain not doubt but it is our mutual duty to be wary here therefore at present the matter shall rest i am determined to bring no action till time and future events shall teach me the course i ought to pursue overwhelmed by a sense of obligation and by the thronging emotions of every kind that assailed her she was again half suffocated with passion as she recovered her eyes sufficiently spoke her feelings when she grew calm she was led to ask what conversation i had had and with whom relative to mr wakefield i gave her the history of my acquaintance with the supposed belmont and of the scene that had passed that very day which she thought altogether surprising and seemed to shrink with the fear that it was an artful plan contrived by artful men she was in some sort appeased however when i once more reminded her of my determination to wait and hope for the best i then enquired concerning the second letter she had mentioned to which she answeredit is addressed to me as a mediator but relates entirely to you and the person who wrote it your poor penitent servant philip she gave it me and these were its contents honoured madam i make bold to lay my case before you which as it is very grievous i hope it may move you to pity me i am the young man that lived with my honoured master mr trevor in the same house madam that you are pleased to live my name is philip i have been guilty of a very great fault for which my conscience worries me night and day so that i am sure i shall never forgive myself though i take my holy saviour to witness it was more a mistake than a thought of committing so wicked a crime i was in a flurry so that i did not know what i was about for to think of having robbed a master that was so kind to me is such a sin and a shame as never was but i had no notion but that my poor dear master had drowned himself in the river and so as he had told me the day before to make up my account and he would pay me the next morning i thought it was hard that i should lose my wages and the money beside which i had laid out for washing and newspapers and tea and sugar and other materials of that kind which though my wages was only eight pounds eight shillings made up the whole to twelve pounds five and threepence three farthings which was the reason to make me do so base a thing as it would else have been as to break open the box and take out a ten pound note and four pair of stockings and two waistcoats because i knew very well my masters kindness so that it is ten to one if he had lived to make his will he would have given me them and more after which i hurried away being as i was told of a place with an old master that i was sure would take me again but i had no more thought that mr trevor was living than the child unborn which since i discovered i have never been at rest being out of place and having nobody now to ask for a character which is the greatest misfortin that can behappen a poor servant that never was guilty of such an action as breaking open his masters box and running away with his money and things in all my life before or since so that i was tempted to list for a soldier but that i happened honoured madam to meet your maid mary and she persuaded me to write to mr trevor which i durst not do though i know his goodness so she said your honoured ladyship would be so kind and tender hearted as to lay my case before mr trevor and my dear and honoured mistress miss mowbray both of which i would run to the worlds end to serve on which she said she was sure they would take my case into merciful consideration and grant me their gracious forgiveness which is the humble petition of your distressed servant to command honoured madam philip franks poor fellow forgive thee what is thy crime an inaccuracy a mistake of judgment a desire to do thyself right without intentional wrong to me or any one yet for this mistake differently circumstanced thou mightest have lost thy life and have been hanged like a dog i too accused thee of robbery of taking more than thy due when thou tookest less hadst thou offered thy old waistcoats and stockings to a street hawker he would not have given thee half the surplus that was thy due such were the reflections that broke from me after perusing his simple but affecting defence mary was called up and questioned she knew where he lived for the poor little inclined to suspicion confide in each other it is the rich only that tempt them to be treacherous after consulting with miss wilmot it was determined that she should write to olivia enclosing philips letter and requesting her to give him a character i knew she would take care to see him paid the wages that were his due and as i had been the cause of his want of employment since the fright he took at cranfordbridge i left money to reimburse him for the loss of his time from that period the people i mixed with and the prejudices of the world required that i should keep a servant but though the man that was with me was by no means so great a favourite as philip had been i did not think i had sufficient cause to discharge him for another there was an additional motive for not wishing philip to be my servant again at least not under my present circumstances olivias aunt had imagined we were in league at cranfordbridge and should she see him once more in my service that suspicion might either be revived or strengthened chapter iii the period of contention approaches and the unabated patriotism of the baronet hector and the earl become enemies and i am made the subject of newspaper calumny threatening appearances a journey projected a tragical event giving occasion to the practice of some small portion of humanity the dissolution of parliament was hourly expected flying reports fixed it to happen on different days but none of them very distant the zeal of sir barnard in behalf of his country and its constitution was unabated the measures of ministry were wicked beyond example and the servility of parliament was unequalled since the time of the tudors such was the baronets continual theme from him and the political circles i frequented i heard news in which i might be said to be personally concerned in consequence of the firm refusal of olivia a rupture had taken place between lord idford and the family much at first to the regret of the mowbrays till the turn that the quarrel took enflamed the latter hector mowbray had great property and influence in the county of which he and i were both natives of this county the earl was the lord lieutenant and here he likewise had his dependents and partisans the mowbrays were wealthy and hector was ambitious of being elected knight of the shire when it was first proposed the aunt forwarded the project for there was no probability that any other candidate so powerful should start the joint interest of the earl and the mowbrays would defy opposition the earl however understood traffic and finding himself so positively refused by olivia he thought proper to inform the family that she must either be induced to consent or instead of aiding to bring hector into parliament he should himself propose and support another candidate with the whole weight of his interest the threat was galling it was insinuated first to the aunt and when hector was informed of it he affected to vapour and treat it with defiance but on better consideration he and the aunt thought proper to importune olivia hoping they should oblige her to comply threats and intreaties alike were vain her resolution was not to be shaken and the earl more openly declared that if she should think proper to persist he would beggar himself rather than hector should carry his election hector had been canvassing the county had subscribed to races been present at the assizes given public dinners and taken various means to increase his popularity of which he had become inordinately vain inflated therefore with a certainty of victory he threw down the gauntlet and dared the earl to the field in the mean time paragraphs appeared in a morning and an evening paper both of them sold to government and the echoes of each other that were evidently aimed at me and my connections at first i could not have conceived how i should have attracted the attention of those worthy gentlemen who earn their bread by the daily manufactory of lampoons but i was soon informed that this is become a regular branch of business and that the motives to carry it on are many these motives originate in paymasters of various descriptions of whom the treasury is supposed to be the chief the libels of which i was the subject aimed to be satirical but were too dull of wing to hit their mark they were only malignant they could neither tickle the fancy nor gall the heart but they proved that i had lurking enemies who wished to wound did they but know when and where to strike it was well known that my professedly dear friend glibly was principally concerned in the morning paper where these libels generally appeared when i first became acquainted with him he affected indifference to parties and was ready to praise or laugh at either as circumstances should happen to direct him but when the temper of the times became intolerant and acrimonious he thought it prudent to take a decided part that such a man should declare in favour of the weakest was not to be expected and he now associated with the known hirelings of ministry of whom i was a still more open and undisguised opponent by these attacks on me glibly therefore for they were undoubtedly a part of his handywork glibly i say had a threefold motive he indulged a propensity which strange to say he had acquired of wounding in the dark that he might smile and shake hands with the insulted person in broad day he answered the end for which ministry retained him that of decrying all its antagonists and he particularly forwarded the views of another of his dear friends the earl the general complexion of paragraphs like these is falsehood which is sometimes direct though it is more commonly a perversion of existing facts the pamphlet i had written which had been partially made known to the public by the advertisement that had appeared the patronage of sir barnard my ambitious views on the mowbray family with such other particulars as the indefatigable glibly could collect sometimes delivered in obscure allusions and at others more openly were the topics of calumny how many of these ingenious devices to irritate and injure were framed i never knew for i seldom read them myself though i heard of them sufficiently often to be assured that they were numerous there were various means by which they might have been stopped and of which in ordinary cases bribing is chiefly practised but in this instance fighting or the law would have been more effectual of these however i totally disapproved defamation is an evil but death is generally and perhaps always a greater and to prevent enquiry is among the worst of evils i was not yet sufficiently acquainted however with the mistakes to which men are subject or rather impelled by the institutions they admire not to feel great surprise and some indignation at the obstacles which i found were continually to impede my career he who has never travelled into the country of mosquitoes is not aware how slight a network covering will preserve him from their sting these were trifles and would have been unworthy of notice had they not resembled the small cloudy speck which though scarcely visible in the distant horizon approaches and swells and bursts over the head in a storm the beginning contest between the earl and the mowbray family the interest which the worthy mr glibly had thought proper to take in me and my affairs the patriotism of sir barnard nay the friendship of mr evelyn himself that best of men were but so many links in the chain of that fate which was impending at present however with respect to the baronet i daily increased in favour he frequently requested me to accompany him when he went down to the house and paraded with me arm in arm through the avenues catching every man he knew by the button and introducing me then descanting on the news of the day the victories of the minister among his creatures and in the house and the defeats of his projects every where else at length it was generally affirmed and believed that parliament would be dissolved in a fortnight and as sir barnard wished to keep well with his borough he proposed that we should go down and visit the worthy and independent electors among whom he observed we might spend a few days in a pleasant manner and advantageously to his interest till the writ of election should be issued this was on the wednesday but as there was to be a debate and probably a division of the house on friday his sense of public duty would not permit him to be absent on such an occasion and we agreed to defer our journey till saturday morning during this short interval an incident occurred which it is necessary i should relate it happened on the thursday that after spending the day near richmond where i had been invited to dine i was returning home on horseback followed by my servant for i thought myself obliged to practise some part of that aristocracy which i nevertheless very sincerely condemned the night was starlight and as we were cantering down a lane at the entrance of barnes common we heard distant cries and the report of a pistol in the direction as we believed in which we were proceeding i immediately stopped and listened very attentively but all was soon silent being convinced as well by the cries as the firing of the pistol that a robbery if not something worse had been committed and not certainly knowing from what point the sound came i rode gently forward and continued to listen with the utmost attention desiring my servant to do the same we rode on still walking our horses and looking cautiously round for some time without any sight or sound of man approaching us till we came to a gate at the edge of the common here i saw a horse standing patiently without his rider and stopping once more to look and listen i presently perceived an indistinct object which i discovered to be a man wounded and weltering in his blood i spoke to him but no answer was returned nor any sound i then raised the body in my arms and it appeared to be lifeless what was to be done a human being who might be dead or might not in either case must not be left in such a situation the neighbourhood is populous and i could distinguish lights at no very great distance fearing lest if i sent my servant he should blunder or that the persons he might address himself to would be less likely to pay attention to him than to me i bade him remain by the dead or wounded man and mounting my horse i rode away immediately to procure aid my direction was across the common and fortunately i met with a carriage which proved to be a hackney coach returning to town with two passengers i ordered the coachman to stop and he immediately supposed i was a highwayman but being undeceived he refused to go out of his way for the purpose i required the persons within hearing a kind of squabble and understanding when they listened the nature of it spoke to me and enquired into the particulars by good luck they happened to feel properly and joined me against the coachman who though unwillingly was obliged to submit and when he came to the point where the roads join to turn back and receive the wounded man into the carriage the passengers alighted i ordered my man to take the horse of the stranger in charge and we proceeded slowly to the first inn here i immediately enquired for surgical and medical assistance and as the people of these villages are many of them opulent good practitioners were presently procured while the messengers were dispatched i had leisure to examine the stranger whose appearance figure and countenance were altogether extremely interesting his hair was abundant but milk white his features were serene and his form in despite of age was still manly the benevolence of his countenance was heightened by the blood with which his locks were in part clotted and that had streamed over his face upon his clothes and linen the medical gentlemen arrived nearly at the same time the stranger was examined the pulsation of the heart was perceptible and though the contusions on the head and the temple were violent and he had been shot in the shoulder so that the ball had passed through behind they were of opinion as there was no fracture of the skull that the wounds were not mortal the appearance of the stranger and the condition in which i found him had made a lively impression upon me i was fearful of leaving him in an unknown place amidst the casualties and hurry of an inn to the care of waiters and the neglect of persons who had scarcely leisure to be humane i therefore determined to send my servant to town and stay with him that night i had an appointment and other business in the morning but i could be at london in less than an hour that was therefore no obstacle hoping to have discovered his place of abode i desired his pockets to be searched before the people present but they were entirely emptied and contained no paper or memorandum that could afford information after some time by the aid which was procured his pulse began to quicken and his lungs to do their office and that nothing might be omitted i prevailed on the physician to remain with me at his bedside and attend to every symptom above half the night with this he the more willingly complied because he was apprehensive of fever when the circulation should recover all its elasticity in the morning though very unwillingly i was obliged to forsake my charge but not till i had left money with the physician who made himself accountable to the innkeeper for all expences being a humane person i believe he would have done this without my interference but in addition to that every mark about the stranger his look his dress and the horse on which he was mounted denoted him to be a gentleman and when i left him though the physician thought it was probable he might not recover the use of his understanding and the power of speech for a day or two he yet was persuaded that he would not die chapter iv an incident in the park or the danger of unruly dogs and horses the fortitude and affection of olivia a visit to the wounded stranger knowing the habits of sir barnard to be precise and pettish so that if i counteracted the arrangement he had made it would put him into a disagreeable temper i resolved as we were to depart early the next morning to return as soon as possible to the stranger about two in the afternoon i was riding through the park for this purpose and here another incident occurred which though it excited extreme terror it afterward afforded uncommon delight a few days before i had witnessed a lady on a runaway horse who was seized with fright dropped from the saddle and bruised herself exceedingly she would have been in no danger if she had behaved but with the ordinary resolution of a man and the accident led me to reflect on the ill education to which women are subjected they seem to be esteemed by men in proportion as they are helpless timid and dependent it is supposed they cannot be affectionate unless their leading feature be imbecility just as i had crossed the bridge over the serpentine river two ladies and a gentleman with their grooms all on horseback were turning round and went off in a hand gallop toward kensington gardens i was riding fast at no great distance and perceived it to be olivia her aunt and some person whom i did not know olivia was mounted on a fine blood horse and a large dog rushed by him in pursuit of me being tempted by my fast galloping the horse of olivia had previously been put upon his mettle i saw the danger and instantly pulled up but he began to plunge and kick in a manner that would have unhorsed most men the dog then turned from me and attacked the animal that was highest in motion and the horse immediately set off full speed the foolish servant being frightened began to gallop after her i was obliged to do the same and stop him for the clattering of feet behind did but increase the fury of the runaway horse terrified however as i was when i first noticed the vicious propensities of the horse the courage of olivia was such her seat was so firm and she kept so steady a hold of the strong curb rein that i felt a confidence she would overpower the horse if the fear and folly of some other person should do no mischief i therefore followed at a proper distance and when i saw several horsemen who attempted to cross her i shouted and waved my hat for them to keep off my hopes were justified she avoided every danger by her management and presence of mind and by her use of the curb and the aid of the wall at the end of the ride arrested the course of the intemperate animal having kept the grooms back i was the first that came up with her and leaping from my saddle i seized the reins and held them till the servant arrived i then enjoyed one more rapturous moment such as i had indeed but little foreseen i received her in my arms not a minute before how firm and collected had her mind and actions been but no sooner did she feel my embrace than her frame was suffused a thousand ideas that had no relation to the danger which her own fortitude had escaped immediately rushed upon her she sunk upon my shoulder and burst into a flood of tears they were the heart casings of ten thousand of the foregone anxieties of love how could i have hated the broad day and the prying eyes that were upon us how welcome would the fogs and darkness of cranfordbridge have been my adventurous spirit would then have surely imprinted the first kiss of love as chaste as it would have been ecstatic this bliss alas was not to be the crowd approached i pressed her hand and as an assurance of fidelity she gently returned the token of kindness such mute signs being all that were permitted perceiving i must leave her i again requested she would not mount the unruly horse and she replied with a heavenly smile have no fear for me i will be careful of myself to which she added in a low whisper for my preservers sake oh moments of unutterable bliss who can estimate your worth one of you will outweigh a life such as the dull round of common place nothings can yield did not my eyes thank her did not the strong workings of my colour and countenance inform her of what was passing within oh yes and in the same language she involuntarily replied he who shall suppose there was one emotion which celestial purity might not approve cannot comprehend olivia they were emanations such as those only who have souls as well as bodies are acquainted with the tide of ecstacy must turn the aunt came up i bowed she returned my salute in a manner that shewed her mind was affected by contradictory emotions and i mounted my horse and guided his head toward the park gate through which i passed feeling at the moment that i was passing the gate of paradise i had not however left all my heaven behind me no i bore with me ample stores for delicious revery the fortitude of olivia the firm and easy grace with which she kept her seat her admirable management and quick presence of mind her unabating courage at one moment and her melting tenderness at the next were not the food but the feast of love in this revelry of the imagination i indulged till i arrived at the inn where i found the physician agreeable to appointment and was informed by him that the stranger still continued insensible but that the symptoms appeared to be rather more than less favourable i remained with the patient during some hours till the necessary preparation for my journey obliged me to depart i then left a sufficient sum with the physician and after most earnestly recommending the stranger to his care reluctantly returned to town though i had obtained a promise from the physician that the patient should be removed to his own home as soon as it should be discovered or to the house of the physician whenever it might be done without danger i yet could not help questioning whether to leave him to the mercy of persons with whom i was unacquainted that i might take a journey to visit the free and independent electors of an english borough were faithfully to fulfill the duties of humanity add to which the venerable and benevolent appearance of the stranger was so uncommonly interesting that it made a strong impression upon my imagination but it was necessary to decide and i acted as mortals are obliged to do on such occasions not knowing what was best i adopted that which appeared to be the most urgent chapter v the journey to the borough of the baronet independent electors and their motives satisfactorily explained evil communication corrupts good manners electors eager to make hay while the sun shines and being once bought wish again to be bribed the following morning at the hour appointed sir barnard and i set off for the borough of at which we arrived without delay or accident the number of voters was little more than thirty and the first business after our arrival was to invite them to a dinner it has long been remarked that men in a body will be guilty of actions of which individually they would each be ashamed in an assembly however the purpose of which is conscious iniquity few who have not witnessed such scenes will be aware of the efforts that each man will make to argue himself into a belief of his own upright intentions or of the eager assent with which his endeavours will be seconded by his associates in the present instance for example what were the motives of the worthy electors sir barnard explained them to the perfect satisfaction of all parties but what were they the love of the constitution the honest struggles that honest men were making to displace a corrupt minister their very eager and laudable attempts to free an oppressed and ruined country relieve it of its taxes recover its trade and revive the glory of old england to effect these great and good purposes was the whole and sole end at which they aimed were all the electors through all the boroughs cities and counties of great britain but as virtuous as those of the borough of it would indeed be a happy land yet strange to say what different masks does selfassuming virtue wear state the per contra imagine only how many free and independent electors were at this period exulting in a similar manner at the purity of their own conduct while giving their votes for the support of government the maintenance of order and to preserve the immaculate statesman the saviour of the nation the great financier the first of orators the admiration of europe and the wonder of the world in power who will deny that a general election is the season when all the disinterested virtues all the pure patriotism all the most generous and best qualities of the soul are called into action how are the morals of the people improved to what a height of grandeur does human nature rise and how captivating is the point of view in which it is seen aera of incomprehensible excellence can it be supposed that i who was to be the representative of such free and noble souls through whose lips their patriotic spirits were to breathe i in whom one fivehundredth part of the virtue of the whole island was to be compressed and bottled up ready for use being as i was in company with sages whose office it was to choose one still more sage than themselves thus circumstanced was it possible that i should not imbibe some portion of their sublime wisdom had i no sympathy were all my affections and passions and patriotism extinct oh no mocking says the proverb is catching and however in my sober moments among sober people reasoning on objects at a distance i might systematise and legislate for the conduct of myself and others being an actor in the scene whether its atmosphere were healthy or contagious i never yet found that i could wholly escape imbibing a part of the effluvia i gave toasts made speeches sung songs ay and wrote them too and became so incorporated with my constituents lovers as they were of liberty that the cut of our cloaths and countenances excepted i might in this moment of overflowing sapience have been taken for one of themselves i was little aware however when i consented to make this journey of its consequences disinterested as these worthy voters were and purchased by wholesale as they had been when the family of the brays bought the borough they yet had wives and daughters who wore watches and rings and gowns and who would each of them think themselves so flattered by a genteel present from me that there was no describing the pleasure it would give them every particular about me told them i was very much of a gentleman beside which one lady had a great affection for a few pounds of the best green tea bought in london another discovered that the loaf sugar in the country was abominable a third could not but think that a few jars of india pickles and preserved ginger would be a very pretty present it would always remind her of the giver a fourth could not but say she did long for a complete suit of lace cap handkerchief and ruffles and so on through the whole list the men too were troubled with their longings with one it was london porter with another it was cheshire cheese and bottled beer they would both drink to the donor their neighbour longed very vehemently indeed for the horse i rode and finding that the animal was too great a favourite to be parted with he compounded for twelve dozen of old port when these hints which looked very like demands were first given me i applied to sir barnard doubting much whether any of them ought to be complied with but he let me understand that such things were politic and customary and that a seat in parliament even when bestowed was not to be had free of expence what could be done to have required him to pay these disbursements would have had so much the appearance of meanness that it was what i could not propose to request a loan in advance of mr evelyn was sufficiently grating to the feelings but he had a liberal spirit it was the least painful of the two and i had no other resource fortune was whetting the darts she soon intended to hurl chapter vi news from mowbray petitioning for aid the period o universal uproar arrives and the baronet pursues his patriotic purposes a few sketches of a county contest at a general election hector loving in his liquor qualms of conscience which are thought very unseasonable and very ridiculous the incomprehensible defection of sir barnard and the suspicion that lights on me while we were spending our time in this pleasant manner and advantageously to the baronets interest we received intelligence of our quondam friends the earl and young mowbray who were canvassing the county in which they had vowed opposition to each other with indefatigable zeal so that a ruinous contest probably to both parties was predicted in this county sir barnard himself had some interest for he had some lands there and hector prevailed on a common friend to write in a very urgent style to the baronet requesting his aid how could so great a lover of his country as sir barnard indignant too as he felt himself at the apostacy of the earl refuse a request by which his own patriotic purposes might be forwarded at length parliament was dissolved and the whole kingdom was immediately in a tumult driving rioting and uproar began god help the poor posthorses hostlers and chambermaids the writ for the baronets borough was made out his agents were ready and as there could be no opposition our business was soon over it was high time for my pocket was tolerably drained and as the worthy electors very industriously compared notes when any one of them discovered that the present made to his neighbour was of greater value than the compliment which he had received i had immediate intimation of my own injustice which it was expected i should correct this serious business settled and these accounts closed the baronet now had leisure to think of his friends and he turned his thoughts to the annoying of lord idford he had purchased me as well as his borough for he had made me his own member and meant to profit by me in all possible ways he had discovered my electioneering talents i was very engaging among the women a matter of no small moment in such affairs and though i was rather shy of my glass yet i could sing an excellent song which i could likewise make quite suitable to the occasion he therefore proposed that we should both journey into my native county and there exercise all our wit and ingenuity to aid in bringing in my old schoolfellow hector it cannot be supposed that in an affair where the family and the brother of olivia were so seriously implicated i could be totally unconcerned with respect to the question of who was the most virtuous or the most wise who the greatest orator the best patriot or the properest person to take a seat among the grand national council of sages the earl or the squire that was not easily determined it was a point therefore that did not disquiet my conscience my compliance was consequently given with a hearty good will and we both prepared for the holy work how it happened that the vice which inevitably attaches itself to such conduct selfevident gross and glaring as it is fatal to private morals and public virtue odious in its practice and hellish in its consequences how the baneful complexion of this monster vice should at first so totally escape me is more than i can declare hurry of thought confusion of intellect and eagerness of passion are the only probable conjectures i can make my mind was so intent on the manner in which i could best prove my respect for olivia and all that related to her that this appears to have been a gulph vast enough for all recollection sense and idea a postchaise and four soon brought us to the field of battle and then i own my blood began to circulate and my feelings to awaken still it was but gradually that my spirits mounted to the proper tone before we entered the place where the election was to be held we heard the jangling of bells and the shouts of men the postillions spared neither whip nor spur and as we galloped furiously along the streets the people came swarming out the women and children saluting us with their shrill trebles and it being dark the men crowding to follow with torches and more sonorous hubbub every inn was a scene of confusion when we drove up to that which was the headquarters of hector his partisans immediately flocked round us and a courier having previously announced our arrival saluted sir barnard with all the force of lungs they could heave elated in proportion to the uproar they made the squire and his friends vociferous though they were and heated with anticipated triumphs wine and wassail heard the glorious din learned its cause and came reeling forth to embrace their puissant ally quitting as they did the fumes of buttocks and sirloins gammons and hams turkies and geese wines brandies beers and tobacco they all came reeking each involved in his own atmosphere their joy was boisterous and not to be repulsed hector was as drunk as the animal that brought the royal david his sucking pigs and as loving as the monster in the tempest he could not indeed curse so poetically but what he wanted in variety he supplied by repetition and his oaths and his raptures were countless he bestowed a part of them upon me for not only did feasting make him fond but he had just memory enough left to recollect that i was now become an mp and he was not quite sure whether till he had gained his election i might not at present be almost as great a man as himself i was moreover his electioneering friend which virtue would for a fortnight to come be inestimable i had been disgusted with the eating and drinking required at the readybought borough of but that was abstinence itself compared to the scene in which i had consented to become an actor away the baronet and i were dragged by the most jovial crew hector our leader and seating himself in state at our head clean glasses bellowed the hero and seizing his own smashed it against the wall commanding us to follow his noble example midway drunkenness disdains to think all arms were raised and destruction was impending fortunately there were two sober men in company and seeing what had happened we both loudly calledforbear you have cut one of the waiters added i addressing myself to hector and pointing to a man whose face was smeared with blood damn him retorted the brave hector put him down in the bill the mighty man was pleased at his own secondhand wit and as an old joke is the soonest understood they all joined in the laugh eager to make the new comers welcome that is as drunk as himself hector insisted that the baronet and i should drink three bumpers each and as the fatigue of travelling had rendered this no difficult task we complied he then swore we would set to for the night but i perceived that his night would not be a long one toasts were called for however and liquor was swallowed till its vapours half deprived the redoubted hector of the faculty of speech at this period he began to mutter nonsense on a subject on which i should have been better pleased with his silence than his praise he made the lovely olivia his theme and in the fulness not of his heart but of his stomach told me how dearly she loved meyes my boy she does by g and shes right damn me shes right i say it by g my boy shes right you are my friendyou are my friend and shes right and as for lord kiss damn me hes a sneaking scoundrel i say it a sneaking so shes right damn me shes right he continued to repeat his oaths and shes right till entirely overpowered he sunk and would have dropped from his chair if the waiter whom he had cut with the glass had not caught him some of the guests had withdrawn some were sleeping and some were senseless but the few who could open their eyes and see to such a distance triumphed in the defeat of their leader which they considered as victory to themselves riot now paused per force the baronet pleaded fatigue and retired i followed his example and once more found myself alone left to ruminate on the methods which men take to make each other happy on their different modes of happiness in their different stations and on waiters who being maimed or killed are to be charged in the bill though these thoughts were not of the most delightful kind they did not prevent me from sleeping the new day brought new cares and presented projects in which i was required to take my part that led me to very serious meditations indeed the poll was to begin that day week and hector and his friends roused from the torpor of overloaded revelry by the importance of the business assembled to consider how they should best collect and marshal the voters of whom they supposed themselves to be certain and cajole and bring over such as they imagined might be gained of this labour each man was to take his allotted share and direct bribery was openly proposed as the general medium by which the great end in question was to be promoted this was what i had not foreseen i was not only young but as i have before remarked i had thought but little on the affair except as it continually presented the image of olivia to my mind i now found myself most painfully situated i had discovered principles of human conduct in which i had gloried i had asserted them unsparingly and had promised myself that from them i would never depart in doubtful cases i might decide and act erroneously but when the way was clear my conduct should be the same these principles i was required to abandon and the shock was severe the transactions which had lately passed in the baronets borough increased the difficulty in what light could the presents that i had made be considered in what were they different from and how much better than bribes to these i had submitted when my own interest was in question again for what purpose had i consented to accompany sir barnard if not to exert myself in favour of his friend and not only his friend but the brother of olivia though this was a silent grief known only to myself however i stated my scruples which as soon as they were heard were the subject of laughter i repeated them in a still more serious tone and was reminded of the facts and motives which i have just been mentioning the struggle was violent the arguments i had to urge were something like insults on every body present that heard me and i was answered sometimes with ridicule at others with anger and not unfrequently with something very like contempt the baronet in particular augured very unfavourably concerning the subserviency which he expected from me and once or twice spoke in a very dictatorial tone but finding himself answered with no little indignation he had no remedy but to chew the cud in silence assailed on all sides as it happened i had the good sense in despite of every mockery and insinuation to remain firm and the only part i could be prevailed upon to take determinately was that of aiding in a fair and open canvas leaving those who were less conscientious to distribute bribes as it was imagined however that i possessed some abilities my services were accepted on my own conditions meanwhile the waste that was committed the bribes that were paid and the money that was squandered in every way as well in london where voters were eagerly purchased and sent down by coach loads as in distant parts of the county and kingdom convinced me that the sums which this election would cost must be enormous i even thought it my duty to take an opportunity in one of hectors half sober moments to remonstrate with all the arguments and energy i could collect and endeavoured to persuade him to decline the poll but my efforts were useless he was equally vain of his wealth and his influence his purse perhaps was as deep as that of the proud peer his friends as numerous and he would carry his election though he were to mortgage every foot of land he possessed finding him resolved i became anxious in his behalf strained every nerve rode in all directions night and day and so effectually exerted myself in enquiring who were the independent men likely to be influenced by honest motives that i procured him above fifty votes with respect to himself the continual drinking vociferating and riot of the scene had made him so hoarse that previous to the day of election his husky whispers were not audible the evening before the poll opened an incident occurred for which at that time i knew not how to account it was no less amazing than incomprehensible i had returned very much fatigued after hard riding and found a message had been left for me by sir barnard who desired to speak with me immediately i obeyed the summons and found him alone he opened the conversation in a strange blustering tone complaining of having been neglected or insulted he did not seem to know which and to my astonishment declared his satisfaction at the scruples which i had professed he knew not what to say to such corrupt proceedings perhaps an honest man ought to have no concern in them and for his own part he certainly should trouble himself no farther on the present occasion he had met with but little thanks for what he had already done and he had come to a resolution not to bring up his voters acquainted with the corrupt arts by which the promises of these voters generally speaking had been gained i knew not what to reply though i felt no little chagrin with the aid of sir barnard it was supposed that mowbrays election would certainly have been carried but without that aid i was persuaded it would as certainly be lost this opinion i forcibly repeated adding that though elections like these were destructive beyond description to the general happiness and though i could not defend having taken any part whatever in one of them yet the mischief in the present instance had already been done if sir barnard had received any insult or even suffered any neglect i intreated that he would permit me to be the mediator and state his griefs being persuaded from all i had seen that nothing injurious to his person or his interest had been intended his answers were evasive he acted as men frequently do who have some secret purpose which they dare not avow he affected that waspish irritation of temper to which he was subject on many occasions but on none so frequently as when he suspected himself to be wrong while we were in the heat of this discourse a chaise and four drove up to the door it was for the baronet his trunk and mine were both prepared by his orders the men were buckling the former behind the carriage and he requested me to accompany him to town i was thunderstruck i could neither account for such sullen intemperance nor the secrecy of this haste i again urgently intreated i might acquaint mr mowbray and his committee but he peremptorily refused and repeated his desire that i would accompany him immediately no arguments no prayers could move him so that at last i hastily left the room in search of hector and his friends he guessed my intention and as soon as i was gone stepped into the chaise and ordered the boys to drive away full speed leaving me behind to act as i should think proper but with a message that if i wished to oblige him i must mount my horse and ride after him with all expedition i might overtake him at the next inn and our servants and horses would then follow at leisure it was some time before i could find mowbray or any of his party they were at another inn promoting the good cause and when i informed them of the intentions of sir barnard they scarcely could believe me but when they heard the chaise was at the door they hurried with me full of anxiety and dismay we were too late sir barnard was gone long out of hearing and out of sight the consternation was extreme stupefied as his faculties were for a moment hector was roused conjectures were formed but none presented themselves that could account for such extraordinary conduct no one knew of any offence that had been given the baronet it was remarked indeed on recollection that the last day or two he had not testified the same alacrity and zeal but no man could guess his motive at length the indignation of hector took vent in a volley of curses which were plentifully and emphatically bestowed and so keenly was the stroke felt that he put a very unusual quantity small though it was of variety in his oaths not only the body and blood of sir barnard but his liver eyes and heart were consigned over to satan even i though i had procured votes distinct from the interest of the baronet and had refused to follow him to town in which refusal i persisted still i did not escape suspicion no direct allegation was made but the questions that were put to me were sufficiently expressive of doubt the irritated mind is apt at error and i disdained to make a personal application of the guilt by which i knew myself uncontaminated chapter vii the opening of the poll my first essay at public oratory the general feelings of men in favour of virtue though contradicted by their practice the hateful spectacle of a corrupt election and more cause of complaint against the baronet a false accusation resented passion dispels passion and care combats care sir barnard was gone diligence was the more necessary and preparations for the approaching day would not admit of neglect it may well be said that circumstances and situation make the man hector who had no habitual capacity for business or intellect for order was inspired by the occasion with a degree of talent of which at other times he was incapable the fatigue he underwent was excessive and impossible as it was that he should create any strong sympathy i still felt some interest in his behalf and some alarm at the fixed hoarseness by which his lungs were threatened and the alteration which incessant drinking and unusual efforts had produced in his appearance the night was passed with more than ordinary tumult it was late before the riotous guests departed and our rest was short the day of beginning contest soon broke upon us the word of command was given to muster and all was in action the friends of the opposing parties collected each round their respective leaders favours for the hat and bosom were lavishly distributed the flags were flying a band of music preceded each of the processions and when the parties approached the hustings each band continued to play its own favourite air with increasing violence as if war were to be declared by the most jarring discord and harmony driven from the haunts of men the grating sounds were increased by balladsingers marrowbones and cleavers and the vociferous throats of men who seemed to imagine that if they were but sufficiently noisy they could not fail of being victorious the scaffolding was mounted the candidates appeared and mouths ears and eyes were open for the reception of all the wisdom and patriotism with all the comicality and fun which the orators were expected to bestow a mob delights in being harangued and is thrown into raptures by every kind of mountebank jealous perhaps of his own honor the god of eloquence decreed that neither the wit nor the wisdom of hector should that day be heard he was too hoarse for any effort to make him audible but as stirring and ambitious spirits on such occasions are always abroad tongues were not wanting to trumpet forth his high deserts the candidates for oratorical fame were several i was of the number and as the gloss of my newly acquired dignity dazzled other eyes as well as my own i was permitted to take the lead it was my first essay and i felt a momentary alarm but full of youthful spirits and high in blood i dashed forward and uttered what first occurred my voice was powerful my nonsense was applauded my fears vanished and i became more collected the real grievances of mankind under the best government that ever yet existed have at all times been so numerous that an orator who makes them his theme is never in want of facts and arguments could i then feel this deficiency at an epocha like the one in question when means so despotic were daily adopted to curb the growing spirit of enquiry that despot ministers might pursue measures so tragical so subversive of the order which they pretended to maintain and so destructive to the happiness they were appointed to guard alas the topics were so numerous so melancholy so almost maddening that the man who would paint them truly must temper and reinin his feelings with an iron arm otherwise imagination will so hurry him away that while describing evils past evils present and evils impending there is danger of his being deemed an incendiary i spoke ill when i remembered what i had said and what i might and ought to have said i was indignant at my own want of recollection the applause that i received nevertheless was prodigious the acclamations of the mob were even awful they displayed a feeling of justice so acute so prompt and so powerful that i was borne out of myself and imagined for a moment not merely that the day of reform was at hand but that it was come men are rendered selfish and corrupt by the baneful influence of the systems under which they live but it is well worthy the attention of those who believe mankind to be generally capable of great happiness and who are desirous to promote it that however the wants of the wretched may tempt them to accept the immediate relief that is within their reach they never collectively fail to bestow the most unbounded applause on those principles by which their own proceedings are condemned they are not in love with baseness it is forced upon them the reader is doubtless aware that hector and his friends assumed to themselves the merit of what is called the independent interest and that his opponent was supported by the whole influence of the court party the numerous groans and hisses and the few plaudits bestowed upon the orators of this party were additional proofs of what is the general sense of mankind and that on the subject of corrupt influence at least they judge rightly in this general sense i own that my soul triumphed and the pangs which i felt after the poll began to perceive that whatever men might think they could forget their duty and vote only as their interest directed were undescribable however the party of hector was strong the struggle was violent every scandalous art of election was resorted to by both sides a spirit of rancour daily and hourly increased the opponents came to frequent blows beastly drunkenness bloated insolence and profligacy of principle met the eye on every side and i almost hated myself not only for being present at and participating in it but to find that i belonged to a race of animals capable of such foul and detestable vice from this distress i was relieved by an event which in itself was very far from satisfactory the poll had proceeded for some days with tolerable equality and hector had rather the advantage though the voters in the interest of sir barnard had not given him their assistance to which they had frequently been urged at length they appeared and how great was the surprise and indignation of our whole party to see them marshalled on the opposite side with the favours of the idford candidate in their hats and uniformly come up and poll against us on the same day twelve of the votes which had been promised to me were likewise brought over to the opposite interest and ten more of them refused to poll for either party the coincidence of this desertion revived the suspicions of hector and his party concerning me this sudden turn of the poll against him rendered his temper ungovernable and in the frenzy of passion he made no scruple of openly affirming that i was no less guilty than the baronet it was not merely the consciousness of innocence that i felt i had been so indefatigable in every possible way i had ridden and walked and talked i had been his defender his eulogist his orator his slave and had as it were so fouled my conscience in his cause that indignation closed my lips i disdained reply or self vindication and casting a glance such as irresistible feeling dictated left the committee room in which the accusation was made without answering a word chapter viii the return to town a visit to sir barnard admission denied enquiries after the wounded stranger who had disappeared an endeavour to guard against misrepresentation the fears and feelings of friends my determination was taken my servant was called my horses ordered and i immediately departed for london my thoughts were far from being clear or of a pleasant kind the scene i had left was the most odious that i had ever beheld hector i was convinced would lose his election and what was more valuable his health i saw prognostics which i thought could not be mistaken and which afterward proved as baleful as i then imagined them to be whether the contest might not ruin the family was more than i knew and what the effect might be on olivia and even on our hoped for union i could not foresee the enigmatical conduct of sir barnard was no less perplexing his sudden desertion of hector and of the cause which he had so loudly defended were alarming for what other interpretation could be put upon the voters in the baronets interest who not only refused to poll according to their promise but were all of them brought up in support of the idford candidate yet i was loth to conclude that an event so fatal to all my hopes as well to my private affections as to my public duties had taken place my horses were excellent and carried us seventy miles in less time than it would have taken to go post i intended to have ordered a chaise for the remainder of the way but a mail coach was to pass in half an hour and i waited there happened to be a vacancy in which i seated myself and by these means i arrived in town early in the morning as soon as the day was far enough advanced my first care was to visit sir barnard and i own i approached the street and the house with a foreboding heart what had happened could not be unintentional it was too decided too abrupt and had too many marks of unprincipled treachery i knocked made my enquiries and was informed the baronet was not at home i asked for lady bray and not at home was again the answer as this was what i apprehended it excited but little surprise though much vexation however i left my card and departed more full of meditation even than i came not at home i had no doubt signified that my visits were no longer welcome still it was necessary i should know the truth and as i had been too intimate with the family to be ignorant of the haunts of sir barnard i went to the cocoa tree a place to which he daily resorted and there lounged away between two and three hours over the papers hoping he would come i was again disappointed the baronet did not make his appearance and i began to conjecture that perhaps the servant had told me truly he might be out early on business or i knew not what as it was past his hour at the cocoa tree perhaps i should now find him at home i therefore went back and again made my enquiries and again received the same dry laconic answer it had an ill face but i had no immediate remedy my next most pressing object of attention was the wounded stranger whom i had left under the care of the physician and whom i immediately determined to enquire after not without some silent reproaches to myself for having so long been absent on schemes such as those in which i had been concerned to the neglect of perhaps a more serious duty for duty seemed to require that men should rather abstain from elections such as they are at present than become aiders and abettors of them my horses not being arrived and disliking the vehicle of a hackney coach i walked forward to the inn at which the stranger had been left musing much on the prospect before me which was once more beginning to be heavily overcast being come to my journeys end i found the stranger had been removed two days after i left him to london but the people of the inn could give me no farther intelligence concerning him or the place of his residence i then asked them to direct me to the house of the physician which they did but told me that he had left the kingdom determined however to make every possible enquiry i went to the house where i found only a person who was left in charge of the premises and who knew nothing more than that the physician was gone with a patient to lisbon these little incidents trifling as they appeared afforded me an excellent proof of the absurdity of false modesty which induces men from the egoistical fear of being thought vain to conceal or disguise the truth the physician had bestowed high eulogiums on my humanity after which he had hinted a desire but with wellbred reserve to know who i was and i catching the apparent delicacy of his feelings and thinking but very little on the subject imagined there would be ostentation in personally taking to myself his praises by giving him my name and place of abode i therefore told him i would answer that question when we became better acquainted if he should then find he had no reason to alter his good opinion of me thus do men by affecting not to be vain indulge a kind of double refined vanity and lead themselves and others into error being disappointed in all my enquiries of this day my next care was to see miss wilmot surrounded as i was by persons who thought me inimical to them and therefore were probably my inveterate enemies i knew not what false reports might be spread nor how to guard against them in the public opinion but i had one consolation olivia had declared she was resolved to enquire before she again gave the least credit to calumny it was therefore essentially necessary that i should acquaint miss wilmot with all that had passed it was now evening and when i came to her lodgings i found her brother and turl both there though my absence had been short the meeting gave me no little pleasure it would likewise save me the trouble of a thrice told tale for to friends like these my heart was always open and i had something like an abhorrence of concealment and secret transactions i wished them to share in all my joys and as to my griefs they not only excited their sympathy but produced remarks and counsel by which they had often been cured i told my story and it may well be imagined my hearers were neither inattentive nor unmoved the selfishness and depravity into which men are driven and the vices of which being thus impelled they are capable exemplified as these vices were in my narration drew heavy sighs from the gentle and kind hearted lydia made her much oppressed brother groan in spirit and excited in turl those comprehensive powers that trace the history of facts through a long succession and teach by miseries that are past how miseries in future are to be avoided the general feeling however was that danger was hovering over me the indignation of wilmot at the treatment of men who most endeavoured to deserve well of their age and country was very strong neither was turl less moved his manner was placid yet his feelings were acute but though they might vibrate for a moment toward discord they touched the true harmony at last he who has fixed principles of action is soon called to a recollection of his duties and the manner in which he ought to act roused by his friendship for me i should rather say by his affection he collected his faculties and presented to the imagination so sublime a picture of fortitude and of the virtue of enduring injuries and oppression with dignity that he prepared my mind most admirably for the trials that were to succeed chapter ix a second and more successful attempt to obtain an interview with the baronet an enigmatical dialogue the meaning of which however may be guessed it was not only the wish of my heart but it was quite necessary for me to see mr evelyn however it was exceedingly desirable that i should previously meet the baronet lest in what i should say my surmises might be false and i might produce a family disagreement between persons who would both have conferred essential benefits on me if the supposed defection of sir barnard should not be true i determined therefore once more to go to the cocoa tree and wait as it happened waiting was not necessary the baronet was there and though there was something of coldness in his manner it was by no means what my fears had taught me to expect salutation having passed i requested to speak with him we retired into a private room and he began by telling me he was glad to see me again in town and no longer continuing to support a person whom he no longer esteemed his friend at hearing this remark and the significance with which it was delivered my evil augury returned upon me in full force i answered that i had quitted mr mowbray not because i had deserted his interest but because i had been unjustly accused accused of what mr trevor of having been influenced by you to betray a party which i had pretended to espouse and were you not influenced by me mr trevor i never can be influenced by any man sir barnard to commit an action which my heart condemns do you mean mr trevor that your heart condemns me the question is very direct and i am not desirous of wounding your feelings sir barnard but i must not be guilty of falsehood i certainly wish you had acted otherwise then you pretend to set up for yourself mr trevor and to have no deference whatever for me and my opinions personally as a gentleman who meant to do me service i wish to preserve every respect for you sir barnard but i hope you do not expect of me any deference that should on any occasion whatever induce me to abandon either my public or my private duties very well mr trevor very well i dare say you are so perfectly acquainted with your duties that no man on earth not even he who had been your greatest friend could induce you to alter any of your notions i should hope sir barnard that either friend or enemy might so induce me provided he had truth and reason on his side very well mr trevor all that is very fine i dare say you understand your own interest and will take your own road even though you might if you pleased travel more at your ease and in better company by going another way will you be kind enough to explain yourself sir barnard no mr trevor i shall give no explanations till i am sure i am talking to my friend my fast friend mr trevor that will think and act with me if you will give me your word and honor as a gentleman to that why then we will talk together if by thinking and acting together sir barnard you mean that you expect i should blindly and implicitly conform to any tergiversationi mean to any change you need explain yourself no farther mr trevor i very well understand your meaning my friend is my friend mr trevor and he is no other mans friend mr trevor i could not but suppose you understood all that perfectly at first and i am very sorry to be so much deceived but it is my misfortune to be always deceived and entrapped and entrapped sir barnard i hope you do not apply that word to me nay nay mr trevor i want no quarrelling nor do i sir barnard but if you suppose me capable of taking any advantage of what you may now think an illplaced confidence in me you egregiously mistake both my intentions and my character i hope i do mr trevor you have a great fluency but i hope i do i saw him preparing to go and being exceedingly anxious to have a determinate answer i addedlet me intreat you sir barnard to give me an explicit declaration of what you expect from me you must excuse me mr trevor i shall say no more at present you say i mistake your intentions i hope i do time will tell when you are my friend i shall be very glad to see you and so will lady bray good morning to you mr trevor chapter x reflections on the mutability of fortune on money expended and on the duties of love and friendship a strange incident shewing the propensity of man to superstitious terrors a lamentable and unexpected event well might i forebode the approach of evil and except that complaint is of no avail is waste of time is unhappiness and therefore is immoral well might i complain of those sudden strokes of fate by which whenever my prospects began to be flattering they were suddenly obscured in darkness and despair but if i had not supposed myself marked in an extraordinary manner as the child of fortune to whose smiles and frowns i seemed to be capriciously subjected i know not what should have induced me to have written my history or rather the history of my youth for of what is yet reserved for me i am still ignorant not that i pretend to consider the hypocrisy selfishness and profligacy of titled folly and church pride as things in themselves extraordinary it was the coincidence and the number and manner of them by which in the crisis of my fate i seemed to be so repeatedly and so peculiarly affected that occasioned surprise and pain yet what was all that i had hitherto felt from persons like these when i remember that which i was now immediately doomed to feel the perverted and the vicious it is true can excite emotion and excite it strongly but how comparatively feeble does their utmost malice seem as far as it affects only ourselves when brought in competition with the thunderbolt that strikes the virtuous that shuts the gate of hope and that robs us of those unspeakable pleasures which imagination has fondly stored as a grand resource against evil fall when and how it may parting from the baronet expecting what was almost certain some change of political sentiment no matter how brought about by which my flattering expectations were at once to be rooted up my thoughts inevitably flowed into that train which was bitterness little short of anguish mr evelyn was a man of such peculiar virtue and disinterested benevolence of a heart so generous and so little capable of accusing me in consequence of the baseness of others that to have suspected him of such a mistake would have been the height of injustice but i could not forget the sums that he had advanced in all four hundred pounds the more than probable failure of all the plans for which they had been advanced and the incapacity i had and should have to repay these sums neither could i forbear to take a retrospective view of the manner in which they had been expended could i approve of that manner could i forget how short a time it was though i had squandered my own money since i had forfeited no atom of my independence by accepting the earnings of others suppose this parliamentary plan to fail and fail it must for there were no hopes that i could honestly retain my seat to what other means could i resort while i continued to indulge in wild and extravagant schemes of enriching myself by which i did but impoverish others ought i to require of olivia to partake of my folly and its consequences had i nothing but the cup of wretchedness to offer and must i still urge her to drink was it not my duty rather to tear myself at once away from her and place some insurmountable barrier between us that should relieve her from such an illfated predilection full of these thoughts i proceeded toward the residence of mr evelyn it was necessary that i should see him immediately for silence would have been the meanest deceit i went with an afflicted heart but how did i return why do i say afflicted no anguish real anguish since i had known him had not yet reached me but it was coming it was rushing forward like a torrent to bear away inferior cares and sorrows and engulph them wholly unexpected events are sometimes peculiarly marked by certain uncommon incidental circumstances as i was walking hastily forward anxious to meet mr evelyn at home i saw a coffin borne before me by four men at some distance their pace was brisk i had several streets to pass before i arrived at the house where mr evelyn had apartments and still the coffin turned the way that i was to go i overtook and went before it but the gloomy object had excited my attention and i presently looked behind me still it took the same route i looked again and again and it was continually at my heels it is strange how imagination will work and how ideas will suggest themselves i wished it any where else but it seemed to pursue me at length i came to my journeys end and having knocked at the door looked round with a kind of infatuated fear the coffin was following and i stood with an absurd and fanciful trepidation waiting that i might once see it fairly past the door yet i was no bigot no believer in omens and was almost ashamed of an idea which the coffin itself and the gloomy state of my mind had suggested but which was in reality superstitious the servant came and the door was opened but the coffin approached and i would not stir till it should pass me pass it did but where into the passage i stood speechless the men asked where it was to go into the first floor was the answer it was the apartment of mr evelyn heavens what was the pang that shot across my brain i gasped for utterance but still was dumb a dread so terrible had seized me that there i stood motionless and stupefied the woman who opened the door and directed the men belonged to the house and just as the bearers were proceeding with the coffin up stairs matthew the country servant who had attended mr evelyn in the dissecting room the first night of our meeting came in the moment he saw me the poor fellow burst into tears and exclaimedoh sir his look and the tone of his voice were sufficient there was but one event that could have produced them in such an extraordinary and unfeigned degree of grief my horrible fears were fulfilled he paused a moment sobbed and again cried in a most piercing and lamentable tone my poor master i must draw the curtain over feelings that i cannot pretend to paint how long i stood what i first said or what my looks were are things of which i know nothing i only recollect that my eyes were stone and had not a tear to shed chapter xi a proof of the danger of not attending to trifles a feeble attempt to characterise a man of uncommon virtue the dying anxieties of mr evelyn the melancholy particulars of this strange tragedy were that three days before mr evelyn being then in perfect health had been dissecting a limb in a high state of putrescence during the operation the instrument had slipped and made what he considered only as a scratch of the skin and so slight that he did not immediately deem it worthy of notice though when he had ended he felt a tingling and then thought it prudent to wash with vinegar and bind it up to keep out the air he was so busily engaged during the day that he paid no more attention to it though he once or twice felt a throbbing that was unusual being fatigued and finding his spirits rather agitated he took a gentle opiate at going to rest but was waked in the middle of the night by symptoms of a very alarming kind the morbid humour that was introduced into the system small as it probably was in quantity was so active that mr evelyn was seized with a violent inflammatory fever so that he was delirious when he woke and died in less than eight and forty hours after he received this slight wound such is the uncertain fate of man in this state of ignorance to such sudden accidents of sickness and death are the good and the bad the foolish and the wise continually subject and such at present is the frail tenure of life that the man in whose hall we feasted on monday or the blooming beauty with whom we sung and danced ere the week passes away are descended to the grave what tribute can friendship or affection pay to the memory of a man like this there is only one that is worthy of his virtues and that is to record them that he being gone his example may inspire the benevolence he practised and teach others to communicate the blessings he conferred oh that i had the power to pourtray those virtues in all their lustre ages unborn would then rejoice that such a man had lived and feel the benefits he would have bestowed but it is a task that cannot be accomplished in a few pages his life was a vast volume of the best of actions which originated in the best of principles peace love and reverence be with his memory for my own part if in addition to that uncommon public worth which he possessed and that noble scale of morality by which he regulated his life the personal kindness which he heaped on me be remembered i must have less of affection than savage brutality did no portion of his spirit inspire me while i speak of these events nor did his friendship end while understanding had the least remaining power his last act of benevolence was a strenuous but incoherent effort to prevent the mischief which disturbed as his functions were he still had recollection enough to apprehend would fall on me the reader is informed of the mortgage i gave mr evelyn when i received not merely a qualification but the possession of an estate and i imagine he will not think i was too scrupulously careful to guard and prove the honesty of my intentions when i further tell him that for the sums of money which mr evelyn advanced i insisted on giving my promissory notes for repayment i was pertinacious and would accept such favours on no other terms this mortgage and these notes were lying in the possession of mr evelyn at the time of his death he had apprehended no danger till the fever and the delirium seized him at the beginning of which he called his servant matthew i tell the story as the poor fellow told it to me and giving him a key bade him go down to his bureau and search among his papers for a parchment and some notes that were tied together with red tape having uttered this he began to talk in a wild and wandering manner of fetters and prisons and asked matthew if he knew why such places were built so make haste matthew said he and burn the parchment and burn the notes and burn the bureau after which you know all will be safe matthew and they can never harm mr trevor you love mr trevor matthew do not you his recollection then seemed to return and he asked of what have i been talking go matthew seek the parchment and the notes tied with red tape observe there is no other parchment tied with red tape bring them to me directly matthew had taken the key but just as he was going the doctor who had been sent for arrived matthew went however as he was directed and applying the key to the lock found it was a wrong one the doctor alarmed for the state in which he saw mr evelyn immediately wrote a prescription and rang for the servant to run and have it prepared at the shop of the next apothecary matthew answered the bell and mr evelyn seeing him eagerly demandedwhere is the parchment have you brought me the parchment why do not you bring me the parchment for said matthew i held out the key and he saw i had nothing else in my hands the doctor asked matthew what parchment his master wanted and matthew replied he could not tell except that his master said it was in the bureau and tied with red tape why do not you bring it said mr evelyn then turning to the doctor addedit is a bundle of misery and you know sir we ought to drive all misery from the face of the earth i cannot tell how it came in my possession why do you not go and bring it me matthew and pray sir do you see it destroyed promise me that i beg you will because mr trevor is in the country i am afraid elections are but bad things what sir is your opinion for i think i shall die and he will then have no friend on earth to secure him the poll seeing my poor master was so disturbed in his mind said matthew the doctor bid me run as fast as i could for the stuff he had ordered which i did but i was obliged to wait till it was made up and when i come back my poor dear master was more distracting lightheaded than ever but still he kept raving about the parchment and his cousin sir barnard and you mr trevor all which the doctor said we must not heed because he did not know what he said though for all that i could not but mightily fear there was something hung heavy on his mind for as long as ever he could be heard to speak he kept calling every now and then for the parchment and after that when he lay heaving for breath and rattling in the throat and nobody could tell a word that he said he kept moving his lips just in the same manner as when he could make himself heard i do believe he was calling for it almost as the breath left his body and i cannot but say that i wish i had found it and brought it to him for the ease and quiet of his soul chapter xii doubts concerning the justice of wills and testaments the provident care of the baronet a demonstration of his ardent love for his country hector loses his election my determination to accept the chitern hundreds when a man discovers that the pathos of his story and the virtues which he has in contemplation are entirely beyond the power of language what method can he take but that of leaving off abruptly that he may suffer the imagination to perform an office to which any other effort is inadequate as mr evelyn lived so he died to prevent evil and to do unbounded good was his ruling passion it never left him till life departed it is a phenomenon which has frequently been remarked that in a state of delirium the mind has its luminous moments during which it seems to have a more clear and comprehensive view of consequences than in its more sober periods of health the evil that excited so strong and painful an alarm in the mind of my dying friend was no idle dream the baronet was his heir at law mr evelyn had made no will for not only was his death premature but knowing the mischiefs that have arisen from disputes concerning testamentary bequests he strongly doubted of the morality of making any it was never his intention to hoard and hoping or i might rather say expecting to have a clear prospect of the approach of death his plan was to distribute all the personal property in his possession before he died in the manner that he should suppose would be most useful however whether it were a just sense of rectitude or an improper pride of heart i own that i felt pleased as far as myself was concerned that the intentions of mr evelyn when he called for the parchment were not executed i did not indeed foresee all that was to happen but i felt an abhorrence of being liable to be suspected of i know not what imputed arts or crimes by the aid of which malice or selfishness might assert i had come into the possession of so large a part of mr evelyns property not that if the deeds and notes had been destroyed i should have thought it just to have retained the estate that i held but my virtue was not fated to be put to this trial when i met sir barnard at the cocoa tree he not only knew of the decease of mr evelyn but had ordered seals to be placed on all the locks under which it was imagined that papers or effects might be secured having heard the story of matthew i could have no doubt but that the mortgage deeds and the notes for sums received would now fall into the baronets power it is true i might if i pleased bid him defiance no i ought not to have said if i pleased but if i could condescend to acknowledge myself a scoundrel he had made me his own member and had himself impowered me to avoid the punishment which is assigned by law to unfortunate debtors for under this best of governments such as a representative of the people was now my privilege this immaculate constitution to which all the homage that man can pay is insufficient worship vaunted as it is and revered by all parties or all parties are broad day liars for all and each strive to be most loud and extravagant in praise of it this constitution in its very essence decrees that things which are vile and unjust in one man are right and lawful in another well then by the aid of this constitution which i too must praise if i would escape whipping i might seat myself as sir barnards member and aid to countenance and make laws to which i and the other wise lawmakers my coadjutors should not be subject i might however offensive the term may be to certain delicate ears i might become a privileged swindler and rob every man who should do me the injustice to think me honest it cannot be supposed that so dear a lover and so ardent an admirer of the constitution as sir barnard was should once suspect that i would not benefit myself by all its blessings that is that i would not cheat him to the very best of my ability this supposition had induced him during our conversation at the cocoa tree to struggle with and keep down those indignant risings with which notwithstanding the modulated tone of his voice i could see he was more than half choaked after what i had heard and situated as i was at present i had very little doubt either of the purity of his patriotism or the manner in which it would affect me still however i had some there might be a change in his politics but it might neither be of the nature nor of the extent that i feared but these doubts did not distress me long they were entirely removed by that most authentic source of intelligence the gazette in which about a fortnight after the death of mr evelyn i read the following unequivocal proof of the baronets inordinate love of his country the king has been pleased to grant the dignity of a baron of the kingdom of great britain to sir barnard bray baronet by the name stile and title of baron bray of bray hall in the county of somerset and to the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten i was now no longer at a loss for the reason of the baronets late sudden departure and the desertion of his political friends at the election what are friends what are elections what is our country compared to the smiles of a prime minister and the titles he can bestow nothing now was wanting to the honor of the house of bray it might in time i own pant after a dukedom and a duke of bray might as justly be stiled princely and most puissant as many another duke but at present it was full with satisfaction this court document brief though it was spoke volumes it was a flash of lightning that gave me a distinct view of the black and dreadful abyss that was immediately before me and into which i foresaw i must be plunged on the same day i read that the idford candidate had been returned for the county of and that consequently hector had lost his election this was not all heated by the illiberal practices which always attend such contentions knowing the bribery that he had used himself and convinced that he could prove the same corrupt means to have been resorted to by his opponent he was not satisfied with the devastation he had already committed upon his fortune but was determined to demand a scrutiny and if he should be foiled in that effort he was resolved to try the merits of the election before a committee of the house of commons such was the report that was immediately propagated and which was afterward verified by facts with respect to myself convinced as i was of its danger i had made my choice my fixed purpose was to vacate my seat in parliament it might perhaps be questioned since the pretended voters had in reality no voice and their imaginary representative was no more than a person nominated by the new lord bray whether i ought to resign an office which as i supposed i should fill for the good of mankind and give place to some person who obedient to his leader would do the reverse but one act of baseness cannot authorize another to bear about me a sense of selfdegradation a certainty that i was sheltering myself from the power of my late patron by a privilege which i considered as highly vicious a subterfuge such as every man who deserves the name ought to despise and spurn at this was insufferable i had lost much for i had lost hopes that had been extravagant and unbounded in promise but i had not lost a conscious rectitude of heart without which existence was not to be endured chapter xiii the comedy of wilmot successful the wounded stranger seen at a distance oratory abandoned with regret the dangers that attend being honest a new invitation from hector a journey deferred by an arrest and another accidental sight of the stranger it is happy for man that there is scarcely any state of suffering whether of mind or body in which pain is unremitting and wholly unmixed with pleasure if he be unhappy himself it will be strange should there be no one more fortunate for whom he has an affection no friend that is more prosperous and in whose prosperity he takes delight the season of the year had arrived when the comedy of wilmot had been put into rehearsal and was to be performed it was a trying occasion and those who knew him loved him too well to be absent though the few intimate friends who had read the piece had no doubt of its success the partial failure of his tragedy had produced no jealousy of rivalship though as its merits had been publicly acknowledged it had incurred no disgrace in private life he was beloved and as a public man his merits had not yet created him enemies he has since indeed in that respect not been so fortunate but he has never thought it just to complain being convinced that mistake though it should be rectified should not be resented the evening of representation arrived the house was crowded the company brilliant and the plaudits with which the author was honoured established his reputation and confirmed the judgment of his friends during the performance i sat in the boxes and among the spectators in the pit i discovered a man whose hair was white whose locks were venerable and who i was well convinced was the stranger whom i had found wounded at the entrance of barnes common i was in a sidebox and he was near the opposite pit door so that the distance made it rather doubtful yet the more i looked the more i was convinced it was the same person the comedy was nearly ended when i first saw him and i determined as soon as i had heard the epilogue to go and satisfy myself how far my persuasion was true i went round to the door but the pit was so crowded that it was with difficulty i could make my way to the seat when i was there my labour was lost i could not find him and enquiring for him by description of the persons near where he sat they told me that such a gentleman had been there but that he complained of the heat and had left the house immediately after the curtain dropped this incident gave me considerable chagrin however as his person was very remarkable and being persuaded he was actually the wounded stranger i conceived hopes that i should again meet him in some place where the danger of losing sight of him would not be so great there being no expectation of his return i went in search of my friends in company with whom rejoicing in the success of wilmot and glorying in the acquisition of poetry and the stage i wholly forgot myself and my own affairs and spent one more very delightful evening these affairs however were not long to be forgotten the returns of the elections throughout great britain had all been made and the new parliament summoned to assemble it was with infinite and deep regret that i found myself excluded by my own sense of rectitude i would willingly have taken my seat had it been only for one night for i was eagerly desirous of an opportunity to deliver my thoughts and urge some of those useful truths which may be uttered with more safety there than in less privileged places but i was too well acquainted with the customs and forms of the house to hope that this opportunity could now be found i had no parliamentary friends no supporters and there was not the least probability that a youth so wholly unknown should catch the speakers eye whose notice so many were ready to solicit these things having been duly weighed i had already applied for the chiltern hundreds and my seat was declared vacated to the great joy of lord bray and his now bosom friend the earl of idford this joy was the greater because it was an event of which they had not the least expectation the due forms of law had been observed the seals had been removed from the locks of my late inestimable friend his cousin the new peer was in possession of the mortgage and the notes for money received and he had no conception of any motives that could induce me to an act which must leave me entirely at his mercy it cannot however be supposed as i have already said that i had any intention to retain the estate which i had received from mr evelyn as a qualification and a support it was now the property of lord bray and obligation to him was a thing that would not admit of a question i did not therefore wait for any notice from his lordship or his attorney but desired mr hilary to inform him that i was ready at any time to give up the deeds and receive back the mortgage this would have been a trifle it was not a sacrifice but a riddance by which could it have ended here i should have regained something of that elasticity of heart which independence only can feel here however it could not end i was obliged to instruct mr hilary to add that i was willing to give my own personal security by bond or in any manner my creditor should please for money received and interest due but to acknowledge that i had no immediate means of payment in other words that my person was entirely at the disposal of himself and the law i might have reminded him that more than half of my debt was incurred by genteel presents to his craving electors and that he had informed me that it was a necessary expence but to this i could not condescend the little business which during his life mr evelyn had in law mr hilary had always transacted he had a sincere regard for me and a reverence for the memory of his late kinsman whose earnest recommendation of me he did not forget being well acquainted with the character of lord bray he foresaw and warned me of my danger while a baronet to behold himself a peer had been his lordships darling passion but that was now gratified and as he was proud he was likewise revengeful in this case however to warn was useless i had no alternative except by means that were dishonorable nor was the resentment of lord bray single or so much to be apprehended as that of the earl with whom he had entered into strict alliance my behaviour to lord idford had uniformly been what he deemed so very insolent that his antipathy may be said to have taken birth at my first act of disobedience my refusal to dine at the second table since then as he conceived it had been progressive in aggravation my scorn of his selfish politics my attempt to continue the letters of themistocles and write him who was the supposed author of them into disgrace the pamphlet of which i was the author the activity with which i had canvassed in favour of mowbray and to sum up all my daring to rival him with the woman on whom he would have conferred his person his dignity and his other great qualities were all of them injuries that rankled at his heart when these things are remembered few will feel surprised that the earl should indulge a passion which is in itself so active or that he should induce lord bray to pursue that kind of conduct to which he was already so much disposed the danger however must be faced and mr hilary wrote as my attorney to state the circumstances above recited a week elapsed before he received an answer but at the end of that time his lordships attorney replied that personal security for so large a sum could not be accepted my bond would be no better than the notes i had given and that i was required immediately to pay what was due to the estate and heirs of the late mr evelyn the spirit in which this note was written proved the temper of my creditor and an incident soon occurred by which his propensity to persecute was called into action the scrutiny which hector had demanded was over and decided against him but understanding that there was an absolute breach between me and lord bray mowbray was convinced that he had accused me falsely as he was almost certain that he could prove bribery and corruption to have been practised by his opponent he persisted in determining to bring it before the house of commons this business kept him still in the country where he and his partisans were busily collecting information he had experienced my utility in the course of the election he wished to enjoy the same advantage at present and he and his committee likewise discovered that my evidence was essentially necessary he therefore wrote me an apology spoke in the handsomest terms he could recollect of the services i had done him requested me to come down once more to aid him in his present attempt and stated the points on which my future testimony would be useful he further informed me that a gentleman of the law whom he named was to set off the morning after i should receive the letter at ten oclock and come post and that he should be much obliged to me if i would take a seat in the same chaise the letter was read in the committee room as a matter of business and in this committee room lord idford had a secret agent from whom he gained intelligence of all their proceedings that deserved notice desirous as i was of obliging the brother of olivia i made no hesitation to comply the evening before i was to go down into i went to mr hilary to acquaint him with the place of my destination and the manner in which he might direct to me if any thing new should occur the agents of lord bray or to speak more truly of the earl had been exceedingly industrious and a writ was already procured it was intended to take me as i stepped into the chaise or that evening if possible and accordingly the door where i lived was watched and i was seen to come out my usual pace was brisk but i happened now to be in haste and as they told me themselves the setters lost sight of me for some time were afterward cautious of coming up to me in any public street where a rescue was probable and followed me till i came almost to the door of mr hilary here there was a carriage standing and to my great surprise and joy i saw mr hilary with a light conducting out the very person whom i had some time before discovered in the pit and whom i now knew to be the wounded stranger i hesitated whether i ought to spring forward and intrude my enquiries immediately upon him or make them of mr hilary with whom it appeared he was acquainted and at this instant the bailiff and his two men came up with me and told me i was their prisoner while i stood astonished at this sudden and at that precise time unexpected event the carriage with the stranger in it drove away and mr hilary shut the door without seeing me there is a sense of indignity and disgrace in being arrested at which all those who have not been frequently subjected to it revolt i was wholly ignorant of the manners of the people who had laid their hands upon me i had heard of giving bail but i had likewise heard that it was a thing of danger to which men were generally averse and i had a bitter repugnance to ask any thing which i thought it was likely should be refused neither had i any probable person to ask for my little law reading had taught me that the sureties of a debtor must be housekeepers unwilling therefore to trouble mr hilary and finding myself without resource i desired the bailiff to take me wherever he pleased or wherever the law directed i suppose sir you do not mean we should take you to jail said the bailiff ignorant as i was and surprised at the question i asked where else they meant to take me he replied to my house sir or to any other lock up house that you choose a lock up house sir said i pray what is that the bailiff knew not how to give a direct answer but replied there is some lock up houses at which a gentleman may be treated like a gentleman though i cannot say but there is others that is shabby enough i see very well sir you are a young gentleman and do not know the trim of such things so if you please to go to my house you will find very civil usage i can tell by your cut sir that you are no scrub so my wife will take care to furnish you with every thing that is genteel and polite the man smelled excessively of brandy and tobacco which corresponding with his gait looks and language seemed an introduction to the purgatory to which i was doomed i thought proper however to accept his offer and go to the house where i was to be treated with so much politeness and gentility chapter xiv the good breeding of a bailiff a period of dejection a visit from mr hilary the hopes he conceives the bailiff and one of his followers walked beside me cautiously keeping in advance and the other marched behind till we came to a stand of coaches and i was asked whether one of them should be called i was thoroughly ashamed of my company but a deep sense of indignity confuses thought and till it was proposed by the bailiff i had forgotten that there was such a thing as a coach his proposal was immediately accepted and we were driven through lincolnsinnfields into careystreet where we were obliged to alight and pass through several narrow allies i had no great expectations of the gentility of the bailiffs abode but slender as they were the few i had were disappointed i was wholly unused to such places this i suspect was one of the meanest of them and the approach to the house as well as all that was in it bespoke wretchedness and inspired disgust as soon as we entered the doors the bailiff called aloud for charlotte the name of his wife and desired her to bring light into the drawing room why what do you talk of george replied charlotte are you drunk dont you know the gentleman is there that you brought in this morning do you think i dont know what i am about answered george i have brought another gentleman so that there gentleman must come down and hoik into the best parlour i am sure retorted charlotte with great vivacity and significance he has behaved vastly proper since he came into my house he has had friends with him all afternoon and dined and called for wine and done every thing that was genteel though half in a trance i was sufficiently awake to understand her meaning i therefore interrupted the bailiff who had begun to reply with passion you are very right madam said i the gentleman must not be disturbed i have no friends that drink wine and i drink none myself this hint was quite sufficient neither the drawing room nor the best parlour were now to be had and i was shewn into a dirty back place which was little more than a closet decorated with a wooden cut of lord lovat over the mantle piece and corresponding pictures of the king and queen on each side before she shut the door charlotte demanded if i chose to have some more coals on the fire and whether i would have two candles or one whatever you please madam i replied nay sir said she pertly that is just as you please i made no answer and she shut the door with a dissatisfied air which she locked on the outside at any other time this george and charlotte with their drawingroom would have presented many whimsical associations to my mind but at present my attention was called to the iron bars of the one window of my prison hole and to the recollection that in all probability i was now shut up for life the weight of evil was so oppressive that i sat motionless in sullen stupefaction for a considerable time hearing no sound whatever the bailiff i suppose was alarmed for he unlocked the door and coming in abruptly exclaimed oh i thought it could not be meaning probably that i could not possibly have escaped through the window recollecting himself he asked if i did not think proper to send to some friends to which i laconically answered no but i suppose you mean to give bail sir i have none to give i perceive how it is sir you are not used to the business and so you are cast down you must bethink yourself for i dare say a young gentleman like you will find bail fast enough becase why the sum is not quite four hundred and forty pounds we have people enough which will go of any message for you so i would advise you to send though it is late becase as you says you dont drink there will be no good much in your staying here not but what we have as good beds and as good wines and all sorts of liquors and can get any thing else as good as a gentleman needs lick his lips to there is never no complaints at our house so you had better take my advice and cheer up your spirits and get a little something good in your belly in the way of eating and drinking and send to let your friends know as how you are nabbed becase nothing can come of it otherwise neither to you nor nobody else his discourse awakened me enough to remind me of the necessity of sending to the gentleman with whom i had intended to travel the next day and inform him of the impossibility of my taking the journey this led me to reflect further the remark of the bailiff was just delay was prejudicial what had happened could not be kept secret secrecy was in itself vicious and to increase evil by procrastination was cowardly thus far roused i presently conceived and determined on my plan i saw no probability of avoiding a prison but being in this house i was resolved first to see my friends i had already sold my horses and discharged my servant clarke i knew would reproach me if i did not accept his goods offices in my distress when such good offices as he could perform would be most necessary i intended therefore to request him the next morning to go round and inform such of my friends as i wished to see but as the bailiff told me it would be proper to send for my attorney immediately i thought proper to dispatch a messenger with one note to him and another to the gentleman with whom i was to have travelled mr hilary was at home and came instantly on the receipt of my billet when he saw me he endeavoured to smile and not appear in the least surprised or affected but his feelings betrayed him the tears started into his eyes and he was obliged to turn away his face he made an effort however and recovered himself after which he rather endeavoured to enter into easy conversation than to talk of business by this i suspected that he neither durst trust himself nor me till a little time should have reconciled us to the scene this was a proper opportunity for enquiries which my sudden misfortune had not made me forget i questioned him concerning the stranger whose person i described and mentioned my having seen mr hilary light him out of the house the moment before i was arrested what do you know of him said mr hilary with an eager air have you ever seen him before yes if i am not very much mistaken nay but tell me what do you know first answer me concerning who and what he is a gentleman of large fortune the last of his family and a great traveller has he met with any accident lately yes but why do you ask and why do you seem so much awakened by the question because he is excessively desirous of discovering some gentleman who found him after he had been robbed and left supposed to be dead that he may if possible reward his preserver now there are some circumstances as related by the people of an inn to which he was taken that have suggested a thought to me which should it prove true would give me inexpressible pleasure what are they that the good samaritan who performed this act of humanity was a young gentleman with a servant out of livery that he and his man rode two blood horses both bright bays that the servants name was samuel and that the master was in person very like you all which correspond and i really believe by your smiling that it actually was you suppose it what then why then i am sure you have gained a friend who will never suffer you to go to prison the word friend conjured up a train of ideas which almost overcame me i have lost a friend said i who would not have suffered me to go to prison but he is gone i accepted even his favours with an aching and unwilling heart and prison itself will not i suspect be so painful to me as more obligations of the same kind and conferred by a person who though i am strongly prepossessed in his favour i scarcely can hope should equal mr evelyn and if he even did an extravagant supposition i should still hesitate i doubt if a prison itself be so hateful as a knowledge that i am only out of one on sufferance and that when any caprice shall seize my creditor i may be hunted like a ferocious beast and commanded to my den like a crouching cur mr hilary endeavoured to combat this train of thinking but it was not to be conquered the short period of trial since the death of mr evelyn had afforded me too many proofs of the painful sensations which such a knowledge can excite and of the propensity which i had to give them encouragement to be as i have said the slave of any mans temper not as an effort of duty but from a sense of fear was insufferable a prison locks bolts and bread and water were to be preferred mr hilary sat with me till bed time and not only to put the bailiff in good humour but to cheer my heart and his own ordered supper and drank more plentifully of wine than was his custom urging me to follow his example i did not refuse for i had a contempt for any thing that had the appearance of an incapacity to endure whatever the tyranny of rancorous men and unjust laws could inflict the stranger he told me was gone down into the country from whence he would return within a week but he forbore to mention his name as he had been instructed the stranger having enquiries to make which induced him to keep it secret before he left me mr hilary received instructions from me to be given to clarke after which we quitted the best parlour into which we had been introduced with great ceremony to sup and i retired to try how soundly i could sleep in one of the good beds of a lockup house chapter xv morning visitors a generous proposal rejected the affectionate friendship of miss wilmot a very unexpected visitor his extraordinary conduct and a scene of reconciliation a letter which excites delightful sensations the morning came the diligence of mr hilary was that of a friend and the best parlour was soon filled the reader will easily guess by whom there is an undescribable pleasure when we are persecuted by one set of human beings to receive marks of affection from another it is a strong consolation to know that kindness and justice have not wholly forsaken the earth wilmot clarke and turl were with me i called for breakfast and felt a gratification at enjoying another social meal before being immured in i knew not what kind of dungeon charlotte and her maid pol were very alert and i believe she almost repented that i was not in the drawingroom since she found i had so many friends clarke was asked to partake but answered with a no thank you mr trevor i supposed it was awkward bashfulness i did him wrong he had a more refined and feeling motive for when i pressed him very earnestly he repliedat another time mr trevor such a favour would make me happy and you know i have not refused but just now why it would look as if because you are under misfortunes i might take liberties honesthearted generous fellow he was still the same but he breakfasted with us be assured good reader he breakfasted with us and now i had a contest to undergo which was maintained with so much obstinacy that it became truly painful wilmot in consequence of the success of his comedy had the power to discharge my debt and on this at first he peremptorily insisted but it was what i could not accept he was i knew an evelyn in soul but i too panted to be something i could not endure to rob him of the labour of a life and walk at large oppressed by the consciousness of impotence of a depressed and sunken spirit of which groveling meanness would be the chief feature such at least were my sensations and they were too impetuous to be overcome in the ardour we mutually felt turl was appealed to by both at first he strongly inclined to the side of wilmot but hearing my reasons and perceiving the anguish which the proposal gave he at length saidlet us pause awhile we are friends imprisonment is a detestable thing and there is no danger that as friends we should suffer each other to endure it long if there should be any possible and honest means of imparting freedom we need make no professions in one part of his argument mr trevor is undoubtedly right if he can relieve himself by his abilities and industry which he is persuaded he can it is his duty for it will not only increase his immediate happiness but it will give confidence to his efforts and strength to his mind qualities that are inestimable impediments serve but to rouse the man of genius to reject aid from a sentiment of haughtiness is a vice but to despair of our own resources is the death of all true greatness of character in any case suspend your contest in which though from the best of motives you are both too warm examine your arguments at leisure if mr trevor can be rendered most happy and useful by accepting your offer it will then be just in him to cede but remember once more we are friends that know each others worth and it will be just that i should partake in his release to this i know you will both joyfully consent if good can be done you will not deny me my share it was characteristic of turl never to speak on serious occasions without leaving a deep impression on his hearers wilmot heaved a profound sigh but was silent having thus far prevailed i was desirous of being immediately removed to prison but to this they both vehemently objected it had an air of ostentation of affecting to love misery for miserys sake time ought to be taken for consideration and evil should not be sported with though when unavoidable it ought to be endured with fortitude while these debates took place it was no uninteresting spectacle to contemplate the changes in the countenance of clarke before the adventure of bath he had risen much above the level of his companions but now when he saw a man willing to part with all he possessed to rescue another from prison and heard strong reasons why it was probable the offer ought not to be accepted his feelings were all in arms his passions while wilmot pleaded were ready to break their bounds and when he listened to the answers that were returned his mind was filled and expanded he discovered that there is a disinterested grandeur in morality of which he had no previous conception he was in a new world and a dark room with barred windows was heaven in all its splendor having agreed to follow their advice wilmot and turl left me with a promise to return early in the evening but poor clarke said he had no heart for work that day and he could not abide to leave me shut up by myself he saw plainly enough i had true friends such as would never forsake me and no more would he though he could do me no good when however i represented to him my wish to be alone that i might consider on my situation and requested he would dine with his family and bring some books from my lodgings in the evening he complied the morning of the day was chiefly consumed and i was not suffered long to remain alone i had scarcely dined before a coach stopped at the door and charlotte came in with demure significance in her face there is a young lady sir said she which says her name is wilmot which wants to see you at this moment she was the most agreeable visitor that could have arrived her heart was full her eyes were swollen and red with weeping and as soon as she entered the room she again burst into tears it has often been asked why sorrows like these should excite so much gratification the answer is evident they are not only tokens of personal respect and affection but they are proofs that injustice cannot be committed without being perceptibly and often deeply felt by others as well as by those on whom it is exercised when she had appeased her feelings sufficiently to be able to speak i found that like her brother she was come with a disinterested plan for my relief she began by blaming herself for not having strenuously enough opposed my forbearance with respect to wakefield and pleaded with great energy of feeling to persuade me immediately to do myself right i took the first favourable opportunity to interrupt her and enquired if she had seen or heard any thing of wakefield since the letter he wrote she answered he had been with her above an hour that very morning in what temper of mind was he extremely exasperated not at you oh no at lord bray at your persecutors at the world in general he says you are not fit to live in it you are no match for it you have been persuading him contrary to all history and experience that men are capable of virtue and happiness in short he owns that he was more than half convinced but that he believes he shall be obliged to relapse into his former opinions i have persuaded him so he says when where i cannot tell i thought from his discourse that he had met with you while we were engaged in this conversation charlotte again entered and told me there was a gentleman of the name of wakefield who desired to see me is it possible exclaimed miss wilmot the door opened and he appeared belmont cried i with surprise why did you announce yourself by the name of wakefield he stretched out his hand to me and turned his face aside then recovering himself replied the farce is over what do you mean that i suppose you will despise me but do if you please for though i love you i too despise to fear you i have done you various wrongs my name is wakefield i have been one of the infernal instruments to bring you here but i am come to make you all the atonement in my power and take you out forgive me only so far as not to insult me by repeating your contempt of that villain wakefield it is a damned undigestible term but i deserved it and you applied it to me without intending an affront i know you are as brave as you are generous till i met with you i thought myself the first man in the world but notwithstanding my evasive raillery i felt your hand upon me i sunk under you there was something in you that excited my envy at first and afterward perhaps a better passion what damned accidents they were that made me what i have been i cannot tell i know not what i shall be but i know what i am i disdain penitential promises if you will be my friend here is my hand good fortune or bad we will share it together thus invited could i refrain oh no i cannot describe the scene that passed we did not embrace for we were no actors and as our passions for a time were too big for utterance we were silent miss wilmot at length looked up and while the tears were streaming down her cheeks her countenance assumed an expression infinitely beyond smiling though something like it while she exclaimedthis is a happy day her eye first met mine and then wakefields he instantly hung his head and saidlydia when we were alone i could just endure to look at you but now i cannot yet i am an ass what is done is done the affections that i have are yours but i must not no nor i will not be afraid even of my own thoughts i know i have nothing to fear from you man is a strange animal and may be many things in the course of a short life wakefield then rang the bell and desired the bailiff would send immediately to lord brays attorney that my debts might be settled and i released and to call as he knew they must for forms sake and see that there were no more detainers hearing him give these directions i could not but ask his meaning what replied he with generous indignation do you suppose that i am come to cant about virtue that at least is a vice of which you have never yet found me guilty i am here to pay your debts with money in my possession whether in a court of law it would be proved to be yours or mine i neither know nor care but there is something better that i do know which is that if i were in your place and you in mine you would not long let me remain in a house like this with respect to the future i am partly persuaded we shall neither of us act the miser miss wilmot again exclaimedthis is a happy day wakefield was impatient to see me released and was well acquainted with bailiffs if you are expeditious said he to george you will have a guinea for your industry if you are dilatory not a farthing more than your fees the promised guinea gave the messenger wings and in less than an hour the debt was discharged and a receipt in full delivered just as this account was closed another messenger came from a different quarter the anxiety of miss wilmot had induced her to take a bold step in the first emotions of grief she wrote to olivia and informed her of every circumstance as well as of the place of my detention this information produced the following letter and the bills inclosed as mentioned in its contents i have no words to speak my feelings i have never yet had an opportunity since i thought the love i bear you justifiable to declare them this is the time to be silent now would argue a distrust of you which would degrade me and render me unworthy both of you and the dignified virtues by which your conduct is guided every new fact that i hear of you does but increase that affection which i find ennobled by being so worthily placed after the proofs you have so repeatedly given it would be cowardice and hypocrisy to say less i inclose you five hundred pounds they are my own i would sooner even see you suffer than be guilty of an action which i know you could not approve they are what i have reserved from money allowed me to be employed on any urgent occasion surely there can be few more urgent than the present your refusal of them would wound me to the soul it would break my heart i need not add any thing more olivia mowbray who will tell me that virtue is not its own reward who will affirm that to conquer selfish desires to render the passions subservient to reason and to make those principles we commend in others rules for ourselves is not the way to be happy the tide of joy was full to overflowing and yet when i recollected that though no longer a prisoner it was denied me to obey the yearnings of my heart and pass the threshold of olivia how suddenly did it ebb chapter xvi a journey to aid hector once more projected an interview with the wounded stranger a discovery of great importance i shall forbear to repeat the joy and congratulations of friends with other less events and hasten to one which gave a more surprising turn to my affairs than even any that i had yet experienced the morning after my release it was my intention to go down into the county of agreeable to the desire of hector of this i informed mr hilary the evening before but as i was become very cautious in money matters i meant to go by the coach when he heard this mr hilary smiled and told me if i would go post he believed he could find me a companion who would willingly bear half the expence i enquired who and found it was no other than the stranger he had been down into cambridgeshire to settle some affairs and was now preparing for a journey into my native county for purposes which he will himself presently explain a proposal more agreeable than this could not have been made to me and it was agreed that we should meet and breakfast with mr hilary when i made the appointment mr hilary pressed me with unusual earnestness not to be induced to break it by any accident whatever the morning came i was punctual and the stranger was there he had slept at the house of mr hilary this sir said the latter presenting me is the young gentleman of whose acquaintance you are so very desirous the stranger regarded me earnestly and with great emotion in his countenance askedare you sir the humane person who found me almost expiring and by whose care i am now among the living i hope sir you do not think there was any thing extraordinary in what i did i wish i had not reason so to think how many there are who from mean and selfish motives would have passed me i cannot say but there are few indeed that would have discharged the office you undertook with so much unaffected and generous benevolence i am in your debt sir not only for my recovery for which i can never repay you but literally for money expended i shall forbear thanks for i have none that are adequate but suffer me to rid myself of petty obligations i understand sir that you are rich and i am not i therefore inform you without hesitation i left twenty pounds with the physician you may well suppose that i returned after my recovery to enquire for my preserver i was then informed of your whole proceedings and of the anxiety with which after your journey you came to complete the charitable office you had begun and i own sir that i was so desirous of seeing a person who in the very fervour of youth could act and feel as you have done that one excepted you are the man on earth i am most happy to meet mr hilary tells me that we are to be travelling companions most willingly i have long been a wanderer and am lately returned to end my days in my native land during my absence the elder branches of my family are all deceased i brought back with me more than sufficient for my own wants but their property has descended to me and i now very unexpectedly find myself wealthy and have you no descendants sir none i am at present in search of a distant relation whom if i should find and find him such as my present hopes and past knowledge have pictured him i shall be one of the happiest of men to make this and another enquiry is the purpose of the journey i now mean to take when i left england i had no intention ever to return i therefore resolved to hold no correspondence with the persons whom i have left that i might not revive the memory of scenes and events which had been full of anguish by accident about eighteen months ago being then at grand cairo i was informed that a person of my family had long been dead this determined me to settle my concerns abroad and revisit my native country as however my informer spoke only from report i am desirous before i make myself known to verify this fact i have my reasons which from what i have said you may suspect to be those of resentment but not so they are only what i conceive to be necessary precautions acrimony and anger have long since died away and i have but too much cause to condemn those actions of my life in which they were indulged the relation whom i hope to find i may unfortunately discover to be more likely to misuse the wealth that has devolved to me by the death of the elder branches of my family than to make it a blessing to himself and others it is true he is not my heir at law i have no heir what i possess is at my own disposal but he was once my greatest favourite and i would avoid any action that should excite hopes which it might be weakness and vice in me to gratify this short narrative was not merely delivered with a serious air but it was accompanied with somewhat of a plaintive tone that rendered the venerable stranger unusually interesting it likewise excited various wild yet not impossible conjectures in my mind which made me very eager to pursue the discourse mr hilary whose mind had been full of conjectures mingled with doubt had not informed him of my name is the person said i in search of whom you mean to take this journey young or old about four and twenty he was the son of my wifes sister therefore my relation only by marriage he was certainly the most extraordinary child i ever beheld i cannot recollect him but with inconceivable emotions of affection of all the sportive little creatures i ever met with he was the most active the most undaunted and the most winning heaven bless the sweet boy he was my delight my eyes overflow whenever i recall to mind the feats of his childhood which can never be long forgotten by me my wife and her sister had been at variance and the first time i saw him was at a fair when he was not five years old i found him placed on a table where he stood reading the newspaper to country farmers who were collected round him and hearing him with astonishment they seemed to doubt if he could possibly be a child born of a woman and were more inclined to think him a supernatural being his flaxen curly hair his intelligent eyes his rosy cheeks his strong and proportioned limbs and his cheerful animated countenance rendered him the most beautiful and most endearing of human creatures the discriminating sensibility which he displayed was enchanting oh should he be living should i find him and should he be at present all that his infancy promised god of heaven and earth i should expire the pleasure would be too mighty for my years but should i survive it i should once again before i die feel the animating fervor of youth i listened in amazement i was not then acquainted with all the incidents of my childhood so perfectly as by hearing them repeated i since have been but i knew enough of them to be persuaded the discourse that i had heard could relate only to me i paused i gazed my eyes were riveted upon the narrator at length i exclaimedwhat i have just heard sir has excited very strange ideas they seem almost impossible and yet i am persuaded they are true pardon a question which i cannot refrain to ask surely i cannot be mistaken your name is elford sir you are my speak go on what am i my uncle heavens mr trevor is that your name it is oh god oh god oh godhugh little hugh my boy my sweet boy mr elford was almost overcome in a moment he again criedmy saviour too still the same courageous humane generous all that my soul could desire oh shield me deliver me from this excess of joy chapter xvii the conclusion one event only excepted little remains to be told of my story and that one is doubtless anticipated by the imagination of the reader to describe the enquiries that passed between me and my uncle the various fortunes we had encountered and the feelings they excited would be to write his history and tediously repeat my own my difficulties now disappeared i was the acknowledged heir of a man of great wealth therefore i myself am become a great man heaven preserve me from becoming indolent proud and oppressive i have not yet forgotten that oppression exists that pride is its chief counsellor that activity and usefulness are the sacred duties of both rich and poor that the wealth entrusted to my distribution is the property of those whom most it can benefit that i am a creature of very few wants but that those few in others as well as in myself are imperious and that i have felt them in all their rigour neither have i yet shut my doors on one of my former friends but i am comparatively young in prosperity how long i shall be able to persevere in this eccentric conduct time must tell at present i must proceed and mention the few remaining circumstances with which the reader may wish to be acquainted after my uncle had heard me describe olivia and mention the motives which induced me to wish to aid her brother he immediately determined on taking the journey we had before proposed we neither of us wished to separate robust in a green old age he had no fear of fatigue from travelling this distance and it would be a pleasure to revisit in my company scenes which would bring my former sports and pranks to his recollection he heard from me a confirmation of the death of mrs elford and heard it with the same tokens of melancholy in his face which he had betrayed when he spoke of her himself that i should have wished before i took this journey short as it was to have seen olivia related all my good fortune and partaken in the pleasure it would excite in her may well be imagined but forms and delicacies and i know not what habitual feelings forbad me the enjoyment of this premature bliss i wrote however and not only to her but to those tried and invaluable friends who were not to be neglected we found hector in a lamentable state instead of the bluff robust form which but shortly before he had worn his limbs were shrunk his cheeks formerly of a high red were wan and hollow his voice was gone his lungs were affected and his cough was incessant he had himself at last begun to think his life in danger and was preparing to return to town for advice consequently our stay was short his reception of me however was friendly the increasing debility which he felt softened his manners and when he understood the good fortune that had befallen me he seemed sincerely to rejoice and now let me request the reader to call to mind not only my first emotions of love for olivia and the violence of the passion that preyed upon me while struggling between hope and despair but those late testimonies of affection such as a mind so dignified as hers could bestow and then let him imagine what our meeting must be should he expect me to describe her such as she was and is in all her attractions all her beauties and all her various excellence he expects an impossible task to be beloved by her to be found worthy of her and to call her mine are blessings that infinitely exceed momentary rapture they are lasting and indubitable happiness i know not if it will give him pleasure to be told that could i have delighted in revenge i might have satiated myself with that unworthy and destructive passion the committee appointed to decide on the election voted the idford candidate guilty of bribery and corruption the fortune of the earl like that of hector has suffered depredations which half a century will probably not repair the newmade peer and his party daily became so obnoxious to the nation by the destructive tendency of their measures that they were and continue to be haunted by terrors that deprive them of the faculties common to man my heart bears witness for me that i do not speak this in triumph i should be no less vicious than unworthy could i triumph in the misfortunes of any human being but i were a wretch indeed were i to make mistakes that are the scourge of mankind a subject of exultation must i repeat more names is it necessary to say the virtues of turl and wilmot are too splendid to need my praise or that my social hours are most beneficially and delightfully spent in their society that i have amply provided for the generousminded clarke that philip is once more the good and faithful servant of a kind mistress that mary and her son are equally objects of my attention and that i do not mean to boast of these things as acts of munificence but as the performance of duties this were unnecessary neither shall i be required to particularize the present happiness of lydia now mrs wakefield and of that man of brilliant and astonishing faculties who is her affectionate companion and friend and from whose exertions if i am not strangely mistaken the world has so much to profit and so much to expect like me he is in the enjoyment of affluence and he enjoys it with a liberal and munificent spirit are there any who hate him because he once was guilty of hateful crimes i hope not it is a spirit that would sweep away half the inhabitants of the peopled earth for my own part i delight in his conversation am enlivened by his wit and prompted to enquiry by the acuteness of his remarks he is a man whom i am proud to say i love i have told my tale if it should afford instruction if it should inspire a love of virtue briefly if it should contribute to the happiness of mankind i shall have gained my purpose my labours will be most richly rewarded
