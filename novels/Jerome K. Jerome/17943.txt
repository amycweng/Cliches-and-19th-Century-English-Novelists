transcribed from the j w arrowsmith edition by david price email ccxcoventryacuk the observations of henry by jerome k jerome author of three men in a boat diary of a pilgrimage three men on the bummel etc bristol j w arrowsmith quay street london simpkin marshall hamilton kent and company limited the ghost of the marchioness of appleford this is the story among others of henry the waiter or as he now prefers to call himself henri told to me in the long dining room of the riffel alp hotel where i once stayed for a melancholy week between seasons sharing the echoing emptiness of the place with two maiden ladies who talked all day to one another in frightened whispers henry's construction i have discarded for its amateurishness his method being generally to commence a story at the end and then working backwards to the beginning wind up with the middle but in all other respects i have endeavoured to retain his method which was individual and this i think is the story as he would have told it to me himself had he told it in this order my first place well to be honest it was a coffee shop in the mile end road i'm not ashamed of it we all have our beginnings young kipper as we called him he had no name of his own not that he knew of anyhow and that seemed to fit him down to the ground had fixed his pitch just outside between our door and the music hall at the corner and sometimes when i might happen to have a bit on i'd get a paper from him and pay him for it when the governor was not about with a mug of coffee and odds and ends that the other customers had left on their plates an arrangement that suited both of us he was just about as sharp as they make boys even in the mile end road which is saying a good deal and now and then spying around among the right sort and keeping his ears open he would put me up to a good thing and i would tip him a bob or a tanner as the case might be he was the sort that gets on you know one day in he walks for all the world as if the show belonged to him with a young imp of a girl on his arm and down they sits at one of the tables garsong he calls out what's the menoo to day the menoo to day i says is that you get outside 'fore i clip you over the ear and that you take that back and put it where you found it meaning o' course the kid she was a pretty little thing even then in spite of the dirt with those eyes like saucers and red hair it used to be called carrots in those days now all the swells have taken it up or as near as they can get to it and it's auburn 'enery he replied to me without so much as turning a hair i'm afraid you're forgetting your position when i'm on the kerb shouting 'speshul' and you comes to me with yer 'a'penny in yer 'and you're master an' i'm man when i comes into your shop to order refreshments and to pay for 'em i'm boss savey you can bring me a rasher and two eggs and see that they're this season's the lidy will have a full sized haddick and a cocoa well there was justice in what he said he always did have sense and i took his order you don't often see anybody put it away like that girl did i took it she hadn't had a square meal for many a long day she polished off a ninepenny haddick skin and all and after that she had two penny rashers with six slices of bread and butter doorsteps as we used to call them and two half pints of cocoa which is a meal in itself the way we used to make it kipper must have had a bit of luck that day he couldn't have urged her on more had it been a free feed 'ave an egg he suggested the moment the rashers had disappeared one of these eggs will just about finish yer i don't really think as i can says she after considering like well you know your own strength he answers perhaps you're best without it speshully if yer not used to 'igh living i was glad to see them finish 'cause i was beginning to get a bit nervous about the coin but he paid up right enough and giv me a ha'penny for myself that was the first time i ever waited upon those two but it wasn't to be the last by many a long chalk as you'll see he often used to bring her in after that who she was and what she was he didn't know and she didn't know so there was a pair of them she'd run away from an old woman down limehouse way who used to beat her that was all she could tell him he got her a lodging with an old woman who had an attic in the same house where he slept when it would run to that taught her to yell speshul and found a corner for her there ain't room for boys and girls in the mile end road they're either kids down there or they're grown ups kipper and carrots as we named her looked upon themselves as sweethearts though he couldn't have been more than fifteen and she barely twelve and that he was regular gone on her anyone could see with half an eye not that he was soft about it that wasn't his style he kept her in order and she had just to mind which i guess was a good thing for her and when she wanted it he'd use his hand on her and make no bones about it that's the way among that class they up and give the old woman a friendly clump just as you or me would swear at the missus or fling a boot jack at her they don't mean anything more i left the coffee shop later on for a place in the city and saw nothing more of them for five years when i did it was at a restaurant in oxford street one of those amatoor shows run by a lot of women who know nothing about the business and spend the whole day gossiping and flirting love shops i call 'em there was a yellow haired lady manageress who never heard you when you spoke to her 'cause she was always trying to hear what some seedy old fool would be whispering to her across the counter then there were waitresses and their notion of waiting was to spend an hour talking to a twopenny cup of coffee and to look haughty and insulted whenever anybody as really wanted something ventured to ask for it a frizzle haired cashier used to make love all day out of her pigeon hole with the two box office boys from the oxford music hall who took it turn and turn about sometimes she'd leave off to take a customer's money and sometimes she wouldn't i've been to some rummy places in my time and a waiter ain't the blind owl as he's supposed to be but never in my life have i seen so much love making not all at once as used to go on in that place it was a dismal gloomy sort of hole and spoony couples seemed to scent it out by instinct and would spend hours there over a pot of tea and assorted pastry idyllic some folks would have thought it i used to get the fair dismals watching it there was one girl a weird looking creature with red eyes and long thin hands that gave you the creeps to look at she'd come in regular with her young man a pale faced nervous sort of chap at three o'clock every afternoon theirs was the funniest love making i ever saw she'd pinch him under the table and run pins into him and he'd sit with his eyes glued on her as if she'd been a steaming dish of steak and onions and he a starving beggar the other side of the window a strange story that was as i came to learn it later on i'll tell you that one day i'd been engaged for the heavy work but as the heaviest order i ever heard given there was for a cold ham and chicken which i had to slip out for to the nearest cook shop i must have been chiefly useful from an ornamental point of view i'd been there about a fortnight and was feeling pretty sick of it when in walked young kipper i didn't know him at first he'd changed so he was swinging a silver mounted crutch stick which was the kind that was fashionable just then and was dressed in a showy check suit and a white hat but the thing that struck me most was his gloves i suppose i hadn't improved quite so much myself for he knew me in a moment and held out his hand what 'enery he says you've moved on then yes i says shaking hands with him and i could move on again from this shop without feeling sad but you've got on a bit i says so so he says i'm a journalist oh i says what sort for i'd seen a good many of that lot during six months i'd spent at a house in fleet street and their get up hadn't sumptuousness about it so to speak kipper's rig out must have totted up to a tidy little sum he had a diamond pin in his tie that must have cost somebody fifty quid if not him well he answers i don't wind out the confidential advice to old beaky and that sort of thing i do the tips yer know 'cap'n kit' that's my name what the captain kit i says o' course i'd heard of him be'old he says oh it's easy enough he goes on some of 'em's bound to come out right and when one does you take it from me our paper mentions the fact and when it is a wrong 'un well a man can't always be shouting about himself can 'e he ordered a cup of coffee he said he was waiting for someone and we got to chatting about old times how's carrots i asked miss caroline trevelyan he answered is doing well oh i says you've found out her fam'ly name then we've found out one or two things about that lidy he replies d'yer remember 'er dancing i have seen her flinging her petticoats about outside the shop when the copper wasn't by if that's what you mean i says that's what i mean he answers that's all the rage now 'skirt dancing' they calls it she's a coming out at the oxford to morrow it's 'er i'm waiting for she's a coming on i tell you she is he says shouldn't wonder says i that was her disposition and there's another thing we've found out about 'er he says he leant over the table and whispered it as if he was afraid that anybody else might hear she's got a voice yes i says some women have ah he says but 'er voice is the sort of voice yer want to listen to oh i says that's its speciality is it that's it sonny he replies she came in a little later i'd a' known her anywhere for her eyes and her red hair in spite of her being that clean you might have eaten your dinner out of her hand and as for her clothes well i've mixed a good deal with the toffs in my time and i've seen duchesses dressed more showily and maybe more expensively but her clothes seemed to be just a framework to show her up she was a beauty you can take it from me and it's not to be wondered that the la de das were round her when they did see her like flies round an open jam tart before three months were up she was the rage of london leastways of the music hall part of it with her portrait in all the shop windows and interviews with her in half the newspapers it seems she was the daughter of an officer who had died in india when she was a baby and the niece of a bishop somewhere in australia he was dead too there didn't seem to be any of her ancestry as wasn't dead but they had all been swells she had been educated privately she had by a relative and had early displayed an aptitude for dancing though her friends at first had much opposed her going upon the stage there was a lot more of it you know the sort of thing of course she was a connection of one of our best known judges they all are and she merely acted in order to support a grandmother or an invalid sister i forget which a wonderful talent for swallowing these newspaper chaps has some of 'em kipper never touched a penny of her money but if he had been her agent at twenty five per cent he couldn't have worked harder and he just kept up the hum about her till if you didn't want to hear anything more about caroline trevelyan your only chance would have been to lie in bed and never look at a newspaper it was caroline trevelyan at home caroline trevelyan at brighton caroline trevelyan and the shah of persia caroline trevelyan and the old apple woman when it wasn't caroline trevelyan herself it would be caroline trevelyan's dog as would be doing something out of the common getting himself lost or summoned or drowned it didn't matter much what i moved from oxford street to the new horseshoe that year it had just been rebuilt and there i saw a good deal of them for they came in to lunch there or supper pretty regular young kipper or the captain as everybody called him gave out that he was her half brother i'ad to be some sort of a relation you see he explained to me i'd a' been 'er brother out and out that would have been simpler only the family likeness wasn't strong enough our styles o' beauty ain't similar they certainly wasn't why don't you marry her i says and have done with it he looked thoughtful at that i did think of it he says and i know jolly well that if i 'ad suggested it 'fore she'd found herself she'd have agreed but it don't seem quite fair now how d'ye mean fair i says well not fair to 'er he says i've got on all right in a small way but she well she can just 'ave 'er pick of the nobs there's one on 'em as i've made inquiries about 'e'll be a dook if a kid pegs out as is expected to and anyhow 'e'll be a markis and 'e means the straight thing no errer it ain't fair for me to stand in 'er way well i says you know your own business but it seems to me she wouldn't have much way to stand in if it hadn't been for you oh that's all right he says i'm fond enough of the gell but i shan't clamour for a tombstone with wiolets even if she ain't ever mrs capt'n kit business is business and i ain't going to queer 'er pitch for 'er i've often wondered what she'd a' said if he'd up and put the case to her plain for she was a good sort but naturally enough her head was a bit swelled and she'd read so much rot about herself in the papers that she'd got at last to half believe some of it the thought of her connection with the well known judge seemed to hamper her at times and she wasn't quite so chummy with kipper as used to be the case in the mile end road days and he wasn't the sort as is slow to see a thing one day when he was having lunch by himself and i was waiting on him he says raising his glass to his lips well 'enery here's luck to yer i won't be seeing you agen for some time oh i says what's up now i am he says or rather my time is i'm off to africa oh i says and what about that's all right he interrupts i've fixed up that a treat truth that's why i'm going i thought at first he meant she was going with him no he says she's going to be the duchess of ridingshire with the kind consent o' the kid i spoke about if not she'll be the marchioness of appleford 'e's doing the square thing there's going to be a quiet marriage to morrow at the registry office and then i'm off what need for you to go i says no need he says it's a fancy o' mine you see me gone there's nothing to 'amper 'er nothing to interfere with 'er settling down as a quiet respectable toff with a 'alf brother who's always got to be spry with some fake about 'is lineage and 'is ancestral estates and who drops 'is 'h's' complications are sooner or later bound to a rise me out of it everything's simple savey well that's just how it happened of course there was a big row when the family heard of it and a smart lawyer was put up to try and undo the thing no expense was spared you bet but it was all no go nothing could be found out against her she just sat tight and said nothing so the thing had to stand they went and lived quietly in the country and abroad for a year or two and then folks forgot a bit and they came back to london i often used to see her name in print and then the papers always said as how she was charming and graceful and beautiful so i suppose the family had made up its mind to get used to her one evening in she comes to the savoy my wife put me up to getting that job and a good job it is mind you when you know your way about i'd never have had the cheek to try for it if it hadn't been for the missis she's a clever one she is i did a good day's work when i married her you shave off that moustache of yours it ain't an ornament she says to me and chance it don't get attempting the lingo keep to the broken english and put in a shrug or two you can manage that all right i followed her tip of course the manager saw through me but i got in a oui monsieur now and again and they being short handed at the time could not afford to be strict i suppose anyhow i got took on and there i stopped for the whole season and that was the making of me well as i was saying in she comes to the supper rooms and toffy enough she looked in her diamonds and furs and as for haughtiness there wasn't a born marchioness she couldn't have given points to she comes straight up to my table and sits down her husband was with her but he didn't seem to have much to say except to repeat her orders of course i looked as if i'd never set eyes on her before in all my life though all the time she was a pecking at the mayonnaise and a sipping at the giessler i was thinking of the coffee shop and of the ninepenny haddick and the pint of cocoa go and fetch my cloak she says to him after a while i am cold and up he gets and goes out she never moved her head and spoke as though she was merely giving me some order and i stands behind her chair respectful like and answers according to the same tip ever hear from 'kipper' she says to me i have had one or two letters from him your ladyship i answers oh stow that she says i am sick of 'your ladyship' talk english i don't hear much of it how's he getting on seems to be doing himself well i says he's started an hotel and is regular raking it in he tells me wish i was behind the bar with him says she why don't it work then i asks it's just like a funeral with the corpse left out says she serves me jolly well right for being a fool the marquis he comes back with her cloak at that moment and i says certainement madame and gets clear i often used to see her there and when a chance occurred she would talk to me it seemed to be a relief to her to use her own tongue but it made me nervous at times for fear someone would hear her then one day i got a letter from kipper to say he was over for a holiday and was stopping at morley's and asking me to look him up he had not changed much except to get a bit fatter and more prosperous looking of course we talked about her ladyship and i told him what she said rum things women he says never know their own minds oh they know them all right when they get there i says how could she tell what being a marchioness was like till she'd tried it pity he says musing like i reckoned it the very thing she'd tumble to i only come over to get a sight of 'er and to satisfy myself as she was getting along all right seems i'd better a' stopped away you ain't ever thought of marrying yourself i asks yes i have he says it's slow for a man over thirty with no wife and kids to bustle him you take it from me and i ain't the talent for the don juan fake you're like me i says a day's work and then a pipe by your own fireside with your slippers on that's my swarry you'll find someone as will suit you before long no i shan't says he i've come across a few as might if it 'adn't been for 'er it's like the toffs as come out our way they've been brought up on 'ris de veau a la financier' and sich like and it just spoils 'em for the bacon and greens i give her the office the next time i see her and they met accidental like in kensington gardens early one morning what they said to one another i don't know for he sailed that same evening and it being the end of the season i didn't see her ladyship again for a long while when i did it was at the hotel bristol in paris and she was in widow's weeds the marquis having died eight months before he never dropped into that dukedom the kid turning out healthier than was expected and hanging on so she was still only a marchioness and her fortune though tidy was nothing very big not as that class reckons by luck i was told off to wait on her she having asked for someone as could speak english she seemed glad to see me and to talk to me well i says i suppose you'll be bossing that bar in capetown now before long talk sense she answers how can the marchioness of appleford marry a hotel keeper why not i says if she fancies him what's the good of being a marchioness if you can't do what you like that's just it she snaps out you can't it would not be doing the straight thing by the family no she says i've spent their money and i'm spending it now they don't love me but they shan't say as i have disgraced them they've got their feelings same as i've got mine why not chuck the money i says they'll be glad enough to get it back they being a poor lot as i heard her say how can i she says it's a life interest as long as i live i've got to have it and as long as i live i've got to remain the marchioness of appleford she finishes her soup and pushes the plate away from her as long as i live she says talking to herself by jove she says starting up why not why not what i says nothing she answers get me an african telegraph form and be quick about it i fetched it for her and she wrote it and gave it to the porter then and there and that done she sat down and finished her dinner she was a bit short with me after that so i judged it best to keep my own place in the morning she got an answer that seemed to excite her and that afternoon she left and the next i heard of her was a paragraph in the newspaper headed death of the marchioness of appleford sad accident it seemed she had gone for a row on one of the italian lakes with no one but a boatman a squall had come on and the boat had capsized the boatman had swum ashore but he had been unable to save his passenger and her body had never been recovered the paper reminded its readers that she had formerly been the celebrated tragic actress caroline trevelyan daughter of the well known indian judge of that name it gave me the blues for a day or two that bit of news i had known her from a baby as you might say and had taken an interest in her you can call it silly but hotels and restaurants seemed to me less interesting now there was no chance of ever seeing her come into one again i went from paris to one of the smaller hotels in venice the missis thought i'd do well to pick up a bit of italian and perhaps she fancied venice for herself that's one of the advantages of our profession you can go about it was a second rate sort of place and one evening just before lighting up time i had the salle a manger all to myself and had just taken up a paper when i hears the door open and i turns round i saw her coming down the room there was no mistaking her she wasn't that sort i sat with my eyes coming out of my head till she was close to me and then i says carrots i says in a whisper like that was the name that come to me 'carrots' it is she says and down she sits just opposite to me and then she laughs i could not speak i could not move i was that took aback and the more frightened i looked the more she laughed till kipper comes into the room there was nothing ghostly about him i never see a man look more as if he had backed the winner why it's 'enery he says and he gives me a slap on the back as knocks the life into me again i heard you was dead i says still staring at her i read it in the paper 'death of the marchioness of appleford' that's all right she says the marchioness of appleford is as dead as a door nail and a good job too mrs captain kit's my name nee 'carrots' you said as 'ow i'd find someone to suit me 'fore long says kipper to me and by jove you were right i 'ave i was waiting till i found something equal to her ladyship and i'd 'ave 'ad to wait a long time i'm thinking if i 'adn't come across this one 'ere and he tucks her up under his arm just as i remember his doing that day he first brought her into the coffee shop and lord what a long time ago that was that is the story among others told me by henry the waiter i have at his request substituted artificial names for real ones for henry tells me that at capetown captain kit's first class family and commercial hotel still runs and that the landlady is still a beautiful woman with fine eyes and red hair who might almost be taken for a duchess until she opens her mouth when her accent is found to be still slightly reminiscent of the mile end road the uses and abuses of joseph it is just the same with what you may call the human joints observed henry he was in one of his philosophic moods that evening it all depends upon the cooking i never see a youngster hanging up in the refrigerator as one may put it but i says to myself 'now i wonder what the cook is going to make of you will you be minced and devilled and fricasseed till you are all sauce and no meat will you be hammered tender and grilled over a slow fire till you are a blessing to mankind or will you be spoilt in the boiling and come out a stringy rag an immediate curse and a permanent injury to those who have got to swallow you' there was a youngster i knew in my old coffee shop days continued henry that in the end came to be eaten by cannibals at least so the newspapers said speaking for myself i never believed the report he wasn't that sort if anybody was eaten it was more likely the cannibal but that is neither here nor there what i am thinking of is what happened before he and the cannibals ever got nigh to one another he was fourteen when i first set eyes on him mile end fourteen that is which is the same i take it as city eighteen and west end five and twenty and he was smart for his age into the bargain a trifle too smart as a matter of fact he always came into the shop at the same time half past two he always sat in the seat next the window and three days out of six he would order the same dinner a fourpenny beef steak pudding we called it beef steak and for all practical purposes it was beef steak a penny plate of potatoes and a penny slice of roly poly pudding 'chest expander' was the name our customers gave it to follow that showed sense i always thought that dinner alone a more satisfying menu at the price i defy any human being to work out he always had a book with him and he generally read during his meal which is not a bad plan if you don't want to think too much about what you are eating there was a seedy chap i remember used to dine at a cheap restaurant where i once served just off the euston road he would stick a book up in front of him eppy something or other and read the whole time our four course shilling table d'hote with eppy he would say was a banquet fit for a prince without eppy he was of opinion that a policeman wouldn't touch it but he was one of those men that report things for the newspapers and was given to exaggeration a coffee shop becomes a bit of a desert towards three o'clock and after a while young tidelman for that was his name got to putting down his book and chatting to me his father was dead which judging from what he told me about the old man must have been a bit of luck for everybody and his mother it turned out had come from my own village in suffolk and that constituted a sort of bond between us seeing i had known all her people pretty intimately he was earning good money at a dairy where his work was scouring milk cans and his christian name which was the only thing christian about him and that somehow or another didn't seem to fit him was joseph one afternoon he came into the shop looking as if he had lost a shilling and found sixpence as the saying is and instead of drinking water as usual sent the girl out for a pint of ale the moment it came he drank off half of it at a gulp and then sat staring out of the window 'what's up' i says 'got the shove' 'yes' he answers 'but as it happens it's a shove up i've been taken off the yard and put on the walk with a rise of two bob a week' then he took another pull at the beer and looked more savage than ever 'well' i says 'that ain't the sort of thing to be humpy about' 'yes it is' he snaps back 'it means that if i don't take precious good care i'll drift into being a blooming milkman spending my life yelling milk ahoi and spooning smutty faced servant gals across area railings' 'oh' i says 'and what may you prefer to spoon duchesses' 'yes' he answers sulky like 'duchesses are right enough some of 'em' 'so are servant gals' i says 'some of 'em your hat's feeling a bit small for you this morning ain't it' 'hat's all right' says he 'it's the world as i'm complaining of beastly place there's nothing to do in it' 'oh' i says 'some of us find there's a bit too much' i'd been up since five that morning myself and his own work which was scouring milk cans for twelve hours a day didn't strike me as suggesting a life of leisured ease 'i don't mean that' he says 'i mean things worth doing' 'well what do you want to do' i says 'that this world ain't big enough for' 'it ain't the size of it' he says 'it's the dulness of it things used to be different in the old days' 'how do you know' i says 'you can read about it' he answers 'oh' i says 'and what do they know about it these gents that sit down and write about it for their living you show me a book cracking up the old times writ by a chap as lived in 'em and i'll believe you till then i'll stick to my opinion that the old days were much the same as these days and maybe a trifle worse' 'from a sunday school point of view perhaps yes' says he 'but there's no gainsaying ' 'no what' i says 'no gainsaying' repeats he 'it's a common word in literatoor' 'maybe' says i 'but this happens to be the blue posts coffee house established in the year we will use modern english here if you don't mind' one had to take him down like that at times he was the sort of boy as would talk poetry to you if you weren't firm with him 'well then there's no denying the fact' says he 'if you prefer it that way that in the old days there was more opportunity for adventure' 'what about australia' says i 'australia' retorts he 'what would i do there be a shepherd like you see in the picture wear ribbons and play the flute' 'there's not much of that sort of shepherding over there' says i 'unless i've been deceived but if australia ain't sufficiently uncivilised for you what about africa' 'what's the good of africa' replies he 'you don't read advertisements in the clerkenwell news young men wanted as explorers i'd drift into a barber's shop at cape town more likely than anything else' 'what about the gold diggings' i suggests i like to see a youngster with the spirit of adventure in him it shows grit as a rule 'played out' says he 'you are employed by a company wages ten dollars a week and a pension for your old age everything's played out' he continues 'men ain't wanted nowadays there's only room for clerks and intelligent artisans and shopboys' 'go for a soldier' says i 'there's excitement for you' 'that would have been all right' says he 'in the days when there was real fighting' 'there's a good bit of it going about nowadays' i says 'we are generally at it on and off between shouting about the blessings of peace' 'not the sort of fighting i mean' replies he 'i want to do something myself not be one of a row' 'well' i says 'i give you up you've dropped into the wrong world it seems to me we don't seem able to cater for you here' 'i've come a bit too late' he answers 'that's the mistake i've made two hundred years ago there were lots of things a fellow might have done' 'yes i know what's in your mind' i says 'pirates' 'yes pirates would be all right' says he 'they got plenty of sea air and exercise and didn't need to join a blooming funeral club' 'you've got ideas above your station' i says 'you work hard and one day you'll have a milk shop of your own and be walking out with a pretty housemaid on your arm feeling as if you were the prince of wales himself' 'stow it' he says 'it makes me shiver for fear it might come true i'm not cut out for a respectable cove and i won't be one neither if i can help it' 'what do you mean to be then' i says 'we've all got to be something until we're stiff 'uns' 'well' he says quite cool like 'i think i shall be a burglar' i dropped into the seat opposite and stared at him if any other lad had said it i should have known it was only foolishness but he was just the sort to mean it 'it's the only calling i can think of' says he 'that has got any element of excitement left in it' 'you call seven years at portland excitement do you' says i thinking of the argument most likely to tell upon him 'what's the difference' answers he 'between portland and the ordinary labouring man's life except that at portland you never need fear being out of work' he was a rare one to argue 'besides' says he 'it's only the fools as gets copped look at that diamond robbery in bond street two years ago fifty thousand pounds' worth of jewels stolen and never a clue to this day look at the dublin bank robbery' says he his eyes all alight and his face flushed like a girl's 'three thousand pounds in golden sovereigns walked away with in broad daylight and never so much as the flick of a coat tail seen those are the sort of men i'm thinking of not the bricklayer out of work who smashes a window and gets ten years for breaking open a cheesemonger's till with nine and fourpence ha'penny in it' 'yes' says i 'and are you forgetting the chap who was nabbed at birmingham only last week he wasn't exactly an amatoor how long do think he'll get' 'a man like that deserves what he gets' answers he 'couldn't hit a police man at six yards' 'you bloodthirsty young scoundrel' i says 'do you mean you wouldn't stick at murder' 'it's all in the game' says he not in the least put out 'i take my risks he takes his it's no more murder than soldiering is' 'it's taking a human creature's life' i says 'well' he says 'what of it there's plenty more where he comes from' i tried reasoning with him from time to time but he wasn't a sort of boy to be moved from a purpose his mother was the only argument that had any weight with him i believe so long as she had lived he would have kept straight that was the only soft spot in him but unfortunately she died a couple of years later and then i lost sight of joe altogether i made enquiries but no one could tell me anything he had just disappeared that's all one afternoon four years later i was sitting in the coffee room of a city restaurant where i was working reading the account of a clever robbery committed the day before the thief described as a well dressed young man of gentlemanly appearance wearing a short black beard and moustache had walked into a branch of the london and westminster bank during the dinner hour when only the manager and one clerk were there he had gone straight through to the manager's room at the back of the bank taken the key from the inside of the door and before the man could get round his desk had locked him in the clerk with a knife to his throat had then been persuaded to empty all the loose cash in the bank amounting in gold and notes to nearly five hundred pounds into a bag which the thief had thoughtfully brought with him after which both of them for the thief seems to have been of a sociable disposition got into a cab which was waiting outside and drove away they drove straight to the city the clerk with a knife pricking the back of his neck all the time finding it no doubt a tiresome ride in the middle of threadneedle street the gentlemanly young man suddenly stopped the cab and got out leaving the clerk to pay the cabman somehow or other the story brought back joseph to my mind i seemed to see him as that well dressed gentlemanly young man and raising my eyes from the paper there he stood before me he had scarcely changed at all since i last saw him except that he had grown better looking and seemed more cheerful he nodded to me as though we had parted the day before and ordered a chop and a small hock i spread a fresh serviette for him and asked him if he cared to see the paper 'anything interesting in it henry' says he 'rather a daring robbery committed on the westminster bank yesterday' i answers 'oh ah i did see something about that' says he 'the thief was described as a well dressed young man of gentlemanly appearance wearing a black beard and moustache' says i he laughs pleasantly 'that will make it awkward for nice young men with black beards and moustaches' says he 'yes' i says 'fortunately for you and me we're clean shaved' i felt as certain he was the man as though i'd seen him do it he gives me a sharp glance but i was busy with the cruets and he had to make what he chose out of it 'yes' he replies 'as you say it was a daring robbery but the man seems to have got away all right' i could see he was dying to talk to somebody about it 'he's all right to day' says i 'but the police ain't the fools they're reckoned i've noticed they generally get there in the end' 'there's some very intelligent men among them' says he 'no question of it i shouldn't be surprised if they had a clue' 'no' i says 'no more should i though no doubt he's telling himself there never was such a clever thief' 'well we shall see' says he 'that's about it' says i we talked a bit about old acquaintances and other things and then having finished he handed me a sovereign and rose to go 'wait a minute' i says 'your bill comes to three and eight say fourpence for the waiter that leaves sixteen shillings change which i'll ask you to put in your pocket' 'as you will' he says laughing though i could see he didn't like it 'and one other thing' says i 'we've been sort of pals and it's not my business to talk unless i'm spoken to but i'm a married man' i says 'and i don't consider you the sort worth getting into trouble for if i never see you i know nothing about you understand' he took my tip and i didn't see him again at that restaurant i kept my eye on the paper but the westminster bank thief was never discovered and success no doubt gave him confidence anyhow i read of two or three burglaries that winter which i unhesitatingly put down to mr joseph i suppose there's style in housebreaking as in other things and early the next spring an exciting bit of business occurred which i knew to be his work by the description of the man he had broken into a big country house during the servants' supper hour and had stuffed his pockets with jewels one of the guests a young officer coming upstairs interrupted him just as he had finished joseph threatened the man with his revolver but this time it was not a nervous young clerk he had to deal with the man sprang at him and a desperate struggle followed with the result that in the end the officer was left with a bullet in his leg while joseph jumped clean through the window and fell thirty feet cut and bleeding if not broken he would never have got away but that fortunately for him a tradesman's cart happened to be standing at the servants' entrance joe was in it and off like a flash of greased lightning how he managed to escape with all the country in an uproar i can't tell you but he did it the horse and cart when found sixteen miles off were neither worth much that it seems sobered him down for a bit and nobody heard any more of him till nine months later when he walked into the monico where i was then working and held out his hand to me as bold as brass 'it's all right' says he 'it's the hand of an honest man' 'it's come into your possession very recently then' says i he was dressed in a black frock coat and wore whiskers if i hadn't known him i should have put him down for a parson out of work he laughs 'i'll tell you all about it' he says 'not here' i answers 'because i'm too busy but if you like to meet me this evening and you're talking straight ' 'straight as a bullet' says he 'come and have a bit of dinner with me at the craven it's quiet there and we can talk i've been looking for you for the last week' well i met him and he told me it was the old story a gal was at the bottom of it he had broken into a small house at hampstead he was on the floor packing up the silver when the door opens and he sees a gal standing there she held a candle in one hand and a revolver in the other 'put your hands up above your head' says she 'i looked at the revolver' said joe telling me 'it was about eighteen inches off my nose and then i looked at the gal there's lots of 'em will threaten to blow your brains out for you but you've only got to look at 'em to know they won't 'they are thinking of the coroner's inquest and wondering how the judge will sum up she met my eyes and i held up my hands if i hadn't i wouldn't have been here 'now you go in front' says she to joe and he went she laid her candle down in the hall and unbolted the front door 'what are you going to do' says joe 'call the police because if so my dear i'll take my chance of that revolver being loaded and of your pulling the trigger in time it will be a more dignified ending' 'no' says she 'i had a brother that got seven years for forgery i don't want to think of another face like his when he came out i'm going to see you outside my master's house and that's all i care about' she went down the garden path with him and opened the gate 'you turn round' says she 'before you reach the bottom of the lane and i give the alarm' and joe went straight and didn't look behind him well it was a rum beginning to a courtship but the end was rummer the girl was willing to marry him if he would turn honest joe wanted to turn honest but didn't know how 'it's no use fixing me down my dear to any quiet respectable calling' says joe to the gal 'because even if the police would let me alone i wouldn't be able to stop there i'd break out sooner or later try as i might' the girl went to her master who seems to have been an odd sort of a cove and told him the whole story the old gent said he'd see joe and joe called on him 'what's your religion' says the old gent to joe 'i'm not particular sir i'll leave it to you' says joe 'good' says the old gent 'you're no fanatic what are your principles' at first joe didn't think he'd got any but the old gent leading he found to his surprise as he had 'i believe' says joe 'in doing a job thoroughly' 'what your hand finds to do you believe in doing with all your might eh' says the old gent 'that's it sir' says joe 'that's what i've always tried to do' 'anything else' asks the old gent 'yes stick to your pals' said joe 'through thick and thin' suggests the old gent 'to the blooming end' agrees joe 'that's right' says the old gent 'faithful unto death and you really want to turn over a new leaf to put your wits and your energy and your courage to good use instead of bad' 'that's the idea' says joe the old gent murmurs something to himself about a stone which the builders wouldn't have at any price and then he turns and puts it straight 'if you undertake the work' says he 'you'll go through with it without faltering you'll devote your life to it' 'if i undertake the job i'll do that' says joe 'what may it be' 'to go to africa' says the old gent 'as a missionary' joe sits down and stares at the old gent and the old gent looks him back 'it's a dangerous station' says the old gent 'two of our people have lost their lives there it wants a man there a man who will do something besides preach who will save these poor people we have gathered together there from being scattered and lost who will be their champion their protector their friend' in the end joe took on the job and went out with his wife a better missionary that society never had and never wanted i read one of his early reports home and if the others were anything like it his life must have been exciting enough even for him his station was a small island of civilisation as one may say in the middle of a sea of savages before he had been there a month the place had been attacked twice on the first occasion joe's 'flock' had crowded into the mission house and commenced to pray that having been the plan of defence adopted by his predecessor joe cut the prayer short and preached to them from the text 'heaven helps them as helps themselves' after which he proceeded to deal out axes and old rifles in his report he mentioned that he had taken a hand himself merely as an example to the flock i bet he had never enjoyed an evening more in all his life the second fight began as usual round the mission but seems to have ended two miles off in less than six months he had rebuilt the school house organised a police force converted all that was left of one tribe and started a tin church he added but i don't think they read that part of his report aloud that law and order was going to be respected and life and property secure in his district so long as he had a bullet left later on the society sent him still further inland to open up a fresh station and there it was that according to the newspapers the cannibals got hold of him and ate him as i said personally i don't believe it one of these days he'll turn up sound and whole he is that sort the surprise of mr milberry it's not the sort of thing to tell 'em remarked henry as with his napkin over his arm he leant against one of the pillars of the verandah and sipped the glass of burgundy i had poured out for him and they wouldn't believe it if you did tell 'em not one of 'em but it's the truth for all that without the clothes they couldn't do it who wouldn't believe what i asked he had a curious habit had henry of commenting aloud upon his own unspoken thoughts thereby bestowing upon his conversation much of the quality of the double acrostic we had been discussing the question whether sardines served their purpose better as a hors d'oeuvre or as a savoury and i found myself wondering for the moment why sardines above all other fish should be of an unbelieving nature while endeavouring to picture to myself the costume best adapted to display the somewhat difficult figure of a sardine henry put down his glass and came to my rescue with the necessary explanation why women that they can tell one baby from another without its clothes i've got a sister a monthly nurse and she will tell you for a fact if you care to ask her that up to three months of age there isn't really any difference between 'em you can tell a girl from a boy and a christian child from a black heathen perhaps but to fancy you can put your finger on an unclothed infant and say 'that's a smith or that's a jones' as the case may be why it's sheer nonsense take the things off 'em and shake them up in a blanket and i'll bet you what you like that which is which you'd never be able to tell again so long as you lived i agreed with henry so far as my own personal powers of discrimination might be concerned but i suggested that to mrs jones or mrs smith there would surely occur some means of identification so they'd tell you themselves no doubt replied henry and of course i am not thinking of cases where the child might have a mole or a squint as might come in useful but take 'em in general kids are as much alike as sardines of the same age would be anyhow i knew a case where a fool of a young nurse mixed up two children at an hotel and to this day neither of those women is sure that she's got her own do you mean i said there was no possible means of distinguishing there wasn't a flea bite to go by answered henry they had the same bumps the same pimples the same scratches they were the same age to within three days they weighed the same to an ounce and they measured the same to an inch one father was tall and fair and the other was short and dark the tall fair man had a dark short wife and the short dark man had married a tall fair woman for a week they changed those kids to and fro a dozen times a day and cried and quarrelled over them each woman felt sure she was the mother of the one that was crowing at the moment and when it yelled she was positive it was no child of hers they thought they would trust to the instinct of the children neither child so long as it wasn't hungry appeared to care a curse for anybody and when it was hungry it always wanted the mother that the other kid had got they decided in the end to leave it to time it's three years ago now and possibly enough some likeness to the parents will develop that will settle the question all i say is up to three months old you can't tell 'em i don't care who says you can he paused and appeared to be absorbed in contemplation of the distant matterhorn then clad in its rosy robe of evening there was a vein of poetry in henry not uncommon among cooks and waiters the perpetual atmosphere of hot food i am inclined to think favourable to the growth of the softer emotions one of the most sentimental men i ever knew kept a ham and beef shop just off the farringdon road in the early morning he could be shrewd and business like but when hovering with a knife and fork above the mingled steam of bubbling sausages and hissing peas pudding any whimpering tramp with any impossible tale of woe could impose upon him easily but the rummiest go i ever recollect in connection with a baby continued henry after a while his gaze still fixed upon the distant snow crowned peaks happened to me at warwick in the jubilee year i'll never forget that is it a proper story i asked a story fit for me to hear on consideration henry saw no harm in it and told it to me accordingly he came by the 'bus that meets the he'd a handbag and a sort of hamper it looked to me like a linen basket he wouldn't let the boots touch the hamper but carried it up into his bedroom himself he carried it in front of him by the handles and grazed his knuckles at every second step he slipped going round the bend of the stairs and knocked his head a rattling good thump against the balustrade but he never let go that hamper only swore and plunged on i could see he was nervous and excited but one gets used to nervous and excited people in hotels whether a man's running away from a thing or running after a thing he stops at a hotel on his way and so long as he looks as if he could pay his bill one doesn't trouble much about him but this man interested me he was so uncommonly young and innocent looking besides it was a dull hole of a place after the sort of jobs i'd been used to and when you've been doing nothing for three months but waiting on commercial gents as are having an exceptionally bad season and spoony couples with guide books you get a bit depressed and welcome any incident however slight that promises to be out of the common i followed him up into his room and asked him if i could do anything for him he flopped the hamper on the bed with a sigh of relief took off his hat wiped his head with his handkerchief and then turned to answer me are you a married man says he it was an odd question to put to a waiter but coming from a gent there was nothing to be alarmed about well not exactly i says i was only engaged at that time and that not to my wife if you understand what i mean but i know a good deal about it i says and if it's a matter of advice it isn't that he answers interrupting me but i don't want you to laugh at me i thought if you were a married man you would be able to understand the thing better have you got an intelligent woman in the house we've got women i says as to their intelligence that's a matter of opinion they're the average sort of women shall i call the chambermaid ah do he says wait a minute he says we'll open it first he began to fumble with the cord then he suddenly lets go and begins to chuckle to himself no he says you open it open it carefully it will surprise you i don't take much stock in surprises myself my experience is that they're mostly unpleasant what's in it i says you'll see if you open it he says it won't hurt you and off he goes again chuckling to himself well i says to myself i hope you're a harmless specimen then an idea struck me and i stopped with the knot in my fingers it ain't a corpse i says is it he turned as white as the sheet on the bed and clutched the mantlepiece good god don't suggest such a thing he says i never thought of that open it quickly i'd rather you came and opened it yourself sir i says i was beginning not to half like the business i can't he says after that suggestion of yours you've put me all in a tremble open it quick man tell me it's all right well my own curiosity helped me i cut the cord threw open the lid and looked in he kept his eyes turned away as if he were frightened to look for himself is it all right he says is it alive it's about as alive i says as anybody'll ever want it to be i should say is it breathing all right he says if you can't hear it breathing i says i'm afraid you're deaf you might have heard its breathing outside in the street he listened and even he was satisfied thank heaven he says and down he plumped in the easy chair by the fireplace you know i never thought of that he goes on he's been shut up in that basket for over an hour and if by any chance he'd managed to get his head entangled in the clothes i'll never do such a fool's trick again you're fond of it i says he looked round at me fond of it he repeats why i'm his father and then he begins to laugh again oh i says then i presume i have the pleasure of addressing mr coster king coster king he answers in surprise my name's milberry i says the father of this child according to the label inside the cover is coster king out of starlight his mother being jenny deans out of darby the devil he looks at me in a nervous fashion and puts the chair between us it was evidently his turn to think as how i was mad satisfying himself i suppose that at all events i wasn't dangerous he crept closer till he could get a look inside the basket i never heard a man give such an unearthly yell in all my life he stood on one side of the bed and i on the other the dog awakened by the noise sat up and grinned first at one of us and then at the other i took it to be a bull pup of about nine months old and a fine specimen for its age my child he shrieks with his eyes starting out of his head that thing isn't my child what's happened am i going mad you're on that way i says and so he was calm yourself i says what did you expect to see my child he shrieks again my only child my baby do you mean a real child i says a human child some folks have such a silly way of talking about their dogs you never can tell of course i do he says the prettiest child you ever saw in all your life just thirteen weeks old on sunday he cut his first tooth yesterday the sight of the dog's face seemed to madden him he flung himself upon the basket and would i believe have strangled the poor beast if i hadn't interposed between them 'tain't the dog's fault i says i daresay he's as sick about the whole business as you are he's lost too somebody's been having a lark with you they've took your baby out and put this in that is if there ever was a baby there what do you mean he says well sir i says if you'll excuse me gentlemen in their sober senses don't take their babies about in dog baskets where do you come from from banbury he says i'm well known in banbury i can quite believe it i says you're the sort of young man that would be known anywhere i'm mr milberry he says the grocer in the high street then what are you doing here with this dog i says don't irritate me he answers i tell you i don't know myself my wife's stopping here at warwick nursing her mother and in every letter she's written home for the last fortnight she's said 'oh how i do long to see eric if only i could see eric for a moment' a very motherly sentiment i says which does her credit so this afternoon continues he it being early closing day i thought i'd bring the child here so that she might see it and see that it was all right she can't leave her mother for more than about an hour and i can't go up to the house because the old lady doesn't like me and i excite her i wish to wait here and milly that's my wife was to come to me when she could get away i meant this to be a surprise to her and i guess i says it will be the biggest one you have ever given her don't try to be funny about it he says i'm not altogether myself and i may do you an injury he was right it wasn't a subject for joking though it had its humorous side but why i says put it in a dog basket it isn't a dog basket he answers irritably it's a picnic hamper at the last moment i found i hadn't got the face to carry the child in my arms i thought of what the street boys would call out after me he's a rare one to sleep and i thought if i made him comfortable in that he couldn't hurt just for so short a journey i took it in the carriage with me and carried it on my knees i haven't let it out of my hands a blessed moment it's witchcraft that's what it is i shall believe in the devil after this don't be ridiculous i says there's some explanation it only wants finding you are sure this is the identical hamper you packed the child in he was calmer now he leant over and examined it carefully it looks like it he says but i can't swear to it you tell me i says you never let it go out of your hands now think no he says it's been on my knees all the time but that's nonsense i says unless you packed the dog yourself in mistake for your baby now think it over quietly i'm not your wife i'm only trying to help you i shan't say anything even if you did take your eyes off the thing for a minute he thought again and a light broke over his face by jove he says you're right i did put it down for a moment on the platform at banbury while i bought a 'tit bits' there you are i says now you're talking sense and wait a minute isn't to morrow the first day of the birmingham dog show i believe you're right he says now we're getting warm i says by a coincidence this dog was being taken to birmingham packed in a hamper exactly similar to the one you put your baby in you've got this man's bull pup he's got your baby and i wouldn't like to say off hand at this moment which of you's feeling the madder as likely as not he thinks you've done it on purpose he leant his head against the bed post and groaned milly may be here at any moment says he and i'll have to tell her the baby's been sent by mistake to a dog show i daresn't do it he says i daresn't do it go on to birmingham i says and try and find it you can catch the quarter to six and be back here before eight come with me he says you're a good man come with me i ain't fit to go by myself he was right he'd have got run over outside the door the state he was in then well i says if the guv'nor don't object oh he won't he can't cries the young fellow wringing his hands tell him it's a matter of a life's happiness tell him i'll tell him it's a matter of half sovereign extra on to the bill i says that'll more likely do the trick and so it did with the result that in another twenty minutes me and young milberry and the bull pup in its hamper were in a third class carriage on our way to birmingham then the difficulties of the chase began to occur to me suppose by luck i was right suppose the pup was booked for the birmingham dog show and suppose by a bit more luck a gent with a hamper answering description had been noticed getting out of the train then where were we we might have to interview every cabman in the town as likely as not by the time we did find the kid it wouldn't be worth the trouble of unpacking still it wasn't my cue to blab my thoughts the father poor fellow was feeling i take it just about as bad as he wanted to feel my business was to put hope into him so when he asked me for about the twentieth time if i thought as he would ever see his child alive again i snapped him up shortish don't you fret yourself about that i says you'll see a good deal of that child before you've done with it babies ain't the sort of things as gets lost easily it's only on the stage that folks ever have any particular use for other people's children i've known some bad characters in my time but i'd have trusted the worst of 'em with a wagon load of other people's kids don't you flatter yourself you're going to lose it whoever's got it you take it from me his idea is to do the honest thing and never rest till he's succeeded in returning it to the rightful owner well my talking like that cheered him and when we reached birmingham he was easier we tackled the station master and he tackled all the porters who could have been about the platform when the came in all of 'em agreed that no gent got out of that train carrying a hamper the station master was a family man himself and when we explained the case to him he sympathised and telegraphed to banbury the booking clerk at banbury remembered only three gents booking by that particular train one had been mr jessop the corn chandler the second was a stranger who had booked to wolverhampton and the third had been young milberry himself the business began to look hopeless when one of smith's newsboys who was hanging around struck in i see an old lady says he hovering about outside the station and a hailing cabs and she had a hamper with her as was as like that one there as two peas i thought young milberry would have fallen upon the boy's neck and kissed him with the boy to help us we started among the cabmen old ladies with dog baskets ain't so difficult to trace she had gone to a small second rate hotel in the aston road i heard all particulars from the chambermaid and the old girl seems to have had as bad a time in her way as my gent had in his they couldn't get the hamper into the cab it had to go on the top the old lady was very worried as it was raining at the time and she made the cabman cover it with his apron getting it off the cab they dropped the whole thing in the road that woke the child up and it began to cry good lord ma'am what is it asks the chambermaid a baby yes my dear it's my baby answers the old lady who seems to have been a cheerful sort of old soul leastways she was cheerful up to then poor dear i hope they haven't hurt him the old lady had ordered a room with a fire in it the boots took the hamper up and laid it on the hearthrug the old lady said she and the chambermaid would see to it and turned him out by this time according to the girl's account it was roaring like a steam siren pretty dear says the old lady fumbling with the cord don't cry mother's opening it as fast as she can then she turns to the chambermaid if you open my bag says she you will find a bottle of milk and some dog biscuits dog biscuits says the chambermaid yes says the old lady laughing my baby loves dog biscuits the girl opened the bag and there sure enough was a bottle of milk and half a dozen spratt's biscuits she had her back to the old lady when she heard a sort of a groan and a thud as made her turn round the old lady was lying stretched dead on the hearthrug so the chambermaid thought the kid was sitting up in the hamper yelling the roof off in her excitement not knowing what she was doing she handed it a biscuit which it snatched at greedily and began sucking then she set to work to slap the old lady back to life again in about a minute the poor old soul opened her eyes and looked round the baby was quiet now gnawing the dog biscuit the old lady looked at the child then turned and hid her face against the chambermaid's bosom what is it she says speaking in an awed voice the thing in the hamper it's a baby ma'am says the maid you're sure it ain't a dog says the old lady look again the girl began to feel nervous and to wish that she wasn't alone with the old lady i ain't likely to mistake a dog for a baby ma'am says the girl it's a child a human infant the old lady began to cry softly it's a judgment on me she says i used to talk to that dog as if it had been a christian and now this thing has happened as a punishment what's happened says the chambermaid who was naturally enough growing more and more curious i don't know says the old lady sitting up on the floor if this isn't a dream and if i ain't mad i started from my home at farthinghoe two hours ago with a one year old bulldog packed in that hamper you saw me open it you see what's inside it now but bulldogs says the chambermaid ain't changed into babies by magic i don't know how it's done says the old lady and i don't see that it matters i know i started with a bulldog and somehow or other it's got turned into that somebody's put it there says the chambermaid somebody as wanted to get rid of a child they've took your dog out and put that in its place they must have been precious smart says the old lady the hamper hasn't been out of my sight for more than five minutes when i went into the refreshment room at banbury for a cup of tea that's when they did it says the chambermaid and a clever trick it was the old lady suddenly grasped her position and jumped up from the floor and a nice thing for me she says an unmarried woman in a scandal mongering village this is awful it's a fine looking child says the chambermaid would you like it says the old lady the chambermaid said she wouldn't the old lady sat down and tried to think and the more she thought the worse she felt the chambermaid was positive that if we hadn't come when we did the poor creature would have gone mad when the boots appeared at the door to say there was a gent and a bulldog downstairs enquiring after a baby she flung her arms round the man's neck and hugged him we just caught the train to warwick and by luck got back to the hotel ten minutes before the mother turned up young milberry carried the child in his arms all the way he said i could have the hamper for myself and gave me half a sovereign extra on the understanding that i kept my mouth shut which i did i don't think he ever told the child's mother what had happened leastways if he wasn't a fool right through he didn't the probation of james wrench there are two sorts of men as gets hen pecked remarked henry i forgot how the subject had originated but we had been discussing the merits of henry viii considered as a father and a husband the sort as likes it and the sort as don't and i wouldn't be too cocksure that the sort as does isn't on the whole in the majority you see continued henry argumentatively it gives as it were a kind of interest to life which nowadays with everything going smoothly and no chance of a row anywhere except in your own house is apt to become a bit monotonous there was a chap i got to know pretty well one winter when i was working in dresden at the europaischer hof a quiet meek little man he was a journeyman butcher by trade and his wife was a dressmaker a schneiderin as they call them over there and ran a fairly big business in the praguer strasse i've always been told that german husbands are the worst going treating their wives like slaves or at the best as mere upper servants but my experience is that human nature don't alter so much according to distance from london as we fancy it does and that husbands have their troubles same as wives all the world over anyhow i've come across a german husband or two as didn't carry about with him any sign of the slave driver such as you might notice at all events not in his own house and i know for a fact that meister anton which was the name of the chap i'm telling you about couldn't have been much worse off not even if he'd been an englishman born and bred there were no children to occupy her mind so she just devoted herself to him and the work girls and made things hum as they say in america for all of them as for the girls they got away at six in the evening and not many of them stopped more than the first month but the old man not being able to give notice had to put up with an average of eighteen hours a day of it and even when as was sometimes the case he managed to get away for an hour or two in the evening for a quiet talk with a few of us over a glass of beer he could never be quite happy thinking of what was accumulating for him at home of course everybody as knew him knew of his troubles for a scolding wife ain't the sort of thing as can be hid under a bushel and was sorry for him he being as amiable and good tempered a fellow as ever lived and most of us spent our time with him advising him for his good some of the more ardent would give him recipes for managing her but they being generally speaking bachelors their suggestions lacked practicability as you might say one man bored his life out persuading him to try a bucket of cold water he was one of those cold water enthusiasts this fellow took it himself for everything and always went to a hydropathic establishment for his holidays rumour had it that meister anton really did try this experiment on one unfortunate occasion worried into it i suppose by the other chap's persistency anyhow we didn't see him again for a week he being confined to his bed with a chill on the liver and the next suggestion made to him he rejected quite huffily explaining that he had no intention of putting any fresh ideas into his wife's head she wasn't a bad woman mind you merely given to fits of temper at times she could be quite pleasant but when she wasn't life with her must have been exciting he had stood it for about seven years and then one day without a word of warning to anyone he went away and left her as she was quite able to keep herself this seemed to be the best arrangement possible and everybody wondered why he had never thought of it before i did not see him again for nine months until i ran against him by pure chance on the koln platform where i was waiting for a train to paris he told me they had made up all their differences by correspondence and that he was then on his way back to her he seemed quite cheerful and expectant 'do you think she's really reformed' i says 'do you think nine months is long enough to have taught her a lesson' i didn't want to damp him but personally i have never known but one case of a woman being cured of nagging and that being brought about by a fall from a third story window resulting in what the doctors called permanent paralysis of the vocal organs can hardly be taken as a precedent 'no' he answers 'nor nine years but it's been long enough to teach me a lesson' 'you know me' he goes on 'i ain't a quarrelsome sort of chap if nobody says a word to me i never says a word to anybody and it's been like that ever since i left her day in and day out all just the same up in the morning do your bit of work drink your glass of beer and to bed in the evening nothing to excite you nothing to rouse you why it's a mere animal existence' he was a rum sort of chap always thought things out from his own point of view as it were yes a curious case i remarked to henry not the sort of story to put about however it might give women the idea that nagging is attractive and encourage them to try it upon husbands who do not care for that kind of excitement not much fear of that replied henry the nagging woman is born as they say not made and she'll nag like the roses bloom not because she wants to but because she can't help it and a woman to whom it don't come natural will never be any real good at it try as she may and as for the men why we'll just go on selecting wives according to the old rule so that you never know what you've got till it's too late for you to do anything but make the best or the worst of it according as your fancy takes you there was a fellow continued henry as used to work with me a good many years ago now at a small hotel in the city he was a waiter like myself not a bad sort of chap though a bit of a toff in his off hours he'd been engaged for some two or three years to one of the chambermaids a pretty gentle looking little thing she was with big childish eyes and a voice like the pouring out of water they are strange things women one can never tell what they are made of from the taste of them and while i was there it having been a good season for both of them they thought they'd risk it and get married they did the sensible thing he coming back to his work after the week's holiday and she to hers the only difference being that they took a couple of rooms of their own in middleton row from where in summer time you can catch the glimpse of a green tree or two and slept out the first few months they were as happy as a couple in a play she thinking almost as much of him as he thought of himself which must have been a comfort to both of them and he as proud of her as if he made her himself and then some fifteenth cousin or so of his a man he had never heard of before died in new zealand and left him a fortune that was the beginning of his troubles and hers too i don't say it was enough to buy a peerage but to a man accustomed to dream of half crown tips it seemed an enormous fortune anyhow it was sufficient to turn his head and give him ideas above his station his first move of course was to chuck his berth and set fire to his dress suit which being tolerably greasy burned well had he stopped there nobody could have blamed him i've often thought myself that i would willingly give ten years of my life provided anybody wanted them which i don't see how they should to put my own behind the fire but he didn't he took a house in a mews with the front door in a street off grosvenor square furnished it like a second class german restaurant dressed himself like a bookmaker and fancied that with the help of a few shady city chaps and a broken down swell or two he had gathered round him he was fairly on the road to park lane and the house of lords and the only thing that struck him as being at all in his way was his wife in her cap and apron or her sunday print she had always looked as dainty and fetching a little piece of goods as a man could wish to be seen out with dressed according to the advice of his new found friends of course she looked like nothing else so much as a barn yard chicken in turkey cock's feathers he was shocked to find that her size in gloves was seven and a quarter and in boots something over four and that sort of thing naturally irritates a woman more even than finding fault with her immortal soul i guess for about a year he made her life pretty well a burden for her trying to bring her up to the standard of the saturday to monday at brighton set with which he had surrounded himself or which to speak more correctly had got round him she'd a precious sight more gumption than he had ever possessed and if he had listened to her instead of insisting upon her listening to him it would have been better for him but there are some men who think that if you have a taste for champagne and the ballet that proves you are intended by nature for a nob and he was one of them and any common sense suggestion of hers only convinced him of her natural unfitness for an exalted station he grumbled at her accent which seeing that his own was acquired in lime house and finished off in the minories was just the sort of thing a fool would do and he insisted on her reading all the society novels as they came out you know the sort i mean where everybody snaps everybody else's head off and all the proverbs are upside down people leave them about the hotels when they've done with them and one gets into the habit of dipping into them when one's nothing better to do his hope was that she might with pains get to talk like these books that was his ideal she did her best but of course the more she got away from herself the more absurd she became and the rubbish and worse that he had about him would ridicule her more or less openly and he instead of kicking them out into the mews which could have been done easily without grosvenor square knowing anything about it and thereby having its high class feelings hurt he would blame her when they had all gone just as if it was her fault that she was the daughter of a respectable bootmaker in the mile end road instead of something more likely than not turned out of the third row of the ballet because it couldn't dance and didn't want to learn he played a bit in the city and won at first and that swelled his head worse than ever it also brought him a good deal of sympathy from an italian countess the sort you find at homburg and that generally speaking is a widow her chief sorrow was for society that in him was losing an ornament she explained to him how an accomplished and experienced woman could help a man to gain admittance into the tiptop circles which according to her were just thirsting for him as a waiter he had his share of brains and it's a business that requires more insight than perhaps you'd fancy if you don't want to waste your time on a rabbit skin coat and a paste ring and give the burnt sole to the real gent but in the hands of this swell mob he was of course just the young man from the country and the end of it was that he played the game down pretty low she not the countess i shouldn't like you to have that idea but his wife came to be pretty friendly with my missus later on and that's how i got to know the details he comes to her one day looking pretty sheepish like as one can well believe and maybe he'd been drinking a bit to give himself courage 'we ain't been getting along too well together of late have we susan' says he 'we ain't seen much of one another' she answers 'but i agree with you we don't seem to enjoy it much when we do' 'it ain't your fault' says he 'i'm glad you think that' she answers 'it shows me you ain't quite as foolish as i was beginning to think you' 'of course i didn't know when i married you' he goes on 'as i was going to come into this money' 'no nor i either' says she 'or you bet it wouldn't have happened' 'it seems to have been a bit of a mistake' says he 'as things have turned out' 'it would have been a mistake and more than a bit of a one in any case' answers she 'i'm glad you agree with me' says he 'there'll be no need to quarrel' 'i've always tried to agree with you' says she 'we've never quarrelled yet and that ought to be sufficient proof to you that we never shall' 'it's a mistake that can be rectified' says he 'if you are sensible and that without any harm to anyone' 'oh' says she 'it must be a new sort of mistake that kind' 'we're not fitted for one another' says he 'out with it' says she 'don't you be afraid of my feelings they are well under control as i think i can fairly say by this time' 'with a man in your own station of life' says he 'you'd be happier' 'there's many a man i might have been happier with' replies she 'that ain't the thing to be discussed seeing as i've got you' 'you might get rid of me' says he 'you mean you might get rid of me' she answers 'it comes to the same thing' he says 'no it don't' she replies 'nor anything like it i shouldn't have got rid of you for my pleasure and i'm not going to do it for yours you can live like a decent man and i'll go on putting up with you or you can live like a fool and i shan't stand in your way but you can't do both and i'm not going to help you try' well he argued with her and he tried the coaxing dodge and he tried the bullying dodge but it didn't work neither of it 'i've done my duty by you' says she 'so far as i've been able and that i'll go on doing or not just as you please but i don't do more' 'we can't go on living like this' says he 'and it isn't fair to ask me to you're hammering my prospects' 'i don't want to do that' says she 'you take your proper position in society whatever that may be and i'll take mine i'll be glad enough to get back to it you may rest assured' 'what do you mean' says he 'it's simple enough' she answers 'i was earning my living before i married you and i can earn it again you go your way i go mine' it didn't satisfy him but there was nothing else to be done and there was no moving her now in any other direction whatever even had he wanted to he offered her anything in the way of money he wasn't a mean chap but she wouldn't touch a penny she had kept her old clothes i'm not sure that some idea of needing them hadn't always been in her head applied for a place under her former manager who was then bossing a hotel in kensington and got it and there was an end of high life so far as she was concerned as for him he went the usual way it always seems to me as if men and women were just like water sooner or later they get back to the level from which they started that is of course generally speaking here and there a drop clings where it climbs but taking them on the whole pumping up is a slow business lord i have seen them many of them jolly clever they've thought themselves with their diamond rings and big cigars 'wait a bit' i've always said to myself 'there'll come a day when you'll walk in and be glad enough of your chop and potatoes again with your half pint of bitter' and nine cases out of ten i've been right james wrench followed the course of the majority only a little more so tried to do others a precious sight sharper than himself and got done tried a dozen times to scramble up again each time coming down heavier than before till there wasn't another spring left in him and his only ambition victuals then of course he thought of his wife it's a wonderful domesticator ill luck and wondered what she was doing fortunately for him she'd been doing well her father died and left her a bit just a couple of hundred or so and with this and her own savings she started with a small inn in a growing town and had sold out again three years later at four times what she had paid for it she had done even better than that for herself she had developed a talent for cooking that was a settled income in itself and at this time was running a small hotel in brighton and making it pay to a tune that would have made the shareholders of some of its bigger rivals a bit envious could they have known he came to me having found out i don't know how necessity smartens the wits i suppose that my missis still kept up a sort of friendship with her and begged me to try and arrange a meeting between them which i did though i told him frankly that from what i knew his welcome wouldn't be much more enthusiastic than what he'd any right to expect but he was always of a sanguine disposition and borrowing his fare and an old greatcoat of mine he started off evidently thinking that all his troubles were over but they weren't exactly the married women's property act had altered things a bit and master james found himself greeted without any suggestion of tenderness by a business like woman of thirty six or thereabouts and told to wait in the room behind the bar till she could find time to talk to him she kept him waiting there for three quarters of an hour just sufficient time to take the side out of him and then she walks in and closes the door behind her 'i'd say you hadn't changed hardly a day susan' says he 'if it wasn't that you'd grown handsomer than ever' i guess he'd been turning that over in his mind during the three quarters of an hour it was his fancy that he knew a bit about women 'my name's mrs wrench' says she 'and if you take your hat off and stand up while i'm talking to you it will be more what i'm accustomed to' well that staggered him a bit but there didn't seem anything else to be done so he just made as if he thought it funny though i doubt if at the time he saw the full humour of it 'and now what do you want says she seating herself in front of her desk and leaving him standing first on one leg and then on the other twiddling his hat in his hands 'i've been a bad husband to you susan' begins he 'i could have told you that' she answers 'what i asked you was what you wanted' 'i want for us to let bygones be bygones' says he 'that's quite my own idea' says she 'and if you don't allude to the past i shan't' 'you're an angel susan' says he 'i've told you once' answers she 'that my name's mrs wrench i'm susan to my friends not to every broken down tramp looking for a job' 'ain't i your husband' says he trying a bit of dignity she got up and took a glance through the glass door to see that nobody was there to overhear her 'for the first and last time' says she 'let you and me understand one another i've been eleven years without a husband and i've got used to it i don't feel now as i want one of any kind and if i did it wouldn't be your sort eleven years ago i wasn't good enough for you and now you're not good enough for me' 'i want to reform' says he 'i want to see you do it' says she 'give me a chance' says he 'i'm going to' says she 'but it's going to be my experiment this time not yours eleven years ago i didn't give you satisfaction so you turned me out of doors' 'you went susan' says he 'you know it was your own idea' 'don't you remind me too much of the circumstances' replies she turning on him with a look in her eyes that was probably new to him 'i went because there wasn't room for two of us you know that the other kind suited you better now i'm going to see whether you suit me' and she sits herself again in her landlady's chair 'in what way' says he 'in the way of earning your living' says she 'and starting on the road to becoming a decent member of society' he stood for a while cogitating 'don't you think' says he at last 'as i could manage this hotel for you' 'thanks' says she 'i'm doing that myself' 'what about looking to the financial side of things' says he 'and keeping the accounts it's hardly your work' 'nor yours either' answers she drily 'judging by the way you've been keeping your own' 'you wouldn't like me to be head waiter i suppose' says he 'it would be a bit of a come down' 'you're thinking of the hotel i suppose' says she 'perhaps you are right my customers are mostly an old fashioned class it's probable enough they might not like you you had better suggest something else' 'i could hardly be an under waiter' says he 'perhaps not' says she 'your manners strike me as a bit too familiar for that' then he thought he'd try sarcasm 'perhaps you'd fancy my being the boots' says he 'that's more reasonable' says she 'you couldn't do much harm there and i could keep an eye on you' 'you really mean that' says he starting to put on his dignity but she cut him short by ringing the bell 'if you think you can do better for yourself' she says 'there's an end of it by a curious coincidence the place is just now vacant i'll keep it open for you till to morrow night you can turn it over in your mind' and one of the page boys coming in she just says 'good morning' and the interview was at an end well he turned it over and he took the job he thought she'd relent after the first week or two but she didn't he just kept that place for over fifteen months and learnt the business in the house he was james the boots and she mrs wrench the landlady and she saw to it that he didn't forget it he had his wages and he made his tips and the food was plentiful but i take it he worked harder during that time than he'd ever worked before in his life and found that a landlady is just twice as difficult to please as the strictest landlord it can be a man's misfortune to get under and that mrs wrench was no exception to the rule at the end of the fifteen months she sends for him into the office he didn't want telling by this time he just stood with his hat in his hand and waited respectful like 'james' says she after she had finished what she was doing 'i find i shall want another waiter for the coffee room this season would you care to try the place' 'thank you mrs wrench' he answers 'it's more what i've been used to and i think i'll be able to give satisfaction' 'there's no wages attached as i suppose you know' continues she 'but the second floor goes with it and if you know your business you ought to make from twenty five to thirty shillings a week' thank you mrs wrench that'll suit me very well' replies he and it was settled he did better as a waiter he'd got it in his blood as you might say and so after a time he worked up to be head waiter now and then of course it came about that he found himself waiting on the very folks that he'd been chums with in his classy days and that must have been a bit rough on him but he'd taken in a good deal of sense since then and when one of the old sort all rings and shirt front dining there one sunday evening started chaffing him jimmy just shut him up with a quiet 'yes i guess we were both a bit out of our place in those days the difference between us now is that i have got back to mine' which cost him his tip but must nave been a satisfaction to him altogether he worked in that hotel for some three and a half years and then mrs wrench sends for him again into the office 'sit down james' says she 'thank you mrs wrench' says james and sat 'i'm thinking of giving up this hotel james' says she 'and taking another near dover a quiet place with just such a clientele as i shall like do you care to come with me' 'thank you' says he 'but i'm thinking mrs wrench of making a change myself' 'oh' says she 'i'm sorry to hear that james i thought we'd been getting on very well together' 'i've tried to do my best mrs wrench' says he 'and i hope as i've given satisfaction' 'i've nothing to complain of james' says she 'i thank you for saying it' says he 'and i thank you for the opportunity you gave me when i wanted it it's been the making of me' she didn't answer for about a minute then says she 'you've been meeting some of your old friends james i'm afraid and they've been persuading you to go back into the city' 'no mrs wrench' says he 'no more city for me and no more neighbourhood of grosvenor square unless it be in the way of business and that couldn't be of course for a good long while to come' 'what do you mean by business' asks she 'the hotel business' replies he 'i believe i know the bearings by now i've saved a bit thanks to you mrs wrench and a bit's come in from the wreck that i never hoped for' 'enough to start you' asks she 'not quite enough for that' answers he 'my idea is a small partnership' 'how much is it altogether' says she 'if it's not an impertinent question' 'not at all' answers he 'it tots up to pounds about' she turns back to her desk and goes on with her writing 'dover wouldn't suit you i suppose' says she without looking round 'dover's all right' says he 'if the business is a good one' 'it can be worked up into one of the best things going' says she 'and i'm getting it dirt cheap you can have a third share for a thousand pounds that's just what it's costing and owe me the other hundred 'and what position do i take' says he 'if you come in on those terms' says she 'then of course it's a partnership' he rose and came over to her 'life isn't all business susan' says he 'i've found it so mostly' says she 'fourteen years ago' says he 'i made the mistake now you're making it' 'what mistake am i making' says she 'that man's the only thing as can't learn a lesson' says he 'oh' says she 'and what's the lesson that you've learnt' 'that i never get on without you susan' says he 'well' says she 'you suggested a partnership and i agreed to it what more do you want' 'i want to know the name of the firm' says he 'mr and mrs wrench' says she turning round to him and holding out her hand 'how will that suit you' 'that'll do me all right' answers he 'and i'll try and give satisfaction' adds he 'i believe you' says she and in that way they made a fresh start as it were the wooing of tom sleight's wife it's competition replied henry that makes the world go round you never want a thing particularly until you see another fellow trying to get it then it strikes you all of a sudden that you've a better right to it than he has take barmaids what's the attraction about 'em in looks they're no better than the average girl in the street while as for their temper well that's a bit above the average leastways so far as my experience goes yet the thinnest of 'em has her dozen making sheep's eyes at her across the counter i've known girls that on the level couldn't have got a policeman to look at 'em put 'em behind a row of tumblers and a shilling's worth of stale pastry and nothing outside a lincoln and bennett is good enough for 'em it's the competition that's the making of 'em now i'll tell you a story continued henry that bears upon the subject it's a pretty story if you look at it from one point of view though my wife maintains and she's a bit of a judge mind you that it's not yet finished she arguing that there's a difference between marrying and being married you can have a fancy for the one without caring much about the other what i tell her is that a boy isn't a man and a man isn't a boy besides it's five years ago now and nothing has happened since though of course one can never say i would like to hear the story i ventured to suggest i'll be able to judge better afterwards it's not a long one replied henry though as a matter of fact it began seventeen years ago in portsmouth new hampshire he was a wild young fellow and always had been who was i interrupted tom sleight answered henry the chap i'm telling you about he belonged to a good family his father being a magistrate for monmouthshire but there had been no doing anything with young tom from the very first at fifteen he ran away from school at clifton and with everything belonging to him tied up in a pocket handkerchief made his way to bristol docks there he shipped as boy on board an american schooner the cap'n not pressing for any particulars being short handed and the boy himself not volunteering much whether his folks made much of an effort to get him back or whether they didn't i can't tell you maybe they thought a little roughing it would knock some sense into him anyhow the fact remains that for the next seven or eight years until the sudden death of his father made him a country gentleman a more or less jolly sailor man he continued to be and it was during that period to be exact three years after he ran away and four years before he returned that as i have said at portsmouth new hampshire he married after ten days' courtship mary godselle only daughter of jean godselle saloon keeper of that town that makes him just eighteen i remarked somewhat young for a bridegroom but a good deal older than the bride was henry's comment she being at the time a few months over fourteen was it legal i enquired quite legal answered henry in new hampshire it would seem they encourage early marriages 'can't begin a good thing too soon' is i suppose their motto how did the marriage turn out was my next question the married life of a lady and gentleman the united ages of whom amounted to thirty two promised interesting developments practically speaking replied henry it wasn't a marriage at all it had been a secret affair from the beginning as perhaps you can imagine the old man had other ideas for his daughter and wasn't the sort of father to be played with they separated at the church door intending to meet again in the evening two hours later master tom sleight got knocked on the head in a street brawl if a row was to be had anywhere within walking distance he was the sort of fellow to be in it when he came to his senses he found himself lying in his bunk and the 'susan pride' if that was the name of the ship i think it was ten miles out to sea the captain declined to put the vessel about to please either a loving seaman or a loving seaman's wife and to come to the point the next time mr tom sleight saw mrs tom sleight was seven years later at the american bar of the grand central in paris and then he didn't know her but what had she been doing all the time i queried do you mean to tell me that she a married woman had been content to let her husband disappear without making any attempt to trace him i was making it short retorted henry in an injured tone for your benefit if you want to have the whole of it of course you can he wasn't a scamp he was just a scatterbrain that was the worst you could say against him he tried to communicate with her but never got an answer then he wrote to the father and told him frankly the whole story the letter came back six months later marked 'gone away left no address' you see what had happened was this the old man died suddenly a month or two after the marriage without ever having heard a word about it the girl hadn't a relative or friend in the town all her folks being french canadians she'd got her pride and she'd got a sense of humour not common in a woman i was with her at the grand central for over a year and came to know her pretty well she didn't choose to advertise the fact that her husband had run away from her as she thought an hour after he had married her she knew he was a gentleman with rich relatives somewhere in england and as the months went by without bringing word or sign of him she concluded he'd thought the matter over and was ashamed of her you must remember she was merely a child at the time and hardly understood her position maybe later on she would have seen the necessity of doing something but chance as it were saved her the trouble for she had not been serving in the cafe more than a month when early one afternoon in walked her lord and master 'mam'sell marie' as of course we called her over there was at that moment busy talking to two customers while smiling at a third and our hero he gave a start the moment he set eyes on her you told me that when he saw her there he didn't know her i reminded henry quite right sir replied henry so i did but he knew a pretty girl when he saw one anywhere at any time he was that sort and a prettier saucier looking young personage than marie in spite of her misfortunes as i suppose you'd call 'em you wouldn't have found had you searched paris from the place de la bastille to the arc de triomphe did she i asked know him or was the forgetfulness mutual she recognised him returned henry before he entered the cafe owing to catching sight of his face through the glass door while he was trying to find the handle women on some points have better memories than men added to which when you come to think of it the game was a bit one sided except that his moustache maybe was a little more imposing and that he wore the clothes of a gentleman in place of those of an able bodied seaman before the mast he was to all intents and purposes the same as when they parted six years ago outside the church door while she had changed from a child in a short muslin frock and a 'flapper' as i believe they call it tied up in blue ribbon to a self possessed young woman in a frock that might have come out of a bond street show window and a japanese coiffure that being then the fashion she finished with her french customers not hurrying herself in the least that wasn't her way and then strolling over to her husband asked him in french what she could have the pleasure of doing for him his education on board the 'susan pride' and others had i take it gone back rather than forward he couldn't understand her so she translated it for him into broken english with an accent he asked her how she knew he was english she told him it was because englishmen had such pretty moustaches and came back with his order which was rum punch she kept him waiting about a quarter of an hour before she returned with it he filled up the time looking into the glass behind him when he thought nobody was observing him one american drink as they used to concoct it in that bar was generally enough for most of our customers but he before he left contrived to put away three also contriving during the same short space of time to inform 'mam'sel marie' that paris since he had looked into her eyes had become the only town worth living in so far as he was concerned throughout the whole universe he had his failings had master tom sleight but shyness wasn't one of them she gave him a smile when he left that would have brought a less impressionable young man than he back again to that cafe but for the rest of the day i noticed 'mam'sel marie' frowned to herself a good deal and was quite unusually cynical in her view of things in general next afternoon he found his way to us again and much the same sort of thing went on only a little more of it a sailor man so i am told makes love with his hour of departure always before his mind and so gets into the habit of not wasting time he gave her short lessons in english for which she appeared to be grateful and she at his request taught him the french for 'you are just charming i love you' with which so he explained it was his intention on his return to england to surprise his mother he turned up again after dinner and the next day before lunch when after that i looked up and missed him at his usual table the feeling would come to me that business was going down marie always appeared delighted to see him and pouted when he left but what puzzled me at the time was that though she fooled him to the top of his bent she flirted every bit as much if not more with her other customers leastways with the nicer ones among them there was one young frenchman in particular a good looking chap a monsieur flammard son of the painter up till then he'd been making love pretty steadily to miss marie as indeed had most of 'em without ever getting much forrarder for hitherto a chat about the weather and a smile that might have meant she was in love with you or might have meant she was laughing at you no man could ever tell which was all the most persistent had got out of her now however and evidently to his own surprise young monsieur flammard found himself in clover provided his english rival happened to be present and not too far removed he could have as much flirtation as he wanted which you may take it worked out at a very tolerable amount master tom could sit and scowl and for the matter of that did but as marie would explain to him always with the sweetest of smiles her business was to be nice to all her customers and to this of course he had nothing to reply that he couldn't understand a word of what she and flammard talked and laughed about didn't seem to make him any the happier well this sort of thing went on for perhaps a fortnight and then one morning over our dejeune when she and i had the cafe entirely to ourselves i took the opportunity of talking to mam'sel marie like a father she heard me out without a murmur which showed her sense for liking the girl sincerely i didn't mince matters with her but spoke plainly for her good the result was she told me her story much as i have told it to you 'it's a funny tale' says i when she'd finished 'though maybe you yourself don't see the humour of it' 'yes i do' was her answer 'but there's a serious side to it also' says she 'and that interests me more' 'you're sure you're not making a mistake' i suggested 'he's been in my thoughts too much for me to forget him' she replied 'besides he's told me his name and all about himself' 'not quite all' says i 'no and that's why i feel hard toward him' answers she 'now you listen to me' says i 'this is a very pretty comedy and the way you've played it does you credit up till now don't you run it on too long and turn it into a problem play' 'how d'ye mean' says she 'a man's a man' says i 'anyhow he's one he fell in love with you six years ago when you were only a child and now you're a woman he's fallen in love with you again if that don't convince you of his constancy nothing will you stop there don't you try to find out any more' 'i mean to find out one thing answers she 'whether he's a man or a cad' 'that's a severe remark' says i 'to make about your own husband' 'what am i to think' says she 'he fooled me into loving him when as you say i was only a child do you think i haven't suffered all these years it's the girl that cries her eyes out for her lover we learn to take 'em for what they're worth later on' 'but he's in love with you still' i says i knew what was in her mind but i wanted to lead her away from it if i could 'that's a lie' says she 'and you know it' she wasn't choosing her words she was feeling if you understand 'he's in love with a pretty waitress that he met for the first time a fortnight ago' 'that's because she reminds him of you' i replied 'or because you remind him of her whichever you prefer it shows you're the sort of woman he'll always be falling in love with' she laughed at that but the next moment she was serious again 'a man's got to fall out of love before he falls into it again' she replied 'i want a man that'll stop there besides' she goes on 'a woman isn't always young and pretty we've got to remember that we want something else in a husband besides eyes' 'you seem to know a lot about it' says i 'i've thought a lot about it' says she 'what sort of husband do you want' says i 'i want a man of honour' says she that was sense one don't often find a girl her age talking it but her life had made her older than she looked all i could find to say was that he appeared to be an honest chap and maybe was one 'maybe' says she 'that's what i mean to find out and if you'll do me a kindness' she adds 'you won't mind calling me marie luthier for the future instead of godselle it was my mother's name and i've a fancy for it' well there i left her to work out the thing for herself having come to the conclusion she was capable of doing it and so for another couple of weeks i merely watched there was no doubt about his being in love with her he had entered that cafe at the beginning of the month with as good an opinion of himself as a man can conveniently carry without tumbling down and falling over it before the month was out he would sit with his head between his hands evidently wondering why he had been born i've seen the game played before and i've seen it played since a waiter has plenty of opportunities if he only makes use of them for if it comes to a matter of figures i suppose there's more love making done in a month under the electric light of the restaurant than the moon sees in a year leastways so far as concerns what we call the civilised world i've seen men fooled from boys without hair on their faces to old men without much on their heads i've seen it done in a way that was pretty to watch and i've seen it done in a manner that has made me feel that given a wig and a petticoat i could do it better myself but never have i seen it neater played than marie played it on that young man of hers one day she would greet him for all the world like a tired child that at last has found its mother and the next day respond to him in a style calculated to give you the idea of a small sized empress in misfortune compelled to tolerate the familiarities of an anarchist one moment she would throw him a pout that said as clearly as words 'what a fool you are not to put your arms round me and kiss me' and five minutes later chill him with a laugh that as good as told him he must be blind not to see that she was merely playing with him what happened outside the cafe for now and then she would let him meet her of a morning in the tuileries and walk down to the cafe with her and once or twice had allowed him to see her part of the way home i cannot tell you i only know that before strangers it was her instinct to be reserved i take it that on such occasions his experiences were interesting but whether they left him elated or depressed i doubt if he could have told you himself but all the time marie herself was just going from bad to worse she had come to the cafe a light hearted sweet tempered girl now when she wasn't engaged in her play acting for that's all it was i could see plainly enough she would go about her work silent and miserable looking or if she spoke at all it would be to say something bitter then one morning after a holiday she had asked for and which i had given her without any questions she came to business more like her old self than i had seen her since the afternoon master tom sleight had appeared upon the scene all that day she went about smiling to herself and young flammard presuming a bit too far maybe upon past favours found himself sharply snubbed it was a bit rough on him the whole thing 'it's come to a head' says i to myself 'he has explained everything and has managed to satisfy her he's a cleverer chap than i took him for' he didn't turn up at the cafe that day however at all and she never said a word until closing time when she asked me to walk part of the way home with her 'well' i says so soon as we had reached a quieter street 'is the comedy over' 'no' says she 'so far as i'm concerned it's commenced to tell you the truth it's been a bit too serious up to now to please me i'm only just beginning to enjoy myself' and she laughed quite her old light hearted laugh 'you seem to be a bit more cheerful' i says 'i'm feeling it' says she 'he's not as bad as i thought we went to versailles yesterday' 'pretty place versailles' says i 'paths a bit complicated if you don't know your way among 'em' 'they do wind' says she 'and there he told you that he loved you and explained everything' 'you're quite right' says she 'that's just what happened and then he kissed me for the first and last time and now he's on his way to america' 'on his way to america' says i stopping still in the middle of the street 'to find his wife' she says 'he's pretty well ashamed of himself for not having tried to do it before i gave him one or two hints how to set about it he's not over smart and i've got an idea he will discover her' she dropped her joking manner and gave my arm a little squeeze she'd have flirted with her own grandfather that's my opinion of her 'he was really nice' she continues 'i had to keep lecturing myself or i'd have been sorry for him he told me it was his love for me that had shown him what a wretch he had been he said he knew i didn't care for him two straws and there i didn't contradict him and that he respected me all the more for it i can't explain to you how he worked it out but what he meant was that i was so good myself that no one but a thoroughly good fellow could possibly have any chance with me and that any other sort of fellow ought to be ashamed of himself for daring even to be in love with me and that he couldn't rest until he had proved to himself that he was worthy to have loved me and then he wasn't going to love me any more' 'it's a bit complicated' says i 'i suppose you understood it' 'it was perfectly plain' says she somewhat shortly 'and as i told him made me really like him for the first time' 'it didn't occur to him to ask you why you had been flirting like a volcano with a chap you didn't like' says i 'he didn't refer to it as flirtation' says she 'he regarded it as kindness to a lonely man in a strange land' 'i think you'll be all right' says i 'there's all the makings of a good husband in him seems to be simple minded enough anyhow' 'he has a very lovable personality when you once know him' says she 'all sailors are apt to be thoughtless' 'i should try and break him of it later on' says i 'besides she was a bit of a fool herself going away and leaving no address' adds she and having reached her turning we said good night to one another about a month passed after that without anything happening for the first week marie was as merry as a kitten but as the days went by and no sign came she grew restless and excited then one morning she came into the cafe twice as important as she had gone out the night before and i could see by her face that her little venture was panning out successfully she waited till we had the cafe to ourselves which usually happened about mid day and then she took a letter out of her pocket and showed it me it was a nice respectful letter containing sentiments that would have done honour to a churchwarden thanks to marie's suggestions for which he could never be sufficiently grateful and which proved her to be as wise as she was good and beautiful he had traced mrs sleight nee mary godselle to quebec from quebec on the death of her uncle she had left to take a situation as waitress in a new york hotel and he was now on his way there to continue his search the result he would with miss marie's permission write and inform her if he obtained happiness he would owe it all to her she it was who had shown him his duty there was a good deal of it but that's what it meant a week later came another letter dated from new york this time mary could not be discovered anywhere her situation she had left just two years ago but for what or for where nobody seemed to know what was to be done mam'sel marie sat down and wrote him by return of post and wrote him somewhat sharply in broken english it seemed to her he must be strangely lacking in intelligence mary as he knew spoke french as well as she did english such girls especially such waitresses he might know were sought after on the continent very possibly there were agencies in new york whose business it was to offer good continental engagements to such young ladies even she herself had heard of one such brathwaite in west twenty third street or maybe twenty fourth she signed her new name marie luthier and added a ps to the effect that a right feeling husband who couldn't find his wife would have written in a tone less suggestive of resignation that helped him considerably that suggestion of marie's about the agent brathwaite a fortnight later came a third letter wonderful to relate his wife was actually in paris of all places in the world she had taken a situation in the hotel du louvre master tom expected to be in paris almost as soon as his letter 'i think i'll go round to the louvre if you can spare me for quarter of an hour' said marie 'and see the manager' two days after at one o'clock precisely mr tom sleight walked into the cafe he didn't look cheerful and he didn't look sad he had been to the 'louvre' mary godselle had left there about a year ago but he had obtained her address in paris and had received a letter from her that very morning he showed it to marie it was short and not well written she would meet him in the tuileries that evening at seven by the diana and the nymph he would know her by her wearing the onyx brooch he had given her the day before their wedding she mentioned it was onyx in case he had forgotten he only stopped a few minutes and both he and marie spoke gravely and in low tones he left a small case in her hands at parting he said he hoped she would wear it in remembrance of one in whose thoughts she would always remain enshrined i can't tell you what he meant i only tell you what he said he also gave me a very handsome walking stick with a gold handle what for i don't know i take it he felt like that marie asked to leave that evening at half past six i never saw her looking prettier she called me into the office before she went she wanted my advice she had in one hand a beautiful opal brooch set in diamonds it was what he had given her that morning and in her other hand the one of onyx 'shall i wear them both' asked she 'or only the one' she was half laughing half crying already i thought for a bit 'i should wear the onyx to night' i said 'by itself'
