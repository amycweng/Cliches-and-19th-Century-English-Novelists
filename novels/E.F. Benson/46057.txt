full to suffocation of people mixed odours of dinner the blare of the band just outside and a babel of voices in the hall theatregoers were having their coffee and cigarettes after dinner while others were still waiting their patience fortified by bitters for their parties to assemble the day had been very hot and as is the manner of days in london when june is coming to an end the hours for most people here assembled had been pretty fully occupied but with a courage worthy of the cause they seemed to behave as if nothing of a fatiguing nature had occurred since breakfast the band played loud because it would otherwise have been inaudible above the din of conversation and people talked loud because otherwise nobody could have heard what anybody else said tonight everybody had a good deal to say for a case of the kind that always attracts a good deal of attention had just been given that lengthy and headlined publicity which is always considered in england to be inseparable from the true and indifferent administration of justice and the vultures of london life found the banquet extremely to their taste so they ate their dinner with a sense of special gaiety pecked ravenously at the aforesaid affair and all talked loudly together but nobody talked so loud as mrs lewis s palmer it was said of her indeed that staying for a weekend not long ago with some friend in the country rain had been expected because one day after lunch a peacock was heard screaming so loud but investigation showed that it was only mrs palmer at a considerable distance away on the terrace laughing like the peacock it is true she had been making la pluie et le beau temps in london this year so the mistake was accountable at present she was entertaining two young men at an anteopera dinner a casual observer might have had the impression that she was clothed lightly but exclusively in diamonds she talked not fast but without pause she was in fact what may be called a longdistance talker in an hour she would get through much more than most people yes london is just too lovely she was saying and how i shall tear myself away on monday is more than i can imagine i shall cry my eyes out all the way to liverpool mr brancepeth you naughty man you were thinking to yourself that you would pick them up and carry them home with you to remind you of me i should advise you not to say so or i shall get lord keynes to call you out i always tell everyone that he takes as much care of me as if he were my father yes lord keynes you are what i call faithful i say to everyone lord keynes is the most faithful friend i ever had dont you think you are faithful now well as i was saying when mr brancepeth interrupted me with his wicked inquiries i shall cry my eyes out indeed if it wasnt that lord keynes had faithfully promised to come over in the fall i think i should get a divorce from lewis s and remain here right along on what grounds asked bertie keynes why on the grounds of his incompatibility of residence just now i feel as if the sight of fifth avenue would make me feel so homesick for london that i guess i should rupture something when i am homesick i feel just like that and lewis s he notices it at once and sends to tiffanys for the most expensive diamond theyve got that helps some because a new diamond is one of the solemnest things i know it just sits there and winks at me and i just sit there and wink at it we know a thing or two a big diamond and i but i conjecture it will have to be a big one to make me feel better this time for just now london seems to me the only compatible residence i guess ill make lewis buy it mrs palmers tact had been one of the standing dishes of the season and it appeared that there was plenty of it still in stock it was distributed by her with strict impartiality to anyone present and had a firm flavour bertie keynes laughed and drew from his pocket a small printed card i dont know if you have seen this he said admit bearer to see the world signed lewis s palmer and he handed it to her mrs palmer opened her mouth very wide and screamed so loud that for a radius of three tables round all conversation ceased for a moment the scream began on about the note selected by express trains when they dash at full speed through a station rose an octave or two with an upward swoop like a steam siren came slowly down in a chromatic scale broken off for a moment as she made a hissing intake of her breath and repeated itself this year it had been one of the recognised cries of london why if that isnt the cutest thing in the world she screamed i never saw anything so cunning why i never admit bearer to see the world how can i get one for lewis it would just tickle him to death pray take this said bertie i brought it on purpose for you well if that isnt too nice of you i shall just hand that to lewis without a word the moment i set eyes on him i guess thatll make him want to buy the world in earnest why hell go crazy about buying it now that it has been suggested well im sure lord keynes its just too nice of you to give me that i shall laugh myself sick over it i always tell everyone that you are the kindest man i ever saw gracious its half after nine we must go at once ill be down with you in a moment but i must give this to my maid to be packed in my jewelcase mrs palmer looked at it again as she rose gave another shrill scream and vanished leaving her two guests alone charlie brancepeth moved his chair a little sideways to the table as he sat down again crossed his legs and took a cigarette from his case if you had asked her a hundred pounds for it she would have given it you bertie he remarked bertie keynes raised his eyebrows a shade a hundred pounds is always welcome charlie he said without a shadow or hint of comment in his voice in fact the neutrality of his tone was too marked to be in the least degree natural charlie did not reply for a moment but blew thoughtfully on the lighted end of his cigarette why this suddenthis sudden suppression of the mercantile spirit he asked bertie laughed dont trouble to be more offensive than is necessary to your reasonable comfort he remarked with some finish i am not i should have been in considerable pain if i hadnt said that but why this suppression bertie delayed answering long enough to upset the salt with his elbow and look reproachfully at the waiter for having done so there isnt any suppression he said at length the mercantile spirit is going strong stronger than ever damn is it the salt you asked a blessing on said charlie no the nonsuppression then you really are going to america in the autumn asked he i beg its pardon the fall yes fall is just as good a word as autumn by the way oh quite over there they think it better and they have quite as good a right to judge as we if they called it the pumphandle it wouldnt make any difference not the slightest yes i am going charlie smiled oh i suddenly understand about the mercantile spirit he said it was stupid of me not to have guessed at once it was rather charlie i should like to talk to you about it the governor has been making some uncommonly sensible remarks to me on the subject he would your father has an immense quantity of dry commonsense yes come round after the opera and well talk it out lengthways heres mrs palmer i hope pagani will sing extremely loud tonight otherwise we shant hear a note two electric broughams were waiting at the pall mall entrance as mrs palmer rustled out between rows of liveried men whose sole office appeared to be to look reverential as she passed as if to have just seen her was the mecca of their aspirations then after a momentary hesitation between the two young men bertie followed her dazzling operacloak into the first brougham and amid loud and voluble regrets on her part that there was not room for three and the exaction of a solemn promise that charlie would not quarrel with his friend for having monopolized her they started charlie gave a little sigh whether of disappointment or not is debatable and followed them alone in the second brougham the motor went swiftly and noiselessly up haymarket and into the roaring whirlpool of the circus it was a fine warm evening and over pavement and roadway the season of the streets which lasts not for a few months only after the manner of the enfeebled upper class but all the year round was in full swing hansom cabs newsboys shouting the latest details of all the dirty linen which had been washed that week omnibuses nodding ten feet high above the road and lifeguardsmen nodding six women plain and coloured men in dressclothes hurrying late to the theatres shabby skulkers in shadow obscure persons of prey glittering glass signs about the musichalls flowersellers round the fountain swingingdoors of restaurants swallowing in and vomiting out all sorts and conditions of men winking skysigns policemen controlling the trafficall contributed their essential but infinitesimal quota to the huge hodgepodge of life bent as the great majority of life always is on the seizure of the present vivid moment the only thing which is certainly existent for the past is already to everyone but of the texture of a dream the future is a dream also but lying in impenetrable shadow but the moment is real to charlie it appeared tonight that the festival of the pavements was certainly gayer than the festival of the carlton his own world schemed more it might be and substituted innuendo for a bolder and more direct manner of talk but it really had less capacity for enjoyment ten weeks of london broke its wind somewhat and it retired into the country to graze to digest to recoup but here on the pavements a lustier spirit reigned the spirit of the people pressing upwards and upwards like buried bulbs striving towards the light through the good moist earth whereas to continue the metaphor that was in his mind the folk among whom he moved whose doings he continually observed with an absorbed but kindly cynicism were like plants tended in a greenhouse and potted out when the weather became assured and what if the whole of england was becoming every year more like a tended greenhouse plant compared to the blind thrust of forces from the earth in other countries for all the old landmarks as the great wheel of human life whirled down the road of the centuries seemed to be passing out of sight the world was racing westwards where america sat high on the seas grown like some portentous mushroom in a single night there at the present moment the inexorable relentless logic of nature was working out its everlasting proposition that the one force in the material world was wealth england had had her turn even as rome had had her turn and even as the hordes of barbarians had swept over the countries that had been hers till they reached and took the capital itself even sowell had he not himself dined with mrs palmer that evening it was not in his nature to hate anything so it cannot be said that he hated her screaming her insensate conversation her lack of all that is summed up in the words breeding and culture but he saw these loud defects and knew of their existence on the other hand he saw and knew also of her intense goodnature her true kindliness of heart and believed in the integrity of her life so if it was fair to consider her presence in london typically as of the nature of a barbarian invasion it must be confessed that england had fallen into the hands of very kindly foes they did not even actively resent culture they were simply not aware of it and cut it when they met in any case they were irresistible for the power that moved them was wealth more gigantic than any which heretofore had furthered the arts of war and peace and that wealth was grasped by men who only yesterday had toiled with their hands in factories and workshops like stars reeling upwards from below the horizon they swarmed into the sky and looked down not cruelly but merely calmly into the world which they owned of such was mrs palmers husband he had been a railway porter now he was railways and steamships and anything else of which he chose to say this is mine occasionally men like these watered the english greenhouse plants and an heiress propped up the unstable fortunes of some fivehundredyearsold english name but such gift of refreshment was but a spoonful out of the great wells also in a manner of speaking having thus watered the plants they picked them his motor got caught in a block at the entrance to leicester square and he arrived at the opera house some few minutes after the others had got there a commanding white label with mrs lewis s palmers name printed on it was on the door of the omnibus box on the grand tier and he found her with her resplendent back firmly turned towards the stage discoursing in shrill whispers to bertie keynes and sighing more than audibly for the end of the act it was the last representation for the year of tristan und isolde and the house was crowded royalty was there a galaxy of tiaras sparkled in the boxes and a galaxy of stars sang together on the stage for london had suddenly conceived the almost incredible delusion that it was musical and flocked to the opera with all the fervour of a newlyborn passion it was not it never had been and it never would be musical but this particular form of the game lets pretend was in fashion and the syndicate rejoiced soon london would get tired of the game and the syndicate would be sad again but the longest act comes to an end at last and even as the curtain fell mrs palmer began screaming again she screamed when she was amused because she was amused and she screamed when she was bored in order that it might appear that she was not just now she was amusing herself very tolerably for as soon as the lights were up the world in general flocked into her box supplementing the very desirable company already assembled there why of course i am coming back next year she was explaining and if lewis doesnt come with me and take seaton house for me so as to be able to have more than one person to dinner at a time i guess ill have a word or two to say to him which he wont forget and if you mrs massington dont come over to us in the fall with lord keynes i shall cry my eyes out and if that monster mr brancepeth is as impudent again as he was at dinner saying that he would pick them up and take them home to remind him of me ill ask him to leave my box and call him back the moment afterwards because i cant help forgiving him there was a laugh at this brilliant effort of imagination and mrs massington leaned back in her chair towards charlie while mrs palmer continued her voluble remarks you are getting quite polished charlie she said i should not have suspected you of so much gallantry i hope you never suspect me of anything he said oh i doof lots of things chiefly of a disapproving attitude you are always disapproving now you probably disapprove of my going to america you have not gone yet he said no but i shall mrs palmer has asked me to stay with them and i am going and bertie is really going too so he told me tonight who suggested it his father yes as usual he has shown his immensely good sense mrs massington laughed you are extremely oldfashioned she said i wonder at your dining with mrs palmer at all and coming to her box i often wonder at it myself said he never mind that i havent seen you for an age what have you been doing with yourself i havent been doing anything with myself it is other people who have been doing all sorts of things with me i have been taken by the scruff of the neck and draggedliterally draggedfrom place to place all this week theres been the serington case you see i was in the court for three mornings getting up at unheardof hours to be there really it was very amusing topsie in the witnessbox was the funniest thing you can possibly imagine he jumped every time anybody asked him a question they seem to have had the most extraordinary manage and the servants appear to have spent their entire time in looking through keyholes i wonder how the housework got done at all charlie you dont appear in the least amused he looked at her a moment gravely am i really so awfully oldfashioned he asked yes you old darling i think you are are you shocked at my calling you an old darling its quite true you know delighted to hear it but am i oldfashioned then certainly antique out of date obsolete of course that sort of thing all the serington affair is extremely shocking and they are done for quite done for nobody will ever speak to them againat least except abroad but because it is shocking i dont see why i should pretend not to be amused at the really ridiculous figure topsie cut in the witnessbox it would argue a very imperfect sense of humour if i was not amused and great hypocrisy if i pretended not to be i was amused i roared i was afraid they would turn me out he laughed somehow whatever you do i cant disapprove he said though the notion of all topsies friends sitting there and looking at him and talking it over afterwards makes me feel ill but you dear charlie it is too nice of you but break those rosecoloured spectacles through which you so kindly observe me it is no use i have told you before it was no use and i dont like telling you again why he asked oh that is so like a man and especially an englishman you know why because it hurts you you dislike hurting me that is something said he but that is all she said the orchestra had taken their places and a silence began to spread over the theatre as the lights were lowered then suddenly he leaned towards her so that he could smell the faint warm fragrance of her presence you mean that he asked she nodded her head in reply and the curtain rose chapter ii mrs palmer when the opera was over had many voluble goodbyes to say to her friends for she was leaving london next day and sailing for her native shores in the middle of the week consequently it was some time before the two young men could get off from covent garden but eventually they strolled away together to pick up a hansom rather than wait for one charlie brancepeths rooms were in half moon street and it was thus nearer one than twelve when they got home he threw himself into a long easychair with an air of fatigue while the other strolled about somewhat aimlessly and nervously smoking a cigarette sipping whiskyandsoda with the indolent carriage of a man who is at home with himself and his surroundings in person he was of the fair blueeyed type of his family smallfeatured and thin and looking taller in consequence than he really was his eyebrows darker than his hair had the line of determination and selfreliance but one felt somehow that his appearance had less to do with the essential man beneath than with the ancestors from whom he had inherited it but his aimless undetermined strolling one felt was more truly his own at last he went to the window and threw it open letting in the great bourdon hum of london coming somewhat muffled through the heavy air only the gentlest draught drew into the room from outside barely stirring the flowers in the windowboxes but spreading slowly over the room the warm drowsy scent of them then taking himself by the shoulders as it were he sat down charlie i am going to america he said in order if possible to find an extremely wealthy girl who is willing to marry me so i understood when you said the mercantile spirit was not suppressed well you are frank anyhow will you tell her that will you ask how much she expects to have as a dowry no it will be unnecessary to tell her anything she will know you dont suppose the americans really think that lots of us go there to find wives because we prefer them to english girls they know the true state of the case perfectly well they only dont choose to recognise it just as one doesnt choose to recognise a man one doesnt want to meet they look it in the face and cut itcut it dead i dare say you are perfectly right said charlie with marked neutrality i suppose you disapprove you have a habit of disapproving as i heard sybil massington say to you tonight by the way she is going to america too she told me charlies face remained perfectly expressionless yes he said slowly you might arrange to travel together never mind that now though you told me your father had some very sensible things to say about mercenary marriages do tell me what they were he is always worth listening to bertie keynes hailed this with obvious relief it was easier to him to put up his fathers ideas for his friend if he chose to box with than receive the attack on his own person he did not care in the least how much charlie attacked his fathers opinions on matrimony nor on the other hand would the marquis of bolton care either because the fact of his never caring for anything was so widely known as to have been abbreviated like a sort of hallmark into his nickname of gallio yes the governor talked to me about it yesterday he said to the other he was very convincing i thought he put it like this it is impossible for royalty to marry commoners therefore when royalty goes awooing it goes awooing in its own class it is equally impossible for me to marry a poor woman because i cant afford it everything is mortgaged up to the hilt as you probably know and indeed if i dont marry a rich woman we go smash therefore i must go awooing like royalty among the class into which alone it is possible for me to marry i see the force of that reasoning so i am going to america see gallio might have gone on to say that it appeared that the english aristocracy is the only possible class for extremely rich american girls to marry into remarked charlie yes ill tell him that said the other he would be pleased with that then he went on to say that every country necessarily sends abroad for barter or exchange what it doesnt want or has too great a supply of america has more money than it knows what to do with so it is willing to let some of it come here while we have just found out that titles are no longer of the slightest value to us nobody cares about them now so we send them for distribution abroad too labelled said charlie ducal coronet so much countesss coronet much cheaper baronesss coronet for an annuity merely you will be a marquis wont you marquises come rather high brush up the coronet bertie and put a fancy price on it charlie rose with some impatience as he spoke and squirted some sodawater into a glass doesnt the governors view seem to you very sensible asked the other yes very sensible that is why i find it so damnable sense is overrunning us like some horrid weed nobody thinks of anything except what will pay that is what sense means a sensible wellbalanced viewa sensible bankbalanced view that is what it comes to bertie keynes whistled gently to himself a minute i dont think ill tell gallio that he said i dont think he would like that so much charlie laughed oh yes he would but you neednt tell him since he knows it already well in sodawater i drink success to your wooing dont make yourself cheap bertie lit another cigarette from the stump of the one he had been smoking previously if anybody else had said that i should have been rather annoyed he remarked you are annoyed as it is at least i meant you to be its no use arguing about it because we really differ and you cannot argue unless you fundamentally agree which we do not im in the minority i know almost everybody agrees with you but i am oldfashioned i have been told so this evening by yes by sybil massington she too agrees with you there was silence for a minute or two its two years since her husband died is it not asked bertie yes two years and one month i know what you are thinking about i asked herat least she saw what i meantagain this evening but i have asked her for the last time i suppose it is thatmy feeling for herthat tonight makes me think what a horrible coldblooded proceeding you are going to embark on i cant help it i do feel like that so theres an end of it bertie did not reply and a clock on the chimneypiece chimed two theres one more thing he said at length you advised me to brush up the coronet did you mean anything charlie took out his watch and began winding it up mechanically bertie took his coat on his arm yes i meant exactly what you think i meant its rather awkward said bertie shes going out to america in the autumn to act i am certain to meet her in new york at any rate she is certain to know i am there will that really be awkward asked charlie is sheis she i havent seen her for nearly two years said the other i dont know whether she hates me or the other thing in either case i am rather afraid mrs massington also had spent the hour after she had got home in midnight conference since her husbands death two years ago she had lived with an unmarried sister of her own a woman some ten years older than herself yet still on the intelligent side of forty and if she herself had rightly earned the title of the prettiest widow in london to judy even more unquestionably belonged the reputation of the wisest spinster in the same village she was charmingly ugly and relished the great distinction that real ugliness as opposed to plainness confers on its possessor she was moreover far too wise ever to care about saying clever things and thus there were numbers of people who could never imagine why she was so widely considered a gifted woman to sybil massington she was a sort of reference in all questions that troubled hera referee always to be listened to with respect generally to be agreed with but in all cases to be treated with entire frankness for the very simple reason that judy invariably found you out if you concealed any part of the truth or had been in any degree when consulting her what mrs massington preferred to call diplomatic sybil massington herself though now a twoyearsold widow with weeds which as we have seen others considered quite outworn was still barely twentyfive she was one of those fortunate beings who invariably through life see more smiles than frowns more laughter than tears for the two excellent reasons that she was always even when herself tired or bored past the general freezingpoint of politeness alert to amuse and to be interested in other people the second because she studiously avoided all people and places where frowns and tears were likely to be of the party k she deliberately took the view that life is a very charming business at the best but full in its very woofinseparably from existenceof many sombretinted threads it was therefore futile to darken the web of existence by serious or solemn thoughts on the sadness of life and the responsibilities which she did not really think were binding on her she preferred dancing in the sun to reading tracts in the shade she wished primarily to be happy herself and in a scarcely secondary degree she wished all her friends to be happy too in this way her essential selfishness yet had the great merit of giving much pleasure as it went on its pleasant course and though she had not to state the fact quite baldly the slightest desire that anybody should be good it gave her the greatest pleasure to see that they were happy and she really spent an enormous amount of trouble and force in advancing this object such a nature whatever may be its final reward or punishment certainly reaps a rich harvest here for strenuous and continued efforts to be agreeable especially when made by a young and pretty woman yield their sixtyfold and a hundredfold in immediate returns it must be confessed that she had immense natural advantages for the role she so studiously played she was rather above the ordinary height of women and had that smooth lithe gracefulness which one associates with boyhood rather than womanhood her head small for her height was set on to her neck with that exquisite pose one sees in the greek figurines from tanagra and her face with its long almondshaped eyes straight features and small mouth expressed admirably the pagan attitude towards life that was hers it was a face to be loved for its fresh dewy loveliness a face as of a spring morning to be enjoyed with a sense of unreasoning delight that such beauty exists it gave the beholder the same quality of pleasure that is given by the sight of some young animal simply because it is so graceful so vital so made for and capable of enjoyment and behind her beauty lay a brain of the same order subtle because she was a woman but in other respects even as her face a minister and pastor of the religion of innocent mirth and pleasure in pursuance of this creed however she was capable of subtle and intricate thought and just now in her talk with her sister it was getting abundant exercise ah that is no use dear judy she was saying i do not say to you make me different then tell me what to do but take me as i am and tell me what to do judys shrewd face broadened into a smile and a pleasant soul looked out of her intelligent eyeseyes that were bright and quick like a birds i dont in the least want to make you different she said because i think you are a unique survival sybils eyes expressed surprise survival she said yes dear you came straight out of pagan mythology you were a nymph in the woods by the ilyssus and apollo saw you and ran after you did he catch me asked sybil with an air of dewy innocence dont be risky it doesnt suit you really sybil considering whatwhat great natural advantages you have you should study yourself more closely just as a fault of manner committed by a woman who wears a beautiful dress is worse than a fault of manner committed by a charwoman so you with your appearance should be doubly careful not to say anything out of character dear judy you are charming but do keep to the point i thought you were the point i am sure i have talked about nothing else i know it is charming of you and you have yawned so frightfully doing it that it is cruel to bring you back to it but i really want your advice now at once judy poured out some hot water from a blanketed jug and sipped it having an admirable digestion she was determined to keep it take care of your health if it is good was a maxim of hers if it is inferior try to think about something better state your case then in a very few words she said looking at the clock it is fast said sybil laughing though not so fast as i should wish well it is this i am twentyfive years old and i dont believe i have the faculty of what is known as falling in love it always seems to me i havent time to begin with i was married as you know at eighteen but i cant imagine i was ever in love with john otherwise that horror couldnt have happened judy looked up forgetting the time and the hot water what horror she asked the light died out of sybils face she looked like a troubled child i have never told anyone she said because i was ashamed but i will tell you to make you understand me he was ill as you know for months before he died every day i used to grow sick at the thought of having to sit by him to talk to him he got more and more emaciated and awful to look at one night i did not kiss him as usual he asked me to and i refused i could notsimply i could not i loathed the thought of the days that were coming i longed for the end and when the end came i was glad i tried to persuade myself that i was glad his sufferings were over it was not so i was glad that mine were over so i think i never loved him though i liked him very much then he got ill and awful and i was very sorry for him but that was all ah she got up and walked up and down the room once or twice as if to waken herself from the clutch of some horrid dream then she stopped behind judys chair and leaned over her sister stroking her hair yes that was the horror judy she said and i am that horror now tonight again charlie would have asked me to marry him if i had not smiling put the question by i like him very much i think i should like to have him always in the house i like everything about him dont marry him said judy quickly judy when you speak like that you are saying to yourself if only she was different well i am not i am as i am i couldnt make my eyes blue by wanting or make myself an inch taller well it must surely be far more difficult to change ones nature in so radical a way i think you did not run very fast when apollo began judy that does not suit you either dear remarked sybil well then i am not to marry charlie am i to marry anybody that is the point or am i to consider that marriage is not for me how can i tell you sybil asked judy rather perplexed i dare say there are men who regard marriage like you you can calmly contemplate marrying a man whom you just like i dont see why if you can find a man like you you shouldnt be far happier together than you would be single i dont see what law human or divine prevents your marrying you promise to love honour and obeywell fifty people mean exactly fifty different things by love because a doesnt attach the same meaning to it as b b has no right to say that a doesnt love and perhaps your liking very much will do but dont marry a man who loves you very much john did yes john did said sybil and paused a moment then i think i shall go to america she said america said judy yes mrs palmer has asked me to go and i think i shall accept do you mean the steamsiren asked judy yes the steamsiren you see i like steam go energy so much that i dont really mind about the siren she has the manners said judy of a barmaid and the mind of aa barmaid i know but i dont mind in factdont howli like her she is extremely goodnatured judy yawned dear sybil she is extremely rich certainly if she lived in a back fourthfloor flat in new york i shouldnt go to stay with her you see i like rich people i like the quality of riches just as you like the quality of generosity by the way you must be rather rich to be generous to any extent so the two are really synonymous im glad i thought of that anyhow i am going to stay with her judy got up you are going to stay with her in order to meet other people who are rich she said why not asked sybil other things being equal i should prefer to marry a rich man than a poor one or shall i cultivate acquaintances in seven dials judy laughed i think they would appreciate you in seven dials said she and i am sure they will in america you can make yourself very pleasant sybil yes dear and you can make yourself most unpleasant and i adore you for it judy dear its after two how you keep one up talking chapter iii mrs massington was lying on an extremely comfortable and elaborately padded wicker couch under a conveniently shady tree the time was after lunch the day an excessively hot sunday in july and the place the lawn of lord boltons present residence on the hills above winchester his big country place at molesworth was let and had been for some years since he could not afford to live in it but in the interval he made himself fairly at home in the houses of other people in equally impecunious circumstances as he truly said one must live somewhere and he very much preferred not to live at molesworth the plan partook of the nature of that of those ingenious islanders who lived entirely by taking in each others washing but though theoretically unsound it seemed to succeed well enough in practice for himself he really preferred haworth the place he had taken for the last four years for molesworth was unmanageably immense remote from london and really lonely except when there was a regiment of guests in the house haworth on the other hand was small exquisite in its way and within an hour or so of london from the lawn the ground sloped sharply down to the watermeadows of the itchen where in the driest summer the grass was green and streams of a translucent excellence wove their ropes of living crystal from bank to bank of their courses a few admirable trees grew on the lawn and all down the south front of the tudor house a deep riband of flowerbed all colour gleamed and glowed in the summer sun sweetpeas were there in huge fragrant groups stately hollyhocks with flowers looking as if they had been cut out of thin paper by a master hand played chaperon from the back carnations were in a swoon of languid fragrance loveliesbleeding drooped its velvety spires and a border of pansies wagged their silly faces as the wind passed over them behind round the windows of the lower story great clusters of clematis like large purple sponges blossomed miraculously fed through their thin dry stalks at some distance off in winmester probably which pricked the blue haze of heat with dim spires a church bell came muffled and languid and at the sound mrs massington smiled that is what i like she said i like hearing a railwaywhistle when i am not going in the train i like hearing a church bell when i am not going to church i like seeing somebody looking very hot when i am quite cool i like hearing somebody sneeze when i havent got a cold i likeoh i like almost everything she concluded broadly i wonder if you i we shall like america said a voice which apparently came from two shins and a knee in a basketchair america said sybil of course you i we will it is absurd to go there unless one means to like it and it is simply weak not to like it if one means to bertie sit up i dont see why said bertie because i want to talk to you and i cant talk to a tennisshoe the tennisshoe descended and the chair creaked well said he you and i are going on business she said that makes one feel so like a commercial traveller the worst of it is neither you nor i have got any wares to offer except ourselves dear me im glad judy cant hear me oh theres ginger ginger come here ginger came probably because he had red hair he wore a panama hat and looked tired he might have been eighteen or thirty and was twentyfour and berties younger brother his lessused name being lord henry scarton he sat down suddenly on the grass took off the panama hat and prepared himself to be agreeable there is a sabbath peace about said he that always makes me feel energetic the feeling of energy passes completely away on monday morning and it and i are strangers till the ensuing sunday then we meet but now it is here i think i shall go to church there is a church isnt there come to church bertie no said bertie that is always the way remarked ginger and it is the same with me i never want to do what anybody else proposes so dont propose to me sybil ginger why dont you do something asked sybil i will go to church said ginger no you wont i want you to tell bertie and me about america you havent been there have you no the capital is new york said ginger and you are sick before you get there when you get there you are sick again then you come back that is why i havent been next question please why is bertie going then she asked becausebecause he is bertie instead of me and why am i going then because you are not judy and you are both going there because you are both progressive english people ginger got up and stood in front of them all people who on earth do dwell said he go to america if they want to dwellreally dwellon earth if you want to have all material things at your command you will if you are going to get them at all get them quicker there than anywhere else but if you attain your ambition you will come back like cast iron everything that was a pleasure to you will be a business you will play bridge with a castiron face and ask for your winnings you will study the nature of your soil before you plant a daisy in it you will always get your moneys worth out of everybody you will be cast iron no i wont said sybil you are quite wrong i will come back in nature as i went you cant if you were strong enough for that you wouldnt go your going is a sign of weakness sybil laughed and stretched herself more at ease on her couch i am not weak she said ginger sat down again i am not sure that to do anything is not a sign of weakness he said it isnt so easy to loaf as you imagine lots of people try to loaf and take to sheer hard work as a rest from it i dont suppose anybody in america loafs and that i expect you will find is the vital and essential difference between them and us it implies a lot go on ginger said sybil as he paused yes i think i will now take mrs palmer she works at pleasure in a way few people in this island work at business it is her lifes work to be gay she doesnt like gaiety really it isnt natural to her but she by the laws of her nature which prevent her loafing works at gaiety just as her husband works at amassing millions they can neither of them stop they dont enjoy it any more than a person with st vituss dance enjoys twitching simply they have lost control of their power to sit still now in england we have lost a good deal we are falling behind i am told in most things but we still have that powerthe power of tranquillity i am inclined to think it is worth something but you will go to america and come back and tell me ginger lay back on the grass and tilted his straw hat over his eyes after this address ginger ive never heard you say so much on end remarked sybil have you been getting it up i never get things up but i scent danger replied ginger i am afraid you and bertie will come back quite different you will always be wanting to do something that is a weakness i dont agree with you said sybil thats all right if people say they agree with me i always think i must have said something stupid what dont you agree with me about about our power of sitting still look at the season in london all the time we are doing exactly what you say americans as opposed to us do we make a business of pleasure we rush about after gaiety when we are not naturally gay we sybil you are talking about three or four thousand people among whom you live i hope you dont think that a few hundred people like that mean england they include almost all wellknown english people well known to whom to themselves no that sleepy little misty town down there is just as important a part of england as the parish of st jamess the parish of st jamess is the office of the company the people there do the talking and see after the affairs of the shareholders and play a very foolish game called politics they are mere clerks and officials well but as regards the pursuit of gaiety said sybil nobody can be more senseless than you or i ginger oh i know we are absurd you are more absurd than i though because you are going to america you seem to resent it not in the least it is ridiculous to resent what anybody else chooses to do so long as it is not a personal attack on ones self that is the first maxim in my philosophy of life published i shall get it no it will be some day it begins with a short history of the world from the days of adam and then the bulk of the book draws lessons from the survey but that is the first lesson let everybody go to the devil in his own way your way is by the white star line i dont think you know what you are talking about ginger said his brother im sure i dont said ginger cheerfully why desecrate the sabbath stillness then ginger was silent a moment that is a personal assault he said at length and i resent it it is unjust too because meaningless conversation is utterly in harmony with sabbath stillness it completes the sense of repose it is no tax on the brain besides i do really know what i was talking about i said i didnt because i dont like arguing you have been doing nothing else no i have been reeling out strings of assertions which sybil has languidly contradicted from time to time you cant call that argument look theres charlie why didnt you marry him sybil and stop in england who is that with him oh judy isnt it are they coming here what a bore charlie and judy strolled across the lawn towards them with extreme slowness to walk across a lawn for tea and walk back again afterwards was the utmost exercise that judy ever took i am taking my walk she observed as she got near them i am now exactly half way so i shall rest sybil you look as if you were resting too we are all resting and we are making the most of it because ginger tells us we shall never rest again do you want a chair judy asked ginger bertie got up sit there he said i am rather tired said judy but pray dont let me turn you out and she sat down im so glad your fathers party broke down she went on to bertie it is so very much nicer to have nobody here except just ourselves who neednt make any efforts ginger gently applauded his face still hidden by his straw hat the voice of my country he remarked ah somebody agrees with you said sybil so you are wrong i am glad i was beginning to be afraid you were right has ginger been sparkling asked judy yes sparkling gingerbeer very tasty remarked ginger fatuously they swallowed it all if you only talk enough some of it is sure to be swallowednot to stick but its finished now charlie had sat down on the bank beside sybils couch this is the last sunday then he said you go to scotland next week dont you yes said she just for a fortnight then aix with judy and i sail on september st that is earlier than you planned originally i know but we get a big boat instead of a small one i thought it worth while do you feel inclined to stroll a bit till tea by all means they are going to desecrate the sabbath stillness by strolling remarked ginger it ought not to be allowed like publichouses ah we are genuine travellers said sybil come too ginger do i look like it no but one never knows with you judy dear would not a good brisk walk do you good i shouldnt wonder said judy but i shall never know sybil put up her parasol come charlie she said they walked off together in the shadow of the big elm avenue that led down to the village the huge boskage of the trees allowed no interpenetrating ray of sun to reach them and in the silence and sleep of the hot summer afternoon they seemed to charlie to be very specially alone this feeling was emphasized no doubt to his mind by the refusal of the others to accompany them really gallio always succeeds in making himself comfortable said she what more can anyone want than a charming house like this it is so absurd to desire more than you can use it is a mistake the whole world makes except perhaps judy i dont think ginger does said charlie oh yes he desires at least to say more than he means consequently people attach no importance to what he says charlie laughed which being interpreted means that ginger has been saying something which you are afraid is correct sybil massington stopped charlie for a man you have a good deal of intuition that is partly what makes me never think of you as a man you are so like a woman in many ways i am wanting to have a last word last word what last word a last word with you sybil he said i shall never bother you again dear charlie it is no use please dont she said i am sorry to disobey you said he but i mean to it is quite shortjust this if ever you change your mind you will find me waiting for you that is all sybil frowned i cant accept that she said you have no business to put the responsibility on me like that there is no responsibility yes there is you practically threaten me it is like writing a letter to say you will commit suicide unless i do something you threaten anyhow to commit celibacy unless i marry you no i dont threaten said he so far from threatening i only leave the door open in case of hope wanting to come in that is badly expressed a woman would have said it better sybil was suddenly touched by his gentleness no one could have said it better she said charlie believe me i am sorry buthere is the truth of it i dont believe i can love anybody this also if i did not like you so much i think i would marry you ah spare me that he said i do spare it you i will not willingly make you very unhappy do you believe that he stopped and came close to her sybil if you pointed to the sky and said it was night i should believe you he said she made no reply to that and they walked on in silence everywhere over the broad expanse of swelling downs looking huge behind the heathaze and over the green restfulness of the watermeadows beneath them even over the blue immensity of the sky there was spread a sense of quiet and leisure to sybil thinking of the afterlunch conversation it seemed of value to her at the moment this contented security was a big factor in life economically no doubt she was wrong a score of dynamos utilizing the waste power of the streams below that so hurryingly sought the sea would have contributed much to the utility of the scene and the noble timber which surrounded them could certainly have been far better employed in some factory than to have merely formed a most wasteful handle as it were for the great parasol of leaves which screened them and the idle cudchewing cattle here as always there was that silent deadly war going on between utility and beauty soon without a doubt in a score of years or a score of days or a score of centuries principles of economy would prevail and the world of men would live in castiron mood in extremely sanitary castiron dwellings already it seemed to her the deathknell of beauty was vibrating in the air the rural heart of the country was bleeding into the towns instead of beating the swords into sickles the way of the world now was to beat the elmtrees into faggots and the rivers into electric light for the faggots would give warmth and the electricity would give light these things were useful and in the distance like a cuttlefish with tentacles waving and growing every moment nearer new york and all that new york stood for was sucking in whatever came within its reach she was already sucked in all this passed very quickly through her mind for it seemed to her that there had been no appreciable pause when charlie spoke again yes the world is going westwards he said i heard a few days ago that mrs emsworth was going to act in new york this autumn is it true i believe so why mere curiosity is she going on her own sybil laughed her own there isnt any i dont suppose she could pay for a steerage passage for her company bilton is taking her she paused a moment do you know bilton she asked the impresario no he is a splendid type she said of what we are coming to cad i should think said charlie cadoh yes why not but a cad with a head so many cads havent one i met him the other night where asked charlie with the vague jealousy of everybody characteristic of a man in love i forget at the house of some other cad it is rather odd charlie he is the image of you to look at when i first saw him i thought it was you he is just about the same height he has the samedont blushthe same extremely handsome face also he moves like you rather slowly but he gets there you mean i dont said charlie i didnt mean it that moment your remark again was exactly like an englishman but i liked him he has force i respect that enormously on the top of charlies tongue was you mean i have none but he was not english enough for that is he going with her he asked no he has gone he has three theatres in new york and he is going to instal dorothy emsworth in one of them is it true by the way she stopped in the middle of her sentence probably not said charlie rather too quickly you mean it is she saidabout bertie charlie made the noise usually written pshaw oh my dear sybil he said queen anne is dead the prophets are dead there are heaps of old histories sybil massington stopped now i am going to ask you a question she said you inquired a few minutes ago whether dorothy emsworth was going to act in new york why did you ask you said it was from mere curiosity is that true you can say yes again if you wish i dont wish said he it wasnt true then and i dont suppose it will be by now you mean that bertie saw a good deal of her at one time but how much neither you nor i know sybil turned and began walking home again rather quickly how disgusting she said your fault he said entirely your fault but wont it be rather awkward for him she asked walking rather more slowly i asked him that the other night said charlie he said he didnt know again for a time they walked in silence but the alertness of mrs massingtons face went bail for the fact that she was not silent because she had nothing to say then it is to be supposed that she followed out the train of her thought to her own satisfaction how lovely the shadows are she remarked shadows are so much more attractive than lights searchlights asked he no shadows and searchlights belong to the same plane i hope it is teatime i am so hungry this was irrelevant enough irrelevance therefore was no longer a social crime and i should like to see my double said charlie the only drawback to the charming situation of the house was that a curve of a branch railwayline to winchester passed not far from the garden trains were infrequent on it on weekdays even more infrequent on sundays but at this moment the thump of an approaching train was heard climbing up the incline of the line brutalite brutalite brutalite said the labouring engine she turned to him even here she saideven here is an elbow a sharp elbow utility utility did you not hear the engine say that something of this sort said he chapter iv a day of appalling heat and airlessness was drawing to its close and the unloveliest city in the world was beginning to find it just possible to breathe again for fourteen hours new york had been grilling beneath a september sun in an anticyclone and though anticyclone is a word that does not seem to matter much when it occurs in an obscure corner of the herald under the heading of weather report yet when it is translated from this fairyland of print into actual life it matters a good deal if the place is new york and the month is september other papers talked airily of a heat wave and up in newport everyone reflected with some gusto how unbearable it must be in town and went to their balls and dinnerparties and picnics and bridge with the added zest that the sauce of these reflections gave even in newport the heat was almost oppressive but to think of new york made it seem cooler from the corner where sixth avenue slices across broadway and thirtyfourth street crosses both one can see the huge mass of the waldorf hotel rising gigantic against the evening sky and wonder if one is that way inclined how many million dollars it has taken to blot out the evening sun but during the afternoon today most people were probably grateful for the shadow which those millions had undesignedly procured them it was something as one went from fifth avenue to broadway to be shielded a little by that hideous immensity for the dazzle and glare of the sun had been beyond all telling and though now the sun was close to its setting the airlessness and acrid heat of the evening was scarcely more tolerable than the furnace heat of the day for boiling was not appreciably more pleasant than baking yet in the relentless city where no one may pause for a moment unless he wishes to be left behind in the great universal race for gold which begins as soon as a child can walk and ceases not until he is long past walking the climbings of the thermometer into the nineties is an acrobatic feat which concerns the thermometer only and at the junction of sixth avenue and broadway there was no slackening in the tides of the affairs of men the electric street cars which ran up and down both these streets and the cars that crossed them running east and west up thirtyfourth street were all full to overflowing and passengers hung on to straps and steps as swarming bees cluster around their queen those in the centre of the car were unable to get out where they wanted while those at the ends who could get out did not want to a mass of damp human heat patient tired nasalvoiced and busy made ingress and egress impossible and that on which serene philosophers would gaze saying how beautiful is democracy appeared to those who took part in it to be merely mismanagement incessant ringings of the conductors bell the sudden jerks of stoppages and startings joltings over points where the lights were suddenly extinguished punctuated the passage of the cars up and down the street and still the swarming crowds clustered and hung on to straps and backs of seats wherever they could find foothold and standing room but all alike in payment for this demoniacal means of locomotion put their five cents into the hot and grimy hands of the conductor from which by occult and subtle processes they were gradually transformed into the decorations of the yachts and palaces of the owners of the line democracy and discomfort too held equal sway in the crowded trams of the elevated railway which roared by overhead down sixth avenue in the carriages of which tired millionaires and tired milliners sat stewing side by side with screeching whistles grinding brakes and the vomiting forth of the foul smoke from soft coal for a strike of some kind was in progress in pennsylvania and the men who had stored coal and also engineered the strike were reaping a million dollars a day in increased prices and slight inconvenience to a hundred million people for the thick pungent smoke poured in wreaths into the firstfloor windows of the dingy dirty habitations of the street but the train passed by on the trembling and jarring trestles and the inconvenience passed also till the next train came thunder of the passing trains above rumbling of the electric cars roar of heavy ironshod wheels of drays on the uneven illpaved cobbles of the street jostling of the foot passengers on the sidewalks as they streamed in and out from the rickety wooden staircases of the elevated railway from the crammed perspiring cars from dingy soursmelling restaurants shouts of the newsboys with sheaves of illprinted newspapers under their arms giving horrible details of the latest murder and abominable prints of the victims false teeth shoes and the dress she had last been seen in the thumpthump of the engines in the herald office the sickening stew of the streets the sickening heat of the skiesdemocracy or everyone for himself as an antidote or warningthough it did not seem to have the least effect on the dogged unending bustlethe note of impermanence was everywhere sounded loudly a block or two further up for instance the street was torn up for some new underground enterprise lewis s palmer as a matter of fact had floated a company to run a new subterranean line across new york and had been paid a million and a half dollars for the loan of his credit and while the cars which will certainly not cease running till the last trump has been sounded several times passed over spindleshanked iron girders and supports shaken every now and again by the blasting of the rock below thousands of workmen were toiling day and night deep down in the earth loading the baskets of the cranes with the splinters of the riven rocks or giving the larger pieces into the embrace of huge iron pincers that tackled them as a spider tackles a fat fly and rising aloft with them above street level took them along the ropes of their iron web over the heads of passengers and vehicles for the carts which waited for them elsewhere half a block of building had vanished almost as the night to make way for something taller and where yesterday a fivestoried building had stood the site today was vacant but for a dozen pistons half buried in the ground which puffed and shook in a sort of hellish ecstasy of glee at the work while a gang of men with axe and pick dug out the foundations for the steel houseframes yet though tomorrow almost would see the newly completed building again filling up the gap in the street the exposed walls of the adjacent houses were just for today only covered with advertisements and a notice informed the bewildered shopper that business was going on as usual that in new york might be taken for granted but the notice omitted to say where it was going on but for the crowd in general it was sufficient that work was to be done and money to be made that was the whole business and duty of each unit there and as far as each unit was concerned the devil might take the rest everyone looked tired worn out but indefatigable and extraordinarily patient one man pushed roughly by another and where in england the one would look aggrieved and the other probably however insincerely mutter an apology here neither grievance nor apology was felt desired or expressed for it is a waste of time to feel aggrieved and a waste of energy to express or feel regret tomorrow the crowd would on the average be a little richer than today that was all they wanted tomorrow the world in general would be a day richer sybil massington and bertie keynes had arrived that morning by the celtic after a voyage of complete uneventfulness the sea had been rough but the celtic had not been aware of it bertie had seen a whale blow or so he said and sybil had seen three fisher boats off the banks there had been six hours fog and they had got in that morning in this day of frightful heat they had been on deck like honest tourists to see the immense green mean statue of liberty or whatever that female represents and had found the huge skyscrapers by the docks the bustling paddlesteamers of the ferries the hooting sirens the general hideousness exactly what they had expected they were in fact neither disappointed nor pleased and when a small tired young man with a notebook had met them on the moment of their landing and asked bertie his first impressions of america they had felt that they were indeed in the authentic place nor had the impression been in any way dimmed all day and now as they sat together in the darkened sittingroom at the waldorf just before going to dress for dinner they felt like old inhabitants bertie had bought a paper containing the account of his interview headed marquis boltons eldest son lands lord keynes first impressions and had just finished reading to sybil half a column of verbose illiteracy of which to do him justice he had not been in any way guilty youre getting on bertie said she that interview shows you have struck the right note and where have you been this afternoon like satan walking up and down the earth said he i went by an overhead railway and an underground railway there are swing gates into the stations of the overhead railway as i passed in i naturally held the gate for the next man so as not to let it bang in his face he did not take it from me but passed through leaving me still holding it i might have stood there all day and they would have all passed through then i learned better and let it slam in other peoples faces it saves time somehow i thought the incident was characteristic of the country sybil lit a cigarette i like it she said the air or the people or something makes me feel alert now when i feel alert in england it is mere waste of energy there is nothing to expend ones alertness on besides one is out of tone but here somehow it is suitable i like the utter hideousness of it too look from that window at the line of houses they are like a row of jagged broken teeth well it is no worse than park lane and somehow there is an efficiency about them here one is ninetyfive stories high for a definite reasonbecause land is valuable the next is three stories high because it belongs to a millionaire who doesnt want to walk upstairs by the way mrs palmer came in while you were out we are going to dine with her this evening and go to mrs emsworths first night she looked at him rather closely as she said this that will be charming he said quite naturally and tomorrow we go down to mrs palmers on long island dont we yes really bertie their idea of hospitality is very amazing she came up here today to this blazing gridiron of a place simply in order not to let us be dull on our first evening here it seemed to her quite natural and she has put a motorcar at my disposal i like that sort of thing bertie thought a moment i know he said but though it sounds horrid to say it a motorcar doesnt mean anything to mrs palmer it means the kindliness of thinking of it said sybil it was the same kindliness which brought her up from long island would you and i if we were in the country come up to town to entertain someone who was going to stay with us next day you know we shouldnt that is true said he is mrs palmer alone here yes her husband and daughter are both down in long island she is making a sort of rival newport you know you and i plunge into it all tomorrow i think i am rather frightened but i am not sure no i dont think i am frightened i am merely trembling with determination to enjoy it all immensely trembling he asked yes just as when you hold something as tight as you can your hand trembles you must go and dressat least i must bertie i am going to be very english i think they will like it best oh dont pose you are never so nice when you pose im not going to pose i am going to be absolutely natural that is the most difficult pose of all said he about halfway up fifth avenue the two rival restaurants sherrys and delmonicos glare at each other from opposite sides of the street each with its row of attendant hansoms and motorcars though new york was technically emptythat is to say of its millions a few hundred were still at newportboth restaurants were full for mrs emsworths opening night was an occasion not to be missed and many of those who would naturally have been out of town were there in order to lend their distinguished support to the actress furthermore mr lewis s palmer from his retreat in long island had been operating yesterday on the stock exchange in a manner which compelled the attendance of many of the lesser magnates who at this season usually left the moneymarket to attend to itself this was very inconsiderate of him so it was generally thought but he was not a man who consulted the convenience of others when he saw his own opportunity but it was extremely characteristic of him that while nervous brokers bankers and financiers rushed back to the furnace of the streets he remained himself in the coolness of long island and spoke laconically through the telephone mrs palmer was waiting in the anteroom at sherrys when her two english guests arrived and greeted them with shrill enthusiasm a rather stout young american goodlooking in a coarse uncultivated kind of manner and dressed in a subtly illdressed expensive mode was with her and here you are she cried how are you lord keynes im delighted to see you again mrs massington you must let me present to you mr armstrong who has been so long dying to make your acquaintance that i thought he would be dead before you got here mrs massington mr reginald armstrong lord keynes mr armstrong the american murmured his national formula about being very pleased and mrs palmer continued without intermission and ive got no party to meet you she said because i thought you would be tired with your journey and want to have a quiet evening and well go in to dinner at once lord keynes you look as if america agreed with you and i see they have been interviewing you already well thats our way here why when reginald armstrong gave his equestrian party down at port washington last week i assure you there was a string of our newspaper men a quarter of a mile long waiting to see him the curious shrillness of talk peculiar to america sounded loud in the restaurant as they made their sidling way by crowded tables toward one of the windows looking on the street equestrian party asked mrs massington what is that tell them reginald said mrs palmer why it tickled me to death your equestrian party mrs massington those are blue points you must eat them tell them reginald well my stable was burned down last fall said he and ive been building a new one so i determined to open it in some kind of characteristic way his own idea said mrs palmer in a loud aside to bertie hes one of our brightest young men youll see a lot of him so i thought continued mr armstrong that id give a stable partymake everyone dress as grooms but then the ladies objected to dressing as grooms im sure i dont know why i should have thought theyd have liked to show their figures but some objected mrs palmer objected i dont know why she objectedlooking at herbut she did object mrs palmer smiled isnt he lovely she said loudly across the table to mrs massington well she objected again continued mr armstrong and when mrs palmer objects she objects she said she wouldnt come so i had to think of something else and it occurred to me that the best thing we could do was to have dinner on horseback in the stables he paused a moment well that dinner was a success he said i say it was a success and im modest too i had fifty tables made fitting on to the horses shoulders and we all sat on horseback and ate our dinners in the new stables fifty of us in a big circle with the horses heads pointing inwards and simultaneously the horses ate their dinner out of a big circular manger and that dinner has been talked about for a week and it ll be talked about till next week next week mrs palmer gives a party and my dinner will be as forgotten as what adam and eve had for tea when they were turned out of paradise no dont tell them screamed mrs palmer reginald if you tell them i shall never forgive you please dont then mr armstrong said sybil i should hate it if you were never forgiven besides i like surprises i should have loved your dinner i think it was too unkind of you to have given it before i came or else it is unkind of you to have told me about it now that it is over she laughed with genuine amusement bertie is it not heavenly she said we think of that sort of thing sometimes in england do you remember the paper ball but we so seldom do it and did it all go beautifully did not half fall off their horses well mrs palmers husband lewis s he wouldnt get on a real horse he said he said that he was endangering too many shareholders so i got a wooden horse for him and had it covered with goldleaf lewis on a rockinghorse screamed his wife i diedi just died luckily she had a resurrection said mr armstrong otherwise i should never have forgiven myself but you did laugh you did laugh he said mrs palmer probably did certainly she did now the dinner went on its way everything was admirable what was designed to be cold was iced what was designed to be hot was molten round them the shrilltoned diners grew a little shriller outside the crisp noise of horses hoofs on asphalt grew more frequent mrs emsworths first night was the feature of the evening and even the harassed financiers to whom tomorrow as dictated by the voice of the telephone from long island might mean ruin or redoubled fortunes had with closing hours laid all ideas of dollars aside and like sensible men proposed to distract themselves till the opening of business next morning distracted them for mrs emsworth was something of a personality her friends who were many said she could act her enemies who were legion allowed she was beautiful and new york which sets the time in so many things takes its time very obediently in matters of artistic import from unbusinesslike england and france in this conviction it was flocking there tonight besides the great impresario bilton had let her the dominion theatre and was known to have given her carte blanche in the matter of mounting and dresses this meant since he was a shrewd man a belief in her success for into the value of business he never allowed any other consideration to enter furthermore there had been from time to time a good deal of interest in england over mrs emsworths career the sort of interest which does more for a time in filling a theatre than would acting of a finer quality than hers have done the piece she was to appear in was a petit salete of no importance whatever that always suited her best she liked her audience to be quite undistracted by any interest in the plot so that they might devote themselves to the contemplation of her dresses and herself of her dresses the quality was admirable the quantity small of herself there was abundance both of quality and quantity for she was a tall woman and as we have said even her enemies conceded her good looks the piece had already begun when the little partie carree from sherrys entered and rustled to the large stagebox which bilton had reserved for them mrs emsworth in fact was at the moment making her first entrance and as they took their places was acknowledging the applause with which she was greeted naturally enough her eye as she bowed to the house travelled over its occupants and she saw the party arriving this was made easy for her by mrs palmers voluble enthusiasm which really for the moment divided the attention of the house between the stage and her box i adore her i just adore her she cried and she promised to come down from saturday till monday to long island you know her of course lord keynes theres something magnetic to me about her i told her so this afternoon i think its her neck look at her bending her head mrs massington i really think that mrs emsworths neck is the most magnetic thing i ever saw reginald isnt it magnetic the magnetic lady proceeded she acted with immense and frolicsome enjoyment like some great goodhumoured child bursting with animal spirits to the rather tired and heated occupants of the stalls she came like a sudden breeze on a hot day so infectious was her enjoyment so natural and unaffected her pleasure in exhibiting her beauty and buoyant vitality the critical element in the audiencein any case there was not muchshe simply took by the scruff of the neck and turned out of the theatre we are here to enjoy ourselves she seemed to say laugh then look at me and you will and they looked and laughed whether she was an actress or not was really beside the point there was in her anyhow something of the irrepressible gamin of the streets and the gamin that there is in everybody hailed its glorious cousin long before the act was over her success was assured and when mr bilton came in to see them in the interval it was no wonder that his mercantile delight was apparent in his face once more for the fiftieth or the hundredth time he had staked heavily and won heavily i knew she would take he said we americans mrs massington are the most serious people on the face of the earth and there is nothing we adore so much as the entire absence of seriousness mrs emsworth is like puck in the midsummer nights dream theyll be calling her mrs puck before the weeks out and shes playing up well there is a crowd of a hundred reporters behind the scenes now and shes interviewing them ten at a time and making her dog give audience to those she hasnt time for do you know her dog i thought it would knock the scenery down when it wagged its tail armstrong in the meantime was regaling bertie with more details of the equestrian party and the justice of biltons remarks about seriousness was evident from his conversation it was all most carefully thought out he was saying for one mustnt have any weak point in an idea of that sort i dont think you go in for that sort of social entertainments in london do you no we are much more haphazard i think said bertie well its not so hereanyhow in our set if you want to keep in the swim you must entertain people now and then in some novel and highly original manner mrs lewis s palmer there is the centre the very centre of our american social life youll see things at her home done just properly last year she gave a farmparty that we talked about i assure you for a month you probably heard of it i dont remember it im afraid well you surprise me all the men wore real smockfrocks and carried shepherds crooks or cartwhips or flails and all the women were dressed as milkmaids it was the drollest thing you ever saw and not a detail was wrong all the grounds down at mon reposthats her house you knowwere covered with cattlesheds and poultryhouses and pigsties and the cows and sheep were driven around and milked and shorn just as they do on real farms and inside the walls of her ballroom were even boarded up and it was turned into a dairy shes one of our very brightest women and next week there is to be a new surprise is there not asked bertie yes indeed and i think it will top everything she has done yet what she has spent on it i couldnt tell you why even lewis s palmer got a bit restive about it and when lewis s gets restive about what mrs palmer is spending you may bet that anyone else would have been broke over it why she spent nearly thirty thousand dollars the other day over the funeral of her dog did mr palmer get restive over that asked bertie well i guess it would have been pretty mean of him if he had and lewis he isnt mean hes a strenuous man you know and he likes to see his wife strenuous as a leader of society hed be terribly mortified if she didnt give the time to american society and he knows perfectly well that she has to keep firing away if shes to keep her place just as hes got to in his why what would happen to american finance if lewis realized all his fortune and put it in a box and sat on the top twiddling his thumbs why it would just crumblego to pieces same with american society if mrs palmer didnt keep on shes just got to then what happened to you all when she came to london asked bertie rather pertinently why that was in the nature of extending her business that was all right said armstrong and heres some of the returns coming in right along he added felicitously mrs massington and you have come to america at this point bilton interrupted mrs emsworth saw you tonight lord keynes he said and hopes you will go to see her tomorrow morning no west twentysixth street easier than your park squares and park places and park streets isnt it much easier said bertie pray give my compliments to mrs emsworth and say i regret so much i am leaving new york tomorrow with mrs palmer ah you couldnt have a better excuse said bilton but no excuse does for mrs emsworth youd better find half an hour lord keynes chapter v mrs emsworths little flat in twentysixth street certainly reflected great credit on its furnisher who was her impresario she had explained her requirements to him briefly but completely before she signed her contract i want a room to eat my chop in she said i want a room to digest my chop in i want a room to sleep in and i want somebody to cook my chop and somebody to make my bed all that i leave to you you know my taste if the room doesnt suit me i shall fly into a violent rage and probably refuse to act at all you will take all the trouble of furnishing and engaging servants off my hands wont you how dear of you now please go away im busy au revoir till new york now bilton as has been mentioned was an excellent man of business and knowing perfectly well that mrs emsworth was not only capable of carrying her threat into action but was extremely likely to do soa course which would have seriously embarrassed his planshe really had taken considerable pains with her flat consequently on her arrival after she had thrown a sham empire clock out of the window which in its fall narrowly missed braining a passing millionaire she expressed herself much pleased with what he had done and gave a standing order to a very expensive florist to supply her with large quantities of fresh flowers every day and send the account to bilton the room in which she digested her chop especially pleased her carpet curtains and upholstery were rosecoloured the walls were green satin with half a dozen excellent prints on them and by the window was an immense louis xv couch covered in brocade with a mass of pillows on it here the morning after her opening night in new york she was lying and basking like a cat in the heat smoking tiny rosescented russian cigarettes and expecting with some anticipation of amusement the arrival of bertie keynes round her lay piles of press notices which stripped the american variety of the english language bare of epithets she was deeply absorbed in these and immense smiles of amusement from time to time crossed her face on the floor lay her huge mastiff which with the true timeserving spirit rightly calculated to be thoroughly popular she had rechristened teddy roosevelt her great coils of auburn hair were loosely done up and her face a full sensuous oval was of that brilliant warmblooded colouring which testified to the authenticity of the smouldering gold of her hair lying there in the hot room brilliant with colour and fragrant with the scent of innumerable flowers the account for which was sent in to mr bilton she seemed the embodiment of vitality and serene paganism not even her friendsand they were manyever accused her of morality but on the other hand all children adored her that is an item not to be disregarded when the moralist adds up the balancesheet in spite of his excuse of the night before bertie keynes had taken biltons advice and before long he was announced bertie bertie she cried as he came in i wake up to find myself famous i am magnetic it appears beyond all powers of comprehension i am vimmyam i really vimmy do you think and what does it mean i am a soulful incarnation of adorableoh no its teddy roosevelt who is the adorable incarnation yes that dear angel lying there is teddy roosevelt and an adorable incarnation which would never have happened if we hadnt come to america would it darling not you bertie i christened him on the way over and you shall be godfather because he wants a new collar let me see where was i bertie i was a success last night enormous i knew i should be now sit down and try to get a word in edgeways if you can i congratulate you dorothy he saidi congratulate you most heartily thanks i say teddy roosevelt the kind young gentleman congratulates us now what are you doing on these opulent shores looking out for opulence i guess going to be married are we well teddy is too if we can find a suitable young lady and so am i oh such fun and well tear up all our past histories and put them in the fire she sat half up on her couch and looked at him its two years since we met last bertie she said and youwhy youve become a man you always were a pretty boy and you dont make a badlooking man and im vimmy i used not to be vimmy did i but we are all changing as time goes on really im very glad to see you again bertie felt unaccountably relieved at her manner his relief was of short duration dorothy emsworth arranged her pillows more comfortably and lit another cigarette i wanted to see you before you left new york she said because i am coming down to stay with mrs palmer next saturday and we had better know how we stand so what are you over here for did you come here to get married and if so why not she lay back as she spoke stretching her arms out with a gesture that somehow reminded him of a cat stretching its forelegs and unsheathing the claws of its silent padded feet his feeling of relief was ebbing a little why not indeed he said dear bertie echoconversation is so tedious she said you always used to be rather given to it so you have come out to get married that is settled then do ask me to the wedding the voice that breathed wedding march from lohengrin ring dropping and running down the aisle like a hoop orangeflowers tears sudden unexplained hysterics of the notorious mrs emsworth deportment of the bride weddingcake puffpuff and the curtain drops with extreme rapidity o lor teddy r what devils we all are to be sure berties feeling of relief had quite gone but his nervousness had gone also he felt he knew the facts now i see he said you propose to make trouble im glad you told me i told you she asked laughing lazily little vimmy me i say im brainy too what do you propose to do he asked well wait first of all till you are engaged i say bertie i like teasing you when you wrinkle your forehead as you are doing now you look adorable i dont mean a word i say you know any more than you meant a word of that very very funny letter you once wrote me which is now she said with histrionic utterance one of my most cherished possessions you told me you had burned it said he i know i meant to burn it but i couldnt when i told you i had burnt it i really meant to have burnt it and so i didnt tell you a lie because for all practical purposes it was burned but then i found i couldnt it was too funny for words really there are so few humorous things in the world that it would be murder to destroy it of course you didnt mean it but i cant burn it it is here somewhere bertie did not smile he sat up straight in his chair and put the tips of his fingers together and dont look like gallio remarked mrs emsworth look here dorothy he said you can make things rather unpleasant for me if you choose now why do you choose you know perfectly well that at one time the world said things about you and me you also know perfectly well thatwell that there was no truth in them you encouraged me to fall madly in love with you becausei dont know why i thought you liked me anyhow then there appeared somebody else i wrote you a letter expressing my illimitable adoration that was allall you have got that letter is not what i have said true yesslightly edited you see i am a very improper person what do you mean well if you choose to write a very fervent letter to a very improper person people will sayit is no use denying itthey will say what a fine day it is but hot bertie got up that is all i have to say he said people are so illnatured said mrs emsworth the catlike laziness had left her though her attitude was the same instead of looking sensuously lazy she looked very alert goodbye then said bertie we meet next week at long island yes it will be very pleasant said she he left the room without more words and for five minutes she remained where she was but slowly as she lay there the enjoyment and the purring content faded completely out of her face then it grew hard and sad eventually with a longdrawn sigh half sob she got up and called to her dog he rose limb by massive limb and laid his head on her lap teddy r she said we are devils but there are two worse devils than you and i one has just gone away one is just coming worsedevil one is worse because he thinkshe thinks that of me worsedevil two is worse because hehe did that to me soso you and i will think nothing more about it at all but keep our spirits up she fondled the great dogs head a moment then got up suddenly and drew the blind down to shut out the glare of the sun which was beginning to lay a hot yellow patch on the floor he thought that she said to herselfhe really thought that she walked up and down the room for a moment or two then went to a table on which stood her despatchbox opened it and looked through a pile of letters that lay inside one of these she took out and read through at moments it seemed to amuse her at moments her smile was struck from her face when she had finished reading it she paused a few seconds with it in her hands as if weighing it then with a sudden gesture of impatience she tore it in half and threw the pieces into the grate then with the quick relief of a decision made and acted upon she whistled to her dog and went into her bedroom to make her toilet resplendency was part of her programme and with the consciousness of a busy hour before her she told her butlerbiltons liberal interpretation of her requirements had included a manservantthat if mr harold bilton called he was to be asked to wait the room to sleep in was if anything more satisfactory than the room to digest her chop in like all proper bedrooms there was a bed in it a large table winking with silver in the window and very little else by the bedside there was a bearskin in front of the dressingtable in the window there was a rug otherwise the room was carpetless and parquetted and devoid of furniture and dust darkgreen curtains hung by the window darkgreen blinds could be drawn across the window the bathroom beyond held the hopeless but necessary accessories of dressing her maid was waiting for herparkinson by nameand it was not dorothy who came to be dressed but puck parkinson she said once upon a time there was a very fascinating woman called x lorm said parkinson quite so and there was a very fascinating young man called y he wanted to marry her and wrote to say so but meantime another man called z also wanted toto marry her so she said yes because he gave her a great deal of money but she kept ys proposali dont know why except because it was so funny and so now i suppose she is mrs z thats all lorm said parkinson will you wear your shiffong and lace dress yes shiffong parkinson supposing i suddenly burst into tears what would you think i should think you wasnt quite wellm quite right also there isnt time mrs emsworth had not been gone more than ten minutes or so before bilton was shown up he appeared to be in a particularly wellsatisfied humour this morning and as he moved about the room noting with his quick eye the stamp of femininity which mrs emsworth had already impressed into the garnishing of the place he whistled softly to himself in his hand he carried a small jewelcase with her initials in gold upon the top as always in the relaxed mood the true man came to the surface for a man is most truly himself not at great moments of emergency or when a sudden call is made on him but when his ambitions for the time being are gratified when he is pleased with himself and his circumstancesabove all when he is alone thus though just now the hard eagerness of his face was a little softened yet its alertness hardly dozed and though he had made he felt sure a great success in bringing dorothy emsworth to america he hardly allowed himself even this momentary pause of achievement but had called this morning to talk over with her the details of a protracted tour through the principal cities of the states true son of his country he realized that to pause spelled to be left behind as his manner was bilton did not sit down but kept walking about as if not to be caught idle either in mind or body as in many of his countrymen the habit of perpetually being ready and eager to snap up an opportunity had become a second nature to him so that it was far more an effort to him to rest than to work working was as natural to him as breathing to cease to work required the same sort of effort as to hold the breath to him in his profession as impresario any movement any glimpse at a room or a picture could perhaps suggest what in the fertile alchemy of his mind might be transformed into a tip and he looked with special attention at two watteau prints which hung on the walls for in the second piece which mrs emsworth was to produce under his direction a certain scene was laid in the gardens at versailles and the note of artificial naturalness had to be struck in the scenery as watteau and no one else had struck it big trees cut formally and square in their lower branches but with the topmost boughs left unpollarded fountain in the centre quite so and a glimpse just a glimpse of the terrace of the palace with the two bronze fountains beneath the trees he stood a moment before the fireplace with eyes half closed conjuring up the scene and in particular seeing it with his minds eye as a setting to that incomparable woman in whom professionally at this juncture he was so deeply interested to whom he was so managerially devoted but of whom in other respects he was so profoundly weary for a year he had been wildly in love with her for another year he had slowly cooled towards her and now it required all his steadiness of head and incessantly watchful will not to betray his tedium also in years he was now though still only half way through the thirties old enough in mind to wish to settle down his capabilities for passionate attachments were a little cooling and with a cynical amusement at himself he was beginning to realize that married domesticity even as morals taught was though for other reasons the placid riverbed into which the babbling mountainstreams of youth must eventually empty themselves rather bathos perhaps but he realized fully that everyone gets in life what they themselves bring to it the only limitations imposed on a man are those which his own nature makes but these unedifying moralities did not occupy him long they were the background to his thoughts just as the terrace of versailles was the background for the picture he was forming in the foreground of the picture stood mrs emsworth on the terrace stood another figure sybil massington he had let his cigar go out as he revolved these things in front of the two watteau pictures and then rose to drop it in the fireplace a letter in an envelope torn once in half lay there and he stooped and picked it up laid the two pieces side by side on the table and read it through then he put the pieces in his pocket and with that praiseworthy attention to detail which throughout his life had contributed so largely to his success he took from the table a sheet of paper folded it inside an envelope tore it in half and replaced the pieces in the grate where he had found the others the whole thing was quickly and naturally done it was merely one among a thousand million other cases in which his mind was ready to take advantage of any possible opportunity that fate might cast in his way the torn letter might conceivably at some future date be useful to him therefore he kept it it is no use to guard against certaintiessuch was his gospelfor certainties in this life are so few as to be practically negligible but he who guarded against contingencies and provided for possibilities was the winner in the longrun this done he dismissed the matter from his mind and in order not to let the moments pass without seed sketched out in some detail the plan of the stage as suggested by the two watteau prints he was deep in this when mrs emsworth entered the shiffong suited her admirably you have been waiting she said i am sorry for keeping you oh harold they love me over here they just love me his part was at his fingertips that doesnt seem to me in the least remarkable he said you are a success no one can be more i want to be allowed to commemorate it and he handed her the jewelcase he was no niggard when business was involved his business now was to keep her in a good temper and the opal and diamond brooch he had chosen at tiffanys was really admirable even mrs palmer might have found it brought consolation to a wounded spirit that is dear of you harold she said i adore opals is it really for me thank you ever so much it goes on now is it rather big for the morning i think it is a reason the more for wearing it she pinned it into her dress and sat down well she said i came really to congratulate you said he but as i am here i suppose we may as well talk over some business that must be talked over about your tour are you willing to stop over here till april at least yes i dont see why not i want to appear in london early in may very well i will draft an agreement and send it you now you may consider that with your extraordinary success of last night the theatre will be full for some weeks ahead i propose your giving an evening performance on saturdays as well as the matinee terms royalty twenty per cent on total takings it is worth your while is it not more worth my while to be seen from saturday till monday at mrs palmers it would be if the theatre was not full but you could fill itfor the present anyhowif you had a matinee every day besides you can get down to long island with the utmost ease on sunday morning i go to mass on sunday morning you forget that he smiled i suggest then that you should omit that ceremony if you want to go to mrs palmers however there is no hurry weigh the three things in your mindeighty or ninety pounds by acting on saturday evening or mass on sunday morning or mrs palmers on sunday morning there is another thing i want to talk over the scenes in paris with you i am going to mrs palmers the sunday after next i will bring the models down with me if you will promise to give me an hour they will not be ready till then yes i am going there next sunday and the sunday after they have a theatre there she wants me to do something in the evening bilton thought a moment what do i get he asked the pleasure of seeing me act silly he shook his head im afraid i must forget that pleasure he said your contract binds you to give no theatrical representations of any sort except under my direction the gamin element rose to the surface in her what a beast you are she said it is for a charity and a cheque he observed the cheque is purely informal besides we shall be there together he took a cigar out of his case bit the end off with his long teeth that gleamed extremely white between the very remarkable red of his lips look here dolly he said there are two sides to the relations in which we are placed one is purely businesslike the other is purely sentimental it is a pity to let them overlap it spoils my devotion to you to feel that it is in a way mixed up with business and it offends my instincts as a business man to let sentiment have a word to say in our bargains briefly then i forbid your acting for mrs palmer unless you make it worth my while after all i didnt bring you out here for sentimental reasons i brought you out because from a financial point of view i thought it would be good for both of us what do you want she asked half your cheque for something you havent arranged and which wont cost you a penny yes i am talking business you can close with that offer any time today tomorrow it will be twothirds im quite square with you americans are jews observed mrs emsworth possibly it would be an advantage if everyone was it would simplify bargaining immensely the gentile mind is often highly unreasonable and instead of allowing both sides to make profits it simply refuses to part with its goods and a fine opportunity goes towell to damnation you wont score if you dont act for her nor will i if you do we both shall dont be a gentile dolly she did not answer for a moment her eyes saw the torn fragments of the letter in the grate and she remembered that she had definitely and for ever torn up what bertie had written to her then she got up crossed the room to where he was standing by the fireplace and put her hands on his shoulders are you tired of me she asked his brown eyes grew black at the fragrance and seductiveness of her close presence for the blood is stirred long after the imagination has ceased to be fired you witch you witch he said but in the background on the terrace there still stood the other figure chapter vi long island is separated from new york by a narrow sound across which ferryboats ply in both directions with extreme punctuality from any part of new york city a couple of electric cars or an electric railway will take you to the threshold of the ferryboat and trains await you at the backdoor so to speak of the ferryboats to convey you down the length of long island on board the ferryboat you can buy a variety of badlyprinted and sensational daily papers for the sum of one cent you can get your boots blacked for very little more and no doubt if there was sufficient demand the directors would enable you to have your teeth brushed or your hair combed no part of the equipment however is at all lovely it answers the purpose of conveying you cheaply and expeditiously from one point to another and enables you to finish your toilet in transit which is an invaluable boon to those who want to save time as a matter of fact everyone wants to save time but it has been reserved for americans to invent such methods of doing it the rest of the world therefore is in their debt the debt is acknowledged but the rest of the world quite inscrutably does not choose to follow their example all may raise the flower now all have got the seed but they do not raise the flower there is no class on these boats there is no class on the elevated railway there is no class on the electric cars millionaires in long island in consequence have the privilege of enjoying the same discomforts as other people and even lewis s who could have bought up the whole system of electric cars overhead railway and ferryboats after a little judicious distribution of emoluments to the officials of new york city habitually went by these unlovely conveyances because there were no other during his transit he once sent a cablegram buying at any price the whole dinnerservice which had been used on the last occasion on which marie antoinette dined at petit trianon it was extremely expensive and as he wrote the drippings from the rain fell on to his cablegram form for the boat was full subsequently he argued with the bootboy who had blacked his boots but gave in when the boy produced his tariffcard and democracy the spirit of his fellowpassengers sympathized in the main with him once arrived on long island a walk of a hundred yards or so leads to the ticketoffice those hundred yards are uncovered however but since people who live on long island must pass them in order to get into the delectable city there is no reason why the railroad or the ferryboat company should offer conveniences in the way of shelter to their passengers given competition any line would vie with the others in mirrors and gilded furniture but if there is none why on earth spend a penny not a passenger the less will travel because the mode of transit is bestial thus commonsense as usual emerges triumphant for the purpose of this narrative the lowlying swamp and companies of jerrybuilt houses that cluster round the various stations on the line may be disregarded and after half an hours travelling the train emerges into a very pleasant land there are no high uplands to dwarf the immediate landscape but there are trees of tolerable growth and slim presence to add distinction to it underneath these trees as the train nears port washington grow high clumps of purple michaelmas daisies now in september full of bursting bud and the temperate seawinds give a vividness of colour to the prevailing green which reminds foreigners of the devon seacoast mrs palmers newbuilt house stood on a charming hilltop some mile or so beyond the station the site had been occupied till a few years before by a delightful bungalow structure built of wood with shingled walls and surrounded on all sides by deep shady verandas the wood in those days came right up to the house on two sides and was just lopped of its topmost branches on a third so that where the ground fell away rapidly from the house a charming glimpse of the dim blue sound could be seen framed in sky and treetops while the fourth side was open the housefront giving on to a broad lawn of velvety turf which changed into rougher meadowland in the middle distance while over distant treetops and a wash of green country the gray smoke of new york sat on the horizon the house in fact had been like a hundred other houses on long island not perhaps very pretty still less beautiful but not without a certain haphazard picturesqueness about it restful and unpretending and most eminently adapted for the purpose of affording to the brainheated business man a draught of coolness and greenness moreover it had expressed somehow the genius of the place its woods not huge nor of magnificent trees but of pleasant growth always sounded in whispers through the rooms and even as the greatest heats of summer came tempered by the passage of the winds through the filter of the woodlands so one would have thought the fever of new york was abated here even as the smoke of the city was but a gray tache on the horizon it had as all houses should been in tune with the pleasant mediocre charm of the island even as the chateaux on the loire express the broad grandeur and classical formality of the landscape as the big houses of england are in the scale of their huge timbered parks and for that matter as the county gaol expresses the security which his majesty kindly affords to the criminal classes but within the last few years the whole place had been completely changed and it was no longer the genius of long island but the genius of mushroom wealth that crowned the hilltop for a quarter of a mile on every side round the house the trees had been felled and their roots dynamited and huge lawns spread their green carpets in the most ample expanses foursquare in the centre stood the immense house of gray stone copied largely from one of the valois chateaux in the south of france but with various protuberances in the shape of a theatre a swimmingbath and a tenniscourt grafted on to it a carriagedrive lay in long curves like a flicked whiplash surmounting terrace after terrace set with nugatory nudities till it reached the leadroofed portico at the front where two great graecoroman candelabra of parian marble stood one on each side of the door pierced for gas and crowned by large glass globes to the north lay the italian garden all laurels and tessellated pavement cypresses and statuary fountains and flowerbeds to the west were the tennis and croquet lawns and to the south where the ground in old days had fallen tumbling towards the sea it had been built up with thousands of tons of earth and faced with masonry so that from the edge of the terrace one looked down on to the topmost fans of the waving trees heavy gilded vanes crowned the lead roofs and high over the central dome of the building a flagstaff displayed mrs palmers very original devicelove caught in a rosebushto the airs of heaven round the extreme edge of the terrace ran the bicycle track on which lewis s palmer did his ten miles a day with black hatred in his heart of this extraordinary waste of time the estate which was of great extent and produced nothing whatever since to mrs palmers way of thinking to live on an estate which produced anything was of the nature of keeping a shop was all pressed into the amiable service of providing entertainment for the guests and of showing the wondering world a specimen of the delectable life for several miles the road through the woods had been run in artfully contrived gradients carried on struts over too precipitous ravines and quarried through cuttings to avoid undesirable steepnesses the sides of the cuttings were admirably planted and creepers and ivy covered the balustrades of the bridges a golfcourse smooth as a billiardtable and not too heavily bunkered lay near the house and mrs palmer had tried a most original experiment last year of stocking the woods with all sorts of game to provide mixed shooting for a couple of parties in the autumn this had not been wholly a success for the deer she had turned out were so tame that they gazed in timid welcome at the shooters probably expecting to be fed till they fell riddled with bullets while the pheasants were so wild that nobody could touch a tailfeather but the costume of the chasseursgreen velvet very robinhoodyhad been most tasteful and she herself armed with a tiny pearifle and dressed in decent imitation of atalanta had shot a roebuck and a beater the latter happily not fatally from the centre of the terrace on the east which had been brought over entire from a needy italian palace a broad flight of steps of rosecoloured marble led down to the sea a small breakwater was sufficient to provide station and anchorage for the two steamyachts and smaller pleasureboats but otherwise the shore had not been meddled with there was a charming beach of sand and a little further on a fringe of seaweedcovered rockpools behind this was a small natural lagoon in a depression in the sandy foreshore some halfacre in extent fed by a stream that came down through the woods but brackish through the infiltration of the salt water this that highly original woman had chosen to be the scene of the fete which was to astonish society next week but the secret had been well kept and no one except reggie armstrong knew the precise details of the new surprise for a fortnight or so however it was common knowledge that a great many large pans wrapped in tarpaulin had been arriving and the shore had been populous with men who plied some sort of barelegged avocation which implied wading in the lagoon but the foreman of the company who was executing mrs palmers orders had received notice that if any word of what was being done leaked out or reached the papers at that moment all work would be suspended and the firm would never have another order from her she herself sometimes alone sometimes with reggie inspected the work otherwise no one was allowed near the place the yachts of her dearest friends it is true constantly passed and repassed up the sound and many were the operaglasses levelled at the shore but what the barelegged men were doing baffled conjecture and the best glasses the house inside was with the exception of one small suite of the most sumptuous description a huge hall paved with marble and covered as to its walls with superb woodwork of grinling gibbons occupied the centre of the groundfloor and en suite round it were the rooms for entertaining pingpong being at this moment fashionable it was to be expected that almost every room had its table and it was curious to see the hideous little black board on its cheap trestle legs occupying the centre of the great french drawingroom old rosecoloured satin was stretched on the walls an immense aubusson carpet covered the floor all the furniture was gems of the early empire style the big ormolu clock was by vernier great dresden parrots in gilt mounts held the shaded electric lights and a statuette by clodion stood on the queens escritoire from the tuileries one side of the square block of house was entirely occupied by the picturegallery which contained some extremely fine specimens of the great english portraitschool a few dubious old masters some good lancrets and several very valuable pictures by that very bright young american artist sam wallace these as all the world knows represent scenes from the ballet and such subjects and he is supposed to have a prodigious eye for colour here too of course was an unrivalled place for pingpong and mrs palmer had caused to be made a very large court so that four people could play together great grave english footmen when the game was in progress were stationed at each end to pick up the balls and hand them on silver salvers to the server and they had rather a busy time of it for the majority of mrs palmers guests found a difficulty in inducing the ball to go anywhere near the table but they found it very amusing and it produced shrieks of senseless laughter an observant man might have noticed in a dark corner of the hall a small green baize door it was in shadow of the staircase and might easily have escaped him altogether but if he noticed it it would have struck him as odd that this plain baize door with three brass initials on itl s pshould find a place in this magnificence if it had only been l s d it would have been quite in place and might have been taken to be the shrine of the tutelary god of the place shrine indeed it was and the tutelary god sat within for the initials were those of mrs palmers husband it was a perfectly plain bare room with drugget on the floor an almanac hung near the fireplace a large table stood in the centre of the room on which were piles of papers apparatus for writing and usually a glass of milk from the door to the right there came the subdued tickings of telegraph apparatus near that door sat a young man on a plain wooden chair and at the table sat a small grayhaired man very thin and spare with bushy eyebrows which frowned over his work from time to time he would throw on to the floor a scrap of paper then the young man would get up noiselessly pick it up and go through with it into the room from which came the tickings of the telegraph then he would return and sit down again occasionally a muffled knock would come at the same door upon which he would rise and take a paper which was handed him and lay it quite close to the right hand of the man who sat at the table who either crumpled it up after reading it or wrote something in reply these answers and messages were all written on small scraps of paper measuring about three inches by one there was a pile of them always ready by his left hand a telephone also stood on this table which rang very constantly then the man at the table would as if automatically place the receiver at his ear and listen sometimes not even looking up from his writing and often replacing the instrument without a word more rarely he looked up and he would say a few wordsyes yes no certainly not very well buy or sell at once yes all sometimes again it would be he who first used the instrument and he would ring up his head clerk in new york or a partner never in a hurry never apparently impatient on the other hand he would not wait idle till the answering bell rang but go steadily on with his work at such moments he would raise his eyes sometimes when he was speaking and if you happened to catch his glance it is probable you would never forget it but would understand though momentarily only and dimly maybe that at the table in the bare room there sat a force a great natural phenomenon before which all the splendour and magnificence of the house all the illimitable outpouring of wealth which it implied became insignificanta mere shirtbutton or a tiepin to the man from whose brain it had all sprung in face but for those extraordinary eyes dark gray in colour but of a vitality so great that it seemed as if each was a separate living entity his features were somewhat insignificant he had gray rather thin whiskers and irongray hair still thick and not yet deserting his forehead his nose was slightly hooked suggesting that a spoonful perhaps of jewish blood ran in his veins his mouth was very thinlipped and compressed in body he was short and thin almost to meagreness and owing to a nearly total absence of digestive power he lived practically exclusively on milk of which he drank some five or six pints a day and in nothing was his power of control so amazingly shown for ten years ago he had been both gourmet and gourmand and had habitually eaten enormous masses of food with a relish and palate for the curiously delicate and uncultivated sense of taste that savarin might have envied even now when he sat at the head of the table at his wifes parties he knew partly by keenness of nostril partly by look whether any dish was not perfectly cooked and next morning the first of the slips which he dropped on to the floor to be picked up by the young man at the door might run to the chef not enough asparagusheads in the sauce milanaise some three weeks ago i told you the same thingl s p this extraordinary sense of and attention to detail characteristic of the great napoleon was also most characteristic of mr palmer only the night before his daughter had come down to dinner in a new dress and found herself the instant target for the piercing gray eye of her father there ought to be two straps on the shoulder not one he said it is copied from the figure of madame matignon in the picture of the last fete of the empress eugenie pray have it altered dear old papa remarked amelie i dare say you know everything but it wouldnt be so pretty that is a matter of taste but it would be right this characteristic which appeared so strongly even in such branches of human interest as the position of a strap or a bow on a womans dress appeared most piercingly of all on questions concerning finance figures indeed once seen by him seemed to be indelibly imprinted on his mind and without reference he would embark on enterprises where an accurate knowledge of previous balancesheets and present prices was essential it was essential to him only instead of referring to books which would give him the required information he carried it about in his head to his partners and those who were associated with him in business he was a source of constant wonder partners they might be to him in name and since they were all welltried and trusted men they no doubt were of assistance to him but as far as executive power was concerned they might as well have been junior clerks in some other firm for palmer went on his way automatically selfbalanced on the topmost crest of the huge wave of prosperity that was flooding america quicker than the whole of the rest of the new york market to scent coming trouble or prosperity in the world of money prompter than any to take advantage of it then when his days work was done at whatever hour that might be it was as if the word business was unknown to him and there sat at table dressed in loose and somewhat illfitting clothes a man of very simple and kindly nature a connoisseur in cookery art and millinery a gentleman at heart and to the backbone an americanone who in spite of his gentleness was without breeding one who in spite of his deep and varied knowledge was without culture he and amelie were seated at lunch alone together on the day following mrs emsworths triumphant debut amelie had only just come in from her ridethe horse she preferred to ride was one which few men could have satand she still wore her ridinghabit she was quite obviously the authentic daughter of her father and mother and like a clever girl which she undoubtedly was she had selected so it seemed all the good points possessed by both her parents rejected all their weaknesses and embodied the result in the adorable compound known as amelie palmer she had been right for instance in possessing herself of her mothers extraordinary vitality and physical health rejecting her fathers digestive apparatus on the other hand she had chosen her fathers eyes impressing upon them however a certain femininity and had set them in a complexion of dazzling fairness which she owed to her mother and out of the careful selection there had sprung crowning it all the quality that more than anything else was shenamely her unrivalled exuberance of enjoyment whether it was some new social effort of her mothers to which she brought her glorious presence whether she rode alone through the flowering woods or accompanied her father on his hygienic bicycle ridepapas treadmill as she called itshe brought to all her occupations the great glowing lantern of her joy the same brilliant smile of welcome for anything that might turn up the same divine contentshe took nothing seriously but had enthusiasm for everything of refinement or intellectual qualities she had none whatever but he would be a bloodless man who could really deplore their absence when he looked on that brilliant vitality surely it would be time enough to think of such gray gifts when the sparkling tide of her life ran less riotously at present it would be like teaching some cleanlimbed young colt of the meadows to sit up and beg or shake a paw in a certain way and it is part of the purpose of this story to draw out the eventual pedigree of the resemblance her joie de vivre was very much akin to that quality which had so captivated the americans in new york on the occasion of mrs emsworths first night in the older woman since her nature had been longer in the crucible of life it had necessarily undergone a certain change but the critical observer had he hazarded the conjecture that at amelies age mrs emsworth had been very like amelie would though he was quite wrong about it have had the satisfaction of making a really clever mistake for mrs emsworth at that age had been possessed of a somewhat serious and joyless nature her present joie de vivre was the result of her experience of life the conviction thoughtfully arrived at that joy is the thing worth living for but amelies exuberance was the result not of philosophy but of instinct she laughed like a child merely because she laughed and the critical observer if after making one clever mistake he had been willing to hazard another and had guessed that at mrs emsworths age amelie would be like mrs emsworth would have risked a mistake that was not clever for it is very seldom that experience confirms ones childish instincts in ninetynine cases out of a hundred it either eradicates them altogether or at any rate modifies them almost beyond recognition mrs emsworth had won back to what had not been in her an instinct when she was a child and it was more unlikely that amelie when a woman would retain the instincts that were now hers at the present moment amelies enthusiasm was largely taken up with food papa you have an angelic nature she said and how you can sit there chewing crackers and sipping milk without throwing the table things at me i cant conjecture habit of selfcontrol amelie said he his eyes smiling at her perhaps you will learn it some day when does your mother come down this afternoon with the two english folk shes been telephoning all the morning when mamma gets hold real tight hold of the telephone she doesnt let go under an hour or two now im not like that the moment i ring anyone up i forget what i was going to say and have to ask them to dinner instead i guess you and mamma took all the brains of the family papa i had the heavenliest ride this morning all through the firwoods and tamburlaine wanted to jump the sound the daisies are all coming out and it smelt so good oh it smelt so good likelike a drug store theres the telephone again mr palmer considered this a moment when your mother gave her huntingparty last year he said she commenced ringing the telephone at halfpast ten in the morning and she was late for lunch because she hadnt finished top speed all the time too she takes things seriously thats why she comes out on top every time yes some more said amelie to the footman mr palmer looked quickly at the dish as it was handed her what mess is that he asked pigeons once said she it wont be anything in a minute or two there ought to be mushrooms in the stew its meant to be a la toulon ive forgotten more about cookery than our present chef ever knew amelie laughed poor papa what a lot you must forget i guess youre failing well ive regretfully finished my lunch are you going treadmilling yes who comes down with your mother mrs massington and lord keynes the others come on saturdaymrs emsworth bilton and that lot papa ive thought of the right name for reggie armstrong at last its pingpong hes just that mr palmer considered this yes pingpong is about the size small set though come and treadmill amelie she got up and stretched herself then let one arm fall round her fathers neck there are schemes in the air she said to him as they walked out but on the day you see me marry pingpong you may tie me up by the heels to tamburlaines tail from which it may be seen that either amelie was charmingly lacking in the wisdom of the world or that her mother had more of it than one would have guessed chapter vii mrs palmers houseparty which was to be with her during the week of the revels as they were called had arrived at mon repos the same afternoon mon repos had been taking its rest in its usual relentless manner and bertie keynes and mrs massington were beginning to get into training it had dawned on them both very soon that they were engaged in the exercise of the most strenuous mental and physical activity that their dawdling english lives had ever known the whole party breakfasted together in a marquee on the lawn and from that moment till after the ensuing midnight were engaged ohne rast with a prodigious quantity of hast in a continuous social effort bathing boating bridge the two latter simultaneously lasted till lunch these and similar pursuits all executed in the dazzling light in the dazzling crowd and largely to the dazzling sound of a band went on without pause till dinner after which was a short oneact play in the theatre followed by a quiet dance after one day of it mrs massingtons quick perceptions made discoveries which she communicated to bertie you are here to play up she said and not to amuse yourself dont drink any wine at lunch and very little at dinner then i shall die said bertie no you will not you will feel much less tired the whole day is a stimulant so why take more besides alcohol produces a reaction that doesnt matter in england because we sit down and react here you cant also dont attempt to sparkle in conversation here they sparkle naturallyat least they open their mouths and let it comewhereas in england we tend rather to shut our mouths unless we want to say something but you are being a great success go away now i am going to rest for three minutes before i dress for dinner bertie lingered a moment at the door of her room they are awfully kind he said if only i was stronger i should enjoy it enormously i am enjoying it said she it suits me you will too if you take my advice i feel more inclined to take to drink said he but the fact once grasped that life at mon repos was not a holiday but hard relentless work of a most exacting kind they began forthwith to settle down to it and grapple with it at once the difficulty and charm of it absorbed them it was a continual piece of acting whatever your mood you had to assume a species of reckless gaiety and all day long feverishly and seriously engage in things that were originally designed to be relaxations but which the ingenuity of social life had turned into instruments of the profession none of those present particularly cared for bridge boating or bathing in themselves they would not have boated or bathed alone or played bridge even with a dummy but they used these relaxations as a means of accomplishing social efforts such a life cannot be undertaken frivolously though it is purely frivolous twenty years of it ages its devotees more than thirty years of hard and reasonable brainwork and though they find it intensely fascinating yet they know they have to pay for their pleasure and grow quickly old in its service indeed it might almost be classed as a dangerous trade and if the pursuit of wealth is a relentless task not less so is its expenditure as a means of social success certainly mrs palmer worked quite as hard as her husband three days passed thus and it was now the afternoon of the first day of the revels in consequence the telegraph and telephone lines down to port washington were congested with messages for the greater part of the evening papers in new york had kept their first page open for them and nothing could be sent to press until it was known in what manner the first afternoon would be spent a good deal of course was ready to be set up for the list of the guests was public property and their dresses could be even if imagined only described but as long as the lagoon on the shore held its secret the page could not be made up it was known also that there would be a ball at mon repos in the evening and that the walls of the ballroom were to be coveredliterally covered as a paper covers a wallwith roses but for the secret of the lagoon the papers had to wait since it had been inviolably kept another event too hardly less momentous hung in the balance for only two days before the reigning prince of saxehochlaben a dissolute young man of twentyfive with a limp a past and no future had arrived like a thunderbolt in new york now to the frivolous and lightminded this does not seem a worldcurdling event but that very enlightened paper the new york gutter snipe was not frivolous and with extreme rapidity it set the red flame of war ablaze when it announced in huge headlines arrival of his royal transparency the prince of saxehochlaben mrs lewis s palmers revels doomed to dire failure fritz that was his name promises to favour mrs john z adelboden at newport the editor of the gutter snipe it may be remarked had once been a man of enormous wealth and had honoured mr palmer by singling him out as an adversary in a certain financial campaign mr palmer had dropped quite a number of little notes on to the floor over him and he was now poor but spiteful the effect of his announcement was magical for there was already war to the knife between mrs john z adelboden and mrs palmer the latter of whom had planted her standard at long island in direct defiance of newport and those headlines brought things to a crisis the news of his arrival was of course telegraphed to newport by the gutter snipe which did not telegraph it to mon repos consequently mrs john z adelboden knew it by midday the germanic having come in at whereas it went down to long island in the ordinary issue of the paper thus mrs john z adelboden had seven hours start that remarkable woman grasped the event in every aspect in about three minutes and a quarter she kneweveryone in america knows everythingthat timothy vandercrup the editor of the gutter snipe was her ally against mrs palmer she guessed also that the news would not reach mrs palmer for some hours so within five minutes of the arrival of the telegram she had called on newport to rally round her and sent out six hundred and fifty invitations for a ball two nights laterthat is to say on the evening of the first day of mrs palmers revels to each invitation she added on the bottom lefthand corner arrival of prince of saxehochlaben that was rather clever she did not actually commit herself to anything the notes were sent out by a perfect army of special messengers and the same evening all the answers arrived there were no refusals simultaneously she wrote a rather familiar little note to h r t whom she had met and flirted with in england the year before saying pray come up to our little cottage here we have a ball on monday night all newport will be there at mon repos the same evening the papers arrived as usual and mrs palmer as usual picked up the gutter snipe since it always contained the manoeuvres of the enemy and though at that moment her guests were in the middle of arriving she left amelie to do the honours instantly left the room went to her boudoir and read the paragraph through twice she also it may be remarked had met the prince before he had tried to flirt with amelie who had given him no encouragement whatever but he had tried to flirt with so many people who had given him a great deal that she thought he might easily have forgotten that she sat with the paper in her hands for some five minutes after she had read it through for the second time her nimble brain leaping like a squirrel from bough to bough of possible policies and she paused on each for a moment the new york evening startler for instance would put in whatever she chose to send it and she went so far as to seize a pen and write in capital letters mrs lewis s palmer refuses to receive prince fritz then she sat still again and thought that would not do newport would only laugh at herthe one thing she dreaded for to be laughed at drives the nails into the coffin of social failure then suddenly all the tension and activity of her leaping brain relaxed and she smiled to herself at the extreme simplicity of the plan she took one of her ordinary revel invitationcards out of her desk on which the word revels was printed at the bottom lefthand corner before this she inserted one word so that it read indiscriminate revels that was all she directed it to the princes address at the waldorf and went back to her guests now a matter so momentous is best described in the simplest possible manner and the emotions that for the next day or two swayed two factionsthat of newport and that of long islandmore bitterly and poignantly than the war of independence swayed the north and the south cannot be too simply treated the plain upshot then was as follows mrs john z adelbodens familiar little note to the prince arrived the same evening as mrs palmer wrote hers h r t accepted it in his own hand with some effusion mrs palmers card arrived next morning h r t read it in bed thought to himselfthe indiscriminate did it that will be more amusing he had forgotten altogether about his acceptance of the newport invitation and if he had remembered it he would not have done differently so after a light and wholesome breakfast of a peach washed down with some hock and soda he accepted mrs palmers invitation the news was all over newport that he was coming there before evening and the gutter snipe gave his portrait and biography both unrecognisable the news was all over long island that he was coming there by evening and the startler gave the portrait and biography of mrs lewis s palmer then followed two days of suspense and anxiety which can only be called sickening eventually the two announcements were laid before prince fritz by his trembling secretary who asked him what he meant to do he flew into a violent passion and exclaimed with a strong german accent olso i shall go where i choose and when i choose and how i choose and suspense continued to reign so the momentous afternoon arrived that was to bring the prince in mrs adelbodens private railwaycarriage to newport or in mrs palmers motor to mon repos and still no word of enlightenment had come which should pierce the thick clouds of doubt which hid the face of the future newport and long island were both en fete and at the railwaystation of the one and on the lawns of mon repos at the other the rival factions were awaiting the supreme moment in a tense unnatural calm mrs palmer alone was absent from her guests sitting at the telephone at length it sounded and with a quivering lip she unhooked the receiver then she gave one long sob of relief and rejoined her guests the motorcar had started and the prince was in it and the revels began at the supreme moment of his arrival when all attention was breathlessly concentrated on him a large signboard bearing the mystic inscription to the pearl fishery had been erected at the head of the staircase leading down to the lagoon and with charming directness the prince pointed to it and said what does that mean mrs adelbodeni should say mrs palmer and mrs palmer replied i guess sir well go and see the expectant crowd followed them it was felt that the secret on which so much fruitless curiosity had been wasted was about to be revealed but like a good secret it baffled conjecture up till the very last moment the crowd screamed and chattered through the woods following their illustrious leader and at last emerged on to the beach there an immense sort of bathing establishment had been erected containing hundreds of little cabinets there were two wingsone for men one for womenand in each cabinet for women was a blue serge skirt and sandals a leather pouch and a small fishingnet in each cabinet for men was the same apparatus minus the skirt the lagoon itself smelt strongly of rosewater for thousands of gallons had just been emptied into it and the surface was covered with floating tables laden with refreshments and large artificial waterlilies and scattered over the bottom of the lagoonscattered too with a liberal handwere hundreds of pearl oysters there was no time wasted as soon as prince fritz grasped the situation and it had been made clear to him that he might keep any pearls he found he rushed madly to the nearest cabin rolled his trousers up to the knee put the sandals on his rather large ungainly feet and plunged into the rosewatered lagoon nor were the rest slow to follow his example and in five minutes it was a perfect mob of sergeskirted women and barelegged men mr palmer himself did not join in the wading for in addition to a slight cold wading was bad for his chronic indigestion but he seized a net and puddled about with it from the shore shrieks of ecstasy greeted the finding of the pearls cries of dismay arose if the shell was found to contain nothing faster and more furious grew the efforts of all to secure them for a time the floating refreshmenttables attracted not the smallest attention in particular the prince was entranced and not waiting to open the shells where the oyster was still alive most however had been killed by the rosewater or the journey and gaped open he stowed them away in his pockets in order to examine them afterwardsnot waste the precious moments when so many were in competition with him and his raucous cries of ach himmel there is a peauty resounded like a bass through the shrill din he paid no attention whatever to the throng round him for the present he was intent on the entertainment and paused once only to empty a bottle of munich beer which had been especially provided for him on a table with a scarlet tablecloth for the day was hot and the exertions of grubbing in the sand quite severe bertie keynes had not entered the water with the first wild scramble but had stood on the bank a few minutes divided between amazement and helpless giggling as he observed mrs cyrus f bimm a stout middleaged woman lately widowed plunge in without even pausing to take her stockings off and fall flat on her face but though soaked she was utterly undismayed and grasping her net wasted no time in idle laments or in changing her clothes her hat was naturally black and streams of dye poured down her face and neck her dress was black too and as wet as her hat but then the indescribable frolic of the thingthere is no other word for itseized him and just as amelie looking like a nymph of grecian waterways hurried past him radiant slimlimbed an embodiment of joy and beckoned to him he delayed no longer but joined the rest but oh if judy could see me now he said to himself as he took off his socks for an hour or more the pearlhunting went on and every oyster had been fished up and the whole lagoon churned into mud long before the prince could be persuaded to leave it twice he made a false start and came out of the water only to seize his net again and hurry back on the chance of finding another his pockets bulging with the shells he had not yet opened all the time the telegraph was whirring and clicking the news of the huge success of mrs palmers first afternoon of revels and the ecstasies of the prince all over the country and mrs john z adelboden like marius sat and wept among the ruins of newport bilton and mrs emsworth had driven down together in a motor from new york but the latter had to get back in time to act that evening to return late on saturday night stop over sunday and act at mon repos on sunday evening bilton on the other hand had taken a rare holiday and was not returning to town till the next week constitutionally he disliked a holiday this one however he had less objection to since there was a definite aim he wished to accomplish during it he was a man to be described as a person of appetites rather than of emotions and his appetites partook of the nature of the rest of him they were keen definite and orderlynot clamorous or brutal in the least degree but hard and clearcut he was supposed not many years ago to have proposed by telegram to the lady who subsequently became mrs john z adelboden who had replied by the same medium much regret am otherwise engaged this had tickled bilton tremendously and he had the telegram framed and put up in his flat during the past summer mrs massington had seen a good deal of him in london and though she had frankly conceded that according anyhow to charlie brancepeths notions he was a cad there was a great deal about him she liked immensely just as she liked the clearness of line absence of fluff in a room so she likedmore than liked precision of mind in a person he was quick definite and reasonable in the sense that he acted and could always be counted on to act strictly in accordance with conclusions at which he had arrived and which would be found to be based on sound reasoning she liked also his spare businesslike habit of body his scrupulous tidiness of attire his quick firm movements his extreme efficiency of person underlying this and but dimly present to her consciousness was the fact that he so much resembled in face and frame charlie brancepeth towards whom she had always felt a good deal of affectionwhose devotion to her touched though at times it irritated her had things been different she would have married him but since matrimonially he was impossible she did not in the least propose to practise celibacy as she had told judy she believed she was incapable of what many other people would call love but she was a great believer in happiness and knew that she had a fine appetite for it many things might contribute to it but love was by no means an essential constituent and more and more especially since her arrival in america she liked the quality of mind which may be broadly called sensibleness americansexcept when they were revellingseemed to her to have a great deal of it the pearlfishing had been succeeded by bridge bridge by dinner and dinner by a ball in the room entirely papered with roses sensationallyfrom the point of view that is of costit was a great success but practically the scent was so overpowering that it was impossible to dance there for more than a few minutes at a time without so to speak coming up to breathe consequently there was a good deal of sittingout done and bilton firmly and collectedly managed to spend a large part of the evening with sybil massington i should so like to know what you really think of us all he said on one of these occasions in his quiet englishsounding voice i adore you said she collectively i mean ah that spoils it all said he we all want to be adored individually there are too many of you for me to do that she said i should have to cut my heart up into so many little bits wherever i gotheres a song about iti leave my heart behind me i always do that people seem to me very nice you are taking the rest of the stuffing out remarked he in a slightly injured voice she laughed well i find you all charming she said again will that do i suppose it will have to and your friend lord keynes ah he finds one person so charming that i dont think he thinks much about the rest she said look there they are bilton did not look he had already seen them he usually saw things first do you think he will marry her he asked yes certainly i hope so if he marries at all he must marry money and nature clearly designed miss palmer to be a peeress in fact the match was made in heaven i hope it will be ratified on earth she said why are you cynical about it i am never cynical what makes you think that well simple direct it comes to the same thing to tell the truth is often the most cynical thing you can do not if it is a pleasant truth and it will be very pleasant to miss palmer to be an english peeress and as you said yourself it is only possible for lord keynes to marry money and he is fortunate in his moneybag he added she frowned a little there was something in this speech which with all her admiration for his countrymen struck her as both characteristic and disagreeable he saw it ah that offends you he said quickly i apologize i wish you would teach me better you know there is a something an inherent coarseness about us which i have seen get ever so slightly on to your nerves fifty times a day she laughed teach you she said i am learning far too much myself you learning what for instance not to be finicking not to be slack and dawdling to go ahead and do something if a person of my nature was in mr palmers place do you suppose i should go on working as he does i would never touch a business question again he shook his head believe me you would you would not be able to help it lewis palmer cant stop his wife cant stop i cant stop in my small way but you at present have the power of stopping it is the most exquisite thing in the world to us to me i assure you it is like a cool breeze on a hot day to see you leisurely english people in england you have a leisured class we have none our wealthy class is the least leisured of all if you adore us as you say grant us the privilege of seeing you like that there was something in this speech that rather touched hersomething also that certainly pleased her and that was the tone of honest deference in which he spoke in fact you want to be english she said laughing it off and i want to be american and she looked at him smiling but he did not smile at all only again his brown eyes grew hot and black that too pleased her then suddenly she felt vaguely frightened she had not definitely intended to give him his chance now and she did not wish him to take it so she rose take me back she said take me into a crowd of your people i want to learn a little more chapter viii the revels ended on saturday on which day the wonderstricken guests for the most part dispersed their faces probably shining like moses at this social revelation and went back to their humble homes the success of them had been gigantic nobody except newport talked about anything else for days and to find news of international importance in the papers was almost impossible for everything else except the revels was tucked away into odd corners newport alone maintained an icy silence but disaffection was already at work there and those who were only struggling on the fringe of newport society said openly that they would go to long island next year since there really seemed to be some gaiety there whereas newport was like a wet sunday afternoon mrs palmers two english guests however stopped on so also did bilton and mrs emsworth having decided not to go to mass on sunday morning was coming down with the larger part of her company on saturday night after her performance in new york sunday however was going to be a quiet day with the exception that there was a large dinnerparty in the evening and a play in the theatre afterwards pingpong armstrong also remained for he was the recognised tame cat without claws about the house mrs palmer sometimes secretly wished in her full consciousness of innocence that people would talk just a little about him and her but nobody ever did even the gutter snipe never alluded to his constant presence in the house but this was probably due to the fact that the editorwho knew a good deal about the meaner side of human natureguessed that it would have pleased mrs palmer for it is a most extraordinary though common phenomenon to find that perfectly virtuous and upright people often like to be thought just a little wicked whereas bad people are totally indifferent for the most part as to whether anyone thinks them good or not during the two or three days that had elapsed since bilton and mrs massington had their talk together his conduct had been immensely pleasing to her he had taken the hint she had given him like a gentleman and had not allowed himself to drift into intimate conversation with her until she gave him the signal he had been diplomatic and delicateabove all he had been intelligent not blundering and she could not help contrasting him much to his advantage with the average englishman who either insists on talking the thing out or else looks sulky and wears a woebegone aspect but bilton had done neither he had remained brisk not brusque and had resisted apparently without effort any attempt to bring her to the point while remaining himself absolutely normal in the meantime during the selfimposed pause in her own affairs mrs massington watched with extreme satisfaction the development of that mission which had brought bertie keynes to america affairs for him certainly appeared to be running very smooth she almost wished for some slight contretemps to take place in order to put things on the proper proverbial footing in other words amelie and bertie had made great friends and owing to the extraordinary freedom which eligible young folk are given in america with a view to letting them improve their acquaintance they had got under way with much rapidity the house being full they had many opportunities for finding the isolation which exists in crowds and took advantage of it mr palmer however with a strong sense of paternal duty thought it well not to let the matter go too far without satisfying himself that he was justified in letting it go to all lengths with this in his mind he went to his wifes rooms on sunday morning to have a quiet talk as was his custom pleased with your party he asked amiably lewis im just sick with satisfaction she said long island i tell you is made and newport will crumble into the sea but what am i to do next year why i believe that if at this moment i built a house on sandy hook i could make it fashionable that would be very convenient said he we could flag the liners and save half a day im glad you are satisfied now what do you get by it all same as what you get when youve made a million dollars said mrs palmer with some perspicacity you dont want them you dont know youve got them but you like getting them his bright gray eyes gleamed suddenly and he looked at her approvingly i guess thats true he said i guess youve hit the nail on the head as you do every time weve got to get you and i and when weve got weve got to get again its the getting we go for his eyes wandered round the room a moment and he went to a cabinet of bricabrac that stood between the windows where did you get that tanagra figure from he asked its a forgery and he took it up and threw it into the grate where it smashed to atoms well i suppose you know said mrs palmer calmly bilton sold it me lewis laughed spoiled his market he remarked that mans very clever but he lackshe lacks length of vision perhaps he didnt know it was a forgery said mrs palmer charitably thats worse give him the credit of knowing mrs palmer put down the paper she was reading lewis you didnt come here just to break my things she said what is it lord keynes what do you know of him he asked with his usual directness had mrs palmer been in the company of other people she would have executed her famous scream because she was amused but she never wasted it and it would have been quite wasted on her husband hes charming she said hes in excellent style hes in the set in london and he wants a wife with a competency thats why i brought him here but what does he do asked her husband does he just exist yes i guess he exists men do exist in england here they dont they get some exist here pingpong does and whos pingpong she asked why armstrong amelie thought of it he is a pingpong you know this time mrs palmer gave the scream for she was so much amused as to forget the absence of an audience well im sure if amelie isnt bright she said but youre pretty far out lewis if you think that lord keynes is a pingpong if he was an american and did nothing he would be but men do nothing in england without being englands a pingpong i think sometimes remarked lewis she just plays about however were not discussing that now i see you mean business with lord keynes youll run it through on your own lines i suppose but remember he paused a moment i guess its rather difficult for one to say it he said but its just this when a girl marries a man if she doesnt hit it off the best thing she can do is to make believe she does but i doubt if amelie can make believe worth a cent well she just adores him said mrs palmer thats good as far as it goes it goes just about to the end of the world said she mr palmer considered this the end of the world occurs sooner than you think sometimes he said ill get you a genuine tanagra if you like he added and ill guy bilton about the other ill pretend he thought it was genuine thatll make him tender though mrs palmer had no objection to exaggeration in a good cause she had not in the least been guilty of it when she said that amelie adored bertie keynes most girls have daydreams of some kind and amelie with the vividness that characterized her had conjured up before now with some completeness her own complement unless a woman is celibate by nature a thing happily rare she is frequently conscious of the empty place in herself which it is her duty and her constant though often unconscious quest to find the tenant for and amelie was not in the least of a celibate nature her warm blood beat generously and the love of her nature that should one day pour itself on one at present overflowed in runnels of tenderness for all living things the sprouts of the springing daisies were dear to herdogs horses even the wild riot of the revels was worthy of her affectionate interest but the rather unreasonable attention she bestowed on these numberless objects of affection was only the overflow from the cistern one day it would be all given in full flood its waters would bathe one who had chosen her and whom her heart chose this morning she was riding through the woods with bertie keynes the charmingly sensible laws of american etiquette making it possible for her to ride with anyone she wished alone and unattended they had just pulled up from a gallop through the flowering wood paths and the two horses musclestretched and quiet were willing to walk unfrettingly side by side oh it all smells good it smells very good she said and this morning somehowi suppose its after mammas fetei like the fresh green outofdoors more than ever i think we live altogether too much indoors in america but the fetes were entirely out of doors said bertie yes but the pearlparty was just the most indoor thing i ever saw said she certainly it was out of doors but all the time i wanted somebody to open the windows let in a breatha breath ofand she paused for a word i know what you mean he said did you feel it too i want to know in that case i did he looked at her a moment but all the time you were my breath of outofdoors he said amelie was not fool enough to take this as a compliment or to simper acknowledgments as he spoke he wondered how she would take it hoped she would look at him anyhow then hoped she would not pingpong is indoors enough she said do tell me what you think of him i dont think of him said bertie if i sat down to think of him i should instantly begin without meaning to to think about something else do you loathe him she asked good heavens no butbut there are people like husks just husks she considered this husky pingpong she said half to herself poor husky pingpong do you grow them in england yes heaps they grow in london they are always at every party and they know everybody and make themselves immensely agreeable it is all they do and you see them in the back seats of motorcars she looked at him with some mischief in her eyes and what do you do she asked no more than they anyone is at liberty to call one a pingpong only im not i know i was wondering what the difference was according to your description there is none i suppose but dont confuse me with pingpongs she laughed lord keynes you are just adorable she said ill race you to the end of the avenue adoring me all the time unless you win she said then i will lose on purpose that will be mean i never adore meanness are you ready and her beautiful horse gathered his legs up under him and whirled her down the grassy ride bertie got not so good a start and rode the gauntlet of the flying turf scattered by his heels till a bend of the path favouring him he drew nearly abreast pursuing her through sunshine and the flecked shadows on the grass he had seen her day after day in the revels night after night at ball or concert yet never had her beauty seemed to him so compelling as it did now as swaying the rein with dainty fingertip her body moving utterly in harmony with the grand swing of her horses stride she turned her smiling face to him all ecstasy at the exhilaration of the gallop all wideeyed smile of consternation at the decreasing lead which she had got at the start and all at once for the first time his blood was kindled he had admired her form as one may admire a perfect piece of sculptured grace he had admired her splendid vitality her charming companionship her intense joie de vivre but now all the separate isolated admirations were fused and glowed flamelike suddenly she laughed aloud as he had nearly caught her up ride ride she cried in a sudden burst of intimate upwelling joy that came from she knew not where you will win apollo pursued daphne in the vale of tempe and in the vales of long island bertie keynes rode hard after amelie and she encouraged him to win she even drew rein a shadejust a shadethough she had wanted to win so much all the afternoon motorcars bicycles carts tandems brakes were arriving for though it was a quiet sunday mrs palmer it was wellknown liked to see a few friends about teatime who usually stopped for dinner and before evening it was as if the revels were extended a day longer the weather was extremely hot and in consequence dinner was served in the great marquee on the terrace among others mrs emsworth had come with those of her company who were to act that night in the theatre the petit salete to be produced had never been presented on any stage before the lordchamberlain of england with a fatherly regard for the morals of the nation entrusted to him having deemed that it was too sale and as a matter of fact mrs emsworth rather embraced this opportunity of playing it before a private audience with a view to seeing whether her public in new york with their strange mixture of cynical indifference to anything but money and the even stranger survival of the puritan spirit which crops up every now and then as some rare border plant will crop up among the weeds and grasses of a long overgrown garden would be likely to swallow it she herself was a little nervous of presenting it there bilton on the other hand who might be supposed to know the taste of the patrons for whom he catered so successfully thought it would be an immense success after all paris loved it he said as he had a few words with her when they went up to dress for dinner and what is bad enough for paris is good enough for new york you may take my word for it that what paris swallows america will gobble you mean they are moremore emancipated here not at all but that they are eager to accept anything that has been a success in london or paris why i produced dramdrinking here dead failure i took it to london where it ran well and brought it back here tremendous success we americans i mean are entirely devoid of artistic taste but we give our decided approbation to what other people say is artistic which for your purpose and mine is the same thing left to ourselves we like david harum i produce hamlet here next week the house is full for the next month but alter the name and say it is by a new author and it wont run a week the papers to begin with would all damn it but the critics do you mean they dont know hamlet there are no critics and they dont know anything they are violent ignoramuses who write for unreadable papers then why do you ever consider them because they are not critics and because in new york everyone reads the unreadable this is my roomyou are next door i think i shant come to dinner she said i am rather tired by the way is that large beautiful girl mrs palmers daughter probably why will she be at the play tonight probably why mrs emsworth frowned it is not fit she said bilton raised his eyebrows this was indeed a woman of infinite variety you cannot alter your play for fear she will be there he said no i suppose not i say what devils we are the play was an enormous success and mrs emsworths personality seemed to lift it out of the regions of the equivocal the part that of a woman who represented the triumph of mind over morals fitted her like a glove and it was as impossible to be shocked as it is when a child uses a coarse or profane expression her impropriety was no more improper than is the natural instinct of a bird or animal improper by a supreme effort of nature rather than art she seemed to roll up like an undecipherable manuscript the whole moral code and say now lets begin again her gaiety covered her sins more than that it transformed them into something so sunlit that the shadows vanished even as we laugh at fricka when she inveighs against siegmund and sieglinde feeling that condemnation is impossible because praise or blame is uncalled for and irrelevant so the ethical question indeed there was no question of whether the person whom mrs emsworth represented behaved quite like a lady never occurred to anyone her vitality dominated the situation of all her audience there was none so utterly surprised at the performance as bilton he knew her fairly well but he had never seen in her half so clearly the triumph of temperament knowing her as he did he knew it was not art it was only an effort unique and unsurpassable to be herself again and again he longed to be a playwright he could write her he felt could he write at all a part that would be she for never before had she so revealed herself a sunlit pagan and as the play went on his wonder increased she was admirable then mrs massington who sat next him laughed at something he had not seen and for the moment he was vexed to have been called down from the stage to a woman less vivid for his sensualism was of a rather high order late that night after the supper that followed the entertainment he went upstairs in mon repos there was no barbaric quenching of electric light at puritanical hours no stranding of belated guests in strange passages and he walked up from the smokingroom with his hands in his pockets unimpeded by any guttering bedroom candle the evening had been a triumph for dorothyin the mercantile way it had been as great a triumph for him for the cachet of success at mrs palmers would certainly float the play in new york the gutter snipe he reflected would have at least a column of virulent abuse since it had been performed at mon repos so much the better he would have a whole procession of sandwich men london fashion parading fifth avenue every alternate one bearing the most infamous extracts from that paper to use abuse as a means of advertisement was a new idea it interested him certainly dorothy had been marvellous she was a witch no one knew all her incantations and he paused at his bedroom door she had gone upstairs only five minutes before him since the performance she had been queen bee to the whole party he himself had not had a word with her surely even puritanical long island would not be shocked if he just went to her even now for a minute and congratulated her besides puritanical long island would never know so he tapped softly and entered after the manner of a man whose tap merely means i am coming the room was brilliantly lit mrs emsworth was standing by the bed by her having looked in for a gotobed chat was sybil massington chapter ix mrs emsworth had a rehearsal early next morning at new york and in consequence she had to leave by the stock exchange train at nine while most of the inhabitants of mon repos were still reposing she herself was down and out before anyone had appeared for she had slept but badly and had awoke definitely and irrevocably soon after six sleeping as her custom was with blinds up and curtains undrawn the glory of the morning quickly weaned her from her bed and by soon after seven she was strolling about outside in the perfection of an early september hour there had been a little thunder during the night and betwixt waking and sleeping she had heard somewhat heavy rain sluicing on to the shrubberies and thirsty grass and now when she went out the moisture was lying like unthreaded diamonds in the sun and like a carpet of pearls in the shade many gardeners were already at work some on the grass and flowerbeds others bringing up fruit from the greenhouses and all looked with wideeyed yokel amazement at the famous actress as she walked up and down one of them had brought his small child a boy of about six years old with him and the little lad with a bunch of michaelmas daisies in his cap very gravely pushed at one handle of his fathers wheelbarrow now children and mrs emsworth were mutually irresistible and the barrow was stopped and the father stood by in a sort of proud admiring sheepishness while mrs emsworth made herself fascinating she had a story to tell about those particular flowers the child had in his hat the fairies had made them during the night one had brought the white silk out of which they were cut another had brought oilpaints to colour them a third had brought a wateringpot with a rose to sprinkle them but the bad fairy had seen them and had come on her broomstick surrounded by an army of flying toads and spiders and slugs to destroy the flowers and a toad had just begun to eat the top of one of the flowers when the sun said pop im coming and before the bad fairy could get under shelter it had shone on her so that she instantly curled up like a burnt feather and died with a pain so awful that stomachache was nothing to it this was so absorbing both to the narrator and the audience that neither had observed that someone else was listening and as the boy broke out into childish laughter crying that was nice at the awful fate of the wicked fairy mrs emsworth looked behind her half hearing a sudden rustle and saw amelie standing there also absorbed she instantly sat down on the other handle of the barrow yes tommy that was nice she echoed and do you think the lady will tell us another story ask her the lady was so kind as to oblige them again this time it was about a real live person who was always very good in the morning and sat down and did her work as she should with the good fairy sitting beside her but later on the good fairy would sometimes go to sleep and as soon as she was asleep all the bad fairies who had not curled up like burnt feathers came in and one of them made her eat peas with her knife and another made her spill her breadandmilk down her new dress and another made her lose her temper and another made her make mud pies in the middle of her nice room so that it had to be swept again and she was very unhappy about this and used to put pins in the good fairys seat to prevent her going to sleep and give her strong coffee to drink for the same purpose but it was all no good until one day she noticed that as long as a child was with her the good fairy kept awake so the poor lady set to work again and tried to see a child every day because even if she talked to a child for a little in the morning and especially if it gave her a kiss the good fairy was much less sleepy tommys eyes grew wide oh i do love you he said and hoisted himself with his dirty boots into her lap then smitten with a childs sudden shyness he clambered down again and the wheelbarrow went on its way the two others strolled on in silence for a moment over the grass amelie with a strange lump in her throat then she put her arm round mrs emsworths waist goodmorning she said quietly and they kissed i think i love you too she said i came out to tell you that mrs emsworth kissed her again that is nice too she said but what makes you i dont know i think it was seeing you in that horrid play last night you were like a sunbeam inin a cesspool but why do that sort of thing mrs emsworth shrugged her shoulders because people are beasts my dear she saidbecause they like that sort of thing and one has to live amelie thought a moment with her face growing grave oh i am sorry i am sorry she said a sudden impatience and ungovernable irritation filled dorothy she felt as if she was being hauled back to her ordinary life when she was so happy in the sweetness of the early morning hour why did this stupid gawky girl come and speak to her like this but with an effort at selfcontrol stronger than she usually bothered herself to make she mastered it oh never mind never mind she said walk with me a little further and let me look at you because you are beautiful and the trees because they are beautiful and the grass and the sky what a heavenly moment do not let us waste it look the lawns are empty where yesterday they were full with all sorts of silly and wicked people is that an insult to your mothers guests i think it is anyhow i was one of the silly wicked people but now i am not silly or wicked i am very good and very innocent and i want to take everything into my arms and stroke it my god what a beautiful world i am so glad i did not die in the night amelie laughed this mood found in her a ready response yes yes she cried go on i know what you mean you want to be rid of all else to be just a consciousness in the world i have felt that what does it say dorothy shook her head it never says the same thing for five minutes she said just now you and i feel that if we sat here for a quarter of an hour we should begin to talk chiffon if we sat here longer we might talk scandal only i think these moments are given us as a sort of refreshment god washes our faces every now and then and we proceed to soil them instantly she turned to her companion eagerly dont soil yours she said dont let others soil it it grows on you it is like using rouge and she broke off suddenly there was silence a moment then amelie said look here is tommy coming back from the house mrs emsworth rose let us go in she said it is time for me to have breakfast as i am going by the early train but remember that i was good for ten minutesif and her voice quavered if people as they are sure to do tell you things they passed tommy who paused as they got near mrs emsworth seemed not to notice him then she looked back dear little chap she said and retracing her steps kissed him again it must be allowed that by the time they got to the station there was nothing of the earlymorning mrs emsworth left about her on the platform bilton approached her with rather an anxious face i particularly want to speak to you dorothy he said in a low voice you can help me she looked at him with extremely vivid virulence oh go away you beast she said i can help you you say no doubt i can but i wont go away bilton had the sense to see that he needed help for there had been a very awkward moment when he went into mrs emsworths room the night before he himself was very good at acting quickly in any emergency he had foreseen but this one was utterly unforeseen and had found him helplessly unprepared had he had even a moments preparation he felt sure that he could have said something which would anyhow have been palliative but since the thing was done he did not trouble his head about what the palliative would have been for he had come inhis knock unheardand found the two ladies together upon which dorothy laughed mrs massington turned pink and he retreated there was the situation and the most unpromising feature of it was that dorothy had laughed with all his quickness he could see no way out it was clearly impossible for him to open the subject again to mrs massington it was equally obvious that she would put a construction on his presence the only person who could conceivably help him was dorothy and now she had called him a beast but apparently during the journey to new york she relented for as they boarded the mangylooking ferryboat that conveyed them across the river she threw a word to him over her shoulder i shall be in at lunch she said you can come if you like he did not like that either though it was better than nothing for he felt that she had in a sense the whiphand of him and knew it and bilton was not accustomed to let anybody have the whiphand of him mrs emsworth always took her rehearsals herself she had a stagemanager it is true who sat meekly in the wings and whom she contradicted from time to time his office being to be contradicted and to write down stage directions which she gave him occasionally bilton looked in for an hour or two him she contradicted also at the time but usually incorporated his suggestions afterwards her author if it was a new play was also in attendance in the stalls his office was to cut lines out or put lines in though perhaps she could not act she certainly had a strong sense of drama that was why she had laughed at biltons entrance the night before for the situation struck her as admirably constructed she had seen with a womans sixth sense as correctly and minutely as in a photograph on what footing he and mrs massington were and though she was not in the slightest degree in love with the manor indeed ever had beenyet she looked on him as her possession and while she did not want him she distinctly did not wish him to change hands jealousy of the ordinary green variety had something to do with it a shrewd eye to business the knowledge of how much better her career went if the great impresario was her devoted admirer had about as much only if her devoted admirer was to become the confirmed settled and sealedup admirer of someone else she did not propose to be the candle at which the sealing was done to be catspaw to an act of treason against herself was a feat of altruism of which she was hopelessly incapable then finally in this jumble of feelings which had resulted in her calling bilton a beast there was something neither sordid nor selfishnamely the determination distinct and honest that mrs massington a woman whom she both liked and respected should not at any rate by any auxiliary help of hers be deceived as to what bilton really was she herself no doubt with the aid of liquid eyes and a mouth so beautiful that it looked as if it must be made for the utterance of perfect verity could persuade mrs massington that she and bilton had never been in intimate relations and assure her even to conviction that his slightly informal visit last night was onlyas was indeed truea visit for the utterance of a few words of congratulation on her success but she did not intendfrom motives good bad and indifferent all mixedto do this for him only into the composition of this intention the good and honest and fine motive entered it was not wonderful that this potaufeu of feeling amounting to positive agitation did not tend towards the comfort of her company at the rehearsal nor indeed on the part of the manageress toward the calm attitude of the thoughtful critic in consequence before the rehearsal was an hour oldit was the first without books rehearsal the second leading lady was next door to tears the leading gentleman in sulks the author in despair and mrs emsworth in a mood of dangerous suavity that made the aspiring actors heartsick miss dayrell she was saying would you mind not turning your back completely on the audience when you speak those lines mr yatesthis was the leading gentleman i am so sorry to interrupt your conversation but my throat is rather sore this morning and i cannot hear myself speak if you talk so loud to your friends yes i think as you are not on the stage just now it would be better if you left it yes miss dayrell you see these are perhaps the most important lines in the play which you have to speak and the audience will have a better chance of understanding it if you let them hear what mr farquar has given you to say mr farquar i am afraid the second act is about twice as long as it ought to be i have cut some of itat least with your approval i propose to cut some of it mr farquar sighed heavily in the stalls he had spent the greater part of the last three nights in writing more of the second act because it was not long enough thank you continued mrs emsworth interpreting the sigh as silence you will see my alterations when we get to them would you kindly begin miss dayrell at if i had a pitchfork suddenly her voice changed to a wheedling tenderness and if my own teddy roosevelt hasnt come down of his own delicious accord to see his aunt in her pretty theatre teddy the world is very evil and my mother bids me bind my hair i beg your pardon ladies and gentlemen but i had to say a word to popsie tootsicums now dear miss dayrell lets begin again you enter excellent you turn yes thats exactly what i want now a murmur of relief went round and the faded actors and actresses raised their drooped heads as when a shower has passed over a droughtdried garden and teddy r the angel in disguise sat sparsely down in the middle of the stage and smiled on the spectacle of his beneficent work but because the happy appearance of teddy roosevelt had made le beau temps for the members of mrs emsworths company it did not at all follow that bilton when he came to lunch would find the same sunshine awaiting him even as there is no guarantee that because at twelve oclock on an april day pellucid tranquillity flooded the earth there will not be a smart hailstorm an hour afterwards on the contrary it was safe to bet that whatever mood mrs emsworth was in she would be in a different one before long the springday temperament of hers was in fact the only thing to be reckoned on consequently since bilton had not witnessed the varied phases exhibited at the theatre he hoped somehow sanguinely that she would not be in a temper that so roundly labelled him beast at port washington station she seemed to have forgotten he was coming to lunchas a matter of fact she had and welcomed him charmingly dear man she said how nice of you to look in im nearly dead with fatigue lets have lunch at once harold ive acted every part in telegrams through from beginning to end this morning those people are so hardworking but they are so stupid in fact i know every part but my own that i have promised them to be word perfect in by five oclock this afternoon you dont rehearse again this afternoon asked he oh yes i do three hours more this afternoon then just time for dinner then theatre again till halfpast eleven then supper at the waldorf tomorrow rehearsal all morning matinee evening performance every interval filled up with reporters and milliners and limelight people oh well thank god we shall all soon be dead time to rest then and time to lunch now dont overdo it dolly said he as they sat down overdo it my dear boy it is rather late in the day to recommend me not to overdo it besides we women and in special this woman are so much stronger than men my company follow me through hours of rehearsal faint yet pursuing they drop asleep and i wake them with a gentle touch on their shoulders and they say is it morning yet and i say kindly wake up for ten minutes and go through this scene dear and then you shall go to sleep again then at the end when i say that is all for tonight ladies and gentlemen they all hurry away in desperate fear lest i should ask them to supper il faut lutter pour lart as daudet says im so glad im not a prig harold who thinks about the exigencies of the artistic temperament im not an artist at all people come to see me act because im a rather goodlooking b in rollicking good spirits what delicious cantaloupe i like my food all the same i wish you would take more care of yourself said he fostering her present temper with a light and he hoped skilful hand im sure you do too much and some day you will break down you are spending more than your income of nervous energy you are living on the capital just what i mean to do like mr carnegie i think it would be a disgrace to die with an ounce of nervous force left in one what use is it when one is dead i am living on the capital i intend to spend it all i shall die sooner no doubtbut oh harold what an awful old person i should be at sixty if i proposed which i do not to live as long look at the old women who have spent their youth as i have done rouge on their raddled cheeks clinging to life mortally afraid of dying trying to get a few more successes with one bleary eye anxiously fixed on some back door into heaven the other roaming round to see if they cant have another little flirtation before they die no let me die at the height of my success i dont want to stumble downhill into my grave i want to find it on the mountaintop and i shall lie down in it quite content for i have had a good time and ask no further questions and harold plant a great crimson rambler and a vine like omar and a few daffodils and some michaelmas daisies on my grave so that i shall flower all the year round and come if you like once a year to it and think over any occasion when i have pleased or amused you and say to yourself if you can she was rather a good sort then go away to the woman who happens at the time tooh i forgot weve got to have a talk and ive been doing all the talking have you finished lunch come into the next room the april day was behaving quite characteristically it had got cold and cloudy and a bitter wind blew suddenly mentally he shivered and followed her she had thrown herself down on the big louis xv couch teddy roosevelt was having his dinner there was no mitigation within the horizon about sybil massington she said and shut her mouth again as if it worked on a steel spring bilton lit his cigar and took his time wishing to appear not nervous ah yes he said i remember that line is no good remarked dorothy critically you must get more sincerity into it or drop it he dropped it and sat down ive been wanting to tell you for some time dorothy he said that i hope to marry mrs massington i should have done so before only its an awkward thing to say there is always a slight crudeness in that situation said she men always try to explain away what cant be explained at all so cut it short i know you must say a few words but let them be few well its just this said he weve been great friends weve got along excellently you have always been charming to me and i hope i havent treated you badly oh no firstclass time said she the gamin coming to the surface well now i want to marry he said and i come to you for your help if you had been in my position i would have helped you thanks well you know it was a devilish awkward moment last night and you made it worse you laughed you shouldnt have done that dorothys face relaxed i couldnt help it she said dramatically it was perfect and so funny harold if you could have seen your own face of blank amazement i really believe you would have laughed too he frowned a pal ought to help a man out he said im sure you went out pretty quick she interpolated oh dont peashoot me he said now a word from you will help me i cant offer any explanation to mrs massington simply because if i tried she would be convinced there is something to explain you can a half word from you will do it represent me as your business managervery businesswith an urgent question to ask and in my stupid unconventional american way it not occurring to me that there was any impropriety and my laugh how shall i explain that because it did occur to you what construction mrs massington would put on it because my face of horror when i saw what i had done was so funny you said so yourself dorothy paused in other words said she slowly i am to tell mrs massington either directly or by implication that you and i are you and i not wethatjust that quite so he said and very neatly put she sat up i refuse she said why for what possible reason for a reason you couldnt appreciate let me try i cant explain it even but the outline is this i respect and like sybil massington therefore i will not assist you to marry her it is not my business to open her eyesyou may marry her if you canbut neither is it my business to close them even if you wished it i would not marry you myself because i dont think you would be awell a satisfactory husband so i will not help you biltons face was clearly given him to conceal his thoughts on this occasion it expressed nothing whatever though he thought a good deal you want to stand in my light then he said not at all only i wont hold the candle for you you refuse to tell the truth to mrs massington you refuse to tell her what you knownamely that i came to your room last night merely to congratulate you on your success i refuse to tell her a fagend of the truth like thata truth that is designed to deceive his eye wandered round the room before he replied and in its course fell on the grate today also there was a torn letter lying in it a slight tinge of colour came into his face i cant understand you he said as far as i know you on the whole wish me well you have assured me that you would not marry me yourself what do you want then do you want to be paid for doing it if you are not unreasonable in your demands i will meet them she got up her eyes blazing that is enough she said not another word harold or i assure you i will throw the heaviest and hardest thing i can lift at you i mean it a rather ugly light came into his eyesa stale unwholesome sort of glow pray dont he said we will leave the subject i think you are behaving most ungenerouslythat is all i should like a few words with you about your dresses in telegrams i will wait till you are ready to discuss them with me take a cigarette she looked at him a moment in silence in spite of herself she could not help feeling the infernal mastery he had over her as always the more violent she became the more he seemed steeped in a calm compound of indifference and almost boredom and since it is obviously more exhausting to continue violent than to continue calm it followed that she had to compose herself thus changing first while he merely remained unmoved it had happened often before and it happened now what is it you want me to say to mrs massington she asked at length pray do not let us discuss it you might throw something at me said he smiling inwardly dont you see my point she asked besides a word from me would do no good she saw the terms we were on it was obvious blatant then no harm would be done by your saying a word she would not be deceived no but she would think i tried to deceive her would you mind that he asked very much i like her bilton knew well the value of the waiting game in an argument the futility of trying to persuade a woman to do something especially if she shows the least sign of persuading herself so he said nothing whatever since her reopening the subject pointed to an already existing indecision but her final answer when it came was not in the least what he expected and i refuse finally to help you she said if you wish i will discuss the dresses bilton would never have made himself so successful a career as he had had he not possessed to a very high degree the power of concentrating his mind on one thing to the complete exclusion of other preoccupations and for the next halfhour no cloud of what had happened crossed in his mind the very clear sky of the new plays prospects he was able to give his whole and complete attention to it until between them they had settled what he desired to settle then since like all other days it was a busy day with him he rose goodbye dorothy he said and dont overdo it once again she wavered and do you forgive me she asked not in the least but i dont imagine you care but i do care he drew on his gloves with great precision i beg your pardon if you really cared you would do as i ask he said goodbye i shall be at the theatre this evening she let him go without further words and in spite of the heat he walked briskly down fifth avenue he was not a forgiving man and though he would not put himself out to revenge himself on anyone since he had more lucrative ways of employing his time and energies he was perfectly ready even anxious to do her an illturn if he had the opportunity and certainly it seemed to him that there was a handle ready to his grasping when he remembered the torn note from bertie keynes which he had picked up in the grate how exactly to use it he did not at present see but it seemed to him an asset chapter x one afternoon late in october ginger was sitting crosslegged on the hearthrug of judys drawingroom outside a remarkably fine london fog had sat down on the town during the morning and like the frog footman in alice in wonderland proposed to sit there till tomorrow if not for days and days but a large fire was burning in the grate for judy detested unfired rooms and the electric light was burning the windows were not shuttered nor the blinds drawn because ginger a sybarite in sensations said it made him so much more comfortable to see how disgusting it was outside so the jaundiced gloom peered in through the windows and by contrast gave an added animation to gingers conversation he had usually a good deal to say whether events of interest had occurred lately or not but just now events of some importance to him and judy had been occurring with bewildering rapidity and in consequence conversation showed even less signs than usual of flagging in fact the world is like a morning paper so crammed with news that one cant read any one paragraph without another catching ones eye and your new paragraph judy is most exciting what has happened do you suppose nothingprobably nothing sybil is just tired of it all she is like that she goes on enjoying things enormously till a moment comes at that moment she finds them instantly and immediately intolerable i am only surprised that it didnt occur sooner well she had enough of new york pretty soon said ginger she only stopped down at long island for ten days then she had a months travelling she returns to new york on a monday and leaves for england fortyeight hours afterwards you know she enjoyed it enormously at first i think something did happen judy shook her head no on her return she found she couldnt endure it for a single moment longer and im sure i dont wonder the description of the pearlfishing party made me sick besides what could have happened ginger handed his cup for some more tea if you want me to guess i will he said but i dont think youll like it pray guess said she well i guess that biltonher own biltonsuddenly behaved likelike bilton why said judy because she wrote me a letter full of bilton one week since when his name has not occurred judy nodded the same applies to mrs emsworth she said do you think yes said ginger for a fool you are rather sharp said judy i wonder if it is so i dont i know it said ginger by the way i saw poor charlie yesterday were you down at sheringham no he has left sheringham apparently you have to get up when a bell rings and eat all that is given you and live out of doors till another bell rings charlie said he would sooner die like a gentleman than live like a strasburg goose so he left he is down at brighton in his mothers house living out of doors judy stirred her tea thoughtfully has he told sybil yet she asked you remember he would not let us tell her he said he wished to tell her himself i dont know i know he meant to humanly speaking what chance has he got she asked a good one if he will be sensible he probably wont but one person could make him sensible judy never asked unnecessary questions and let this pass in silence and have you heard from the millionaire she asked bertie yes bertie seems uncommonly happy so should i be if i was going to marry the richest girl in the five continents also i think hes in love with her isnt gallio delighted yes for the first time in his life he really takes an interest in bertie he says a mans efficiency is measured by his success success means income you know gallio speaks of himself as the most inefficient man of his own acquaintance but the pictures have to be sold all the same berties news came a little too late pictures asked judy hadnt you heard you see gallio about a month ago suddenly became aware that he had a genius for speculating on the stock exchange he chose american rails to exercise his genius on but the american rails went flat and knocked him flat so all the dutch pictures are up at christies next week he doesnt care as soon as he gets the money for them he is going to speculate again he has written to bertie in case he can get any sort of special information from palmer he has stockbrokers to dinner and lunches with bulls and bears judy was silent a moment what about mrs emsworth she asked suddenly ginger had got hold of a large persian cat and was stroking it the animal was in the full ecstasy of sensuous pleasure with eyes shut and neck strained to his hand but as judy asked this he paused a moment and stroked it the wrong way it hit at him with its paw and fled in violent indignation well what about mrs emsworth he repeated ginger dont be ridiculous it is loyal of you to pretend not to know what i mean but still ridiculous how has bertie managed to do this under her very guns i suppose he silenced them first said ginger cautiously or perhaps she has no guns why then two years ago did we all talk about nothing else but her and bertie because we are gossips said he do you mean that ginger examined his injured hand yes i mean that he said bertie told me all that happened he fell desperately in love with her he wrote her a very foolish letter which proposed oh all sorts of thingsmarriage among them immediately afterwards shewell we all began talking about her and bilton what happened to the letter asked judy dont know said he judy was silent a little anyhow it all hangs together with your idea about sybil and bilton she said at length i wondered if you were going to see that said ginger rather loftily judy went to the window and looked out i like that fog she said because it renders all traffic and business of all sorts out of the question i like the feeling that london anyhow has to pause and just twiddle its thumbs until god makes the wind blow after all a fog comes from smoke and it was man who lit the fires remarked ginger parenthetically you neednt remind one of that said she now sybil told me there were no fogs in new york that is awful her letters were awful the whole of life was a ceaseless grind if you stopped for a moment you were left behind how hopelessly materialistic why the only people who do any good in the worldapart from making pullman cars and telephones that is to sayare exactly those who do stopwho sit down and think all the same it is possible to stop too much you are always stopping ginger why dont you ever do something because it is so vastly more amusing to observe other people doing things said he as a rule they do them so badly besides sybil seems to me an awful warning she deliberately went to seek the strenuous life well something has happened the strenuous life has been one too many for her oh by the way i have more news for you the most important of all nearly you have been talking so much that i couldnt get a word in slander said judy get it in now gallio as you know has been trying to sell molesworth well advances have been made to him through an agent about it he wants to know the name of the purchaser but he cant find out what does gallio care as long as the price is a good one you cant tell about gallio he has some charming prejudices besidesi dont understand the ins and outs of itberties consent has to be obtained but he is offered two hundred thousand for a barrack he never lives in and some acres of land which nobody will farm he has telegraphed to bertie about it today well i suppose its no use being oldfashioned said judy but i think its horrible to sell what has been yours so long probably the buyer is some awful south african jew very likely but its nothing new money has always possessed its own buying powerit always will only theres such a devil of a lot of it now in certain hands that a poor man cant keep anything of his own and the hands that own it are not english but they want england anyhow as you say it is no use being oldfashioned but it is an immense luxury you are luxurious judy what do you mean well the greatest luxury of your life was refusing to ask mrs palmer to your house how you could afford it i dont know it was delicious said judy with great appreciation sybil was so sensible about it she took just your view she said she couldnt afford it herself but that i was my own mistress i wonderi really wonderwhy i find that class of person so intolerable because you are oldfashioned because you do not believe what is undoubtedly truethat wealth will get you anything anything material it certainly will get you quite so and this is a materialistic age i must go as im dining out mind you let me know anything fresh in all these events that concern us ginger went out into the thick dimcoloured evening with a sense of quickened interest in things his only passion in life was the observation of other people but for the last month or two he had found very little to observe apart from his work as a clerk in the foreign office which could have been done quite as well in half the time by an ordinary bank clerk at a quarter of his salary his life was valueless from an economical point of view while as far as his work went from the same point of view he was positively fraudulent thus judged by the relentless standards of america where work is paid for strictly by the demand which exists for it and that demand is tested simply and solely by the criterion of whether it adds directly or indirectly to the wealth of the country gingers services would have been dispensed with for he wasthough the wedge was being pulled out not pushed inthe thin end of that wedge which in the days of george iii had provided so amply for the younger sons nephews and connections of the nobility but the leisured ease in which those fortunate people could live in those days was rapidly passing away and ginger from an economical point of view was a very small specimen of an interesting survival for provided that a thing is done equally well in a cheap way as in an expensive way it is inexcusable in the public service not to have it done as cheaply as possible whether the complete application of this principle will be found wholly successful in its working will be for succeeding generations to determine but even today we have so to speak a working model of it in america the money once earned of course becomes the entire property of the individual and it is perfectly right that beggars should starve for a crust while on the foreshore of mon repos the glutted vulgarocracy gabble and search for pearls so the interesting survival made his groping way westwards in order to dress for dinner the fog was extremely dense and the light from the streetlamps was not sufficient to pierce the thickness that lay between them so that a man following the curb of the pavement had passed out of range of one before he came within range of the next dim shadows of people suddenly loomed large and close and as suddenly vanished into the fog in the roadway omnibuses and cabs proceeded at a footpace some drivers even leading their horses here a hansom had gone utterly astray and was at a standstill on the pavement being backed slowly off into the road through the dense air sound also came muffled and subaqueously it was like a city in a dream at the corner of bond street a man walking faster than is usual in a fog ran into ginger just below a gaslamp and apologized in a voice that struck him as familiar the next moment he saw who it was pray dont mention it he said i thought you were in america mr bilton bilton peered at him a moment and recognised him also really lord henry if it was necessary for me to run into someone i should have chosen you at the present moment i may be in australia for all i know is this london and if so what part corner of bond street said ginger which way are you going south audley street said the other im going to see your father in fact about the sale of molesworth are you going to buy it asked ginger no but i have been asked to communicate direct with him about it the intending purchaser wants me to see about doing it up i am going that way too said ginger let us go together walking is the only way you know we dont know who the intending purchaser is that so asked bilton well theres no reason any longer for secrecy its lewis s palmer lewis palmer asked ginger yes pity your father didnt ask an extra ten thousand he would have if he had known who the purchaser was said ginger candidly do you know if mr palmer means to live there he asked no more than he means to live on the new liverpool and southampton line ah he hasnt got that through yet said ginger with a sudden feeling of satisfaction that there had been considerable difficulties in getting the bill through the house last session there had really been no reason why it should not have been passed except that the commons objected to it merely because the line was practically to belong to a man who was not english bilton laughed a short rather shouldershrugging laugh london is the last place to know what happens in london he said the bill was passed this afternoon lewis s palmer owns that line as much as i own my walkingstick he could sit down on the uptrack and mrs palmer on the downtrack and stop all traffic if he chose you dont seem to like it ginger rather resented this chiefly because it was true why should i not like it he said cant say im sure said bilton i guess your country ought to be very grateful palmer will show you how to run a line properly he wont give you engines which are so pretty that they ought to be hung on the wall and he wont give you cars covered with gilt and mirrors but hell run you trains quicker than you ever had them run yet hell give you express freight rates that will be as cheap as transport by sea and hell pull the two ports together like stringing beads instead of letting them roll about unconnected of course hell get his bit out of it but all the benefit of rapid transport and cheap fares will be yours i guess your house of commons was annoyed they didnt think of it themselves they had got to hyde park corner and the fog had suddenly grown less dense and the darkness was clarified across the open square they could see the dark mass of the arch at the top of constitution hill and farther on the dim shapes of the houses in grosvenor place hansoms no longer passed as if going to a funeral but jingled merrily by to the cheerful beat of the horses hoofs on the road all the traffic was resuscitated buses swayed and nodded silentfooted electric broughams made known their advent by their clear metallic bells and the two turned more briskly up hamilton place and what has brought you to england so suddenly asked ginger i thought you intended to stop in america throughout mrs emsworths tour circumstances altered my plan said bilton i had several pieces of business here for instance lewis s palmer wished me to conduct the negotiations of molesworth as his agent seemed to be a sort of foolman and tell him what must be done to make it liveable in it is going to be lived in said ginger quite unable to stifle the curiosity he felt oh certainly it is going to be lived in then i wanted to securei have securedthe lease of the coronation theatre for next summer i thought mrs emsworth had taken it said ginger no she meant to but she did not complete her contract before leaving for america in fact she let an excellent chance slip you have cut her out certainly then there was another thing now do you know lord henry whether mrs massington has arrived in london yet she sailed the day before i did but we made a very fast voyage she was in the oceanic she arrives this evening said ginger and goes to her sisters to miss faradys asked bilton yes here we are wont you come in with me i will see if my father is at home gallio was in and very much at biltons service personally he detested the man but he liked his way of doing business and he particularly liked the business he had come to do berties consent had been received by cable that afternoon and a short halfhour was sufficient to draw up the extremely simple deed by virtue of which molesworth the house and park and all that was within house and park passed into the possession of lewis s palmer on payment of the sum of two hundred thousand pounds and ill cable to lewis right along said bilton at the conclusion and youll find the sum standing to your credit tomorrow morning by the way lewis expressly told me to ask you whether you had any wishes of any sort with regard to molesworthany small thing you wanted out of it or anything you wanted kept exactly as it is gallio considered a moment ah theres the visitors book he said i should rather like to have that i dont think it could be of any value to mrs palmer as it only contains the names of friends of mine who have stayed there distinguished names asked bilton i suppose you might call some of them distinguished i guess mrs palmer might like to keep it on said bilton but ill ask anything else i should rather like the oak avenue left as it is said gallio it was planted in the reign of henry viii and several what you would call distinguished peoplejames i and george i among themplanted trees there mrs palmer will have a gold fence put round it said bilton with a touch of sarcasm that will add very greatly to the beauty of the sylvan scene gallio permitted himself to remark in fact if i ever have the pleasure of seeing molesworth again i shall expect to find it improved out of all recognition i expect mrs palmer will smarten it up a bit said bilton quite unmoved that excellent man of business went down to molesworth next day in order to inspect it generally with a view to estimating what would have to be spent on it to make it habitable he had sufficient taste to see the extraordinary dignity of the plain elizabethan house and though he felt that mrs palmer would probably have called it a mouldy old ruin he did not propose even though he got a percentage on the sale and the costs of renovation to recommend any scheme of gilding and mirrors the tapestries were admirable the sheraton and chippendale furniture was excellently suited to the thoroughly english character of the place and the gardens wanted nothing but gardeners biltons extremely quiet and businesslike mind had its perceptive side and though he did not care for yet he appreciated the leisurely solidity the leisurely beauty of the place so characteristic of england so innate with the genius of the anglosaxon the red lichentoned house had grown there as surely as its stately oaks and lithe beeches had grown there out of the english soilindigenous not bought and planted cedartrees with broad fans of leaves and starred by the ripe cones made a spacious shade on the lawn and whispered gently to the stirring of the warm autumn wind as they bathed themselves in the mellow floods of october sunshine below the lawn ran a dimpling troutstream and within the precincts of the park stood the small gothic church grown gray in its patient unremitting service gathering slowly round it the sons of the soil attached to one aisle was the chapel of the family and marble effigies of scartons knelt side by side or reclining on their tombs raised dumb hands of prayer one had hung up his armour by him by the feet of another his hunting dogs lay stretched in sleep one but a beardless lad the second of the race had been killed in the huntingfield his wife so ran the inscription was delivered of a child the same day and died within twentyfour hours of her lord and over all was the air of distinction of race of culture that could not be bought though lewis s palmer by right of purchase was entitled to it all bilton felt this but dismissed it as an unprofitable emotion and made a note on his shirtcuff to inquire whether the right of presentation to the living belonged to the family sybil massington in the meantime had arrived in london and while bilton was engaged in appraising the molesworth estate was herself in the confessional of the wisest spinster in london all her life she had been accustomed to knowing what she wanted and knowing to getting it but now for the first time in matters of importance she did not know what she wanted and was afraid of not getting anything at all things in america in fact had gone quite stupendously awry she was upset angry at herself and others and what to her was perhaps most aggravating of all uncertain of herself to one usually so lucid so intensely reasonable as she was this was of the nature of an idiocy it was as if shethe essential sybilstood by while a sort of wraith of herself sat feeble and indifferent in a chair unable to make up its mind about anything she longed to take this phantom by the shoulders and shake it into briskness and activity again open its head and dust its brain for it but perhaps judy could do it for her anyhow the need not so much of consultation but of confession was urgent she did not in the least want absolution because she had done nothing wrong indeed she wanted to confess because she was incapable of doing anything at all she had to make up her mind and she could not perhaps stating the problem of her indecision very clearly might even if it did not elicit a suggestion from judy help her at any rate to see what her difficulties were more clearly and though indecisive she still retained her candour and told judy all that had happened exactly as it had happened oh i know it she said in answer to some question of judys a woman feels in her bones when a man is going to propose to her only i wasnt quite ready for it and for two days i kept him from actually asking me then on the night that mrs emsworth was acting there i went upstairs with her to her room two minutes afterwards bilton came instrolled in you mean he didnt knock asked judy oh my dear what does it matter whether he knocked or not as a matter of fact i think he did but he came in on the top of his knock anyhow there was no doubt in my mind as to what their relations were but to make sure i asked mrs emsworth it was a horrible thing to do but i did it i like that woman she is what she is but she is extremely bon enfant a nice straightforward boy and she told me i was perfectly right he had been living with her for the last two years sybil got up and began walking up and down the room it hurt me she went on it hurt me intolerably it hurt my selfrespect that he should come to me like that no he had not broken with herat any rate not definitely she was perfectly straightforward with me and in a curious sort of way she was sorry for me as one is sorry for a pain one does not understand she could not see i think that it made any difference judys rather short nose went in the air luckily it does not matter much what that sort of woman thinks she said sybil did not reply for a moment you dont see my difficulty then she said my difficulty my indecision is that i am not certain whether she is right or not look at it this way i was attracted by mr bilton i felt for him that which i believe in me does duty for love i liked him and i admired him i liked the fact that he admired me now all the time that i liked and admired him this thing had happened i liked the man who had done that what difference then can my knowing it make judy looked at her in surprise if he had happened to be a murderer she said i should not ever have liked him i dont know what to say to you said judy really perplexed what you tell me is so unlike you i know it is i have changed i suppose i think america changed me what has happened is it that i have become hard or that i have learned commonsense what i cannot make out is whether i would sooner have learned this or not if i had not learned it i should be now engaged to him but knowing it shall i marry him have you seen him since no he has behaved very typically very cleverly he neither tried to see me again nor wrote to me he has very quick perceptions i am sure i am sure he reasoned it out with himself and came to the conclusion that it was better not to approach me in any way for a time he was quite right if he had tried to explain things away or had even assured me that there was nothing to explain i should have had nothing more to say to him i should have told him that he and all that concerned him was a matter of absolute indifference to me he has been wise he simply effaced himself and he has therefore made me think about him sybil paused in front of the lookingglass and smoothed her hair with an absent hand then she turned round again you will see she said he will follow me to england i dont think you like him judy she added my approbation is not necessary to you not in the least but why dont you because i am oldfashionedbecause we belong to totally different generations you and i i dont like motorcars either you see and a persons feeling for motorcars is a very good criterion as to the generation to which he belongs sybil laughed how odd you are she said they are fast and convenient but about mr bilton he is a very remarkable man he can do anything he chooses to do and whatever he chooses to do turns into gold he owns half the theatres in new york he has a big publishing business there he furnishes houses for people he has made a fortune on the stock exchange some of those americans are like spiders sitting in the middle of their webs which extend in all directions and whatever wind blows it blows some fly into their meshes just as a great artist like michael angelo can write a sonnet or hew a statue out of the marble or paint a picture fitting the artistic sense like a handle to any knife so with a man like him he sees money everywhere he is very efficient is he quite unscrupulous asked judy not unscrupulous exactly but relentless that is the spirit of america it fascinates me and it repels me some of them remind me of destinymr palmer does by the way he asked me when i was over there if molesworth was for sale have you heard anything about it yes ginger told me that negotiations were going on he didnt know nor did gallio who the possible purchaser was no doubt it was mr palmer sybil put her head on one side considering what was the price she asked two hundred thousand of course money does not mean anything particular to the palmers she said but i rather wonder why they bought it mr palmer has been looking out for an english house i know but i should have thought molesworth was too remote i expect they paid for the spirit of ancestry which clings to the place said judy molesworth seemed to me the only time i saw it to be the most typically english house i had ever seen mrs palmer cant procure ancestors but she can procure the frame for them that is not charitably said dear judy said her sister besides i am sure that is not it ah i know they have bought it to give to bertie on his marriage that must be it if so there is a largeleaved coarse sort of delicacy about it said judy there again you are not charitable besides you have not seen amelie she is charming simply charminga girl too a real flesh and blood girl and she adores him she adores him with all her splendid vitality and bertie asked judy oh they will be very happy said sybil it will be a great success he admires her immensely he likes her immensely dear judy there are many ways of love one way of love is berties and mine that is all did he adore mrs emsworth like that asked judy well no i imagine not that was the other way of love she took up the morning paper then a sudden thought seemed to strike her and she laid it down again by the way is charlie in town she asked i heard from him just before i left america he said he had not been well his letter made me feel rather anxious there was an undercurrent ofof keeping something back did he tell you no more than that asked judy sybil glanced up and seeing judys face knitted her brows into a frown judy what is it she asked quickly tell me at once i cant dear he wished to tell you himself i promised him i wouldnt but is there something wrongsomething really wrong judy nodded where is he down at brighton with his mother judy you must tell me said her sister it is merely saving me a couple of hours of horrid anxiety i shall go down to see him this afternoon now what is it is it lungs i will tell charlie i forced you to tell me there is no use in my not answering you said judy yes it is that serious consumption is always serious sybil said nothing for a moment i shall go down this afternoon she said why is he at brighton why is he not at some proper place he went to sheringham for a time but he left it but he has got to get better said sybil quickly he must do what is sensible judy glanced up at her a moment as things at present stand he does not much want to get better she said sybil turned and looked at her long and steadily you mean me she asked there was silence sybil went to the writingtable and wrote a telegram while her sister took up the paper she had dropped and looked at it mechanically almost immediately a short paragraph struck her eye but her mind dwelling on other things did not at once take in its significance yet you advised me yourself not to marry him said sybil as she rang the bell i know i did nor have i really changed my mind but it is in your power to make him want to live sybil turned on her rather fiercely you have no right to load me with such responsibilities she said it is not my fault that he loves me it is not my fault that i am as i am i know it is not said judy but sybil be wisebe very wise i dont know what you can do but certainly nobody else can do anything i am very sorry for you sybil gave the telegram asking charlie if she could come to the servant and stood in silence again by the fire after a pause judy took up the paper again there is something here that concerns you she said it is that mr bilton arrived in london yesterday sybil turned then suddenly threw her arms wide oh judy judy she cried i am unutterably unhappy i am perplexed puzzled i dont know what i feel and she flung herself down on the sofa by judys side and burst into uncontrollable sobs chapter xi charlie brancepeth was sitting in a wooden summerhouse on the lawn of his mothers house at brighton it was set upon a pivot in the centre of its floor so that it could be turned with little effort to any point of the compass so as to face the sun and avoid the wind in itso much at any rate he practised of the treatment which he had compared to the fattening of a strasburg goosehe passed the whole day only sleeping indoors but this he did because it seemed to him a very rational and sensible mode of life soothing to the nerves and producing in him a certain outdoor stagnation of the brain he did not want to think he wanted merely to be as quiet and drowsed as he could and not to live very long for since sybils final rejection of him the taste had gone out of lifetemporarily it might be onlybut while that was still very new and bitter within him had come this fresh blow the discovery that he was suffering from tubercular disease of the lungs for some months before he had suspected this then soon after the departure of sybil and bertie for america he had had an attack of influenza from which he did not rally well he had a daily rise of temperature a daily intolerable lassitude and his doctor seeking for the cause of this had found it then following his advice he tried a cure on the east coast of england in which he had to get up at the sound of a bell and proceed out of doors there to remain all day till a bell summoned him and the other patients in again at frequent intervals he had to eat large quantities of fattening food at other hours he had to walk quietly along a road work of all sorts even more than an hour or twos reading was discouraged and the days had been to him a succession of nightmares all presenting the same dull hopelessness so after a fortnight of it he decided to persevere with it no more and if he had to die to die he had talked the thing out once with his mother and had promised to go to davos for the winter if it was recommended to him and in the interval to lead a mode of life that was rational for his case without being unbearable they both agreed finally to dwell on the subject as little as possible in their thoughts and dismiss it altogether from their conversation just now she was away for a day or two and he was alone as he waited for sybils arrival that he was alone he had felt himself bound to tell her but he felt certain that she would come all the same and though he waited for her in a sort of anguish of expectation he felt that life for the first time since the sunday at haworth at the end of july was interesting what she would say to him how he would take it even the vaguest predication of their intercourse was beyond him to guess indeed it was scarcely worth while he thought trying to conjecture what it would be for love and death were near to him august guests the shelter was lit by an electric light and he had just turned this on when he heard the wheels of her cab drive up he went in through the gardendoor to meet her his heart beating wildly found her in the moment of arrival and advanced to her with outstretched hands ah this is charming of you he said i am delighted to see you but she had involuntarily paused a moment as she saw him for though his disease had made no violent inroads on him yet the whole manner of his face his walk his appearance was changed his eyes were always large they now perhaps looked ever so little larger his face was always thin it was perhaps a shade thinner he always stooped he stooped perhaps a little more but even as one can look at a portrait and say i see no point on which it is not like yet it really has no resemblance to the man so though charlie was changed so little yet he was not like him with whom she had walked on the hot sunday afternoon of july last then it was summer now it was autumn and instead of the broad brightness of sun a little bitter wind stirred among the trees for the flame of life there was substituted the shadow of death intangible indescribable untranslatable into definite thought but unmistakable but her pause was only momentary the quick practical part of her nature leaped instinctively to the surface to do its duty she was here if possible to help and she came quickly forward to meet him my dear charlie she said it is good to see you again she took both his hands in hers you bad boy she said to get ill judy told me it was not her fault i made her i meant to tell you myself said he but it does not matter now that is enough of that subject my mother and i never talk of itwe hardly ever think of it now will you take off your things sybil drew her cloak round her no certainly not said she judy told me you lived in a summerhouse well i did not come down here to see you through the window lead on to the summerhouse it will be too cold for you said he it will be nothing of the kind they talked till dinner on indifferent subjects she sketched new york for him with a brilliant if not a very flattering touch she did her best for the revels but suddenly in the middle broke down it really is awful what a beast one is she said but there somehow where what i am describing to you is natural where everyone is so extraordinarily kind and so entirely uncultured the vulgarity did not strike me i like the people and as you know i like the sense of wealth who is it who talks about moral geography burke i think well that is a very suggestive expression you can do in new york what you cannot possibly conceive doing in england just as you can grow plants in the south which will not stand our climate charlie shook his head i dont think i could stand that anywhere he said oh yes you could milieu environment is everything but now as i sit here and look at the big trees in the garden covered with that wash of moonlight it is different you tooyou are so very unamerican i always told you you were oldfashioned charlie looked at her in silence a moment and you he said at length you yourself have you changed as ginger prophesied do i seem to you more oldfashioned than ever i am a very good test question i imagine why because you have seen have you not a good deal of my double bilton the contrast of our natures ought to be all the more apparent for the similarity of our appearance she got up i have a great deal to talk to you about charlie she said but it is afterdinner talk a good deal is about you the rest is about myself i have also made another discovery i am a more profound egotist than i knew did i always strike you as egotistic dominant people are always egotistic said he dominant am i dominant you will not think so when you have heard have things gone wrong he asked yesor right i do not know which anyhow they have gone differently to what iwell planned now the plans of dominant people go as they expect them to go until they meet a more dominant person she shook her head no if my plans have been upset anyhow i have upset others she said they dined rather silently for both of them were thinking of the talk which was coming and sybil again was conscious of her own indecision then after dinner since delay only made her more heavily conscious of it she went straight to the subject judy told me you had left sheringham she saidthat you had practically taken yourself out of the hands of doctors who humanly speaking could probably have cured you do you think you have any right to do that my life is my own said he ah i dispute that one does not belong to ones selfat any rate not wholly one belongs to ones friendsto those who care for one who cares for me bertie keynes i suppose cares for me but i entirely deny his right to any disposal of what i do your mother then in the main she agrees with me supposing i had cancer she would not urge me for a moment to have an operation which was uncertain of success and my case is similar sybil was silent a moment i then she said i entirely disapprove of your action i care for you you should consider me as well it is in that sense your life is not your own you have made yourself a niche so to speak in other peoples lives you have put an image of yourself theregiven it themand you have no right to take it away he took a cigarette from a box near him and you are not allowed to smoke she added he laughed and lit it we have got to talk he said if you convince me i have no right towell to commit what will probably be a very lengthy suicide i will smoke no more if you dont i shall continue to smoke and in the interval i can talk more easily now you have spoken so frankly to me i shall use the same frankness she nodded a mans life he said belongs to himself until he has given it to a woman and she has accepted it then it is no longer his but hers and she may dispose of it no woman has accepted mine she made a little movement in her chair as if wincing and he saw it shall i not go on he said no go on it is this for which i came here so everybody said he has about the same weight with me and that combined weight is less than my right to do as i choose bertie keynes you judy gingeryou all want me to be what you call sensible and live as long as possible but my indifference to life is stronger than your desire that i should live my mother alone wishes me to do as i choose because she understands he paused and saw that sybil was looking not at him but into the fire and that unshed tears stood in her eyes fighting with some emotion that would not let them fall i understand too she said in a whisper and it looked as if the tears would have their way then they were checked again as she continued but you are grossly unfair to meboth you and judy you saddle me with this responsibility you say it is my fault that you are indifferent to life indeed it is not fair i am what i am you may hate me or love me but it is me i am hard i dare say without the power to love that is me too and you say to me alter that please and become exceedingly tender and devoted and because i dontah there is your mistake it is because i cant i could pray and think and agonize and yet not add an inch to my stature and do you think then it is likely that i could alter what is so vastly more me than my height ah i dont blame you said he and i dont saddle you with any responsibility but if i loved you you would care to live yes but i dont say that it is your fault that you dont that would be interfering in your lifea thing which i am deprecating in regard to my own she made a hopeless gesture with her hands we are talking in a circle she said leave it for a moment i have something else to tell you he sat very upright in his chair grasping the arms in his hands feeling that he knew for certain what this was you mean you are going to marry harold bilton no i mean exactly the opposite i mean that i am not he dropped the cigarette he had just lit into the fireplace with her womans quickness she instantly saw the symbolical application of this and with her passion for analysis could not resist casting a fly as it were over it she pointed to the grate you have dropped your cigarette she said he looked at her for one halfsecond and then with rather slowermoving mind recalled what he had said about not smoking any more yes the doctors told me not to he said feeling again the thrill of even this infinitesimal piece of fencing with her they said it was a bad habit for me she got up charlie i dont know if i was right to tell you that she said you mean it may lead me to hope thati assure you it shall not but it leaves things less utterly hopeless she shook her head you mustnt even think that she said i cant help thinking that while there is life you knowi was lyingand his eye brightened with a sudden excitement with throat ready for the guillotine i could see it they had not bandaged my eyesbut they have taken the knife away no i dont ask what next the knife is gone that is sufficient for the moment she stood close to him by the fire with eyes that strayed from him to a picture down to the fire again and again back to him it is late she said at length i must go to bed and so must you i have got to go back tomorrow i shall see you in the morning goodnight he lit a candle for her and she went to the foot of the stairs then paused a moment with her back to him you will stop to smoke another cigarette before you come up she said she heard him take a couple of steps inside the room she had just left and then a vague sort of rustle i have thrown them all into the fire said he oh charlie how wasteful she cried beginning to ascend the stairs and how and she paused at the corner he appeared in the doorway on the instant how he asked nothing what were you going to say sybil said he on oath mind she leaned over the banisters premature she whispered and rustled up the remaining steps charlie did not smoke another cigarette after she had gone for the simplest of all reasons but he broke another rule of health by sitting up much later than he should he listened in the way a man does for the sound of the closing of her door hoping for some hopeless groundless reason that she would come back then because the room was hot and to him in his openair sojournings airless with the closed windows he opened one and sat by it looking out into the still starry night and even as the coolness and breeze of air refreshed his body so the thought of the talk he had had with her refreshed and was wine to his soul at present he hoped for nothing it was not necessary for him to tell himself not to be sanguine for she had done nothing for him that she would not have done for a hundred other friends she had in fact told him no more than others when she had said that his life did not belong entirely to himself and she had told him no more than a penny newspaper might have told him when she had said she was not going to marry bilton yet the imminent knife had gone whether her mere presence again was tonic to him or whether it was that there was again for him a loophole for hopesomething possibly his to winhe did not stop to inquire the upshot was that life his life that is to say which is all that the most altruistic philosophers really mean when they talk of life was again interesting worthy of smiles or tears as the case might be whether it was to be smiles or tears he did not at this moment care the fact that it merited emotion was enough the chequerboard of nights and days was still in movement he was not yet a taken piece for the last three months he had thought of himself as exactly that and simultaneously with that conviction had come the conviction that the chequerboard and the game played thereon was utterly without interest his part in it was over he no longer cared and as has been said even the most altruistic and the most philosophical cannot do much better quelle perte irreparable was comtes exclamation when he was told that he had to die how premature was not that too an indication however veiled that it was not premature she would not have said that his holocaust of the cigarettes was premature if it was so she would merely have thought to herself poor fellow but the hopelessness of the thought was neutralized by its announcement not the most matteroffact physicians broke news of fatal illness like that and again he reminded himself that he must not be sanguine anyhow she had reminded him like everybody else no doubt that his life was not entirely his own she had told him also there was nothing secret about it that she was not going to marry harold bilton but it was she who had told him bilton meantime with the speed of his race had completed his contract for the lease of the coronation theatre for the next season and had finished on behalf of lewis s palmer the purchase of the molesworth property it was quite characteristic of him that he should postpone for these affairs which were really imminent the piece of private business which had more than either of them perhaps more than both brought him to england consequently it was not till the afternoon of the next day that he called at judys and asked to see mrs massington sybil had spent the morning at brighton and had arrived only some halfhour before he called but with the instinct of the autumn perhaps strong in her she had said she would see him rejecting judys offer to put herself in the way of a teteatete he was shown into the room where judy usually sat a sittingroom off the drawingroom it had been furnished with her unerring bizarre taste and looked like nothing whatever except judys room there was a bearskin on the floor because somebody had given it her two execrable watercolours were on the wall for the same reason and on the same walls were three wonderful prints of reynolds engraved by smith there was a grand piano there making locomotion difficult because judy played much and badly and steinway so she always said knew what she meant better than anybody there was some good french furniture there because it was hers and some hopeless english armchairs because they were comfortable finally there was sybil there because she was her sister and at this moment there had entered harold bilton because she had said she would see him she got up and advanced to him this is quite unexpected she said i thought you were in america pray sit down what has happened has mrs emsworth also come back bilton sat down he brought his hat and stick with him according to the custom of his countrymen and sybil who had never noticed it there noticed it in london she noticed it more particularly since the stick fell down from the angle where he had propped it with a loud clatter no mrs emsworth is still in america he said she has left new york and gone on tour i think her tour will be very successful so glad said sybil tea i guess i wont thank you said bilton i dont want anything i want just to talk to you sybil pulled herself together in other words she tried to remember that a man in new york if he crosses an insignificant ocean is the same man who lands at liverpool she succeeded moderately well and how is everybody she asked how is mrs palmer and amelie and all the long island party theyre all right said bilton mrs palmers giving a woodland fete this week it will be very complete and i guess the sea will come and swallow up newport but i didnt come here to talk about mrs palmer he finished taking off his gloves threw them into his hat and took a chair exactly opposite her so that they faced each other as in a waggonette which to sybil was an odious vehicle for locomotion his likeness to charlie was somehow strangely obliterated today she thought of the latter as of something suffering in need of protection whereas the samefeatured man who sat opposite her looked particularly capable of selfdefence and if necessary of aggression for the first time she rather feared him and dislike looked hazily out through the tremor of fear you ran away from america in a great hurry he said you left us very desolate something in this quite harmless speech displeased sybil immensely ran away she asked yes ran away but only incidentally from america you ran away from me i came after you sybil got up really mr bilton she said you have left your manners the other side of the atlantic she went halfway across the room with the intention of ringing the bell but she stopped before she got there curiosity about the development of this situation conquered and she sat down again he took no notice of her remark about his manners i have come to ask you to marry me he said you are the woman i have been looking for all my life i will try to make you very happy she answered him without pause i am very grateful to you she said but i cannot you led me to suppose you would said he i am very sorry for it there was a moments silence you changed your mind when you saw me come into dorothy emsworths room he said now i always meant to tell you about that it is perfectly true that for nearly two years she held up her hand you need not trouble she said i know bilton paused a halfsecond to arrange his reply in the way he wished i always supposed she would tell you he said her silence admitted it and he had scored a sidepoint he wished to know whether dorothy had told her i think you are hard on me he said or perhaps i do not understand you were before you knew that prepared to accept my devotion do you reject it now because i have led that sort of life sybil frowned i cant discuss the question with you she said i will just suggest to you this that you went to see your mistress while i to whom you had expressed devotion was staying in the house if you cant understand my feeling about that i cant explain it to you i will promise never to see her again said bilton suddenly and almost with the vividness of actual hallucination the figure of the man who was so like him rose up before sybil and she all but saw charlie taking biltons place there and imagined that it was he who was saying what bilton said for a moment she invested him with the grossness of his double and loathed and shuddered at the picture she had conjured up charlie behaving like bilton was an image so degrading and humiliating that she could not contemplate it the very thought was to do him dishonour but bilton so she recognised was acting now up to his very best it was the best of his nature which promised not to see mrs emsworth again but charlie in a corresponding position was unthinkable against this grossness all sybils fineness all her taste ran up like a wave against a stone seajetty and was broken against it and the jetty did not know what it had done she rose conscious that she was trembling it is a matter of entire indifference to me she said when or where or how soon you see her again i want you to understand that bilton sat quite unmoved if you were quite certain of yourself you would not be so violent he said you are overstating your feelings that is because you are rather perplexed as to what they are sybil turned quickly round to him she could not help showing her appreciation of this ah you are frightfully clever she said i do you that justice he rose i shall not give up hope he said that is as you please she said i have stated as clearly as i can that i can give you none it is not your fault that you dont convince me said he it is the fault of my own determination goodbye sybil shook hands with him what are your movements she asked i return to america almost immediately to collect my company for the coronation theatre ah you are going to have an american company then she asked certainlytwo companies rather i shall have two pieces running simultaneously with two performances a day no one has yet thought of producing entertainments to last from about five till eight in the evening when he had gone she sat down without book paper or work simply to think despite herself and despite the disgust for him which sown by that moment in mrs emsworths room had grown up funguslike in her mind this unhurrying relentless activity so typical of him and of the nation to which he belonged which had so stirred her in america stirred her again the practical side of her nature responded to it as an exhausted man responds to alcohol it woke in her the need to do something definite with her life it reminded her that the mere observation of other people was not to her as it was to ginger a sufficient excuse for her existence she felt that her quick brain her sure analytic grasp could not find its permanent fruition in mere quickness or in mere analysis something of the passion for deeds for accomplishment that instinct which blindly spurs on bees to labour and men to work had got hold of her but what was she to do she refused to marry bilton for apart from the fungus of disgust this very need for activity rejected him that niche for herself in front of which should burn in her honour the thick incense of wealth no longer attracted her she wanted to accomplish to make to be in however small a degree an active creating force so strong at the present moment was the impulse that she wondered probably correctly whether her refusal of bilton did not dip some rootfibre into this soil the thought stirred within her till sitting still became impossible and she rose and walked up and down the room soon her eye fell on the great nosegay of michaelmas daisies which she had gathered in charlies garden that morning before leaving and with her keen dislike of waste her unwillingness that anything should perish without having got the best out of itself she busied herself for a few moments in filling a tall venetian vase with water to place them in the stalks were a little dry and sapless at the ends and she made another journey to her room in order to get some scissors to cut off the dry pieces even a flower should be made to do its best to look its best and last as long as possible even flowers should be strenuous and here was she and ninetenths of her nation drifting like thistledown on a moor wherever the wind happened to carry it to workthat was the impulse she had brought back with her from americanot to scheme merely with her busy brain to intrigue to find as she always had found endless amusement and entertainment in watching others even though she exerted her intellect to its fullest in intelligently watching them but to make some plan and carry it outto find some work to do and do it suddenly in the middle of her neat decisive clipping of the flowerstalks she stopped and laid the scissors down surely there was a piece of work that lay very ready to her hand though twice in the last day or two she had resented the responsibility being laid on her but if she took it on herselfif she led charlie back to interest in life if she coaxed from him his apathywas not that worth doing there were difficulties in the way sufficient to rouse enthusiasm in one who was much less on fire with the desire for production than she she would be quite honest with him she would not hold out any hope of which the fulfilment was not sure she would not let him think for a moment that she would ever marry him if the thing was to be done at all she would do it by inciting him to live for the sake of life by making him feel the unworthiness of giving inthe unworthiness too of the only condition on which he at present cared to live she was not in love with him but even if she had been that would have made but a poor motive the vitality that was hers was so abundant that surely she could impart some of it to himmake something of it bubble in his veins his nature his perception were of a fine order and though disappointment first and then disease might have dulled their sensibilities for the time yet surely their numbness was only temporarya passing anaesthesia anyhow here lay a work worth doing chapter xii mr lewis s palmer was sitting at his table in the sittingroom of the quiet modest little suite he had taken at the carlton hotel and was studying with some minuteness a large ordnance map of worcestershire he had some dozen of the sheets arranged in front of him and the molesworth estate which he had been down to see only the day before occupied a considerable portion of the central one of them by him was seated bilton who answered usually monosyllabically the questions which mr palmer asked him from time to time yes or no was generally sufficient occasionally he thought a moment and then said i dont remember of the answers he received lewis palmer sometimes made a short note finally he studied the map for a considerable time in silence and then folded up each sheet separately and replaced them in the bookstand that stood on the table then he read his notes through twice and tore them up complete the purchase of the wyfold estate as soon as possible literally as soon as possible he said if you can do it by halfpast four this afternoon let it be done by then not by five its a huge price remarked bilton for half a dozen unproductive farms it is a necessity said the other and a necessity is cheap at any price but the fact that they ask so much leads me to think they have some kind of inkling as to what i am going to do thats why i want you to do it at once he rose and sipped the glass of milk that stood on the sidetable there is one more thing he said i want someone who will give a general supervision to my affairs here which are growing important to me i offer you the place because i like your way of doing business how much time do you want me to give to it he asked roughly two days a week anything of emergency to be dealt with separately bilton smiled you chiefly deal in emergencies he said mr palmer tapped the table rather impatiently what do you make a year he asked round about two hundred thousand dollars i guarantee you a hundred thousand he said on the two days a week basis if it takes you longer than that let me know only my affairs come first bilton considered this a moment without the slightest trace of exultation or pleasure thats right then he said i guess ill go off over the wyfold business yes do im going to look at seaton house i shall be in by two will you lunch with me cant say said bilton im rather busy today lewis palmer continued sipping his milk in a regular methodical manner till he had finished it and then put on some rather shabby dogskin gloves an extremely shiny and obviously perfectly new tall hat and rang his handbell almost before it sounded his bedroom door opened noiselessly and his valet stood there lunch at two he said if lord keynes gets here before me ask him to wait lunch for how many sir asked his servant i dont know mr palmers progress out of the carlton was made easy for him doors flew open as he neared them and by the time he had reached the pavement his motor had drawn up exactly opposite the entrance and the door was being held open for him mrs palmer had had her eyeor part of an eyeon seaton house for some time quite a year ago her husband had given her to understand that london might very possibly be the headquarters of his business for a considerable time and when she spent her season there last summer she had considered london as a residence on general principles it was highly attractiveamericans as she knew from experience could command all that was worth having there with on the whole a less expenditure than was necessary to keep up the same position in new york prince fritz for instance in the autumn had been a very heavy item and though prince fritz had yielded high social dividends in america yet it was easily possible to run a royalty of the same class in england at a far lower figure on the other hand prince fritz in london would not be worth exploiting at allthat she recognisedbut her conclusions had been that social success of a firstrate order in london could be done on less than the same article in new york in both towns it was necessary to stand up among the ruck of ordinary hostesses like a mountainpeak you had in any case to spend much more than most other people since therefore most other people spent less in london than in new york the mountainpeak need not be so high she saw also with her very clearsighted eye that england the professedly aristocratic was far more democratic than the professedly democratic america lady a duchess b countess c she saw as regards their titles alone were quite valueless socially in england except among suburban and provincial people that was naturalthe prophet has no honour in his own country again england or rather that small section of english society which in her mind was equivalent to england was rapidly conforming to the american ideal it no longer cared for birth or breeding it wanted to be greatly and continuously amused a hostess was worth her power of entertainment nobody cared here in the least whether her grandfather was a butcher or a bootblack all they cared was whether they were sufficiently lavishly entertained so far she had seen clearly and correctly enough dimly she had seen a little farther and knew that for a reason she could not grasp there were in england some few families who had a cachet altogether independent of wealth she could have named some halfdozen who floated on the very tiptop of everything to whose houses kings and queens drove up so to speak in hansoms and played about in the garden they might be poor they might apparently have no particular power or accomplishment which could account for it but it was into that circle that mrs palmer now desired to get to one of these families bertie keynes belonged anyhow she had secured him as a soninlaw she had cut a step on the steep icewall furthermore it could not be a disadvantage to have one of the few really fine houses in london for ones own that was why mr palmer had bought seaton house he drove there now in his noiseless motorbrougham looking out with his piercing gray eyes on to the grimy splendour of pall mall it was a brilliant winter day and primrosecoloured sunshine flooded the town giving an almost southern gaiety to the streets as usual a large extent of the pavement was up for repairs and it vexed his sense of speed and efficiency to see the leisurely manner in which the work was done frankly england seemed to him in a very bad way her railways her trade her shipping all the apparatus of her commerce was haphazard unconcentrated uneconomical just like her mode of making repairs to her streets personally except that at this moment his motor was stopped he did not at all object to it since it gave him the opportunity which he had been preparing for of stepping in in the matter of her railways and introducing american methods he had now three months ago got through his bill for a direct railway between liverpool and southampton and the work of construction was going on with a speed that fairly took away the breath of contractors who were accustomed to think that slowness was essential to solidity that boast of solidity so characteristic of the english had long amused lewis palmer what they call solid he had once said to bilton i call stodgy they make a brick wall three feet thick that would bear the weight of the world when all they want is a twoinch steel girder riveted to an upright and when they have spent a couple of months in building it they think they have done better than the man who puts up the steel girder it is false economy to put up what is not necessary just as it is false economy not to put up what is and they think that to paper their railroad cars with lookingglasses in gold frames will console the shareholders for an absence of dividends no before we financed the liverpool and southampton we made certain of getting the line built the proper way but this line was by no means all the control he meant to get in english railways its success his financial knowledge told him was certain it was as sure that the traffic between the ports would come by a directer and faster route than that which already existed as that the sun would rise tomorrow it was equally sure that facility of communication would lead to increased traffic what followed cardiff would be forced to get direct communication with his line instead of letting her trade walk about in country lanes as he expressed it to do that a new line from there must join the liverpool and southampton at the nearest possible point that point lay allowing ample margin somewhere within the borders of the molesworth estate which he had purchased in the autumn and the wyfold estate which he had given orders to bilton to purchase that day there was another thing as well geologically it seemed most probable that there was coal on the molesworth estate it had been suspected half a dozen years ago but gallio out of a mixture of reasons partly indifference partly want of cash partly repugnance to turn the park into a colliery had never made so much as a boring for it but lewis palmer was neither indifferent nor bankrupt he also had no particular feeling about parks and his gray eyes brightened and the momentary stoppage of his motor owing to the slovenly and dilatory way in which the street was being repaired irritated him no longer one could not say he was lost in reverie he was rather picking his way through his reverie with very firm and decisive steps directing his course to a welldefined goal an assemblage of upholsterers paperers carpenters plumbers furniture dealers and painters were awaiting his arrival for he had promised his wife to get the house into habitable shape before easter and to save time to himself he took them all round in his inspection and gave orders to each as they went along i shall want a large brocade screen to stand straight in front of the door of the inner hall he said let it be at least seven feet high send me the patterns first dont put much furniture into the hall a big plain mahogany table there for cards and small things a long line of hatracks there with an umbrella rack below it dont think you can make a hatrack pretty so make it plain half a dozen chippendale chairs and an old english steel fender with dogs i will choose the rugs and stair carpet myself but polish the whole of the staircase put a big vitrine for china in that corner cut a circular louvre window above the frontdoor and copy the mouldings round it from the north door of the erechtheum you will find the drawings in schultzs book big candelabra will stand at the bottom of the stairs i will send them here fit them with electric light but do not pierce them there will be six lamps in each of eight candlepower it was extremely characteristic of mr palmer that he went thus into everything himself nothing escaped him he grasped at once the difficulty of bringing the diningroom into directer communication with the kitchen a problem that had puzzled his architect and solved it in five minutes by a lift and shutter arrangement so simple that it seemed mere idiocy not to have thought of it he went into every servants bedroom every bathroom into the sculleries the coalhole the winecellar and knew immediately what was wanted and the more he saw of the house the better it pleased him the big oak staircase to the receptionrooms was admirable and more than admirable was the circular diningroom with its walls panelled in excellent italian boiseries and its cupolashaped roof with carved converging wreaths of fruit and flowers with his amazing knowledge of furniture and decoration he had in an hours time chosen the scheme for every room in the house and provided the dealers the paperers the painters with a weeks work in looking out and bringing for his inspection the kind of thing he wanted but it was not his way to allow a week for a weeks work and these gentleman were appointed to meet him there again in three days time to submit for his approval carpets papers rugs tables chairs kitchen ranges refrigerators wardrobes and specimens of carving then at exactly three minutes to two he again stepped into his motor to go back to the carlton where bertie keynes was to lunch with him there were other people there as well he found waiting for him when he got back and it was not possible for him to talk privately as he intended to do to his future soninlaw he had observed him once or twice during lunch not eating much and apparently rather silent and abstracted and wondered vaguely if anything was the matter he guessed indeed that some money difficulty or accumulation of debts might be bothering him but as his talk with him was to be partly on that subject he considered that if that was the cause berties evident preoccupation would not last very long he had seen a good deal of him in america and was very welldisposed towards him partly because bertie was such an eminently likeable young man but mainly because amelie was so fond of him for lewis palmera thing which most people would have been inclined to doubthad a heart his business which occupied him it is true more than anything else in the world was to him a thing quite apart from his human life and human affections in it he was as relentless and as hard as it is possible for a man to be as far as an affair was business he was without pity or compassion for business is as inhuman a science as algebra and as unemotional if properly conducted as quadratic equations a heart in such spheres would be anomalousalmost an impropriety had bertiea thing which he had no thought of doingcrossed lewis palmers path in such a connection he would have had not the slightest compunction in obliterating him if he was of the nature of an obstacle however minute but as the affianced of amelie he was something of an object even of tenderness he had a few words with him after lunch arrived last night bertie he asked glad to see you how are they all bertie pulled himself together and smiled all sorts of messages to you he said they miss you awfully i guess im not missed most remarked mr palmer can you wait here half an hour or so i want to talk to you but ive got other things that wont wait bertie looked at his watch i can be back in an hour he said if that will do yes an hour from now quarter to four then and he nodded to him shut up his heart again and dismissed him from his thoughts as completely as he had left the room bertie as mr palmer had supposed had arrived in london only the evening before and since gallio was out of town spending in point of fact a most unremunerative fortnight at monte carlo on a system which lost infallibly though slowly had at his invitation taken possession of his chambers in jermyn street he had come down to breakfast in as happy and contented a frame of mind as any young man gifted with good digestion and a charming girl to whom he was engaged need hope ever to find himself and had seen with some satisfaction that there was only one letter waiting for him he had expected rather to find creditors clamouring round him for he had a respectable number of them waiting for his leisure cash and had supposed that they would very politely have notified him of their existence as soon as he arrived but there was only one letter for him he opened it its purport was as simple as a statement of accounts and typewritten it began dear sir i have the honour to remind you of a document from which i have extracted the following then in neat marks of quotation were appended certain sentences why did you bewitch me if it was not for this when i am with you i am tonguetied even now my hand halts as i think of you you are the only woman in the world for me i offer you all i am and have and shall be and shall have there was a decent space left after these and other quotationsa silence of good manners then the letter continued mrs emsworth has reason to believe that you are about to marry miss amelie palmer she therefore offers you the chance of regaining possession of the letter from which we have given you extracts for the sum of ten thousand pounds l should you decide to accept her offer you are requested to draw a cheque for the abovementioned sum to the account of her present manager mr harold bilton who on receipt of it will forward to you a sealed envelope containing the complete letter from which the above are extracts should this not reach you within twentyfour hours you are at liberty to stop the cheque if however such cheque does not reach mr harold bilton by the evening of january he will post the sealed packet in his possession of the contents of which he has no idea containing the original letter from which the above are extracts to mr lewis s palmer carlton hotel london he has been instructed to do this on behalf of mrs emsworth without admitting any discussion or temporizing on your part we are sir your respectful obedient servants a b c the postmark on the envelope was london w and the envelope was typewritten in purple ink berties mouth when he read this got suddenly dry and with a hand that he observed was quite steady he poured himself out a cup of tea and sipped it reading the letter through again also he had a horrible feeling of emptiness inside him resembling great hunger but of some sickly kind for so far from being hungry he could not touch the eggs and bacon to which he had just helped himself he could not yet even begin to think but again he filled his cup with tea again drank it and again read the letter then he suddenly felt hot stifled and though the morning was of a brisk chilliness he went to the window and leaned out he was aware that a cold sweat had gathered on his forehead and he wiped it away then all at once his feeling of physical faintness and thirst left him altogether and he was back in his room lighted a cigarette and sat down squarely on his sofa to think the matter out his first impulsenamely to go straight to mr palmer with the letterdid not last long he had told him after amelie had accepted him in answer to questions which were very delicately put that there were no pages in his past life which he feared mr palmer with the tact and finesse which is inseparable from great ability had indicated his meaning with absolute precision and clearness he had not hinted that he wished bertie to confess any liaisons he might ever have had he only asked him with considerable solemnity to assure him that he had done nothing which coming to light at a future time could humanly speaking bring unhappiness to and possibly rupture between him and amelie he had not pressed him for an answer immediately think it all over he had said and tell me tomorrow young men will be young men as long as women are women i dont mean that what i do mean is whether anyone can rake things up afterwards if anyone can i should like to know about it i neednt ask you to be straight with me i guess you are straight without being asked now it had not occurred to bertie to tell him about mrs emsworth for the very simple reason that he was quite innocent that he had been foolishmad if you willwas perfectly true but morally he was clean and now at this moment she was on tour in americawhere he had no notion bilton no doubt knew but bilton had been instructed to admit no discussion of any kind and tomorrow would be january his second impulse was also shortlivednamely to go straight with the letter to scotland yard but what did that mean an action for blackmail against mrs emsworth a dragging into the public view all that had happened a feast for the carrioncrows of london and for himwell celibacy for mrs emsworth clever woman as she was knew well what justice is done by the world to those who invoke the justice of the law the verdict of the world is always the same there must have been something in it and though every judge and jury in the land might testify to his innocence the world would simply shrug its shoulders there must have been something in it for it is not in the least necessary to touch pitch to be defiled it is quite sufficient if somebody points a casual finger at you and merely says pitch yes it was on this that she the blackmailer counted here lay her securitynamely that his bringing her to justice meant that he must lay himself open to the justice of the world and what justice in that case would mr palmer give him if he was to know at all it must be bertie who told him and bertie knew he could not after the assurance he had given him for a moment his brain deserted the question of what to do and put in as a parenthesis that the blackmail scheme had been brilliantly planned it was excellently timed it gave him quite long enough to think the matter over and not rush as he might possibly have done in desperation to mr palmer or scotland yard if he had only been given an hour or so to decide and at the same time it did not give him an opportunity of communicating with mrs emsworth the extracts too were cleverly chosen their genuineness he could not doubt and they gave him a very fair idea of the impression that the whole letter would make on an unbiassed mind then suddenly he sprang to his feet but i am not guilty he cried my god i am not guilty his fit of passion subsided as suddenly as it had sprung up and his thoughts turned to dorothy he remembered with great distinctness his interview with her on the morning after her debut in new york and the uneasiness with which what his sober self thought was mere chaff had inspired him but afterwards at their various meetings in new york and down at long island he had been quite at his ease again and ashamed of his momentary suspicions she was a better actress than he knew it appeared for never did anything seem to him more genuine than her kindliness towards him she had made friends with amelie too for amelie had told him of their meeting in the dewy gardens of her entrancing way with children which had quite won her heart thenthis then a third alternative struck him what if he did nothing just waited to see if anything would happen if by tomorrow evening he had not paid this hideous sum to his blackmailer but again he turned back daunted the whole plot had been too elaborately too neatly laid to allow him to think that the threat would not be carried out if in a sudden passion dorothy had threatened to send the letter to mr palmer he might so he thought have reasoned with her appealed to her pity appealed above all to her knowledge of his innocence he might even have threatened have coolly and seriously told her that he would lay information against her unless she gave up his letter to him but he was not dealing he felt with a woman in a passion he was dealing with a cold wellplanned plot conceived perhaps in anger but thought out by a very calm and calculating brain there was not he felt even an outside chance that having worked it out so carefully she would hold her hand at the last moment true he held now in his own hand evidence against her for blackmail sufficient to secure her if he chose a severe sentence only he could not do it he had not nerve enough to take that step she had calculated on that no doubt she had calculated correctly then this money must be raised somehow there was no way out in order to silence a false accusation against himself he had to pay l it was this question of how to get it that he carried about with him all the morning and this that had sat beside him at lunch gallio might possibly lend it him but it would entail telling gallio the whole story which he did not in the least wish to do however if no better means offered itself he determined to telegraph to him that evening and so at a quarter to four his brain still going its dreary rounds from point to point of his difficulties he again presented himself at the carlton he was shown by the noiseless valet through the noiseless door of mr palmers sittingroom the latter had not heard him enter and bertie in the strangeness of the sight that met his eye forgot for a moment his own entanglements for lewis palmer was seated in an easychair by the window doing nothing his arms hung limply by his side his head was half sunk into his chest and his whole attitude expressed a lassitude that was indescribable but next minute he half turned his head languidly towards the door and saw bertie standing there ah come in come in he said i was waiting for you no you are not late he rose bertie never be a very rich man he said it is a damnable slavery you cant stop you have to go on you cant rest you are in the mill and the mill keeps on turning he stood silent a moment then pulled himself together i hope nobody overheard he said they would think i was mad now and then just now and then i get like that and then i would give all i have to get somebody to press out the wrinkles in my brain and let it rest i should be quite content to be poor if i could forget all this fever in which my life has been spent i might even do something as an art critic there its all over sit down there are the cigars by you now you talked to me straight enough once before he went on and told me i believe the exact truth i wanted you to start with amelie with a clean sheet in that direction and i want you to have a clean sheet in another i want you to pay off all your debts all mind dont come to me with more afterwards i know its difficult to state the whole please try to do so take time bertie sat quite still a moment with a huge upleap of relief in his mind i cant tell you accurately he said but i am afraid they are rather large well a million pounds suggested mr palmer dryly bertie laughed already he could laugh no not quite he said but between ten thousand and twenty about twelve i should say confiding people english tradesmen remarked mr palmer been going to the jews no well dont my house doesnt charge so high now im not going to give you the money i shall deduct it from the settlement i am going to make the amount of which i have already determined on only i shall give you that at once and ask you to pay them at once you are most generous said bertie i cant thank you dont then are you sure thirteen thousand will cover them mind it doesnt matter to me it is all deducted i am sure it will mr palmer did not answer but drew a chair to the table and wrote the cheque pay them at once then he said now you looked worried at lunch anything wrong it was said bertie it isnt now mr palmer looked at him a moment with strong approval i like you he said now go away the mill has to commence again the relief was as profound as the oppression had been and now that the strain was over bertie was conscious of a luxurious relaxation the tension and strain on his nerves had passed and a feeling of happy weariness as when a dreaded operation is well over set in he could scarcely yet find it in his mind to be bitter or angry even with mrs emsworth she had done a vile thing but he would not any longer be in her power and being free from it he scarcely resented it so strong was his relief mr palmer he knew had designed to make some settlement of money on him what it was to be he did not yet know but the fact that this had been deducted from it prevented his feeling that he had come by the money in any crooked fashion as it was a certain payment to be made to him had been partly anticipated and he looked forward to paying his blackmail almost with eagerness he made an appointment by telegraph with bilton for the next morning and at the hour waited on him at his office in pall mall he had always rather liked the man his practical shrewdness the entire absence of what might be called nonsense about him a certain hard definite clearness about him and his ways was somehow satisfactory to the mind and this morning these characteristics were peculiarly developed he gave bertie a blunt and genuine welcome delighted to see you he said just come over havent you smoke bertie took a cigarette ive called about some business connected with mrs emsworth he said i am here to settle it bilton looked puzzled a moment mrs emsworth he said business with mrs emsworth ah i remember she sent me certain instructions some time ago lets see where did i put them he took down an alphabetical lettercase from a shelf and after a short search drew out a packet thats it he said ah i see there is no discussion to pass between us curious love of mystery a woman has especially when there is nothing to make a mystery about as i dare say is the case here you dont know what the business is asked bertie i only know these instructions and one of them if you will pardon me reminding you is that no discussion is to pass between us you are to deliver to me a cheque which i am to place to her account and i am to deliver to you a sealed packet this is it is it not yes you are also to deliver to me a certain letter which i am to verify and then destroy in your presence i heard nothing of that said bertie it is in my instructions said bilton i cant give up that letter said bertie it he stopped bilton got up i am afraid i can do nothing then he said except fulfil the rest of mrs emsworths directions and if this is not done by the evening of january today give the packet to mr palmer he referred again to one of the papers he had taken out yes give the packet to mr palmer he repeated which you intend to do bertie asked certainly at the same time i may tell you that i have written a very strong letter to mrs emsworth protesting against her making use of me inin private matters of this kind i am a busy manand he looked at his watchi have no taste for other peoples intrigues bertie thought intently for a moment if he gave up the letter he would be powerless in the future to prove anything with regard to the blackmail the fact that he had drawn a cheque for l to bilton was in itself nothing to show that he had done so under threats especially if as it suddenly occurred to him bilton was if not in league with mrs emsworth at any rate cognizant of her action on the other hand if he refused he had to risk that letter of his being sent to mr palmer he had been unable to face that risk before and it was as unfaceable now but the idea that bilton was concerned in this was interesting it had been suggested by the slight overemphasizing of the fact that he was busy by the looking at his watch that was however vaguely threatening it implied time was short or that he himself was concerned in berties acceptation of the ultimatum bilton sat down again and tapped with his fingers on the table excuse me lord keynes he said but no purpose is served by our sitting here like this you will of course please yourself in this matter here is the packet for you if you decide one way there is the letterbox if you decide the other the speech was wellchosen and left no room for doubt in berties mind that the letterbox would be used he took the desired document from his pocket here is the cheque he said and here is the letter the latter you say you are going to verify i on my side i suppose may verify what you give me bilton appeared to consider this for a moment there was nothing said about that he remarked but i feel certain that the lady would be willing to let you receive proof of her honourable dealing with you did you say honourable dealing asked bertie in a tone which required no answer bilton opened the letter bertie gave him referred to a paper out of the alphabetical case looked at the cheque and handed him the packet bertie glanced at it saw enough and put it in his pocket thats correct then said bilton bertie rose next time you see mrs emsworth pray congratulate her for me he said she has missed her vocation by going on the stage i am inclined to disagree with you said bilton it has developed her sense of plot must you be going goodbye i suppose you are off to america again in a month you may meet her there that is not possible said bertie biltons smile which sped the parting guest did not at once fade when the guest had gone it remained a smile of amusement on his face for a considerable time god what a fool he permitted himself to remark as he settled down to his work again chapter xiii some three weeks after this ginger was occupying the whole of the most comfortable sofa in the rooms of his father occupied by bertie and was conversing to him in his usual amiable manner the rooms wore the look of those belonging to a man shortly to take a journey there were packets and parcels lying about a bag gaped openmouthed on a chair and bertie himself was sorting and tearing up papers at a desk listening with half an ear to the equable flow of gingers conversation he had a good deal to say and a good deal to ask about but with the instinct of the skilled conversationalist he did not bring out his news in spate nor ask a succession of questions but ambled easily so to speak up and down the lanes and byways of intercourse only occasionally emerging on to the highroads it may appear odd he was just saying but i never was in these rooms before gallio has never asked me here i am glad to see that he appears to make himself fairly comfortable i suppose he is at monte carlo still heard from him bertie yes a letter of extreme approbation at my marriage and a regret that he will be unable to visit america for it also a cheque for l as a weddingpresent out of his hardly lost losings he says gallios in funds now or was till he went to monte carlo remarked ginger he got two hundred thousand for the sale of molesworth but he has to settle half of it on you doesnt he and where do i come in you dont im afraid i think gallio made a very good bargain said ginger but i think it remains to be seen whether mr palmer didnt make a better hows that whether with his american spirit of enterprise he wont begin digging for the fabulous coal which was supposed to exist bertie looked up turn molesworth into a colliery he wont find it very easy you see he has settled it on amelie or rather is going to on our marriage by gad he does things in style said ginger and you think amelie would not allow it i think she would attach some weight to my wishes do you feel strongly about it i thought you were rather in favour of its being done when it was spoken of before i know there was an awful need of money it is a necessity before which sentiment must give way but now there is not and my sentiment is rather strong after all it has been ours a good long time and now we can afford to keep the coal underfoot if it is there at all besides do you know for certain that he has any thought of it no bilton put it into my head said ginger he hinted that mr palmer had made a good bargain he seemed rather elated at something so i did not question him further i dont like elated people i suppose he had made some good bargain or done somebody in the eye that is the american idea of humour he went off to davos the other day bertie again looked up hasnt he realized the fruitlessness of that yet he asked sybil refused him pointblank i know and really when she follows that up by going out to davos to coax charlie back to life you would have thought that a third party was notwell exactly of the party sybil is an enigma said ginger she went to america in the autumn with the avowed intention of getting married with bilton indicated she comes back in a scurry refuses him and instantly constitutes herself lifepreserver to charlie whom she had also refused what is she playing at thats what i want to know bertie took up a quantity of wastepapers and thrust them down into the basket shes not playing at anything just now he said shes just being a human woman trying to save the life of a friend judy talked to me about it the only interest in life to charlie was she and she is trying to get him to take an interest in life that isnt her that will require some delicacy of touch remarked ginger it will she has itwhether enough remains to be seen charlie had one foot in the grave when she came back im told she has taken that out anyhow but does she mean to marry him asked ginger i cant believe she will succeed in getting him back to life without anyhow holding that out as a prospect its really a delicate position said bertie and it is made more interesting by the fact that physically charlie is so like bilton in other respects he added they are remarkably dissimilar do you like him no i have got an awful distaste for him why i dont quite know that rather accentuates it ginger sat up from his reclining attitude bertie im awfully interested in one thing and i havent seen you since you came back he said was there anywell any difficulty with dorothy emsworth bertie paused in his labours divided in his mind as to whether he should tell ginger or not he had a great opinion of his shrewdness but having himself managed his crisis paid up and got back the letter he did not consider that there was any need for advice or counsel from anybody so he decided not to tell him she was quite friendly in america he said i saw her several times she even stayed down at port washington ginger as has been seen was immensely interested in other peoples affairs having none as he said of his own which could possibly interest anybody on this occasion he could not quite stifle his curiosity i remember you telling me that you once wrote her a veryvery friendly letter he said certainly it is in my possession now i keep it as an interesting memento ginger shuddered slightly i should as soon think of keeping a corpse he said burn it shes rather a brick to have given it you back though sort of weddingpresent yes a valuable one does she still carry on with bilton asked ginger i dont know well i hope she didnt show it him before she returned it said the other january in london with few exceptions had been a month of raw and foggy daysdays that were bitter cold with the coldness of a damp cloth and stuffy with the airlessness of that which a damp cloth covers far otherwise was it at davos where morning after morning after nights of still intense cold the sun rose over the snowcovered hills and flamed like a golden giant rejoicing in his strength through the arc of crystalline blue much snow had fallen in december but when the fall was past the triumphant serenity of the brilliant climate reasserted itself the pines above the long onestreeted village had long ago shaken themselves clear of their covering and stood out like large black holes burned in the hillside of white day after day the divine windlessness of the high alpine valley had communicated something of its briskness to those fortunate enough to be there and the exhilaration of the atmosphere seemed to percolate into minds of not more than ordinary vivacity the village itself lies on a gentle down gradient of road some mile in length where alpine chalets jostle with huge modern hotels below lies the puffy little railway which climbs through the pinewoods above the town and communicates in many loops and detours with the larger routes and straight underneath the centre of the village is the skatingrink where happy folk all day slide with set purpose on the elusive material and with great content perform mystic evolutions of the most complicated order others by the aid of the puffy railway mount to the top of the hills above the town and spend enraptured days in sliding down again on toboggans to the village of klosters motion in fact of any other sort than that of walking is the aim and object of davos lifean instinct dictated and rendered necessary by the keen exhilaration of the air at no other place in the world perhaps is the sluggard so goaded to physical activity at no other perhaps is the active brain so lulled or intoxicated into quiescence it lies in fact basking and smiling while the rejuvenated body free from the low and cramping effects of thought goes rejoicing on its way charlie by reason of his malady had been debarred from taking either much or violent exercise he had been told to be out always and to be idle usually this he found extremely easy for his mother was there to be idle with him and sybil was there to furnish entertainment for both with her usual decision and eye for fitness she had seen at once that for the present there was only one thing in the world worth doingnamely skating she skated extremely badly but with an enjoyment that was almost pathetic in consideration of the persistence of frequent fall thus morning after morning she setting out at earlier hours would be followed down to the rink by charlie and his mother where they would lunch together returning to the hotel before dark fell for the cosy brightness of the long winter evenings mrs brancepeth was a widow cultivated intelligent and gifted with a discernment that was at times really rather awkward to herself though never to those to whom she applied it since she never used what her intuition had enabled her to see to their discomfort this gift put her into very accurate possession of the state of affairs between charlie and sybil it was clear to her that is to say that sybil was wiling him back into the desire to live waking his dormant interests as if by oftrepeated little electric shocks of her own vitality charming him back into life she knew of course the state of her sons feelings towards sybil and did her the justice of allowing that not byword or look direct or indirect did she ever hold herself out as the prize for which life was worth living indeed mrs brancepeth admired with all the highlydeveloped power of appreciation that was in her the constant effacement of herself which sybil practisedeffacement that is of the personal element while by all healthy and impersonal channels she tried to rekindle his love for life whatever wasso sybils gospel appeared to runwas worth attention her own falls on the ice were matters for amused comment the outside edge was per se a thing of beauty the stately march of the sun was enough to turn one parsee enthusiastic vitally active as sybil always had been it required less penetration than mrs brancepeth possessed to see that her amazing flood of vitality was deliberately outpoured for the sake of charlie this was the more evident to her by the fact that sybil when alone with her subsided sank into herself and rested from an effort at times indeed when charlie was not there she was almost peevish which in a woman of equable temper is a sure sign of some overtaxed function such an instance occurred so mrs brancepeth thought on an evening shortly before bilton arrived at davos in the six weeks that they had now spent there the elder woman had got to know the younger very well to like her immensely and to respect with almost a sense of awe the extreme cleverness with which she managed her affair the affair was briefly to her mind to make charlie take a normal interest in life again without exciting an abnormal interest in herselfto transfer his affection in fact from herself to life they had dined together that evening at their small table at the beau site and sybil had traced loops on the tablecloth with a wineglass and sketched threes and brackets to a centre with the prong of a fork yes it sounds silly she said but it is the most fascinating thing in the world to try to do anything which you at present believe yourself incapable of doing i have no eye for colour at all therefore two years ago i took violently as charlie remembers to painting i have no eye for balance therefore now i spend my day in trying to execute complicated movements which depend entirely on it charlies eye lit up the quest of the impossible he said how i sympathize this was direct enough with returning health he had got far greater directness mrs brancepeth waited for sybils reply it came as direct as his oh charlie you always confuse things she said you do not mean the quest of the impossible but the quest of the improbable the quest of the improbable is the secret of our striving anyone can grasp the impossible it is merely an affair of the imagination i can amuse myself by planning out what my life would be if i were a man what i cannot do is to plan out for myself a successful career as a woman surely you have plans enough said mrs brancepeth no no plans said sybil desires merely i have lots of desires one is control of the outside edge that is unrealized dear charlie you look so well this evening that is another of my plans it is getting on he gained two pounds last week said his mother how nice i lost a hundred because i speculated on the stock exchange it sounds rather grand to speculate but it wasnt at all grand what happened was that a pleasant young gentleman here whose name i dont know said two days ago to me buy east rands i bought a hundred they went down a point i sold but i bought many emotions with my hundred pounds one was that one could get interested in anything whether one knew what it was or not as long as one put money into it and if money interests you surely anything else will this tooso mrs brancepeth interpreted itwas a successful red herring drawn across the path charlie appeared equally interested ah you are wrong there sybil he said money in excelsis must be the most interesting thing in the world there is nothing it cannot do oh it can do everything that is not worth doing interrupted sybil i grant that and most things that are he continued for except content which it will not bring you there is nothing which is not in its sphere toothache said sybil promptly i had three minutes toothache yesterday and was miserable painless extraction but not the courage for extraction said she i always think that extraction is at the root of it one can get along all right with what one has not got what one cannot do is to part with something that one has which gives pain mrs brancepeth tapped with the handle of her fork on the table this is irrelevant she said the question before the house is the power of money dear mrs brancepeth said sybil please dont let us discuss let us babble in a little while our lips are dumb as some depressing poet says poets are so often depressing sybil is the most prosaic poet i know said charlie she casts her thought really in the mould of poetry and before it is cold she hammers it to prose she is the only person i know who has the romantic temperament and is ashamed of it not ashamed of it cried she but it is not current coin i hammer the metal into currency and he calls me prosaic the ice was thin here so thought mrs brancepeth everyone has the same difficulty she said one has either to hammer ones poetry into prose before it is current or trick out ones prose into poetry the raw product of any of usthat is what it comes todoes not pass ah but what is the raw product said charlie if one knew one would use it but no one knows about himself know thyselfthe first of mottoes and like all mottoes impossible to act upon if you know other people it is a good working basis about ones self said sybil one is very averagethat is the important thing to remember but if everybody is average why does a single out b asked charlie why not c or d up to z sybil finished her pudding i dont know she said probably because b comes firstis next to a about moneyof course it will not give you content content is a matter of temperament but it will give you the power to gratify any taste and considering how many beautiful things there are in the world it is a confession of idiocy or of want of taste which is the same thing not to be able to be absorbed in some one of them that is quite true said mrs brancepeth and it matters hardly at all what one is absorbed in so long as one is absorbed charlie responded to this and ones power of absorption depends almost entirely on health said he the evening post came in on this and not long after charlie went upstairs to answer certain letters which had come for him leaving the other two together since the arrival of the post sybil had become very silent and preoccupied one letter in fact she read three times over with silent frownings between each perusal at length she rose took a turn or two up the room and spoke i have had disquieting news she said and i want advice do tell me dear said mrs brancepeth i will do my best i dont know if you know mr bilton she said i have just heard from him he is starting tomorrow for davos charlie has mentioned him said the other you know who he is then said sybil shortly before i left england he proposed to me i refused him i dont want him to come here but how is it possible for me to stop him she faced about and stood opposite the elder woman what am i to do she asked he is strong masterful i am afraid of him and it will take a great deal of nervous force out of me now i cant spare that she paused a moment perhaps i had better say straight out what i mean she said i am having rather a hard time as it is that i take on myself very willingly but every day leaves me more and more tired when the need for playing up is over but it is worth it i should be a very feeble creature if i did not feel that because he is getting better is he not mrs brancepeth laid her hand on sybil every day i thank god for what you are doing she said and i thank you butbut i suppose i have been more sanguine than i should is there no chance for charlie sybil threw her arms out with a hopeless gesture i dont knowliterally i dont know i like him so much that i cant offer him only liking and i dont know that i have anything more to offer him it is all very difficult i dont suppose there is a woman in the world who knows herself so badly as i do and i used to think i was so decisive so clear cut what is happening to me mrs brancepeth looked at her with a wonderful tenderness and pity she had often noticed how completely she was in the clutch of her temperament how the mood of the moment completely blotted out all other landmarks and guidingposts which experience from without and her own character from within might have been supposed to be of some directing value in perplexities but it was not so with her in such things she was a child ruled by the impulsenot led by the reason nor steered by any formed character with her the present moment so blotted out the past that all precedents all warnings all points which ninetynine grownup people out of a hundred have to help their decisions were with her simply nonexistent if the present moment was pleasant she abandoned herself to childish delight if perplexing she was the prey of insoluble doubts she had a passion for analysis but her analysis brilliant as it often was was as fruitless as the japanese cherry it was the process of thought which she loved to dissect and having dissected it she threw it away all this mrs brancepeth sawsaw too that sybils was a nature to which it was no use to preach principles the practical dealing with the concrete instance was all that could help her tell me more about mr bilton she said he is dominating said sybil i was greatly attracted by him then he did something disgusting or so i thought it and i was disillusioned i even began to dislike him but he has force and it will need force on my part to fight him what will the result be i shall have less force to fight charlies microbes for him yes that is what you are doing said mrs brancepeth softly and even here even when i see most clearly how much better he is getting i ask myself whether i am doing wisely or not continued sybil what will the end be is he filled with certain hopes which i cannot say will ever be realized and what if he is disappointed of them there was no reply and after a minute she went on mr bilton will arrive in two days she said he will come to this hotel it is impossible for me to cut him not to recognise him he is quite extraordinarily like charlie by the way i must speak to him when he speaks to me i must behave decently and i knowoh how well i know ithe will interest me again i shall be forced to be interested there is that about himsome force some relentless sort of machinery that goes grinding on pulverizing what gets in its way mrs brancepeth rose now dear be quiet she said you are working yourself up about it dont do that dont whip up your imagination on the subject you take things too vividly sybil smiled rather hopelessly that does not help matters she said some people take them not vividly enough i am myself you are yourself the broad lines of each of us are inexorably laid down for us all we can do is not to make a very shocking mess of them we are all unsatisfactory no i dont think you are you are very nice and restful now what am i to donot about bilton i mean but now this minute that is always so important mrs brancepeth laughed and that is so like you she said go to bed dear and dream as vividly as you can of the outside edge bilton arrived two days afterwards and as was quite natural paid a call on his friends before dinner in their sittingroom as chance would have it neither charlie nor his mother were in and he found sybil alone she rose and shook hands with him as he entered but gave him no smile i was surprised to get your letter she said i thought you were too busy to come out to this very idle place i chose it for its idleness he said i was very tired and i have a busy time ahead of me again it is economical to spend a fortnight in complete idleness rather than let your work suffer for a year he paused a moment that was my excuse he said i had also a reason sybil felt a sudden anger with him which flared up and died down again as he went on i am glad to find you alone he said because i wanted to see you i had to see you i was thirsty for the sight of you but do not be afraid i shall not make myself importunate i shall say nothing to offend you i shall not entreat you by word or look i just wantedwanted to see you that is all he spoke rather low and rather more slowly than his wont but next moment he resumed the ordinary tone of his speech i came here a couple of years ago said he and i carried away with me an extraordinary sense of coolness and rest i think ones brain goes to sleep here we americans need that we have awful insomnia of the brain i want to go sliding on a silly sledge down a steep place i want to fall about on skates and not read the paper sybil laughed there had been a certain modesty and good taste in his first speech that had rather touched her and from that he had gone straight to ordinary converse the assurance of the harmlessness of his intentions seemed to her very genuine as a matter of fact it was profoundly calculated and produced just the effect he wanted for he particularly desired to be admitted without embarrassment or delay into the others party to charlies mind this additionfor though bilton never seemed to intrude himself yet he usually was therewas nothing more at first than a slight nuisance more than that it could not be called since he knew of sybils complete and final rejection of bilton as a lover and it was not consonant with the sweetness of his own nature to be rendered jealous and exacting about her friends but by degreesso gradual that he could not notice the growth of the feeling but only register the fact that it had grownhe became aware of uneasiness of mind which as it increased diminished from the great content in which he had passed the earlier weeks of their stay at davos also he began to realize that in the shade of his mind there had grown up unconsciously a hopeor if not a hope the possibility of the hopethat he himself might find in her some day more than a friend he had often asked himself before whether he still cherished and watered the tender seedling and as often he had honestly told himself that he did not but biltons coming and the terms he was on with sybil cast a light into his own dark places and he knew that that hops was still not rooted up from his mind and realizing this he realized how vital such a hope was to him sybil too during the ten days following biltons arrival had insensibly changed in her attitude towards him having definitely decided that he should not be her lover she speedily began to find in him excellences as a friend which she had scarcely realized before as a lover she had found him wanting a certain coarseness of nature in him prevented her from receiving him on that footing but once off that ground this coarseness almost ceased to offend her at any rate transferred on to the less intimate plane it ranked a minus of the same calibre as one of his numerous pluses among these his practical qualities greatly appealed to herhis quickness at grasping the salient points of any question his very firm hold on concrete affairs from the quickest and securest way of tying a bootlace to his lucid exposition of american finance as typified in that napoleon lewis palmer or his knowledge in his own business of what constituted a play that would draw on a hundred occasions every day she had some exhibition of this brought to her notice in whatever he did or said he showed efficiency that quality as she had settled was not one to be loved but socially she delighted in it moreover the force she had feared seemed to be in abeyance he made no demands on her nervous energies that she recognised as demands now love though proverbially blind is often very prone to see something which has no existence whatever and before long charlie began to conjure up a very complete phantom which would have done credit to a much finer imagination than he really possessed had not he viewed the situation through the eyes of a lover to whose vision all is intensified he saw what was true that sybil listened with very genuine interest to what bilton had to say he saw her an eager pupil of that excellent skater he saw if some expedition was projected that she left all the arrangements of sleighs and food in his hands to the unbiassed observer nothing could have been more natural for he talked well on subjects that interested her he gave her valuable aid towards accomplishing the elusive outside back edge and his arrangements in expeditions were admirable for sleighs were punctual and nothing was forgotten out of the luncheonbasket but charlie was not unbiassed and the conclusions that slowly and silently formed themselves in his mind were both untrue in the abstract and in the concrete unjust to her he was still sufficiently young to have an attack of childishness and he was quite sufficiently in love with her to be a prey to jealousy the second week of biltons stay had passed and still he dropped no hint about his imminent return and on this particular morning after a rather worried week rendered not more easy because he kept his worries strictly to himself charlie had just returned rather gloomily from a visit to his doctor during the last ten days he had gone down a little in weight and though the doctor would have preferred it otherwise he reminded him that he must have ups and downs no cure was uninterrupted progress but this piled on the top of his other cares which were rendered harder to bear by a couple of days of south wind instead of the cold purity of windlessness unduly depressed him and sybil coming out of the hotel to the sheltered corner of the veranda which he usually occupied in the morning found him somewhat listless and dejected but with tact which had often succeeded before she affected not to notice it and discoursed on indifferent subjects such a bore she said the road down the valley is too soft for sleighing and the rink is too sloppy for skating charlie brightened up a little he seemed to have seen much less of her lately so youre going to have an idle day he said sit and talk to me well we are going out almost immediately she said just to go down the schwester tobogganrun which they say is still possible i wish you could come charlie but theres no way of getting up except walking charlie instantly froze into himself im afraid thats quite impossible he said youre going with bilton i suppose yes i rather think hes waiting for me charlie registered to himself the fact that she had not asked for the doctors report of him though monday was his regular day for being overhauled never keep people waiting he said and opened a book then his better disposition came to his aid i hope it will be possible for you to get a good run he said cordially it is horrid this weather is it not horridquite horrid she said well goodbye your mother will be out directly he sat there after she had left him with book open but not reading a pale watery sun instead of the golden monarch enthroned in cloudless blue peered like a white plate through the clouds blown up by the south wind and instead of a dry and vivifying air the atmosphere was loaded with moisture the eaves dripped with the melting snow and every now and then with a whisper and a thud some sheet would detach itself form a houseroof and plunge into the roadway below instead of presenting an expanse of crystalline whiteness the snowfields were stained and yellowish to the eye hideous corners of corrugated roofs showed where the coverlet of white had slipped all the raw discomfort of a thaw was in the air to charlie both owing to his physical condition and his unspoken trouble the heavy chilliness of the day was peculiarly oppressive his mother also was detained indoors and for an hour he was prey to the gloomiest reflections it was all no use so lie told himself since october he had heartily tried with all his power both to get better and to recapture the normal joy of living but now as so often happened he had begun to slip back again next week no doubt would tell a further tale of hardlyearned ground lost and week would follow week and he would slip back and back even if he pulled through even if he became strong again what was there in life for him worth recovering for he had thoughtdeluded himself into thinkingthat perhaps sybil might come to care for him but with sudden bitter intuition he guessed that he was really no nearer winning her love than he had been before he had been taken ill great compassion the divine womanly instinct to help a man had brought her out here the improvement in his health the successful combating of his disease was due to that but it was but a bitter gift she had brought him it was as if she had brought him through some illness only to give him over to the hangman at the last and she had not asked about the doctors report that seemed to him in his disordered frame of mind to clinch the matter instead she had gone off tobogganing with bilton true she had refused him in the autumn but how many marriages have been prefaced by that charlie shivered slightly and looked about him for a rug for the damp of the day made a man chilly where the dryness of far greater cold would have been but warming and invigorating but he had not brought one out and saying to himself that he would go in to fetch one in a minute he still sat on looking for a break in the clouds that encompassed him but he could not find one the taste had gone out of the world again the schwester run had been in unexpectedly good order and sybil did not get back to the hotel till late in the afternoon the weather had cleared since noon and about twilight the curtain of clouds had been dispersed the south wind had ceased and the splendid frosty stars again hung embroidered on the velvet of the night instead of plunging through the snow before they reached the hotel their footsteps went crisply on the crackly crust and the steel runners of their trailing toboggans sang like teakettles as they slid over the refrozen surface already her spirits had been high and with the increased exhilaration of the air they rose to nonsense point climate climate she was sayinghow is it that people worship money and brains and beauty and never worship climate which is the one thing in the world that matters of course you dont think that because you live in new york which is unbearable threequarters of the year and intolerable the restisnt that itand get accustomed to doing without climate just as you train oysters to live out of water until you are ready to eat them but to me nothing but climate is really of any importance i am so much better than when i came here and i was quite well when i came she added it seems to have suited charlie brancepeth very well said bilton yes hes much better soon hell be quite well he gets more like you mr bilton as he regains his health every day it really is very odd because i dont suppose two people were ever so unlike in character but the climate here has been good for your character as well as charlies lungs have i improved im delighted to hear it i thought i was a hopeless case not at allno more hopeless than charlie you have developed a side your character which i hardly suspected you of having and are beginning to take perfectly frivolous pursuits with great seriousness you were much more annoyed at losing ten seconds today in that spill than you were at losing your cigarettecase i have been a pupil thats all he said i have been well taught since i have been here tanti complimenti said she really when you came i was afraid you would be absorbed in telegrams and bargains and bulls and bears but you have not you have played very nicely how much longer do you stop they had come to the hotel and were passing the big squares of light cast by the hall windows he dropped the rope of his toboggan as she asked this and stopped to pick it up looking her full in the face i shall go when i am told he said not a day before she looked at him and understood it was the first personal word he had said to her since the little interview on her arrival but it was so modest again so selfobliterating that it did not offend her with a sense that he had broken his word when he promised not to speak to her again on intimate subjects it was sufficient to remind him of it very gently just to cool him off so to speak we should all miss you i am sure she said charlie did not appear at dinner that evening he had caught a little chill it appeared in the morning and had gone to bed in a good deal of discomfort with a somewhat high temperature mrs brancepeth though she would not confess to any anxiety yet felt anxious and as soon as dinner was over went off to see how he was she came back before many minutes were over and signalled to sybil across the salon who got up at once and followed her is there anything wrong she asked yes i have asked dr thaxter to come and see him his temperature has risen again but he asked me if he could see you for a moment i wish you would go he is very restless and i think you might quiet him for you know she said looking at her i think you can do more for him than any doctor sybil stood there a minute biting her lip she had a physical repulsion to illness which though it shocked her that she should feel it yet dominated her since she had taken charlie in hand she had had daily to wrestle with it and though owing to his very satisfactory progress it had become easier to overcome yet it was always there but she decided almost immediately yes i will go she said then paused does he look terrible will it shock me she asked mrs brancepeths eyes lit up with a momentary indignation ah what does that matter she exclaimed involuntarily no dear i did not mean to say that i know your horror of illness but go to him it will not shock you he is looking rather flushed his eyes are very bright she took sybils hands in hers oh make him better make him better she said make him want to live entreaty vibrated in her voice and her hands trembled sybil felt immensely sorry for her and her sorrow overcame her repugnance at what lay before her her horror for illness was of the same character as a childs fear of the darkunreasonable but overmastering but in the presence of this mothers anxiety it was conquered for the moment i will do what i can she said i will do what i honestly can are you coming with me no he wants to see you alone and as she spoke a sudden pang of jealousy and rebellion struck her why should she who would give her life for him with thankful willingness be powerless to help him while half that love from another woman might prove so efficacious could she but exert its strength but next moment that was gone no other thought but the mothers yearning for her son was there sybil went from her up the passage to charlies room and entered softly at that moment hearing perhaps the rustle of her dress he turned his head on his pillow and looked towards the door and in dead silence for a moment their eyes met his face was very much flushed his eyes as his mother had said were very bright but bright with the burning of fever and the indescribable sharpness and hardness of feature that comes with illness was there but as sybil looked no horror was hers and no shrinking all she knew was that a man suffering and ill lay therea man to whom she was the reason of living and the sun of life a man whom she had known long liked always loved never in his eyes there burned not only fever but as he saw her the unquenchable light of love in all its dumb faithfulness she had seen it often before and had rejected it but now it smote upon her heart something within her melted and as a butterfly cracks its chrysalis and emerges weak hardly yet conscious of the new life of the iridescence of its own wings of the sunlight which till now has been hidden from it by that sheath of its shell so something new trembled on the threshold of her heartpitywhich knew not yet that with which it was entwined and with the waking of herself within her came the knowledge of what to do and say intuitively because she was at last a woman she came quickly across the room smiling at him charlie charlie this will never do she said i leave you alone for one day and you instantly behave naughtily like this i am ashamed of you sybil it is good of you to come and see me he said i wanted to see you so much then the inevitable querulousness of illness mastered him oh i am so uncomfortable he said so hot and feverish and he flunghis arm outside the bedclothes poor old charlie she said poor old fellow it is a bore now put that arm back at once there now you are not going to talk to me now but i am going to make you ever so much more comfortable put the pillow for you so and you are going to see the doctor and then you are going to sleep headache poor old boy and i shall sit here and talk to you till the doctor comes she drew a chair to the bedside and he turned more over in bed so that he looked directly at her oh im ill im ill he said and it was quite my own fault i sat outside this morning without a rug and i knew i was catching a chill and i didnt care you see you didnt care you never asked me what the doctors report was this morning and ii determined not to care either i am sorry i shouldnt have said that sybils hand trembled as she arranged the bedclothes which he had thrown off i was a brute said she and she paused charlie you must get well she cried suddenly he lay quite still a moment with breath coming quickly you said that as if you cared he said chapter xiv the marriage of bertie keynes and amelie was to be celebrated at new york towards the end of february and bade fair to be the comble up to date not even excepting the famous pearl fishery of mrs palmers social successes it was to take place in st lukes church fifth avenue and for days beforehand the ordinary services had been altogether suspended because the church had to be made fit to be the theatre of the ceremony and a perfect army of furnituremen upholsterers carpenters and plumbers occupied it the ordinary squarebacked wooden pews were removed from the body of the church which was carpeted from wall to wall with purple felt and rows of fauteuils in scarlet morocco like the stalls of an operahouse occupied their places to complete the resemblance each chair was marked with its particular number in its own row and the occupants who gave up their tickets at the church door retaining only the tallies were shown to their places where they found in each chair a copy of the service printed on vellum and bound by riviere by scarletcoated footmen similarly the free seats in the gallery were cleared out in order to make room for the very magnificent orchestra which beguiled the hours of waiting for the guests with inspiriting and purely secular pieces and during the choral part of the service accompanied the choir in front of the altar where the actual ceremony would take place there had been constructed hanging from the roof an immense bellshaped frame made of wood and canvas which was completely covered inside and out with white flowers and reached from side to side of what the reporters called the sacred edifice it had been quite impossible even for mrs palmer to procure at this time of year sufficient real flowers and as a matter of fact they were largely artificial like everything else round the edge of this large bell suspended by invisible wires but appearing to float in the air were lifesize baby figures of amorini made of wood and beautifully tinted winged and almost completely nude who discharged gilded arrows from their gilded bows towards the pair who were to stand in the centre of the bell numbers of others peeped from the banks of flowers that lined the walls all aiming in the same direction so that the bridegroom one would have thought might reasonably compare himself to a modern st sebastian framed in these banks of flowers also were several pictures belonging to lewis palmer all bearing on what might be called classical matrimony a titian of europa and the bull a veronese of bacchus and ariadne and a more than doubtful rubens of leda and the swan gilded harps twined with flowers leaned about in odd corners and the general impression was that one had come not into a church but by some deplorable mistake into the venusberg as depicted in the first act of tannhauser the ceremony of course had been many times rehearsed and for days beforehand the dummy bridegrooms procession had crossed fifth avenue the house exactly opposite was to be berties domicile for the night preceding the marriage and taken up its position chalked out at the church door that event was signalled to the chef dorchestre in the gallery who was thereupon to begin the mendelssohn weddingmarch and to the brides procession which was to start at the same moment from mr lewis palmers house four blocks off this proceeding at walking speed should reach the church door exactly at the conclusion of the weddingmarch whereupon the two processions dummybertie attended by his usher dummyamelie by her bridesmaids moved up the church to right and left of the bell at such a pace that the voice which breathed oer eden ceased breathing as they reached their places thenthis was a startling innovationmr and mrs palmer arm in arm were to have an unattended progress up the aisle to two very suitable golden chairs which at this moment would be the only unoccupied places in the church while the choir in their honour were to sing a short hymn specially written for the occasion and addressed to them beginning blessed parents here who see this bright hour arriving then the bride and bridegroom took their places under the bell and the service proceeded in the usual manner one rehearsal was rudely interrupted by the fall of one of the wooden amorini at this point which narrowly missed the dummybridegrooms head and fell with a loud crash splintering itself into matchwood on the floor of the chancel so another one was procured and they were all more securely wired immense baskets of white flowers were to be carried by the bridesmaids which they were to strew in the path of the bride both as she entered and left the church with her husband and from the belfry outside as they emerged a shower of sham satin slippers with little parachute wings so that they should float in the air and sink very gradually on to the heads of the amazed crowd was to be discharged these had been tested privately and were not used in the rehearsals bertie had arrived in new york some fortnight before the marriage leaving mr palmer who was very much occupied in england to follow a week later weddingpresents for both of them had begun arriving and were still doing so in shoals and every day he was occupied for several hours in writing letters of gratitude he soon got a certain facility at this but one morning there arrived for him a present which astonished him the present itself was a charming dressingbag there was nothing surprising in this for it was the eleventh he had received and the donor was mrs emsworth she wrote with it a characteristic little note saying that she was unable to come to the ceremony as she was at chicago and begging him to forget her and not acknowledge the gift she was making a great success with her tour and was getting quite rich considering what had happened this seemed to him one of the most superb pieces of impertinence ever perpetrated she was getting quite rich quite so she had made a considerable sum lately apart from her theatrical business she could well afford to give him a dressingbag but the impertinence of it the irresistible impertinence how like the gamin who puts his tongue in his cheek and says yah he almost laughed when he thought of it but the laughter died at the memory of those sickening hours in london on the day he had received the blackmailing letter and in a sudden spasm of anger against her not pausing to consider whether it was wise or not he gave orders that the bag should be packed up again and sent back to her at chicago without word of any kind she would understand quite well this incident small though it was in itself served to increase a certain depression and uneasiness that beset him during this fortnight the appalling apparatus and display which was to be made over the wedding was intolerable to him never before as he read and reread the instructions which had been sent him as to the timing of his own movements in what he mentally termed the show had the huge preposterous vulgarity of the american mind fully struck him the thought of what his weddingday would be like was unfaceable and the unextinguishable mirth of ginger who had come over as his best man was not consoling here the bridegroom crowned with garlands and ribands shall be led underneath the largest amorino which at a given signal shall descend upon his head while the orchestra plays the dead march from saul had been his comment when the accident in rehearsal happened and bertie though he laughed groaned inwardly all this however was as he recognised but a temporary worry and did not seriously affect him more intimately disquieting was the perpetual sense of his nerves being jarred by the voices manners aims mode of looking at life of the society into which he was to marry not for a moment did he even hint to himself that his manner of living and conducting himself traditional to him english was in the smallest degree better or wiser than the manner of living and conducting themselves practised by these people traditional though less so to them american only there was an enormous difference which had been seen by him in the autumn and dismissed as unessential since it concerned only their manners and had nothing to do with their immense kindliness of heart which he never doubted or questioned for a moment what he questioned now was whether manners did not spring after all from something which might be essential something the lack of which in one case the presence of it in another might make you find a man or a woman tolerable or intolerable if brought into continuous contact he was going to marry this charming american girl whose friends interests companions pursuits were american it was reasonable and natural for herindeed it would have shown a certain heartlessness had it not been sothat she should wish to continue to be in touch with her friends and interests for no human being can be plucked up like a plant and have its roots buried in an alien soil transplant it without a lump of its own earth and it will infallibly wither nor had bertie the least intention of making the attempt to transplant her like that all along he had known that the american invasion would come to his house he no more expected amelie to give up her american milieu than she would have expected him to give up his english milieu indeed when mr palmer had presented him with a charming little bijou flat in new york he had accepted the implication that he would pay from time to time a visit there with the same unquestioning acquiescence but now in his second visit he found to his dismay that so far from ceasing to mind or notice the difference between the two peoples the difference was accentuated as far as notice went and doubled as far as minding went his nerves no doubt were a little out of order and what would have scarcely affected him in a serener frame of mind was in his present mood like the squeak of a slate pencil yet behind all this even as the sky extends for millions of miles behind a stormy and cloudy foreground lay his feeling for amelie herself true once in his life the passion for a woman had burned in him with so absorbing and fierce a flame that for more than two years afterwards he had soberly believed that he never again could feel any touch of passion for another his adoration for dorothy emsworth had been his first grande passion it was therefore probably his last for such a thing does not come twice men whose lives are morally unedifying might doubt it so he said to himself but merely because they have never experienced it at all to them has come a succession of strong desires but this never and though he did not give nor did he make pretence of giving to amelie that which mrs emsworth could find no use for yet he gave her very honestly another way of love he gave her very strong and honest affection he gave her immense admiration lie gave her as much for he was of ardent nature as many men have ever felt all the chords of his lyre sounded for her but once there had been another chord that he could not give her for it was gone consequently when he wondered whether continuous contact with american milieu might not prove absolutely intolerable he did not include in his misgivings his continuous contact with amelie he had deliberately set out in the quest of a wealthy wife and he had found one in all ways so charming so lovable that the mercenary side of his quest was out of sight that quest he admitted to himself was not a very exalted one but as his father had pointed out he could not practically speaking marry a poor girlat least without marrying a great deal of discomfortand it was therefore more sensible to look for his wife among wealth he had been quite prepared in fact for marrying a girl who would do provided she saw the matter in the same light amelie did much more than do two nights before his marriage he had been to a very ingenious party the author and inventor of which had been reggie armstrong it was called a noahs ark party for he had caused his stableyard to be flooded and erected in the centre of it a huge wooden building in shape and form exactly like the noahs arks which children play with it had false painted windows on it the whole was in crude and glaring colours and it was approached up a gangplank across the stableyard at the door stood reggie armstrong on a little wooden stand dressed like noah in a brown ulster with a stiff wideawake hat and a false black beard and by him the four other people who were the joint hosts mrs palmer was one representing mrs noah and three young new york bachelors were shem ham and japheth a confused noise came from within the ark and as the astonished guests entered they saw that all round the walls were cages containing real live animals a pair of elephants occupied the top end a snarling tiger was in the next cage there were giraffes lions pumas antelopes all sorts of birds in diminishing order of size and at the tail a small glasscovered box containing fleas shrill cries of excited admiration greeted this striking piece of genius and in the rather pungent menagerie atmosphere to the snarling of the tiger the growling of lions the mewing of cats the barking of dogs and the neighing of the equine species the banquet at which each guest sat on a wooden stool and ate off wooden plates in order to accentuate the primitive nature of the surroundings ran its appointed course and took rank among the brilliant entertainments of the world after dinner bridge and normality followed and it was natural that bertie should find a corner as quiet as possible to have a talk with amelie they had wandered together round the cages had tried to make themselves heard at the lions end but that monarch of the forest roared so continuously that it was impossible to catch a word anyone else was saying unless he shouted and as their conversation was not naturally adapted to shouting they sought the comparative quiet of the end which harboured the meaner insects amelie had looked at the last case of all and turned to bertie its very complete she said very said he and their eyes met and both laughed now tell me exactly what you think of it she went on turning her back on the fleas and sitting down i really want to know what you think of it bertie bertie looked round to see that they were alone it appears to me absolutely idiotic he said she did not reply at once mammaah you like me to say mothermother was one of the hosts she observed i know but you asked me what i thought reggies very rich she said it doesnt make any difference to him i suppose a beggar would think me idiotic to wear jewels which might be converted into cash at least i suppose it is that you meanthe senseless expenditure no one cant say any expenditure is senseless said he since it is a matter of degree a matter of how much you have to spend if a man spent all his capital on such an entertainment or indeed on any it would be senseless but as you say armstrong is very rich what do you mean then i mean that it is idiotic because it doesnt give one any real pleasure it gives one real pleasure to see those pearls lying on your neck oh but it does give pleasure though perhaps not to you she said lots of people here think its just exquisite i suppose that means they are idiots she paused a moment youve been very frank she said i will be too when i see you here when i see that darling ginger here i think it is idiotic but i dont otherwise you see ive been brought up in it all you have been brought up differently all my life i have been in the middle of this this senseless expenditure you have been in gray old houses and big green parks and quiet places among people with low voices he made a gesture to stop her it was no use saying these things no i want to say this she said i have meant to say it often and i havent been able i have chosen you seei have chosen you and i have seen often that we have grated on you i have seen you thinking how senseless this all is but bertie i cant give up my friends and i dont suppose i can change my nature i cant promise to become english i cant promise even to try but i love you she looked up at him with those great gray eyes and for a moment something rose in his breast till he almost thought that the intolerable joy of a passion he had once felt was about to burn again within him but it rose stayed short of the point and sank again i dont ask you to amelie he said i am not so unreasonable or unfair as to ask you to change and you left to say last what was best of all suddenly he felt an impulse almost overwhelming to tell her all to tell her that tender and strong as was his affection for her he had known once a love that was different in kind from this a love which he thought a man can only feel once and when he felt it it was not for her yet how could he do it how define a moonbeam and what good would it be when done it might perhaps vaguely distress and disquiet her but it could serve no other purpose except that it would satisfy a certain demand for honesty felt by himself the impulse he dimly felt was of a momentous nature it involved principle which lies behind expediency but though for a space it was very strong it soon passed and the want of practical purpose in telling her took its place to minimize pain and to multiply pleasure was one of berties maxims suffering of any sort was repugnant to him whether he or another was the sufferer such a desire is part always of a kindly nature but when as in his case it is a dominant factor one of the dominant lords of conduct it is the sign of a nature not only kindly but emphatically lazyone which will always drift as long as possible one which in a moral sense will never go to the dentist before its teeth ache and will then not try to have them saved but take gas and part with them his last words to amelie made the girls cheek glow and her eye brighten she loved her lovers lack of effusiveness for to her it indicated the depth of still waters in everything she found him as she would have him and when he said you left till last the best of all she felt that no torrent of words no battery of impassioned looks could have been so convincingly genuine as the dry simplicity of his words like every other woman or man who has ever loved she had imagined for herself the ideal lover and enshrined it in some human tabernacle to her bertie was the one and only tabernacle wherein her love could dwell he had told her with a limpid directness in the early days of their engagement that when he came awooing he had come of set purpose to a wealthy house and this declaration which would in a nature less sweet and generous than hers have prompted in case of a lovers quarrel the stifled whisper you wished to marry me for my money had not the most shadowy existence in her she knew otherwise the fortunate accident of her wealth had been no more so she believed than the mere master of the ceremonies who had introduced them the completeness of his reply so satisfied her that after a short pause she spoke at once of other things father has settled molesworth on me she said he has made it my own will you ask me there sometimes said bertie yes perhaps are you very fond of it yes somehow right inside me i am i think one gets a very strong though not at all a violent feeling for a place where one has been brought up ones father was brought up there too you see and ones grandfather the feeling isnt worth much we have tried to sell it for years and whistled for a buyer in vain she sighed we americans have no sense of home at all she said really we all live in hotels for preference i dont suppose i shall ever get it or even understand it is itis it worth having that sense of home i dont know that it is it is a comfortable feeling that is all my own fireside it is a domestic sort of joy which rather reminds one of cowpers poems i shall read them remarked amelie with decision bertie laughed you will certainly go to sleep over them he said that will be domestic too come bertie im going to jabber like the others jabber to me i cant jabber to you you are not jabberable look at me once that must be our goodnight mr palmer had arrived in new york some week or so before and had occupied himself for a whole day over the matter of settlements molesworth he had given to amelie had settled a million pounds sterling on her and on bertie two hundred and thirtyseven thousand the curious exactitude of this sum being due to the fact that he had intended to settle a quarter of a million on him of which he had already received thirteen thousand he also recommended him a few suitable investments for it while mrs palmer after getting rid of the first high pressure of satisfaction by sending to amelie a perfect packingcase of diamonds directed a torrent of different objects chiefly mounted in gold at both of them bertie went home that night in a more settled and buoyant frame of mind than had been his since his arrival in america never before had he felt so certain of a happy and harmonious future what amelies feeling for him was he dimly guessed from his knowledge of what once had been his for another while for his part he gave her all he had to giveadmiration affection desire onlyand this as far as he knew was no longer among the capabilities of his naturehe did not give her their fusion into one white flame he only offered as it were packets of the separate ingredients but as sybil massington had said there are many ways of love he took the best he knew the knowledge of this and the straight and honest acceptation of it by himself was tranquillizing and possibly a sedative to his conscience for his thoughts as he strolled down fifth avenue on that night strangely warm for the earliness of the month strayed slowly like his footsteps to past years and it would have surprised anyone who looked on his extraordinarily youthful and untroubled face to know how very old he was feeling as his mind drifted with the quiet strength of some oceantide back via weddingpresents to dorothy how absolutely she had dominated his every thought and feeling how completely for those months he had ceased to have any independent will of his own being absorbed and melted into her he remembered one june in particular they had both been in london and day after day he had gone to see her in her house in curzon street the weather was very hot and she had a craze for living in nearly empty rooms all her carpets had been taken up and all her floors polishedeverything not essential to comfort had been stacked in garrets and the rooms were empty except for flowers lilacs had been magnificent that yearthey were her favourite flowersand the smell of lilac to him now meant that he lived once again in the flash of a moment that month of beautiful days when he had been so exquisitely unhappy with the unsatisfied yearning of his first passion all that month she had kept him in a sort of rapturous agony of suspense which kept ever growing nearer to certainty then at the end to bring matters to a crisis he had written her that letter and not gone near her for two days then having no answer he went and she laughed at him and sent him away well he had paid dearly for that letter both in the desolating inability to care for anything in the months that followed and also in other ways what it cost him in hard cash did not trouble him after all he was infinitely her debtor it was she who had let him see though she had plucked the vision away again to what height of ecstasy his own average human nature could rise what must a woman of that kind be made of he wondered to himself was she so grossly stupid that she never had a glimpse of what she meant to him or was she so utterly hard that having seen that she had not the decency anyhow to go into mourning as it were for him just for a little stupidity he could not accuse her of there was no one of such lightninglike power of intuition to divine the mood of a man no she must have seen it and known it and brushed it from her as one brushes a fly off ones coat for not a month after that she had left london with bilton whom she never professed to care for but he was rich and certainly he had done a great deal for her for he had taken her from her position of pretty woman actress seen her capability of dramatic impersonation and got her play after play where she had to behave like herself till now in a certain sort of role there was no woman who touched her also he had somehow made her the fashion he had gauged his age correctly and given it what it wanted he had seen the trend of society both in england and americaseen its hardness its heartlessness its imperative need of being amused its passion for money and for its stage he had given it mrs emsworth an incarnation of itself yes she was hard hard hard as her own diamonds and as brilliant as manyfaceted sometimes out of her as out of them a divinely soft light would shine but if you tried to warm yourself in that mellow blaze there was no heat there if in the excellent splendour and softness of the light you would think for a moment that there was a heart there you would find only the cold clearcut edges had she not proved itshe who not satisfied with leading him on with letting him fall passionately in love with her only to divert herself a little in watching that storm of passion which she observed from behind her shut window only to draw the blind down when she had looked enough had even used the letter he wrote her to make money out of it how well she knew him his weakness his ineradicable instinct to save trouble avoid disturbances so that when she wrote or caused to be written the letter of blackmail she did it probably without the least fear that she was putting herself in a dangerous position nor was shesecure in the knowledge of berties engagement she was certain to get her money and as no doubt she also knew well against her he could not have taken legal steps for the memory of the love he once bore her no she was safe quite safe he let himself into his flat with his latchkey and saw several letters lying on the table the english mail had come in and ginger who had got home before him was busy with his own correspondence and only looked up and nodded at bertie as he entered for bertie himself there were several english letters chiefly congratulatory a parcel from tiffanys by order of mrs palmer containing a gold sapphirestarred cigarettecase and two or three letters from america one of which was typewritten for some reason which he hardly formulated to himself he took it up and examined on front and back before opening it then he laid it down again mixed a whisky and soda and returning to it tore it open it contained one square sheet and ran as follows dear sir hearing that you are about to be married to miss amelie palmer it may interest you to learn that we are in possession of an autograph letter of yours to mrs emsworth the following phrases may recall it to your mind i loved you more than ever last night though i thought i could not have loved you more than i really did lilac lilac it reminds me of you more than any picture of you could you know my devotion to you for me there is no other in the world then as before followed a space should you care to possess yourself of this we will let you have it for l the money should be sent to mr harold bilton at his business office a broadway for mrs emsworths account by tomorrow tuesday evening in the event of its not being to hand we shall presume that you do not wish to have the letter which we shall thereupon forward by special messenger that evening to mr lewis s palmer mr bilton who has lately arrived in new york is authorized to receive the abovementioned sum from you should you settle to adopt this course but to permit no discussion of any kind referring to the matter in hand we are dear sir your faithful obedient servants a b c bertie read it through folded it neatly up replaced it in its envelope and walked across to where ginger was sitting absorbed in a letter any news he asked yes a good deal ginger finished the sheet he was reading got up briskly and helped himself to whisky noahs ark he observed great and merciful god you seemed to be enjoying yourself said his brother i was enormously but its great and merciful all the same thats all oh no one thing more bertie i think your girl is worth the rest of this continent news yes news from davos charlie is better ever so much better and his nurse throughout has been sybil in fact there is going to be love in a cottage i think charlie writes he seems to like the idea of a cottage shes going to marry him asked bertie ginger smiled now i come to think of it he doesnt mention the word he observed youre rather coarse remarked bertie i am i thought it might cheer you up you look rather down anything wrong nothing whatever ginger strolled back to his chair put his whisky on one arm a little heap of cigarettes on the other and curled himself up between them the young folk are all growing up and being married he said it makes me feel extremely old and it is a little uncomfortable ive done nothingbut that might happen to anybodyand ive felt nothing what is it like to feel things bertie depends what they are no i mean independently of what they are i dont know what strong emotion is i dont know what it is to be carried off ones feet i am much interested in many things but impersonally now youyou have adored and you have been adored i have sat and looked on does it leave you duller do you think to feel a thing and then cease to feel it than you would have been if you never felt it at all bertie considered this a moment you never cease to feel things he said a thing that has been exquisitely sweet becomes bitter and continues bitter you taste the jam first and the powder afterwards he turned to the mantelpiece took up a cigarette and then with a sudden trembling hand threw it into the grate and you pay for it all he said you pay over and over again goodnight ginger chapter xv it was a glorious blue and golden morning in early june and the soft brilliant sunshine of english summer weather flooded the glades of the park at molesworth where amelie intent on the finishing of a watercolour sketch sat on a fallen treetrunk and bertie lay on the grass by her side reading at intervals to her from a volume of tennyson he had brought out with him she was almost too busy with her painting to follow very clearly what he read but the sound of his voice thrilled her with a big quiet happiness and when he was silent the consciousness of his presence by her was hardly less vivid all the same she was attending very closely to what she was doing and her brush industriously recorded what the upward sweep of her gray eyes had noted before she bent them again with bowed head on her sketch indeed that which lay before her was very well worth her attention in front of them lay a sward of finewoven turf and from under the shade of the huge oak which spread its living canopies of green above them they looked through aisles of noble trees into the open heathery ground of the far distance the cool greenness dim and subaqueous in tone stretched to right and left of them in all shades of colour here underneath the oak it was dark and almost sombre there where a cleanlimbed slender beech foamed up in the freshness of its pale foliage into the blue cup of heaven the colour was enchantingly vivid and delicate as if to match even as the rosecolour of youthful cheeks matches the slender litheness of the frame the girlish grace of the tree itself flecks of sunlight lay like spangles on the grass below the trees and in spaces between them the blue blaze of the june day poured down on to the flowerdecked grass the last of the bluebells still lingered in shady places as if pieces of sky had fallen there tall foxgloves rose in spires of blossoms through thickets of bramble buttercups made a sunlight of their own and in the shelter of scattered coppices the pale windflowers still dreamed in whiteness not far in front of them the centre point of amelies sketch rose a huge thorn covered with clusters of crimson blossom standing in full sunlight so throbbing and bursting with colour that she almost fancied she could see on the pale green of the slenderfingered birches that grew near some red reflection of that glorious blaze to the right of it one could see through the treetrunks the gray palings of an enclosed cover where the ground tumbled upwards under pines and the velvet of the turf was riddled and sandy with rabbitholes a fringe of elders with the white umbrella of their flowers grew there and tawny honeysuckle added one more note to the great symphony of delicate woodland smell and even more entrancing than the woodland smell more subtly mingled than that bouquet of coolness and greenness of the aroma of pines the drowsiness of the honeysuckle the languor of the elders was the symphony of woodland sound the forest murmur that filled the ear even as the greenness filled and refreshed the eye the hum of insects of bees at their fragrant labour was the bourdon note that pervaded everything a light breeze stirred in the trees calling out of each its own distinctive notefrom the pines the sound of waves very far off from the birches a thin sibilant murmur from the beech something a little lower in the scale and from the tall grasses a whisper and a sigh a late cuckoo chimed still mellowthroated doves moaned softly thrushes fluted their repeated notes from bush to bush calling to one another in the joy of the great vigorous life that filled these enchanted glades and out in the open larks black specks against the blue hung over the nests of their mates and towered in the triumph of their song but best of all pervasive even as the hum of bees was the ripple and gurgle and chuckle and pouring of water that one note more liquid than the nightingales right down the centre of the glade came the stream brimmed with the rains of spring and filling its bed from edge to edge here its course lay over gravelbeds and the pebbles glanced and glimmered with the living light that the sun poured down through the pellucid transparency of the water then came a sharp elbow in its course and it fretted its way with sound of melodious outpouring through the tangled roots of some tree that stood bare in the angle of the turning then for a space the ground was more clayey and a carpet of green waterweeds were combed and waved by the woven ropes of water deeper pools lay here and under the protection of the banks where some promontory of rocky stuff made a breakwater the broad fans of waterlilies and the golden crown of their blossoms found anchorage for their sappy stems dragonflies as if revisiting the scenes of their childhood where they had nosed in the mud or lain blind pupre till the spring of their awakening hovered iridescent and flashed like jewels flying through the air over the sunlit shallows whitethroated swallows skimmed upstream and companies of swifts chided together rushes waded kneedeep into the water loosestrife stepped gingerly to the brink and to all the stream prattled and sang and went on its sweet way amelie laid down her brushes and held out her sketch to bertie criticise she said he looked at it a moment in silence its very good he said but you still want thethe big softness of it all it is still a little hard she sighed i knew you would say that she said and its perfectly true perhaps i shall get to be able to do it in time its all very well to say that a sketch is merely a matter of line and colour but it isnt there is a feeling which is beyond either she took it back from him anyone could see it was painted by an american she observed bertie laughed thats where you are wrong he said most americans would say it was done by an englishwoman she smiled to herself with a secret pleasure laid her sketch by her to dry slid off the trunk where she had been sitting and sat down on the grass by her husband read to me again she said read that song that ends the moan of doves in immemorial elms and murmur of innumerable bees she leaned her head on his shoulder and sat with eyes halfclosed as in his low gentle voice he read through the exquisite passage it is english she said when he had finished and oh bertie that means a lot to me bertie are you happy he closed the book and sat thinking a moment before he answered her it was true that he had never supposed that he was capable of being so happy as he had been in these last three months it was true also that his affection for his wife had grown with every day they had passed together yet the question was a difficult one to answer a few months ago had she asked him in his present mood the same question he would instantly have said yes but with the growth of his capacity for happiness and for loving her had grown the demand for happiness and love which his nature made instead of acquiescing in the conclusion that he never again could possibly love as he had once loved he had begun to want that again he was no longer content with this limitation ah my dearest he said happiness is not in your power or mine no i am not quite happy i want something more he sat up as her eyes questioned him i want the impossible i suppose he said i want to be fire you have made me want that for a moment some shadow of vague trouble crossed her eyes i dont think i understand she said bertie plucked a long feather of grass and chewed the juicy end of it he had not meant to say quite so much im not sure that i understand either he said it is quite easy to understand complicated things but when one gets to the plain simple things like love and death then one realizes how little one understands is it not so the trouble grew i never ask for confidences she said so you mustnt think i am doing so but bertie sometimes i feel that there is a piece of you which i do not knowsome locked room oror it is like that haunted house we went to the other day where there is a space unaccounted for one goes into all the rooms but by the measurements there is yet another room which one cannot find the intuition of this rather startled and shocked him so you credit me with a bluebeards chamber he asked it is far more likely to be a cupboard for lumber have you some lumber then she asked quickly the bitter taste of that which had been exquisitely sweet was at this moment very present to himmore bitter perhaps than it had ever been for he regretted now not that which was past but its absence from the present and the curious persistence of amelie rather vexed him ah we all must have a little lumber he said with an unconscious touch of impatience in his voice in this rough and tumble of a world we all get some bits of things brokenideas ideals desires what you will they are our lumber and it is wiser to turn the key on themnot bring them out and try to mend them amelie noticed the impatience of which he was unconscious cannot i help you to mend them bertie she asked with a wonderful wistfulness in her voice and have i vexed you he threw the grass spearwise down the wind i think you could not really vex me he said but you cant help me to mend them nobody cannot even you she picked up her sketching things in silence washed out her brushes and closed her sketchbook let us forget it all then she said briskly let us put the hands of the clock back ten minutes and go on from then the murmur of innumerable bees all june is in that line is it not bertie what a beautiful june we have had and it is not over yet said he no but people come to us this evening you know and on monday we go up to town come we must go back to the house it is lunchtime and the post will be in but for both of them the huge blue of the day was flecked with a little cloud after lunch amelie had a few calls to make and some little business to transact in the village and bertie who sturdily refused to accompany her ordered his horse and went for a rambling ride through the park somehow the vague conversation of that ten minutes in the morning had dimly but rather deeply upset him in any case it had the effect so to speak of smashing open his lumberroom door on which he had so carefully turned the key twice before had it been rudely openedon those occasions by mrs emsworth herself when she had got from him first ten thousand pounds for what was only a copy of his letter and secondly five thousand more two evenings before his marriage it was with a sense of shame that even now made his cheeks burn when he thought of it that he recalled his own utter weakness his dread of possible exposure even at the time he knew that the wise thing to do would have been to have gone straight to mr palmer with the letter for which he had paid ten thousand pounds and the second blackmailing letter and have with these proofs in his hand of the vileness of the scheme told him the whole truth but his nerves could no more face it than they could have allowed him to pull out a tooth or a nail of his own and next day he had gone cursing his own flabbiness to biltons office and obediently paid the second levy bilton himself was not there but a young and rather insolentlymannered clerk who addressed him as earl keynes had been authorized to receive his cheque and the typewritten letter in exchange for a small packet which contained as he satisfied himself a couple of sheets in his own handwriting torn half across he had of course kept the first letter which he had bought back and comparing the two he came to the conclusion that the first was a very careful forgery the second the genuine letter but this afternoon it was not so much his own weakness in having been so easy a prey to the blackmailer and in having been incapable of forcing himself to tell the whole thing to mr palmer that lay like a shadow on him as his present inability to feel as he once felt he had unlocked the despatchbox where he kept the letters on his return this morning with amelie and read one through again passion vibrated therea passion which had once been his he could recall it perfectly he could remember with the most vivid distinctness the rapture of desire in which he had written those sheets of adoration it had seemed to him then that life was this that the whole world and whatever it contained that was lovely and worth the worship of man found in her its completion the best and the worst of himfor it was all of him that wrote thuswas hers in the passionate selfabandonment of love for that gift she had in return called him a pretty boy and told him not to talk nonsense but for the faculty of feeling that nonsense again for his wife he would have given everything he had he saw and fully recognised the exquisite quality of amelies beauty and the beautiful and generous soul that dwelt therein day by day he saw the sweet unfolding of her naturean unfolding as silent and as perfect as the blossoming of a rose he admired her he felt passion for her but a passion that never was lost and blinded by itself as his passion for dorothy had been often in that june of lilacs he had come home from seeing her and sat for hours as if intoxicated or stupefied unable to speak or think even only lie with mind open under the eye of his sun it was that power he would have given the world to recapture his ramblings had led him into an outlying piece of the park which he seldom visiteda somewhat bleak heathery upland not more than a mile or so from the house but away from the beauty of the wooded glades where he and amelie had spent the morning he was about to turn when at some little distance off he saw a couple of men standing by a tall red rod planted in the ground one of whom apparently was taking observations through some sort of telescopic instrument about a couple of hundred yards further on was another rod and following the line with his eye he saw that between them and the park paling was yet another he rode up to them and with a certain resentment inquired what they were doing and got for answer that they were under orders to survey this piece of country for the projected railway they further explained that the line when it reached the ridge over which he had ridden would probably enter a tunnel and emerge again only outside the park her ladyship one of the men remarked in a rather insolent tone had given permission for the survey bertie turned his horse round and rode back homewards doing his honest best not to think what he thought in his heart he was very much hurt that amelie had not told him and somehow the idea that the park was apparently to be invaded and cut up by a railwayline was extraordinarily repugnant to him a couple of years ago it is true both he and his father would have welcomed any scheme which should turn that white elephant the molesworth property into cash at whatever violation of its forest glades yet now when only the bare outlying portions were to be given to the invader he intensely disliked the thought of it money was no longer needful the railroad might go hang he found amelie in the garden when he got back and instead of giving her the little caress which was still usual between them after only an hour or twos separation he began abruptly i found some men surveying on the far warrens he said they told me they had your permission amelie frowned slightly as if puzzled yes i believe the agent did say something about it two days ago she said it is only a survey they are making there is nothing settled i think you might have told me said he but of course the place is yours you will please yourself this hurt her he had rather intended it should but she answered with admirable gentleness i am sorry she said i quite forgot to tell you the thing seemed to me immaterial of course i should have consulted you before settling anything bertie felt rather ashamed of his illtemper and remembering the omission of their usual little ceremony he picked up her hand as it lay on the arm of her chair and pressed it yes dear i am stupid to have made anything of it he said but tell me amelie what is the proposed line a branch line from cardiff joining the liverpool and southampton it is only a preliminary survey i believe of course i meant to talk to you about it as soon as they opened negotiations with us i may as well now it will cross the far warren for about a mile i believe and then tunnel under the ridge it will not interfere with us in any way it is completely cut off from the house and the woods and i suppose they would pay something substantial i had meant to give you that berties feeling of shame grew a little hotter i am a crossgrained brute he said am i forgiven she smiled at him do you ask that she said but oh bertie dont hurt me even ever so little a little hurt from you hurts so much so another cloud flecked the blue of june that afternoon their guests began to arrive for the weekend party it was the first they had given and amelie somehow felt a little nervous for it was her debut as hostess lord bolton was coming and in a way it seemed to her hardly decent that she should be receiving him in this house she had met him once or twice before and was vaguely terrified at him sybil massington was coming too with charlie to whom she was to be married in july ginger was accompanying his father other friends of berties raised their numbers to a dozen and both her own parents with reggie armstrong as gentlemaninwaiting to mrs palmer were to make a sort of family party this consciousness that she was on trial made her the least bit in the world selfconscious and deep down in her mind tucked away in its darkest corner but still there was a sort of haunting anxiety about her mother again and again she tried to picture to herself mrs palmer and gallio engaged in friendly desultory conversation but as often she abandoned this projected situation as unthinkable she even hopedhoped in a whisper that is to saythat for some reason her mother would be prevented from coming that whisper she stifled as often as it sounded thoroughly ashamed of it but it was there but providence declined to have any special dealings on this point and mrs palmers entry into the house was clearly audible to her as she sat in the garden with those of her guests who had arrived gallio was already there his thin but freshcoloured face and flossy white hair his general air of great distinction and complete imperturtability seeming admirably suited to the dignified stability of the gray house and the spaciousness of the ancestral lawns he had been most affectionate and gentle to her had called her his dear daughter had kissed her hand with a courtly grace and made her feel intensely ill at ease then came the sound of screamings from the house and if the simile of a substantial butterfly with a shrill voice discharged from a catapult conveys anything to the reader it was in such manner that mrs palmer came through the open french windows of the drawingroom and with outstretched arms swooped swiftly across the lawn to amelie my dearest sweetest angel child she criedscreams of emotion mingled with kissing why if i havent been just dreaming day and night of seeing you againmore screams why you look so well you look just too lovely for words ive been just crazy to see you lord bolton had in the previous year firmly declined the honour of mrs palmers acquaintance saying he did not wish to be deaf for the remainder of a misspent life and amelie introduced her to him very pleased to make your acquaintance lord bolton she said and to have the pleasure of meeting you here makes it just too complete gallio shook hands i have looked forward to this he said with his best paternal air bertie dear amelie you and my unworthy selfthe family group in the family frame and his eye wandered over the great gray facade of the house well i think thats too beautifully put said mrs palmer thats a real poetical thought lewis she called to her husband lord boltons been too poetical for words well im sure gallios thin lips tightened a little how are you mr palmer he said i am most fortunate to have been able to come down today i was afraid i should not be able to but when my dear daughter said you were both coming i could not let anything stand in the way why that was just lovely of you said mrs palmer as she moved to amelies side at the teatable and went on in a loud aside as gallio engaged mr palmer in conversation dearest child she said you look simply too sweet and ive lost my heart to lord bolton i think hes just lovely with his white hair and alljust the old nobleman i used to dream about before i married lewis now give me some tea poured out with your own hands at your own house you darling countess of keynes well im sure im just crazy with pleasure mrs palmer flowed on in a shrill and equable torrent of conversation her particular timbre of voice made talking in her vicinity as difficult as talking in a rail waytunnel for it echoed and reverberated in a manner which rendered all else inaudible i read all about your presentation in the new york herald she went onthe new american beauty the young and charming countess of keynes and youll laugh amelie but i ordered a special edition with all about you printed in gilt letters and just flooded newport with the copies i guess newport will find it as hard to beat you as it did to beat the pearlparty newport will just curl up and die i guess youve done for newport and theres one thing i want to ask do i lord bolton take any rank as mother of a countess i could find nothing about it in your debrett gallio turned to her with his most courtly air ah mrs palmer he said we have no rank in england to equal that which a charming and beautiful woman enjoys in her own right the famous cry resounded over the lawns and beat in echo against the house why if that isnt just too sweet of you she cried lewis heres lord bolton saying such things to me as you never thought of saying and wheres reggie armstrong reggie did you hear what lord bolton said you did though you pretend you didnt youre just green with jealousy i can see the greenness reflected on your strawberries well i never sybil massington and others had arrived already and the assembled party some fifteen or sixteen were now all gathered on the lawn drinking tea and eating strawberries with a slight air of constraint as if social thunder of some kind was in the air bertie who had been receiving his guests indoors and bringing them out was in a low chair just opposite mrs palmer listening with rather less than half an ear to what sybil was saying to him quite involuntarily at this speech he raised a deprecating eyebrow looked up and caught amelies eye she flushed slightly and looked away again some rather heavy rejoinder on the part of reggie armstrong followed and gallio sat down opposite bertie and sybil charming woman he said in his very low gentle voice she has all the brightness of the western civilization bertie could not help smiling and looking up again caught amelies glance and felt guilty the resounding voice went on its just my idea of the english country house she said its just ancestral why lewis might go and establish his office right here under these trees and give vanderbilt fits as he did last year and the trees wouldnt care thats what ive just lain awake and coveted till three in the morning why i was at windsor last week and i assure you windsor looks like a mushroom beside this its just english lord bolton however you could let lewis have it i cant think come and sit by me and pay me some more compliments why it tickles me to death to sit here and talk to you i think youre just lovely gallio rose obediently tact too he observed to mrs massington as he turned to comply with mrs palmers frank and direct request in fact for the time things could not have been worse and mrs palmers voluble shrillness bawling all sorts of things which were neither wicked nor stupid nor anything objectionable except that they were simply impossible at gallio who sat beside her and encouraged her by his exquisite courtliness of manner into imagining that she was being the most brilliant success was too much for the nerves of some of the english section who strolled away about the lawn with fine deliberation and carefully abstained from any comment but in process of time amelie took her mother away to see her room and gallio suave to the last made her his best bow as she declared for the twentieth time that she considered him the loveliest man she had ever met bertie had strolled away with charlie and sybil massington feeling that in its small way the situation was unbearable it was one of the hideous bitter little comedies of life where everyone is ridiculous yet it is impossible to laugh for fear of crying he knew so well how mrs palmer felt how gallio felt how he himself felt and he was afraid he knew how amelie felt sybil had much to say it is quite like a fairystory bertie here are charlie and ithe poor young man who proposed to drop into an early grave and who proposed to me instead who has now no more idea of dropping into a grave than i haveand here are you and amelie with molesworth once more your home bertie if you hadnt fallen in love with amelie you would have argued yourself the most obtuse young man in the world why she fell in love with you is harder to say she has got extraordinary charm i felt it as soon as i saw her you were in luck when you went awooing so were you charliewhy didnt you say that you really didnt give me much time said charlie in selfjustification no thats true bertie what fun we had in long island really that time was most amusing and we all meet again hereall but mrs emsworth that is to say by the way she has come back she is staying somewhere in the neighbourhood did her tour end as successfully as it began she wrote to me just before my marriage saying she was getting quite rich said bertie wincing a little how nice i wish i was charlie they are all rich except you and me never mind we will stay with them all a great deal which will be charming for them and the palmers house in londonhave you seen it really it is magnificent who did it mrs palmer or her husband it cant have been done by a firm the taste is too individual too certain mr palmer did it said bertie i fancy he ordered every individual thing down to the smallest details i fancied it must be he mrs palmer is a little more voulumore bird of paradise she laughed i cant help laughing she said to anyone with any eye for human comedy the scene at tea was delicious she is a great dear and i am very fond of her but frankly she and gallio together were extraordinarily funny i love contrastsnotes of jarring colour bertie did not laugh i was furious with gallio he said he tried to make a fool of her assuredly he did not succeed said sybil mrs palmer was delighted with him anyhow he had to be polite or rude he chose to be extremely polite amelie saw said bertie briefly and the subject dropped they strolled back in the enveloping light of the sunset which flooded and pervaded the air with level rays the glades where he had sat with his wife that morning were full of the soft luminousness of the sun which entered below the leafy boughs of the thick trees and lit them from end to end with a wonderful glory birds were busy with their evensong in the bushes and as at noonday the countless hum of insects was still in the air bertie still rather disturbed for amelies sake at the little teatime comedy felt soothed by the leisurely tranquillity of the hour and the two others a little apart passed from time to time some whispered confidence but the mellow call of the bell from the elizabethan turret warned them that the minutes to dinnertime were numbered and they briskened their steps back to the house the other two went upstairs but bertie turned for a moment to his sittingroom in quest of evening news and found amelie there waiting for him her face was a little flushed and some shadow of trouble clouded it i wanted to see you a moment before dinner she said i and she stopped what is it dear said he gently you know he your father was laughing at her he made other people laugh at her he made you laugh i dont think it was a good joke there are many sorts of bad breeding i think he showed one of the worst i am sorry you take it like that amelie said he it is true i laughed but i did not laugh at your mother i laughed at the comedy of the situation he made a fool of her continued amelie but i think he made a cad of himself that is rather strong language said bertie i think it is suitable language i think you ought to ask him to behave with courtesy to my guestsnot with exaggerated courtesy bertie thought for a moment i will tell him that he hurt your feelings if you wish said he at length that is not the point said she for me it is she turned on him a long luminous look then you dont understand she said my meaning is that i will not have my mother insulted in my house he frowned you make too much of it he said you wont do as i ask then she said if you think it over you will see that it would serve no good purpose she left the window where she was standing and began to move towards the door i never ask twice she said by the way mrs emsworth has telegraphed to know whether she may come over to lunch tomorrow she is staying at midhurst please make some excuse said bertie quickly i do not wish her to come here why not i desire you to make her some excuse he repeated she looked up started at the quiet peremptoriness of his tone and again there flashed into her mind the thought that had been there this morning when she told him that there was a piece of him she did not know at this moment she felt she localized it what reason do you give me she asked you used to be quite friendly with her last autumn quite true but i am not now have you seen her since asked amelie not quite recognising from what that question really sprang no i have not he paused why did you ask that he said quietly it was a reasonable question she said mrs emsworth is a friend of mine too i have every right to ask her to the house unless you give me good reason i ask you not to exercise that right said bertie suddenly and almost audibly in its distinctness amelies mind said to her we are quarrelling her love for him frightened ran as it were towards him but stumbled over her pride she did not answer him but left the room feeling sick at heart chapter xvi the construction of the intermediate pieces of line which were to connect liverpool with southampton by a direct route were finished by july and running powers over the lines of other existing companies having been acquired the new service was open for traffic by the beginning of august as mr palmer had foreseen the immense saving of time and convenience of transport effected by this direct linking together of the two ports had been as soon as the bill for the projected line had passed the houses of parliament instantly recognised by the various fleets that used these ports and its success was assured long before its completion added to this the economical and businesslike methods of running trains which were adopted by him based on american systems enabled the line to cut down rates while it secured for its customers far more rapid transport so that it obtained from the first practically a monopoly of the goods traffic between the ports a quantity of gentlemen who in some vague sort of manner considered that they were acting in the sacred name of patriotism wrote hundreds of violent letters to the papers protesting against this fresh american invasion while others equally vaguely in the sacred name of art ranted themselves hoarse over the steelgirder budges that desecrated the most lovely spots in the rural fortresses of england and the black squat but eminently efficient engines that drew the trains of unlovely merchandise but this vox et praeterea nihil soon died away and the only influence it had on traffic was perhaps to call added attention to the eminent advantages enjoyed by the customers of mr palmers line consequently neither he nor they had any quarrel with it all this he had foreseen and more it became practically necessary as he had known all along for swansea and cardiff to put themselves into communication with this system and as early as june as we have seen surveyors were busy on the molesworth estate over the route the winter before mr palmer had purchased both it and the adjoining wyfold estate knowing that the line of direct communication must pass through one or the other and when towards the end of july the experts pronounced very strongly in favour of the molesworth route he forwarded their recommendation to amelie with the request that she would come and talk matters over with him before she left town the last month had not passed very happily for her it lacked at least that wonderful edge of happiness which may and june had given her the little rift which had opened between her and bertie had not closed again and if anything it had become rather wider she had obeyed his request and not asked mrs emsworth to lunch but she had done so unwillingly rebelling in her mind against this arbitrariness which expected to be obeyed and yet would give no reason for what it wished done in consequencefor her protest though mute was very obviousthe spirit of her compliance was almost as irritating to him as her disobedience would have been furthermore at that interview she had had with him suspicion vague and darkling she knew lurked in the shadow of her mind the piece of him she did not know irresistibly connected itself with mrs emsworth there it had grown like some mushroom and though she did not officially so to speak recognise its existence it was there other things too had tended to separate them and in particular the treatment or so she called it of her mother by the world of london she had expected to see and saw that london in general flocked to mrs palmers new house where the entertainments if not quite so wildly improbable as those which awoke the echoes in the glades of long island were on the most lavish and exuberant scale consequently london with its keen eye for the buttered side of the bread went there in its crowds drank mrs palmers champagne danced to her fiddles won her money at bridge and enjoyed the performances of all the most notable singers and pianists in the world with the greatest contentment but what amelie saw also was the halfshrugged shoulders the instantaneous glance of the eye the raised eyebrow the justnotgenuine smile of those who were the most constant habitues there mrs palmer in fact was in london not of london this amelie resented and by way of retaliation she had as was perfectly natural her mother constantly in her own house and filled it with americans perhaps rather more than was perfectly natural for the rest there had been nothing the least resembling an open breach between her and bertie he accepted the continual presence of her countrymen without the slightest protest and never even by the smallest inflection of voice or manner was other than absolutely civil to everyone she asked indeed the perfect evenness of his manner added its quota to the constraint that lay between them in her heart of hearts she knew that he often found neither interest nor entertainment in her guests and the chilled perfection of his mode of conducting himself towards them but served as a barrier the more but what most stood between them was her undefinable suspicion about mrs emsworth on that day the cankerworm had entered and since then she had again and again asked herself whether berties affection for her had ever been of the same quality as the love she had felt for him she remembered with horrible distinctness his words i want to be fire and they which at the moment had seemed to her but an expression of the ever unsatisfied yearning of love which always however perfect still desires to go yet deeper now wore a more sinister interpretation and were to her the kindling of a secret heartburning what if this natural and simplest interpretation was true what if he had never really felt fire for her such was the abbreviated reading of her spiritual diary down to the day when she drove to see her father though he had been in london all this last month she had scarcely set eyes on him so immersed had he been in the railroad business and it was with a childish eagerness that she looked forward to having a long talk with him in the trouble of her mind she felt great longing for that kind unwearied affection which he ever had for heran affection not very demonstrative but extraordinarily real and solid the effusiveness of her mothers love just now was less satisfying to her for mrs palmer had been for the last six weeks a mere whirling atom in the mill of social success and while one hand so to speak was entwined round amelies neck in a maternal embrace the other would be scribbling notes of invitation and regret to the flower of englands nobility she got to the house rather late for lunch and was struck by the resemblance which the moral atmosphere of the diningroom bore to that of basle railwaystation there was the same sense that everybody was just going to catch a train that they were exchanging last words as they took their hurried meal her father next whom she sat was an exception for he ate his thin slices of toasted hovis bread and drank his milk with the deliberateness which his digestion demanded but everyone else seemed to be unable to attend to what was going on at this moment because they all were thinking of what they would be doing the next even her father too seemed rather preoccupied and from time to time she saw that his eyes were fixed on herself with a certain anxious look which was removed as soon as he saw she observed it with regard to the railroad scheme his explanation after lunch was very short a big ordnance map showed her where the line would enter the park where it would enter the tunnel not to appear again till it had passed outside the precinct its whole course would be quite remote from the houseremote also from the wooded side of the park they would be as unconscious of its presence there as if it was in the next county the wyfold route on the other hand which perhaps might be adopted if amelie put serious obstacles in the companys way would actually be very much closer to the house and the forested piece of the park than the other mr palmer made these explanations as if he anticipated some opposition on amelies part and he was pleased to find none it seems to me much the most sensible plan she said and as you say the railway will really interfere with us less if it is in molesworth than if it was in wyfold i must just tell bertie about it and i will send you my formal consent this evening i will leave everything connected with the sale in your hands she pushed the maps away from her with rather a weary air and how are you papa she said falling into her old habit of addressing him i havent set eyes on you for weeks mr palmer gave a moments consideration to how he was before he answered well i guess im a bit out of condition in the brain he said from the business point of view england is the most enervating place i ever came to these directors and business men here are about as much use as nurserymaids they go down to their offices round about eleven and sit there till one then they eat a heavy lunch and stroll back about two to see if anything has happened of course it hasnt things dont happen unless you make them happen so they light a big cigar and go down to woking for an evening round of golf after the fatigues of the day saturdays they dont put in an appearance at all thats their idea of business and it tells on me rather its difficult to keep up ordinary high pressure when youre surrounded by so many flabby bits of chewed string i guess ill go back to america in the fall and get braced up it dont affect mamma said amelie falling more and more into her native vernacular she just flies around same as ever shes having a real daisy of a time she says mr palmer did not listen to this he was pursuing his own melancholy reflections on english business methods it reminds me of a poultryyard he said an englishman on the rare occasions when he lays an egg has to flap his wings and crow over it instead of sitting down to hatch it why i suppose theyve given fifty lunches to boards of the directors over this twopennyhalfpenny line of mine already there was a luncheon on the formation of the board there was a luncheon to celebrate their determination to set to work at once there was a luncheon to celebrate their doing so there was a dinner on the occasion of the cutting of the first sod of earth they brought down some foolsort of highness to do it they had a week at the seaside when the bill passed through the house and when the first train runs next month theyll all go and have a restcure on the completion of their labours what they want is something to cure them of their habit of always resting he got up from his chair in some impatience folded up the maps and stood looking at his daughter in silence for a moment say amelie he said and what kind of time have you been having all going serene and domestically bertie been behaving himself do either of you want anything you look a bit down somehowkind of tired about the eyes amelie looked up at him the tired about the eyes seemed to be a wonderfully true interpretation of how she felt oh we trot along she said i suppose everyone has their bits of worries mamma has when she accepts three dinner invitations for the same evening you have when your directors give luncheonparties instead of doing business we all have cant see why you should he said i dont like you to worry amelie whats it all about he paused a moment have you heard anything about bertie which bothers you he asked or hasnt he been good to you she did not answer at once for in her rather supersensitized frame of mind it seemed to her that her fathers first question was not vague or general but that he had some special definite reason for asking from that it was but the shortest of links necessary to couple the question with that which grew mushroomlike in the shadow of her mind no he has been perfectly good to me and i have heard nothing that bothers me she said she looked up at her father as she spoke he was standing close to hera short graywhiskered man insignificant in face and features except for those wonderful eyes in his hand the hand which by a stroke of the pen a signing of the name could set in motion the force of millions was a little silver paperknife which she had once given him even now as she knewfor he had said he could only give her five minutes after lunchthere were waiting for him a hundred schemes to be considered a hundred more levers to move the world as he chose but he stood there waiting with a womans infinite patience for any impulse towards confidence shemight feeljust a tender solicitous father grasping in his hand a daughters insignificant gift we have always been chums amelie he said with a sort of appealing wistfulness when you were quite little you always used to bring me your little worries for us to smooth out together i used to be pretty smart at it i used to be devilish proud of the way i could take the frown out of your little forehead she held out her hand to him you are an old darling she said with unshed tears springing to her eyes but i tell you this truth it is only i who have been worrying i have been imagining all sorts of things so that i have got to believe them that is the matter with me you have heard nothing specific he asked again that question arrested her awoke her imaginings and she made up her mind on what had long been a pondered idea she got up at once nothing whatever she said with a resumption of her usual manner now i am going take care of yourself papa darling and wake this sleepy old county up i adore its sleepiness myself and i know you can never rouse it otherwise i should not suggest it the carriage was waiting for her and she got briskly in mrs emsworths she said to the footman as she drove there she tried to stifle thought for she knew that her design was to confirm or dispel a suspicion that should never have been hers she was doing a thing which was based on a wrong done to her husband in thought that she knew but she combated it by saying to herself what if it is true she found mrs emsworth at home and delighted to see her and for a little they just interchanged the generalities which between two people who have not seen each other for some time are the necessary ushers to real talk the day was very hot and dorothy catlike basked and purred in it there was something rather decollete about her appearance and something in her general atmosphere was equally so she was in fact very different so she struck amelie from the woman who told the gardeners son the fairystory on the dewy lawn at long island i am charmed to see you she said for the second time when amelie was seated and i was furious the other day when you put me off coming to see you at molesworth had you a prim party if so it was kind of you priggish prim and prudishthose are the qualities i dislikeprobably she added with admirable candour because i do not happen to be fortunate enough to possess them she paused a moment then an idea seemed to strike her and where and how is bertie she asked i havent set eyes on him for monthsnot since the party in long island in fact he said he hadnt seen you since then the other day said amelie no im rather hurt because at one time you know we were the greatest friends i used to see him every day nearly then she got up with her slow catlike movements and stretched herself luxuriously and laughed a lazy laugh of somewhat animal enjoyment something about amelies attitudeher reserve her stiffness which was altogether unlike what she remembered of her in long islandrather irritated her and woke in her that gamin spirit of mischief which was a very sensible ingredient in her nature amelie was putting her nose in the air giving herself airs and if there was one thing in the world dorothy could not stand it was that then to fortify the mischievous spirit she remembered the unexplained return of her present to bertie he too was giving himself airs his nose was in the air and when dorothy saw a nose in the air it was her habit to very rudely lay hold of it so to speak and rub it in the mud then as a copingstone to her noseinair theory had come amelies refusal to let her come over to molesworth decidedly this was a case for treatment also her love of making mischiefan occupation we are led to infer specially designed by satanwas rather strong in her so she laughed her laugh and continued then he dropped me she said just opened his fingers and let me drop i suppose i ought to have been broken but i wasnt she had sat down again in a very long low chair opposite amelie and noticed with great inward amusement the tense interest with which amelie listened to her i suppose berties been playing about again she thought to herself an amorous young man but it isnt playing the game now hes married and with only threequarters of her mind bent on mischief she went on yes i suppose i ought to have been broken but one gets tough you know but when i sent him a really charming weddingpresent and had it sent back without a word i thought it was rather strong that was being dropped with a vengeance did bertie do that asked amelie yes dear unless you did back it came anyhow now if i had not been the sweetesttempered meekest little moses that ever lived i should havewell made it unpleasant amelie flushed her manner was still far from pleasing dorothy for she sat as upright in her chair as if the plague lurked in the back or arms of it i dont understand you she said how could you make it unpleasant for bertie mrs emsworth laughed amelie really was too stately for words my dear you are new to london of course but i wonder that no candid friend has ever told you bertie was once just madly in love with me it was a great bore though i liked him well enough but such classical ardour was beyond me his letterhas he never confessed to you about the letter he wrote me it was quite a lyrical letter and it made me scream i was just the only thing on gods earth can you show it me asked amelie very quietly i should think it must be amusing she made a rather pitiful attempt to laugh i wish i could said the other still maliciously i am sure you would shriek over it but i tore it up ages agolast autumn to be accurate the first time i saw bertie in america it was rather kind of merather excessively kind i have sometimes thought i might have had some fun over it she glanced carelessly across to amelie the girl had grown quite pale even to the lips and her hands were trembling instantly a compunction as quick as all her emotions seized the other ah you mustnt mind my nonsense dear amelie she cried jumping up i have been talking very foolishly i did not think it would make you mind like that she took the girls hand but amelie withdrew it but there was this letter she said and bertie did make love to you yes why not show me the man the most respectable married man who says he has never kissed another girl in his life and i will show you a liar what does it matter a lyrical letter said amelie yes i wish i had kept it i would show it you suddenly a wave almost of physical nausea swept over amelie she had all the stainless purity of thought of a girl who has been married young to the first man she has ever loved and in the first moment of her knowing definitely that bertie at one time had made love to this woman she felt sicksimply sick she rose from her chair and put on her gloves while dorothy watched her conscious that some emotion which she herself had so long forgotten had she ever experienced it that she no longer comprehended it mastered her and with the best intentions in the world not recognising that any further allusion to her own friendship with bertie would only further disgust and sicken his wife she said that was all there was never anything moreanything wrong amelie turned on her a marble face how am i to know she asked what prevented it his morals the lyrical letterwriter or yours dorothy felt a strong though momentary impulse to box her ears it would probably have been a good thing if she had yielded to it she herself had felt for amelie a sort of wondering pity that a matter so long dead could possibly be bitter still and acting under that she had done her best to reassure her but amelie had slapped that generous impulse in the face she had also chosen to express doubt as to the truth of what she had been told and a rather more pronounced felinity awoke in dorothys face you had better go and talk it out with bertie she said ask him to repeat what he remembers of that letter he is sure to have some recollection of it even now that he is so happily married you can then draw your own conclusions and as far as i am concerned you are perfectly free to do so oh yes and tell him that i constantly use the dressingbag he so kindly returned and think of him amelie went out feeling as if her world had fallen in ruins about her head possibilities which she had been ashamed of harbouring in her mind suddenly leapt out into flaring certainties and they enveloped her she could not think as yet coherently or connectedly wherever she turned her thoughts a flame flashed in her eyes all her secret doubts were justified bertie had loved this woman it was she who had called out the notes of his lyre while she herself was given the shillings and penceall the small change of the dower of love which he had once showered on mrs emsworth she could get no further than this in this circle her thoughts ran round and round like a squirrel in a revolving cage wherever she tried to go she was still pawing round that one circle she could get no further the range of her mental processes was limited to that and she now knew at once that she had to go on her way whatever it was unattended uncomforted and even in the exaggerated desolation of these first moments she could make the one resolve that no one not even her father should ever know this her pride imperatively demanded whatever she had to bear she would bear in silence and she could bear anything except pity i want to be firethat was explained now and that he should want that seemed to her an added insult my dear amelie he seemed to say you are a charming girl but you dont interest melike that i wish you did i really wish you did she bit her underlip till it was white with the pressure of her teeth and clasped her hands so tightly in her lap that the sharp facets of the stones in her rings dinted her fingers the future spelt impossibility there were hours daily to be gone through with bertie what of them what of the little loverlike caresses that were still constant between them what indeed of the whole tissue of his simulated loveof his wish to be fire for the moment whether it was true or not that the acme of his relationship with mrs emsworth culminated actually in that lyrical letter or not she hardly cared it was there in any case that his fire had burnedhad burned itself out for a moment the spinning cage of her thoughts paused and she moved forward in a straight and horrible line since her engagement to bertie those two had not met bertie had returned her weddingpresent he had refused to have her at the house why because he was afraid of seeing her lest the fire had burned for her what if it had not yet burned itself out chapter xvii the london season was over and with most admirable industry now that that garden was empty of flowers the bees of the world flew in all directions to other gardens where the autumn flowers bloomed cowes was crammed carlsbadthis was a medicinal flowerwas crammed also scotland was beginning to echo with the buzzing and in a hundred country houses all over the kingdom other bees were resting a moment cleaning the pollen from their legs as it were before they went forth again one hot august afternoon a small company of bees were pollencleaning at haworth talking over that is to say the events of the last few monthslondons little adventures and ironies with the exception of bertie who was in scotland with his wife the party was much the same as that which had sat there just a year ago before the departure of him and sybil massington to america in fact the only other change was that the latter was mrs massington no longer but just as before she sat in an extremely comfortable chair on the lawn with charlie by her side and ginger his hat over his face lying on the grass in front of them as before also he was employed in editing the history of the world and making parenthetical prophecies for the future oh we are certainly getting on he was saying and the last year i am happy to inform you shows great progress the palmerization of england is perhaps the most significant sign of the times england in fact consists of men women and palmers chiefly the latter if you want to go by trains anywhere the money you pay for your ticket goes into the pockets of palmers if you want you shouldnt complain then interrupted sybil i dont i like it at least i like most of it but not all i went down to molesworth the other day there were gangs of navvies busy on the construction of the line that i dont mind it was remote from the house but until mr palmer bought it you were all remote from the house too said sybil you none of you ever went near it quite true reverberating throbs shook the air where they were blasting the tunnel that also i dont mind but on the lawn in the glades in the garden they were sinking boreholes to find the extent and direction of the new coalfield have they found coal asked charlie yes they found it in the tunnel they found it also on the wyfold estate between which and the tunnel lie the house and gardens therefore i suppose in a years time the whole place will be a colliery i dont like that i didnt think amelie would do that said sybil nor did bertie i remember talking to him about it he said he thought that his wish would have influence with her one cant blame her any more than one blames a trufflehound for finding truffles it is in the blood that scent and search for wealth of course the borings are only exploratory but what is the point of exploring if you do not mean to utilize what you find i thought she was so fond of molesworth said sybil she was at first but she has taken an extraordinary dislike to it she and he stopped there was silence a moment but they havent quarrelled asked sybil at length oh dear no they are staying about together in scotland now but something has happened what has happened i suppose she knows bertie doesnt since when was this asked charlie about six weeks ago towards the middle of julyand quite suddenly bertie says she had been lunching with her father one day to talk over the railway matters and when she came back she was quite a different person quite polite you understand quite courteous and considerate but as far away as the antipodes sybil got out of her chair with a sudden quick movement mrs emsworth she said but there was nothing to know said ginger there were no revelations possible because there was nothing to reveal mrs emsworth said sybil again emphatically i remember seeing her about that time and she told me that amelie had been to call on her she said she had been rather prim rather priggish and in that connection made remarks about the refining influence of married life i asked what she meant and she said that bertie had cut her dropped her she was rather incisive over it and tried to laugh about it but she didnt like it all the same i can recommend her remarks about puritans to the attention ofof puritans ginger sat up amelies an awfully good sort he saidand so is bertie but to dine with them as i did just before they went north was like dining with a piece of ice at one end of the table and a lump of snow at the other now what has happened i reconstruct this that mrs emsworth being annoyed with bertie told amelie what friends they had been theres a working hypothesis anyhow but platonically said charlie berties platonism waswas aristotelian in its intensity said ginger he once wrote a letter to her i believe which might have been open to misconstruction and she told amelie about it do you think asked sybil that occurs to one theres judy taking her sunday walk its just like last year she is coming here and she shall give us advice they called to her but to hurry judy when she was taking her exercise was an impossible task however she arrived at last and the case was laid before her she heard in silence and turned to ginger do you mind interfering she asked no i like it what then write to bertie tell him that amelie called on mrs emsworth that day dear oracle observed sybil judy put down her sunshade for here under the trees the shade was deep and the air cool i hate seeing two excellent people making such a mess of their lives she said they are both proud they are both reticent and neither will speak unless the other speaks first i have a great belief in having things out if only amelie would pull berties hair or scratch his face and say what are you behaving like sour milk for or if only he would do that to her something must happen but they go freezing and freezingevery day the ice gets thicker soon it will be frozen into a solid block that is why i advise ginger to throw a stone at it so to speak without delay i dont know that bertie will thank me said ginger i dont think he takes the same pleasure in being interfered with as i take in interfering probably not but no situation can be worse than that which at present exists i remember i was there when she told bertie that she had given orders to make half a dozen boringholes for coal in the park she announced it in the same tone as she might have announced that she had given orders for the carriage to be round at halfpast two and bertie hardly looked up from his book and merely said the diamond drill is generally used i believe in making boreholes that is bertie at his worst said ginger it seemed to me tolerably bad i looked at amelie to see how she took it her face was like frozen marble but as she turned away her lip quivered a moment it made me feel ill then soon afterwards i looked at bertie he was not reading but staring straight in front of him he looked as if his face was made of wood so i say stir them up at any price ginger sighed heavily vanity of vanities he said a year ago bertie thought that nothing would be intolerable if he had money we most of us think the same until we have got it then we find that nothing on the whole matters less that one sees in america we are supposed to take our pleasures sadly but in america they take them seriously as well all the gold of the indies cannot make a man gay and all the palmerization that is going on does not add one jot to anybodys happiness i hate it said judy suddenly i look on america as some awful cuttlefish its tentacles are reaching over the world it grips hold of some place and no power on earth can detach those suckers you cannot see it coming because it clouds the whole of the atmosphere with the thick opacity of its juice wealth thus before you know it is there and you are powerless it has come to england it laid hold first on the newline from liverpool to southampton that is spreading in all directions it is in london in every sense of the word what woman was the central figure there this year the queen not at all mrs palmer at seaton house it laid hold of worcestershire the huge new coalfield on the wyfold estate is theirs molesworth is to be a coalfield then there is your admirer sybil half the theatres in london belong to mr bilton and the worst of it is that from all practical points of view america is our benefactor theatres are better ventilated and better lighted coal will be cheaper one will get about the country more expeditiously only very soon it will not be our country that is the only drawback and it is a purely sentimental one sybil shivered slightly charlie she said i look upon you as my lifepreserver a tentacle touchedjust touched me the juice of wealth as judy says had prevented my seeing what was coming but one night you were ill do you remember she smiled at him the complete smile of happiness lifepreserver said he and what were you judy turned to ginger these slight connubialities are rather embarrassing she said will you walk with me while i finish my exercise for the day sybil laughed dont go just yet judy she said charlie and i will send you away when we want to be alone judy rose with some dignity my selfrespect cannot quite stand that she said come ginger you shall walk back with me to the house and i will hold the pen when you write to bertie i shall put that in the postscript he said the vials of wrath shall descend on both of us the two strolled away out of the shadow of the trees into the yellow flood of sunshine that hung over the lawn the air was very windless and the flowerbeds below the house basked in full summer luxuriance of colour far away in a misty hollow the town of winchester sunned itself under a blue haze of heat and languid dimsounding church bells clanged distantly sybil turned towards her husband a year agojust a year ago she said we sat here like this i always remember that day as a day of pause before i started on adventures oh charlie on what tiny things life and happiness depend just as a bullet may pass within an inch of your head and not touch you when another inch would have killed you so the smallest incident may turn the whole course of things for do you know if i had not been in mrs emsworths room when mr bilton came in i believe i should have married him well then you see that had just got to happen said charlie smiling at her i suppose so do you know i am very happy today why particularly ah one never knows the reason for happiness if one knows the reason one is only pleased ah there is the train coming out of the cutting what was it we settled it said you thought utility i thought brutalite they sound very much alike there was a pause the train rumbled itself away into the distance and its diminuendo grew overscored again with the sounds of summer i met mr bilton again the other night said sybil he wished me every happiness i felt rather inclined to send the wish back like bertie with mrs emsworths weddingpresent he didnt please me somehow i dont trust him charlie he is extraordinarily like you many thanks you old darling do you know i believe it was that which made me firstfirst cast a favourable eye on him and what made you firmly remove that favourable eye i have told you then i came back to england and found you ill and i embarked on a career of most futile diplomacy i wanted to win you back to life you see without permitting or harbouring any sentiment you proposed to die because you were bored that seemed to me feeble futile charlie laughed it was rather but under the same circumstances i should do the same again ah the same circumstances cant occur he turned to her with the lovelight shining brightly in his eyes let us lean and love it over again he said how did it happen what change came to you tell me and to you there never came a change to me i have always loved you it was your illness first of all she said and that made me want to help i am very practical the futility of your dying seemed to me so stupid and as my handiwork the attachment of you to life grew i got rather proud of it it was like taking a plant that was lying all draggled in the mud and training it upright she paused a moment that grew she went on till one night you were taken suddenly ill at davos i came up to see you do you remember and at that momentthis is the only way i can explain iti began to become a woman so that if you or i could owe each other anything dear the debt i owe you is infinitely greater than what you owe me i gave you perhaps a few years of life you gave me life itself and love she bent her head took up his hand where it lay on the arm of her chair and kissed it ah not that sybil said he yes just that she answered the letter which the joint wits of judy and ginger concocted that afternoon went northwards and reached its destination next morning it told bertie merely the fact that on the day on which amelie had lunched with her father she had been to see mrs emsworth afterwards and suggested that it would be worth while finding out if possible what took place there of late the estrangement between him and amelie though it had in no ways healed had been since they were staying in other houses where there was less opportunity for intimacy and thus less sense of its absence less intolerably and constantly present to his consciousness every now and then as on the occasion when she told him that they were going to bore for coal there had been bitter and stinging moments but such were rare and their intercourse which was rare also was distinguished by cool if not frigid courtesy on this particular morning they were leaving the house they had been staying in near inverness and were coming south again to visit other friends in the north of england it was perfectly natural therefore that bertie should travel some part of the way at any rate in a smokingcarriage but the train being an express he never omitted to visit her carriage when it stopped and inquired whether she wanted anything once she was thirsty and he got her some lemonade from the refreshmentroom bought her papers and opened for her a window which was stiff to move these little attentions were accepted by her with the same courtesy as that with which they were offered and he would stand on the platform chatting to her through the window or seating himself for a few minutes in her carriage till it was time for him to go back to his own they lunched together in her carriage and it was at her suggestion that at the next stoppingplace he went back to the other to smoke after lunch it was then that he opened the letters which had reached him that morning having in the hurry of departure forgotten to do so and found gingers communication at first his impulse was to do nothing whatever and treat the letter as if it had never been received and following the dictation of his laisser aller nature make no further effort to investigate any possible source of his domestic estrangement in a way the freezing process had already gone far he had got used to his aloofness from his wife the acuteness of it had got dulled with time the intolerable had become bearable he was tired with conjecturing what had happened and the pride which at first had prevented him straightforwardly going to her and saying what have i done had become habit not having done so before he could not now and until she voluntarily told him the matter must remain in silence disgust fastidiousness and a bitter sense of having been cheated had at first stood in her way where pride stood in his and she like him having lost her first opportunity waited for him to be the first to speak but as he watched through the window the giddy scudding by of the brown windscoured moors his indifference began to fade and curiosity at first it was no more than that took its place having successfully blackmailed him had dorothy in order to emphasize his own weakness told his wife that which he had already paid so much to keep secret to have blackmailed him at all was so utterly unlike what he knew of her that he told himself he knew nothing at all and if this conjecture was right she became something monstrous something portentous he would really very much like to know if she was stupendous enough to do that a rather bitter smile crossed his face and he took out of his despatchbox a small packet containing the two letters for which he had paid so highly and a copy of the second blackmailing letter which he had made before he delivered his cheque and the original at biltons office in new york his own letter he read through again wondering at himself those words of wild adorationeven now he felt a faint internal thrill at the recollection of the mood they conjured up againwere written to a woman who had done this it seemed to him incredible that no inkling of her real nature had ever crossed his mind it seemed impossible that he could have loved one to whom this was possible for mere interest in a phenomenon like this he must find out what had passed between her and amelie it was impossible to ask amelie therefore he would ask her he wrote to her that night asking whether he might come and see her as soon as he got to town their northern visits were nearly at an end and he would be passing through in about a weeks time the matter he added was one which might be of great importance to him and his future happiness and no one in the world could help him but her the answer he got was thoroughly characteristiccharacteristic that is of the dorothy emsworth whom he knew thoroughly uncharacteristic of the dorothy who had blackmailed and then mocked at him by telling his wife what he had paid so heavily for her not to know charmed to see you it ran though you have behaved so very badly yes perhaps i can help you i dont know i am rather afraid i made mischief with your wife but she annoyed me and i have as you well know the temper of beelzebub really i am very fond of amelie but she is not very fond of me deeply pathetic but i shall get over it yours ever d e psthank you so much for the charming dressingbag you sent me i use it constantly it has your crest and initials on it so that i am constantly reminded of you by the way i shall give it you hot when we meet so it is only fair you should be warned bertie read this and reread it and for the first time a doubt stood by him dim and shadowy but apparent visible to the senses this last letter was so like her it threw into brighter light the unlikeness to her of the affair of the blackmail yet there was no other explanation the least plausible a week later they were both in london the palmers were there also on the eve of their departure to americamrs palmer having spent august very pleasantly in about thirty different houses her husband having spent it very profitably in one in other words he had remained the whole month in london and devoted himself to the consolidation and extension of his english interests he had been able to go ahead more completely on his own lines and with his own rapidity owing to the absence of other directors on their holidays and octopuslike had spread his tentacles far and wide but now affairs in america demanded his presence and he was leaving his english business in the hands of bilton who appeared to him the better he knew him to be extraordinarily efficient he was almost as rapid and quite as indefatigable as mr palmer himself and had the faculty of being able to absorb himself in one branch of his work from ten to eleven and to pass without pause into a similar state of absorption over another since then seaton house was open and to open their own house just for a couple of days was unnecessary bertie and amelie took up their quarters there mrs emsworth under biltons direction was to make another american tour this autumn and was in fact in london only for a day or two before she left by the same boat by which the palmers were also going she had made an appointment with bertie for the afternoon of the day after his arrival in london and since she had warned him that he might expect a hot time he took with him in order to equalize the temperature on both sides the contents of the packet that lived under lock and key in his despatchbox he had himself no wish to indulge in recrimination as he had told her he wanted and entreated her help but if she was proposing to hurl so to speak the returned dressingbag at his head the letter seemed to him of the nature of a gun that wanted a great deal of silencing she was at home when he arrived and he was at once shown up into the room he knew so well the outside blinds were down to keep out the stress of the august heat and the air was thick with the scent of flowers then there came the rustle of a dress on the landing outside and she entered are you there bertie she asked it is so dark one can see nothing she drew up one of the blinds that is better she said now what do you want she gave him no other greeting of handshake but sat down on the sofa opposite the chair where he had been sitting at the sight of her all his pentup anger and indignation rushed to the surface he had not known before how vile what she had done seemed to him what have i done to you that you should treat me like this he broke out once i gave you my heart myself all i was and you laughed at me thenoh my god it is too much she looked at him in blank surprise you got over it she said you married somebody else i think i behaved rather well if i had chosen i might have made things unpleasant for you but i am not that sort of woman bertie heard himself laugh though he was unconscious of any amusement i paid you a high price and you cheated me he said i paid you again that was not enough but you must needs tell her that is the sort of woman you are dorothy sat up either you are mad or i she said i think it is you as i told you your wife annoyed me she was prim priggish puritan i thought it would do her good to know that once you were foolish enough to write me a letter i wished i had kept it i remember i should have liked to have seen her face when i showed it her i cant bear prigs but you paying me and i cheating you if you will excuse the expression i wish the devil you would tell me what you mean bertie leant forward you are inimitable he said i never much respected your power as an actress till today but i see i was wrong you told me you were getting rich so rich perhaps that ten thousand pounds for a forgery and then five thousand more escape your memory he got up the mere statement of what she had done now that he was face to face with her infuriated him to a sort of madness of rage if you will excuse the expression you devil he said he came a step nearer and saw her shrink from him and look round as if to see where the bell was no no i am not going to touch you he said you neednt be frightened he took from his pocket the letters and unfolded them do you remember this and this he said and this a copy of the instructions you gave all that i think i could have forgiven you but on the top of it you tell amelie by your own confession you tell her that and anything more i suppose that occurred to you no doubt you told her that you had gratified my passion for you that is the only thing that can account for the change that came over her from the time she saw you dorothys frightened look had passed completely off give me those bertie she said quietly before god i swear to give you them back you can trust me i dont use that name unless i mean it his anger had so transported him that his errand to her had been forgotten he had come to ask for her help to learn anyhow if she would tell him exactly what she had said to amelie but the sight of her had somehow driven him to frenzy to a pitch of passionate anger which he had not known he was capable of but her words the quietness of them the sobriety with which she spoke sobered him there was something too in her tone that convinced him so in silence he handed them all to her she read through them all without once raising her eyes then she gave them back to him and sat still with eyes downcast when she raised them he saw that they were full of tears i know nothing whatever of the whole affair she said the torn letter i think is yours i remember tearing it up myself on the day on which you came to see me in new york the other two i know nothing of and you thoughtyou bertie who knew methought i had done that i thought you had done that he repeated mockingly then his doubt stood beside him again a little clearer a little more precise in outline and his tone changed you didnt do it he said she looked at him half in scorn half in pity i she said in a tone indescribable and no more she was far too deeply hurt to reproach him no words could meet the situation but looking at him she saw the anger die out of his face and knew that he believed her i am sorry i am sorry he stammered she made a gesture of impatience tell me all about it from the beginning she said and she heard him in silence and you thought i had done that she said certainly it looked like it but you ought to have known it was impossible you did not now listen she paused a moment bertie for many months you saw me almost daily and guessed nothing of all the men i have knowni have known severali loved one you that was why i always refused you it was my one decent impulse it was not easy for me nor was it easy for me to see you marry amelie but i loved you and liked her and in a very dim and vague sort of way i realized that there was such a thing as keeping good as being clean even i realized that so i kept you by me as long as i could because your passion for me made you lead a proper life you did not know that other women even existed while you could see me then you wrote that letter and i knew that i could resist no longer if i continued to see you so i sent you away i have done a good many horrible things in my life but i have done just that one decent one one thing more you have never known me do a mean thing i wonder you dared think it was i who blackmailed you now that is absolutely all i have no other word to say about myself i have one he said can you forgive me i have no idea she answered she got up and walked once or twice up and down the room he sitting where he was not looking at her but hearing only the froufrou of her dress then he heard the sprit of a lighted match and a moment afterwards she blew a great cloud of smoke into his face you disgusting horrible pig she said my fingers simply tingle to box your ears now what is to be done it is perfectly clear who blackmailed you and if you like you can have him in the hollow of your hand bilton said bertie of course he really is rather a charming character he had a grudge against me because i told sybil brancepeth ofof past events he has made a good attempt to pay it off now what will you do personally i should like you to prosecute him and i will come to the trial you could get him years and years for that but you must not do it except with your wifes permission england is the home of linenwashing in public it is the one industry that remains to us but you must ask her first tell me what terms are you on polite speaking terms dorothy laughed what fools husbands and wives are she remarked why dont you have it out with her why dont you explode boil over beat her or something it is partly my fault too i saw she thought there was more to be told and i did not trouble to convince her for she did behave so primly nose in the air as if i was a bad smell she paused a moment go to her now at once she said before you have time to think it over show her the letter tell her the whole story off with you ah wait a minute she left the room quickly and came back again with the dressingbag in her hand will you take it now she said with her enchanting smile he could not speak there was a pathos about her gaiety that gripped his throat all happiness to you and her dear bertie she said now go away it was between eleven and twelve that night when bertie left the smokingroom and went upstairs his wife had gone some quarter of an hour before but mr palmer had detained him talking he tapped at her bedroom door her maid opened it and after a moment he was admitted she was sitting before her glass in a blue silk and lace dressinggown and her hair a rippling sheet of molten gold was streaming down her back you want to speak to me she asked if i may you can go she said to the maid i will send for you if i want you amelie got up smoothing her hair back behind her ears if she had been the most finished coquette she would have done exactly that art would have imitated the complete naturalness of the movement her face was very pale and looked infinitely weary but its beauty the beauty of that falling river of gold the beauty of her bare arm and the gentle swell of her bosom half seen through the low opening of the neck of her dressinggown had never been more dazzling but her eyes were lustreless they looked on him as on a stranger what is it she asked he tried to school his tongue to begin but for the moment it would not would tomorrow do as well asked amelie i am rather tired no i want to tell you tonight said he it is about mrs emsworth she flushed and turned her head a little away i do not care to hear she said i must tell you all the same he said she shrugged her shoulders ever so slightly i cannot prevent you she said she sat down by her toilettable turning only a shoulder to him and with her cool white hands idly arranged the things that stood there and he began his tale he told her everything from the beginning of his wild infatuation for mrs emsworth of the absolute innocence of that attachment and of the letter he had written she interrupted him here i do not see why you tell me this she said i knew all you have told me you did not know it from me he said that makes a difference for the first time her face softened a little yes she said i see that do you believe what i tell you she turned now and faced him no bertie i am afraid not she said it is not reasonable we all know what sort of a woman mrs emsworth is you say you were madly in love with her we know also what a mans code of morality usually is is it reasonable there is a reason he said tell it me then it is hard to tell you he said but it is this she loved me for that reason she wished me notnot to act unworthily so she laughed at me she sent me away amelie got up and stood in front of him with head downcast instinctively and completely she knew this to be the truth and was humbled she touched his arm gently with her fingertips yes that is a very good reason she said bertie i am sorry all these awful weeks i have believed the other it has made everything black and bitter to me have you minded so much he asked i have minded more than i can possibly tell you she said but i believe you now and i am sorry bertie took her hand and kissed it there was more to tell yet i want to tell you first about the letter he said and then there is just one word more mrs emsworth destroyed it or believed she did but it fell into the hands of a man whom i will name if you wish at least she regards it as certain it was he he blackmailed me twice over it sending me once a copy of the letter the second time the letter itself i paid him both times who was it asked she harold bilton now what do you wish me to do it will mean publicity if you prosecute him she asked all those horrors of a court yes i dont think i could bear it about you she said threaten him if you like get back your money if you can but not that bertie it shall be as you wish do you want to very much i see red when i think of him said he ah dont dont she said she was silent a moment one thing more then he said i want to show you the letter i want you to know all i have brought it here will you read it yes if you wish she said she took it from him and went over to the brighter light of the dressingtable to read it by it was long and it took her some minutes and in those minutes she learned for the first time what a mans love could be and she envied with a sense of passionate longing the woman to whom it was written that was the fire he had spoken of when she had finished she gave it back to him i have read it all she said poor bertie you suffered she paused and suddenly her jealousy and her desire flamed high you never spoke to me like that she said his white face looked down on her no dear since then until weeks after we were married i thought all power of feeling like that was dead in me i had forgotten what it meant i could not imagine ever wanting to care like that again then by degrees you and your sweetness and your love and your beauty awoke the desire again that desire grew and my power to feel it grew with it till it trembled on the verge of passion it was growing every day when things began to come between us till in these last weeks we have been worse than strangers something woke in her eyes that he had not seen there for months and will it grow again now she asked or have i spoiled it all he drew her to him amelie forgive me he said whether you can or not i dont know but if you still care for me at all try try to help me the light in her eyes grew more wonderful if i care for you she asked if i care for you he kissed her on her beautiful eyes and on her mouth so it is all told dear said he and you will help me you look very tired i have been keeping you up i am not tired now she said and bertie bertie there is one thing yet before very many months i shall be the mother of your child and the long pentup tempest of her love for him broke overwhelming and flooding her her arms were pressed round his neck and from his shoulder she raised her face to his your child she whispered again chapter xviii on the second morning after this bilton was seated at breakfast with his confidential secretary by him who was engaged in opening and reading his letters to him and taking shorthand notes of his replies bilton himself glanced at the envelopes and directions first and reserved for his own opening anything that carried a superscription of privacy or was in the hand of anyone with whom he was on terms of intimacy there were never many of these the bulk of his daily correspondence was of a purely business character which was on the whole infinitely more to his mind than the effusions of friends of late his mailbag had put on weight enormously the english affairs of mr palmer and the swelling trade of his own personal enterprises having almost doubled it in the last few months but this increase was wholly welcome to him since every letter received and answered meant business on this particular morning there was nothing as far as he could see designed for his private eye and the quiet smoothvoiced young american who sat by him had the field to himself some letters required but a monosyllabic reply from his master which he jotted down in a corner of the page others were longer and demanded some halfpage of cabalistic notes others again were set aside to be dealt with by bilton himself there were today several of them dealing with the subject of a threatened strike at the railway works which were in process of establishment at the junction where the cardiff line now in process of construction would join the existing liverpool and southampton the business was an annoying one bricklayers employed on repairs on a tunnel there were already out and now a demand came from platelayers on the same section another letter was from the engineer in charge of that section of the line the entrance to the tunnel on the work of which the bricklayers had been employed was of course perfectly safe with its wooden casing and strutting but in case of heavy or continuous rain the ground might get soft and the struts sink in the ground thus rendering the passage unsafe for trains he suggested that labour should be brought from elsewhere at once unless the men could be induced to go back to work the letters dealing with this bilton had caused to be put on one side towards the end of his breakfast he asked for a second reading of them some of the matters appeared to him to be rather urgent in addition to that mr palmer was leaving for liverpool and america the next morning and would thus be out of touch for the next eight days so after a little consideration he dictated a telegram to say that he would go down there himself that afternoon there were but few letters remaining and during biltons pause for consideration the secretary had opened the rest and had them ready to read the next was from amelie dear sir kindly order all work of coalboring on the molesworth property to be stopped until further instructions from me faithfully yours amelie keynes bilton frowned and held out his hand for this ill answer that he said go on the smoothvoiced secretary proceeded we are instructed by our client the earl keynes to apply to you for the prompt payment of the sum of fifteen thousand pounds should your cheque for this not reach us by the evening of tuesday september his lordship will place the matter in other hands he desires me to admit no discussion either from you or your representatives we are dear sir faithfully yours hobarts howard bilton did not ask for this he plucked it out of the young mans hand anything more he asked no sir that is all very good i shall leave by the two oclock train for molesworth i shall spend the night there and get back tomorrow if by the evenings post today or by tomorrow mornings post there is anything further from messrs hobarts and howard telegraph it to me bilton did not at once move from the breakfasttable after his secretary had left him but remained seated there his elbow on the table his lips caressing an unlit cigar adept as he was at seeing combinations and supplying from his imagination factors which alone would account for certain combinations presented to him as problems he could not at once see his way through this more than that he could not determine with any internal satisfaction on his next move that move might of course be merely a negative movemere inaction on his part but turn the matter over in what way he might he could not see how to say check in answer to this check he was threatenedthreatened too by a firm of eminently reputable solicitors who presumably would not undertake business of any but the securest nature fifteen thousand pounds it is true did not mean anything very particular to him but he saw further than that should he pay it the very fact of his payment was equivalent to his shrewd american brain to a confession of his guilt what if he paid only to find that he had clinched the proof against himself and if he did not pay if he shrugged his shoulders at the whole matter what if the other hands were entrusted with it he rose from the table biting his cigar through the blackmailer blackmailed he muttered new sensational novel guess ill think it over he glanced again at the letter and saw that he had till the evening of the next day in which to commit himself definitely to one or the other course of action he would be back in london in the course of the next afternoon there would be time then and today he was really too busy to give the matter the attention which he was afraid it deserved but by midday tomorrow the affair of the strike in any case would be off his mind he would devote the whole of the hours occupied by his journey back to london if necessary to the consideration of this matter then there was the note from amelie stopping the coalboring in a moment a possible reconstruction of what had happened suggested itself to him she knew he went down to the scene of the strike that afternoon and found things rather more serious than he had anticipated the bricklayers had already gone out the platelayers had sent in demands which he did not feel himself justified in accepting without consultation with mr palmer and what was much more serious in spite of their indentures there was a hint of trouble with the signalmen it took him indeed some two or three hours to find out the full extent of that with which the line was threatened and in the back of his mind all the time was the consciousness of that with which he himself was threatened he had in fact to leave the inspection of the tunnel till the next morning he left also till the next morning in case the result of his negotiations with the strikers might prove to be nugatory the despatch of a telegram to mr palmer asking him to have the express in which he would travel to liverpool stopped at the wyfold junction so that he himself might get in there and during the journey to liverpool talk over the situation in that case it would be necessary also perhaps to get an extra day for himself in his own private matter and after dinner he telegraphed to messrs hobarts and howard saying that he would reply to them by the evening of september extremely urgent business he said engaged his attention and being at a loss to understand their communication he asked for this extension he went up to bed in the rather dingy hotel in which he was forced to stay conscious of extreme weariness but unhappily conscious of an inability to obtain the refreshment of sleep often before now he had suffered from insomnia and he was aware when he got into bed that the worst form of insomnianamely the utter absence of the slightest drowsiness which to some extent compensates for the absence of sleepwas likely to be his he knew that there lay before him a seemingly infinite period of intensely active thought inharmoniously linked with an intensely active desire for sleep a millrace of coherent images foamed through his brain all tinged with failure he cursed himself for all he had done he had made a mess of his courtship of sybil he had made a mess over the wretched fifteen thousand pounds knowing bertie he thought he had known how safe this small transaction was true it was scarcely worth while but the man who makes his million makes it by consideration of very much smaller sums and it was not in his nature to have neglected any chance the chance seemed certain his money was paid his letters were returned never had blackmail gone on smoother wheels but in his wakefulness and in his agitation about the strike which involved larger issues to him than the mere payment of this sum the latter assumed nightmare proportions it swelled and encompassed him if he paid there was his confession if he did not pay there were the other hands ready to undertake the business i did not think the young man had so much blood in him he thought as he tossed in his abominable featherbed during the last fortyeight hours the plans of the palmer family had somewhat altered mrs palmer for instance had discovered that it was necessary to start at ten in the morning in order to join the liverpool and southampton line by which her husband wished to travel that was clearly out of the question and the matter resolved itself into a decision whether they should go by euston or spend the night at molesworth stopping the liverpool express there the latter counsel prevailed and a couple of hours after bilton had left london they also left four of them for bertie was of the party his plans too had changed he was going to america now instead of following a fortnight later the inn at which bilton passed the night was close to the railwaystation at frampton near which on the south lay the tunnel where there was trouble with the strikers frampton itself was originally a small village but was now extending huge suckers of jerrybuilt houses into the country for it lay on the junction between the liverpool and southampton line and the new communication with south wales it was on the junction too of the molesworth and wyfold estates molesworth lying on the north wyfold to the south consequently the palmer party had passed through it the afternoon before and had got out at the station of molesworth some five miles further on this of course was unknown to bilton who imagined they were still in london he rose from his bed the next morning feeling tired and unrefreshed dressed and sent a telegram to mr palmer at seaton house asking him to have the train stopped at wyfold where he himself would get in as he wanted to consult with him over the situation it should reach him in london in plenty of time before he started and he himself would have the greater part of the morning at frampton and would get over to wyfold in time to take the train there he wished also to see for himself the condition of the unfinished and abandoned work in the tunnel and get an estimate if possible from the engineer of the shortest time in which it would be possible to finish the work without interrupting traffic in case he decided to import labour at once his work in connection with other matters however took him rather longer than he had anticipated and he set off down the mile of line which lay between frampton and the tunnel to meet the engineer who was appointed to be waiting for him there rather short of time he had expected to be obliged to go over to wyfold in the course of the morning and he had therefore telegraphed to have the train stopped there this had proved however to be unnecessary but it was too late now to alter the rendezvous to frampton the tunnel in question was a very deep burrow under some mile of hill that rose steeply above it and its completionor so close an approach to completion that it could be usedhad been the great triumph of speed in the construction of the line he found that the work remaining to be done was easily compassable within a week or two if sufficient numbers of men could be brought to the spot while there was also at the wyfold end of the tunnel another unfinished piece of less extent if anything than this the report of the engineer also put matters in rather a less serious light the great beams and timber which supported the wooden arch over which the bricks had to be laid were at present absolutely secure it would take weeks of rain before danger was even threatened but would it not be well if possible to finish so small a job at once and have it off their minds bilton was decidedly of this opinion and gave orders that steps should be taken to get outside labour without delay this concluded his mornings work he looked at his watch it was later than he had known and to walk back a mile to frampton where he could get a trap and then drive over the huge ridge of the tunnel down into wyfold might mean missing the train which would stop for him there but would assuredly not wait if he was not on the platform but the engineer had an easy solution why not walk through the tunnel which would take very little longer than going back to frampton he would thus find himself within a mile of the wyfold station he could get there in very little over half an hour going briskly and would easily be in time to step into the stopped express no train was due on either line for the next halfhour in fact the next train that would pass would be the southampton to liverpool express in which at the moment he would himself be travelling the engineer would provide him with a lantern which he could leave at the signalbox at the other end of the tunnel this seemed an admirable arrangement and in a couple of minutes he had set off the light cast by the lantern was excellent it shone brightly to guide his path and gleamed on the rails of the four tracks as they pointed in narrowing perspective up the black cavern that lay before him until they were lost in the darkness he walked on the righthand side of the tunnel immediately on his left was the main line from southampton to liverpool along which he would soon return at a brisker pace than that which was his now for some hundreds of yards the gray glimmer from the end of the tunnel where he had entered also cast a diffused light into the darkness but as he proceeded the light faded and grew dim and when he was now some third of the way through the slight continuous bend in the tunnel which had been necessary in order to avoid a belt of unstable and shifty strata obscured it altogether and he walked but for the light from his lantern in absolute darkness his own footsteps echoed queerly from the curved vault but there was otherwise dead silence save for some occasional drip of water all outside noises of the world were entirely cut off from him he was stepping along thus when he saw with a sudden start of horror that there was something dark lying between the second and third pair of rails a little way ahead of him from the fact that he started he was conscious that his nerves were not working with their accustomed smoothness and coolness and he heard his heart hammering in his throat then he pulled himself together crossed the two rails which lay between him and it turned the lantern on it and saw next moment with a spasm of relief that it was only a coat left there and forgotten no doubt by some workman with a cheap impulse of kindness he picked it up meaning to leave it with his lantern at the signalbox at the far end but as he picked it up and stepped on again to regain the side path where he had been walking his foot tripped in it or on the corner of some sleeper and he fell forward the lantern flying from his hand and smashing itself to atoms on the hard metal of the road and his head struck full on the temple against the steel of the track the blow completely stunned him about the same time the party left molesworth to drive to the station where the liverpool express would be stopped for them it was a distance of not more than three miles but they stopped in the village close to the station in case there was anything at the postoffice which had come by the second post and would thus miss them there was only one thinga telegram from bilton redirected from seaton house asking that the train might be stopped at wyfold so they drove on to the station and there learned that the express had already passed through wyfold without stopping and would reach molesworth in six or seven minutes so mr palmer who never wasted regrets on the inevitable shrugged his shoulders and inspected the bookstall while mrs palmer inundated the telegraphoffice with despatches and bertie and amelie strolled up and down the platform bilton came to himself with a blank unconsciousness of where he was it was quite dark and he first realized that he was not in bed by the feel of his clothes then he put his hand to his head and drew it away with a start of horror for it was warm and wet then he felt with his hand the metal of the roadway and following that encountered one of the rails at that the broken ends of memory joined themselves and he knew where he was simultaneously he heard the dead silence broken by a distant roar and rumble at this he started to his feet wavered and nearly fell again all his senses were suddenly electrified vivified by that noise and he remembered allhow he had started to walk through the tunnel how he had picked up the coat how he had fallen how the engineer had told him that the next train through would be that to liverpool but where was he on which line had he fallen there were four tracks he thought he ought to move to the right across the railsno to the left hell was it to the right or to the left that that train would pass the roar got louder it echoed with an infernal clangour from the curved sides of the tunnel it prevented him thinking and he felt sure that if it would only stop for one second his head would be clear and he could take two steps to safety but that noise must stop a moment and in a frenzy no longer master of himself he shouted hoarsely and impotently waved his hand in the darkness from which way did it come from in front of him or behind him if he could only settle that he would know what to do the roaring grew unbearable it drove him mad and with his fingers in his ears he began to run he did not know where and he again tripped on some rail and fell on the sides of the tunnel there shone a red gloomy light but he did not see it above the roar and rattle of the racing wheels there sounded the hot quick panting of some monster but he did not hear it he knew one moment of awful shock of the sense of being torn and battered in pieces then the roar sank down as the train passed on and diminished into silence as it emerged from the darkness of the tunnel into the pure and glorious sunlight of that september morning and to him who had been pitiless and relentless in life had come death as swift and relentless as himself amelie and bertie were at the foreend of the platform when the express drew up and they turned back just as they got opposite the engine bertie gave one short gasp of horror and grasped his wifes arm bertie what is it she said go on amelie he said quickly dont look to right or left but walk straight on she obeyed him and he went to the enginedriver there is something on your engine he said epilogue it was a march day of glorious windy brightness and all down the glades of molesworth where bertie and amelie had sat one hot morning in june last year innumerable companies of daffodils danced and flickered in the sun the great trees were yet for the most part bare of leaves but round the birches a green mist hovered and the red buds on the limes were ready to burst boisterous but warm and fruitful and teeming with the promise of the opening year the wind shouted through the branches and bowled as a child bowls a hoop great fleecy clouds across the blue of the sky movement light fruitfulness of the warm earth were all triumphant the strength of all that lived was renewed spring was there today amelie was pacing alone up and down the glade near the fallen treetrunk where she had sketched before she walked briskly for it was not yet a day to loiter in and as she came to the end of her beat within sight of the house she looked eagerly towards it as if expecting someone but the brilliance of her face and of the smile that every now and then hovered round her lips was in no way diminished when she turned again without seeing him whom she waited for it seemed she was content to wait and though eager did not fear disappointment the grass where she walked was all bright with the springing shoots of young growth and the daffodils nodded and tossed their heads all round her not yet was the full note of woodland summer sounding but the great orchestra of nature as it were was tuning up for the concert somehow the fragmentary broken sounds and scraps of summer melody strangely pleased her often she stopped in her walk and looked with her brilliant smile to right and left once she threw her arms wide so that her red cloak stood away from her bosom as if to take the world to it at last he came and her heart embraced him ere yet he reached her he was hatless and the yellow gold of his hair was tossed by the wind at the sight of him her whole being leaped towards him with stronger ecstasy than she had known yet for the love between them seemed perfect and she womanlike and loving her task knew that a little word of comfort and sympathy was demanded of her dear one she said and dear one again poor bertie you look tired you should have waited the night in london and come down this evening should i when you were waiting he asked oh what a morning from god and you amelie among the daffodils she put her arm into his tell me she said did you get there in time did your father know you bertie shook his head no he knew no one from the time of his seizure but i am glad i went he will be buried here on friday she pressed his arm that sympathy of touch was more eloquent to him than words and the baby he asked oh bertie so wonderful nurse says he will speak in no time at all if he goes on like this she says she never saw such a clever baby bertie laughed that is a remark i never heard before he said then you will hear it lots of times in future said amelie with some dignity nurse says it nearly every day they had passed out of the shade of the trees on to the lawn near the house just in front of them was an ugly patch of blacklooking earth on which however the new growth of grass was beginning to show amelie stopped when they came to it ah bertie those weeks she saidthose weeks when we were strangers this black patch where the borehole was begun makes them more vivid to me than my memory of them it is like thema black patch yet the grass springs again said he she took both his hands in hers yes bertie she said the grass springs again for the winter is past i read it this morning only it says beautiful things the flowers appear on the earth and the time of the singing of birds is come that is now is it not then further on my beloved is mine and i am his and that is the best of all said he the end
