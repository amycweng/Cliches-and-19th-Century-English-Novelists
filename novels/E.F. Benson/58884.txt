along the front of the newest and whitest and most pretentious and preposterous house in park lane had been blazing with lights which were kindled while the last flames of the long july day had scarcely died down into the ashcoloured night and were still shining when morning began to tinge the velvet gray of the sky with colour and extinguish the stars the lights however in no seemed to be of more durable quality than the heavenly constellations and long after morning had come and the early traffic begun to boom on the roadway they still burned with undiminished splendour it was literally true also that all the windows in the long gothic facade which seemed to have strayed from nuremberg into the west end of london had been ablaze not only was the ground floor lit and the first floor where was the ballroom out of which all night had floated endless webs of perpetual melody but the bedrooms above though sleep then would have been impossible and as a matter of fact they were yet untenanted had been equally luminous while from behind the flamboyant balustrade the top of the house smaller windows which might be conjectured to belong to servants rooms had joined in the general illumination this was strictly in accordance with mrs osbornes orders as given to that staid and remarkable person called by her when she forgot willum and when she remembered thoresby and also when she remembered alluded to as my major domo willum he had been in earlier and far less happy years first as boot boy then when the family blossomed into footmen as third second and finally first of his order afterward came things more glorious yet and thoresby was major domo at the present time mrs osborne had probably forgotten that there existed such officers as boot boys and willum probably had forgotten too the rise of the family had been remarkably rapid but he had kept pace with it and tonight he felt as did mrs osborne that the eminence attained by them all was of a very exalted order mrs osborne had ordered that every window in the front of the house was to be lit and this sumptuous edict not without purpose she said it looked more joyful and what was a little electric light and as the evening had been devoted to joy it was right that the house should reflect this quality for herself she felt very joyful indeed the last month or two had it is true been arduous and in all london it is probable that there had been nobody man or woman more incessantly occupied but had there been an eight hours bill introduced and passed which should limit the hours of energy for hostesses she would have scorned to take advantage of so pusillanimous a measure besides the nature of her work necessitated continuous effort for her work was to effect the siege and secure the capitulation of london that with her great natural shrewdness she realized had to be done quickly or it would never be done at all london had not to be starved but to be stuffed into surrender she had to feed it and dance it and ply it with concerts and plays and entertainments till its power of resistance was sapped long quiet sieges conducted with regularity however untiring were she knew well perfectly incapable of accomplishing its fall the enemyat times though she loved it so well she almost considered london to be her enemymust be given no quarter and no time to consider its plans the assault had to be violent as well as untiring the dear foe must be battered into submission to arrive at all you had to gallop and she had galloped with such success that on this night in july or rather on this cool dewy morning in july she felt that the capitulation was signed and handed her but she felt no chill of reaction as is so often the case even in the very moment of victory when energies not only can be relaxed but must be relaxed since there is nothing for them to brace themselves over any more her victory was of different sort she knew quite well that she would have to go on being extremely energetic else the capitulated garrison would by degrees rally again but since the exercise of these energies was delightful to her she was merely charmed that there would be a continual call for them there was no casement jessamine on the house which could stir to the dancers dancing in tune but on the walls of the lowest story growing apparently from large earthenware pots filled with mould were enormous plants of tin ivy which swarmed up the walls of the house but it was too strongly and solidly made to stir even to the vibration produced by the earthquaking motorbuses which bounced down park lane and thus the dancers dancing in tune had no effect whatever on it this stalwart ivy was indeed a sort of symbol of the solidity of the fortunes of the house for it was made at the manufactories from which her husband derived his really american wealth they covered acres of ground at sheffield and from their doors vomited forth all sorts of metallic hardware of the most reliable quality the imitation ivy of course was but a froth a chance flotsam on the stream of hardware and was due to the inventive genius of mrs osbornes eldest son percy who had a great deal of taste his was no abstruse taste like an appreciation of caviare or strauss that required an educatedor as others might saya vitiated palate or a jaded ear but it appealed strongly and almost overwhelmingly to judge by the order book of the art department to the eye of that general public which goes in for forms of decoration which are known as both chaste and handsome and are catholic enough to include mirrors framed in plush on which are painted bunches of flowers and bead curtains that hang over doors with shrewd commercial instinct percy never attempted to educate the taste of his customers into what they ought to want but gave them in handsome catalogues lists of the things they did want and of a quality that they would be sure to find satisfactory though this ivy for instance was from the excellence of its workmanship and the elaborate nature of its colouring rather expensive it was practically indestructible till the melting point of the best tin was reached and it resembled ivy so closely that you might perfectly well prick your fingers on it before you found out the art that so closely imitated nature indeed before now some very pretty jesting had taken place in the windows of the house with regard to it when percy who liked his joke amid the scarcely suppressed merriment of the family asked a stranger to pick a leaf of it and examine the beauties of nature as illustrated in the manner in which the stalk of the leaf was joined to the parent stem also it had no inconvenient habits of growing over places on which you did not wish it to trespass if you wanted more you ordered more it harboured neither slugs nor any abominable insects and afforded no restingplace for birds while it could be washed free from london dust by the simple application of the handsyringe the ivy has been insisted on at some little length because it was typical of the fortunes and family of its inventor it was solid indestructible and new and in just the same way the osbornes were very strong and well held large quantities of giltedged stock and had no family history whatever in one point only were they unlike the ivy that clung to the limestone wall of the house in park lane but that was an important one the point of the ivy was to deceiveit was often successful in so doingwhile the osbornes never intended to deceive anybody there was with regard at any rate to mrs osborne her husband and percy no possibility of being taken in you could see at once what they were like a glance would save you any subsequent disappointment or surprises and no one it may be added at once ever pricked his fingers over them they were as kind as they were new but since many strains of blood have gone to the making of each member of the human race one strain prospering and predominating in this specimen while in another though of the same blood it scarcely shows a trace of existence the divergence of type even in one generation is often very marked indeed thus though mr osborne felt that he both understood and admired his eldest son his admiration for the younger was agreeably tempered with mystification old claudes a rum fellow he often said and mrs osborne agreed with him but as will be seen there was still much in common between claude and them the house like the ivy was also new and solid and in point of fact none of its inhabitants again with the curious exception of claude were quite used to it yet this they concealed as far as they were able but the concealment really went little further than the fact that they did not openly allude to it they all agreed that the house was very handsome and mr osborne had a secret gratification not unmingled with occasional thrills of misgiving as to whether he had wasted his money in the knowledge of the frightful costliness of it outside as has been said it was of gothic design but if a guest thought that he was to pass his evening or listen to music in a gothic interior he would have been rudely undeceived it had been unkindly said that you went through a gothic door to find vandals within and if vandalism includes the appropriation of beautiful things the vandalism exhibited here was very complete but the destructive side of vandalism had no counterpart mr osborne was very careful of his beautiful things and very proud of them he admired them in proportion to their expensiveness and having an excellent head for figures could remember how much all the more important pictures articles of furniture and tapestries had stood him in and he ran no risk of forgetting these items for he kept them green in his memory by often speaking of them to his guests yes he would say theres three thousand pounds worth of seating accommodation in this very drawingroom and they tell me twas lucky to have got the suite at that figure all louislouisper my boy did they tell us it was louis xv or xvi sixteenth yes louis xvi divide it up and youll find that it averages two hundred pounds a chair seems funny to sit on two hundred pounds hey mrs osborne she said a bright thing about that sit firm then she said and youll keep it safe the furnishing and appointments of the house had in fact been entrusted to a notable firm which though it had certainly charged mr osborne a great deal of money for what it supplied had given him very good for his cheque and both he and his wife after they had got over the unusual feeling of sitting on two hundred pounds and if you chose putting your feet up on another two hundred were quite content that both the furniture of this louis xvi room for instance and the cheque for it should be what they called a little stiff it was the same in the italian room that opened out of it and matters were no better in the dining room which was furnished with chippendale here indeed a very dreadful accident had happened on the first evening that they had got into the house now two months ago for mr osborne alone with percy his wife for that night had drawn his chair up to the firethe night being chillyto drink his second and third glasses of port and had rested his feet on the pierced steel fender that guarded the hearth this led to his tilting his chippendale chair back on to its hind legs which designed to bear only half the weight of its occupant had crashed into splinters and deposited mr osborne on the floor and his second glass of port on his shirt front but he had taken the incident with great goodhumour live and learn he had said live and learn got to sit up and behave now maria per my boy dont you finish all the port while your dad changes his shirt drink fair for fair plays a jewel and fill your mothers glass mr osborne would never have attained to the eminence he occupied as a manufacturer of hardware had he not been a man of intelligence and instead of upbraiding the furnishing firm for charging so high a price for a four legs of carved dry rot which a momentary irritation carefully kept to himself might have led him to do drew the lesson that it was unwise to tilt chairs unless they were clearly tiltable but this accident had caused him to insist on his own room which he called his snuggery being furnished as he chose and not as anybody else chose and here he rejoiced in chairs of the pattern known as chesterfield a solid mahogany table on which stood a telephone and a broad firm mantelshelf where he could put a box of cigars without fear of its overbalancing on this point also his wife had adopted a similar attitude and her own sitting room opening out of the whitefurnished bedroom where she was afraid to touch anything for fear of soiling it was thoroughly to her taste as in her husbands snuggery she had matters arranged for her own comfort and not for other peoples admiration percy had done the room for her and sometimes when she came up here to look at her letters before going to bed and drink the glass of hot water which was so excellent a digestive after the dinner that was still a little curious to her she wondered whether percy did not understand house furnishing better than the great french firm the name of which she was always rather shy of pronouncing she had asked him to choose all the furniture himself remarking only that she was a little rheumatic and found it difficult to get out of very low chairs and he had succeeded to admiration not only had he consulted her comfort but he had divined and satisfied her taste the paper of the walls was a pattern of ferns with iridescent lilies of the valley neatly disposed among them so that it was almost a shame to hang pictures thereon indeed it would have been quite a shame had not those pictures been so well selected for mrs osborne cared far more about the subject of a picture than the manner in which it was presented and all the subjects were admirably chosen there was a beautiful view of the church that edward had built at sheffield a print of the duke of wellington in a garter and of queen victoria in a bonnet and a couple of large oilpaintings one of the lands end and the other of koynance cove both of which were intimately associated in her affectionate heart with her honeymoon edward and she had spent a month in cornwall staying at little inns and walking as much as possible to save expense and though all that was thirty years ago she never entered this room now without remembering how they had sat just on that very bluff above the emerald sea and read the idylls of the king together and he had promised her when they were rich enough to give her an emerald necklace to remind her of the colour of the sea it is true that those emeralds which were remarkably fine were not exactly of the tint that either nature had given to the sea or the very vivid artist had reproduced in the painting that hung on the walls but they still reminded both her and edward of those enchanted weeks in cornwall and it was but seldom when she wore her emeralds that he did not say mrs o has got the lands end emeralds on tonight then more often than not would follow the explanation of this cryptic remark and the whispered information of how much the emeralds had cost mrs osborne as a matter of fact had overheard again and again what the figure was but she was still officially ignorant of it and generally closed the subject by saying mr osborne wont never tell me what he paid for them i believe he got them cheap and thats why but she secretly rejoiced to know that this was not the reason the reason was just the opposite they had been so enormously expensive that expense would not be unreasonable now but at the time for she had worn the lands end necklace for twenty years it had been preposterous they had had no holiday one year in consequence but had grilled in sheffield throughout august and september but during those months she had worn the emeralds every evening and it had been a sort of renewal of the honeymoon though they had not been able to go away themselves they had managed to send percy and claude to the seaside and the two months in sheffield when every night she wore the emeralds which had been the cause of their remaining there was still one of mrs osbornes most delightful memories as a sort of renewed honeymoon since then times had considerably changed and though to many the change from simplicity of life and not uncomfortable narrowness of means to the wider horizons which the rapid accumulation of an enormous fortune brings within the view implies a loss of happiness rather than an extension of it neither edward nor she were of that arcadian build they both immensely enjoyed the wider horizon the humble establishment with parlour maids had been all very well but how much more enjoyable was the brownstone house on the outskirts of sheffield with footmen and a carriage for mrs osborne did not find it in the least interfered with her happiness to have men to manage or richer things to eat as a matter of fact she liked managing and rejoiced in the building of a new wing to the brown stone house in the acquisition of motor cars and in the drain on their time and resources by edward being made mayor of sheffield neither of them ever thought that they had been happier when their means were more straitened and their establishment humbler both of them in spite of an essential and innate simplicity of nature rejoiced in these establishments and were always ready to enlarge and embellish and rejoice they had always made the most of their current resourcesthough in a merely financial sense they had always savedand it was as great a pleasure to mrs osborne to see her table plentifully loaded with the most expensive food that money could provide and press second helpings on her guests as it had been to have a solid four courses at midday dinner on sunday in sheffield and tell her friends that mr osborne liked nothing better than to have a good dinner on sunday and see a pleasant party to share it with him she still inquired if she might not tempt her neighbours at table to have another quail just as she had tried to persuade them to have a second cut of roast lamb when in season while from the other end of the table she would hear as a hospitable echo her husbands voice recommending veuve clicquot of just as in the old days he had recommended the sound whiskey which would hurt nobody not if you drank it all afternoon the year of the mayoralty of sheffield had been succeeded by seven years fatter than even joseph had dreamed of edward was as sound in his business as he was in the whiskey he so hospitably pressed on his guests and by dint of always supplying goods of the best possible workmanship and material at prices that gave him no more than a respectable profit the profits had annually increased till in the opinion of those who did not adopt so unspeculative a quality of goods they had almost ceased to be respectable and became colossal instead then at the end of seven fat years edward had realized that he was sixty though he neither looked nor felt more than an adolescent fifty had turned the hardware business into a company and as vendor had received ordinary shares to an extent that would insure him an income no less than that of the fat years he had already put by a capital that produced some ten thousand pounds a year and he was thus not disadvantageously situated percy however still held the art department in his own hands the plant and profits of that had not been offered to the public but had been presented to percy by his father on the occasion of his marriage an event now six years old for the whole idea of ornamental tin ivy and the host of collateral ideas that emanated therefrom had been percys and it was now a joke between his father and him that mrs p would soon have an emerald necklace that would take the shine out of the lands end lands end will be mrs ps beginning said his father and the sea is britannias realm he added by a happy afterthought ill call her mrs c instead of mrs p hey per badinage had ensued she was called mrs c instantly and there were numerous conjectures as to who c was mr osborne said that it was curious that c was the first letter of corespondent but that joke though edward was usually very successful in such faceti was not very well received the momentary mrs c ate her grapes with a studied air and mrs osborne from the other end of the tablethis was still in sheffieldsaid you dont think eddie you let your tongue run away with you on reflection eddie agreed with her and there was no more heard about mrs c but he always thought that his badinage had been taken a little too seriously a jokes a joke he said to himself as he shaved his chin next morning leaving sidewhiskers but if they dont like one joke well try another lots of jokes still left so without sense of injury or of being misunderstood he tried plenty of others which were as successful as humour should have any expectation of being humour comes from a well that is rarely found but when found proves always to be inexhaustible the numerical value therefore of edwards jokes had not been diminished and percy inherited his fathers sense of fun still in sheffield mr osborne had after the formation of the company seen an extraordinary increase in business with the result that his income already scarcely respectable mounted and mounted years ago he had built a chapel of corrugated iron outside and pitchpine inside in the middle of that district of the town which had become his and was enstreeted with the houses of his workmen and now he turned the corrugated building into a reading room as soon as ever the tall gothic church with which he had superseded it was ready for use a princess had come to the opening of it and had declared the discarded church to be a reading room and there was really nothing more to do in sheffield except to say that he did not wish to become a knight mr osborne had no opinion of knights knighthood in his mind was the bottom shelf of a structure where if he took a place it might easily become a permanent one but he had no idea of accepting a bottom place on the shelves with his natural shrewdness he said that he had done nothing to deserve it but he winked in a manner that anticipated familiarity toward shelves that were higher he had not done with the question of shelves yet though he had nothing to say to the lowest one it must not be supposed that because he had retired from active connection with the hardware business his mind slackened the exact contrary was the case there was no longer any need for him to exercise that shrewd member on hardware and it only followed that the thought he had previously given to hardware was directed into other channels he thought things over very carefully as was his habit before taking any step summed up his work in sheffield settled that a knighthood was not adequate to reward him for what he had already done but concluded that he had nothing more to do in sheffield just for the moment and having come to that conclusion he had a long talk with mrs o in her boudoir where she always went after breakfast to see cook and write her letters but that morning cook waited downstairs in her clean apron long after mrs osborne had gone to her boudoir expecting every moment to hear her bell and no bell sounded for more weighty matters were being debated than the question of dinner and at first when mr osborne broached the subject his wife felt struck of a heap well mrs o its for you to settle he said and if youre satisfied to remain in sheffield why in sheffield we remain old lady and thats the last word you shall hear from me on the subject but theres a deal to be considered and ill just put the points before you again theres yourself to lead off with you like seeing your friends at dinner and giving them of the best and so do i well for all i can learn theres a deal more of that going on in london where you can have your twenty people to dinner every night if you have a mind and a hundred to dance to your fiddles afterward and im much mistaken should we agree to leave sheffield and set up in town if mrs os parties dont make some handsome paragraphs in the morning post before long lor to think of that said mrs osborne reflectively she did not generally employ that interjection which she thought rather common and even now though she was so absorbed she corrected herself and said there to think of that but mind you my dear continued mr osborne if we go to town and have a big house in the country as per the scheme ive been putting before you we dont do it to take our ease and just sit in a barouche and drive round the park to fill up the time to luncheon i shall have my work to do and its you who must be helping me to get on as youve always done god bless you maria and fine and busy it will make you theres a county council in london as well as in sheffield and theres a house of parliament in london which there isnt here no my dear if we go to london it wont be for a life of ease for i expect work suits us both better and theres plenty of work left in us both yet give us ten years more work and then if you like well get into our bath chairs and comb out the fleece of the poodle and think what a busy couple we are mr osborne got up and shuffled to the window in his carpet slippers they had been worked and presented to him by his wife on his last birthday and this had been a great surprise as she had told him throughout that they were destined for percy at this moment they suggested something to him look at me already my dear he said what should i have thought ten years ago if i had seen myself here in your boudoir at eleven of the morning in carpet slippers instead of being at work in my shirt sleeves this last three hours eddie i should have said to myself youre getting a fat lazy old man with years of work in you yet and by gad mrs o i should have been right give me a good dinner but let me get an appetite for it though thank god my appetites good enough yet but let me feel i earn it mrs osborne got up from her davenport and came and stood by her husband in the window in front of her stretched the broad immaculate gravel walk bordered by a long riband bed of lobelias calceolarias and geraniums beyond that was the weedless tennis lawn with its brand new net where one of the very numerous gardeners was even now marking out the court with the machine that mr osborne had invented and patented the year before he retired from entire control of his business and which sold in ever increasing quantities below the ground fell rapidly away and not half a mile off the long straggling rows of workmens houses between which ran cobbled roads and frequent electric trams stretched unbroken into the town of late years it had grown very rapidly in the direction of this brown stone house and with its growth the fogs and smoky vapours had increased so that it was seldom as on this morning that they could see from the windows the tall and very solid tower of the gothic church that had supplanted the one of corrugated iron he looked out over this with his wifes hand in his for a moment in silence i dont know how it is with you my dear he said but every now and then a feeling comes over me which i cant account for or resist and the feeling thats been coming over me this last month agone is that me and sheffields done all the work were going to do together but there are plenty of days of work for us both yet but not together look at that there quarter my dear right from where the new lane houses begin to wheres the big chimney of the works behind the church i made that as well you know and its paid me well to do it and its paid sheffield to have me to do it not an ounce of bad material to my knowledge has gone into the factory gates and not an ounce of bad workmanship has come out of them ive paid high for firstclass materials and i seen that i got them ive turned out none but honest goods whatll do the work i guarantee them for and last you ten times as long as inferior stuff as you and cook know since theres not a pot or a pan in your kitchen my dear but what came from the shops and ive made my fortune over it and thats over so i take it and whats the sense of my sitting on top of a hill just to look at my calceolarias and get an appetite for dinner by running about that court there but if youve got a fancy for staying in sheffield as i say this is the last word i speak on the subject mrs osborne nodded at him and pressed his arm as he poured out these gratifying recollections in his rather hoarse voice theres more on your mind yet eddie my dear she said do you think ive lived with you these years and seen you off your victuals by day and heard you tossing and turning in your bed at night without getting to know when youve told me all or when youve got something further unbeknown to me yet its not me only youre thinking of mr osborne beamed on his wife well if you arent right every time he said youve guessed it all i reckon yes its claude i doubt whether i didnt make a mistake about claude at the beginning and whether we shouldnt have done better to put him into the business like percy and let alfred leave him his money or not just as he liked but there if we made a mistake its our business to make the best we can of it now but whenever i see the boy i think we did the right thing by him and weve got to go on doing the right thing and if a young fellow has been to eton and cambridge and is going to be as rich a man and richer nor his father was without having to do a stroke of work for it i ask you mrs o whats he to do with himself in sheffield of course he could go to london and work at the law or go into the army or adopt any other of the ways of wasting time and doing nothing without having it cast up at you but think of the chance he gets if you and i settle in london and have a country house as well so that he can ask his friends down for a bit of shooting or whatevers on and bring them home to dine and stop for his mothers dance or concert or whatever you have named for such a day he paused a moment hell be home for good now in a months time and i should like to be able to say to him claude my boy theres no need for you to think how youll occupy yourself in sheffield for your vacation for well soon be moving on mother and ithats what i shall sayyou understandhave come to an agreement and therell be a house for you in grosvenor square perhaps or in park lane to bring your friends to and a shooting box somewhere else so that whether its lord this or the honourable that you can bring them down and find a welcome and a bird or two to shoot at and the pick of the london girls for you to dance with eh edward you talk as if the thing was done said his wife well so it is if you and i make up our minds to it and you guessed right its a particular feeling ive always had about claude eton and cambridge may have made a change in him or it may be that he was something different all along but to see him come into a room into that smoking room for instance at the club why its as if the whole place belonged to him it is if only he cared to claim it and the very waiters know the difference and i warrant you theres always an evening paper ready for him whoever has to go without but in london hell find friends yes and a girl to marry him i wager you whose folk came over with the conqueror maria i should like to speak of my soninlaw the earl or the countess my boys motherinlaw theres a deal in a name if you can get hold of the right one mrs osborne gave a great sigh and looked at her rings and as she sighed the row of pearls that hung over her ample bosom rose and fell there was a great deal in what edward had said and that which concerned claude appealed to her most she had felt it all again and again and again and again she had wished content though she was with the very comfortable circumstances of her life that they had some other house in which to welcome him home for his vacation she felt he was her own son at heart but his manners were such it was claude all over to behave as if the whole room belonged to him should he choose to claim it she was devoted to percy but percy she well knew felt as she did when he was going out to dinner and thought about what he should say and looked to see if his hair was tidy and hoped he hadnt left his handkerchief behind but claude seemed to know that everything was all right with him or if it wasnt he didnt care once on a solemn occasion when a royal visitor was in sheffield the whole family had been bidden to lunch with the mayor and claude had discovered in the middle of lunch that he hadnt got a pockethandkerchief and the day was enough to make anybody persp and then in thought mrs osborne checked again and said to herself action of the skin but claude though hot had been as cool as a cucumber he just stopped a waiter who was going by and said please send out to the nearest shop and get me a handkerchief mrs osborne would never have dared to do that and if she had she felt that the handkerchief wouldnt have come but in five minutes claude had his and never paid for it neither thought mr osborne to himself in a mixed outburst of pride and misgiving claude wanted a handkerchief and it came he didnt bother about it but the whole suggestion of giving up sheffield where she was so friendly and pleasant with so many local magnates and their wives and launching into the dim unplumbed sea of london was bewildering though exciting she had no doubts about edward wherever edward was he would do his part she was only doubtful about her own and these doubts were not of durable quality while the reflections about claude were durable in texture once a friend of claudes at cambridge had come to stay at the brown stone house and it had all been very awkward he was an honourable too and his father was a lord and though he was very quiet and polite mrs osborne had seen that something was wrong from the first the most carefully planned dinners had been offered him and edward had brought out the chateau yquem which was rarely touched and this young man had eaten and drunk as if it was nothing particular mrs osborne had tried to console herself with the thought that he didnt think much of his victuals whatever they were but it was not that he refused dishes he just ate them all and said no more about it and he had been regaled with two dinner parties during the three days he was with them to which all sorts of aldermen and their wives and daughters had been bidden she had not forgotten his rank either for though there were two knights and their wives present at one of these dinners and at the other two knights and a baronet he had taken her in on both occasions nor was their conversation wholly satisfactory for though mrs osborne had the morning post brought up to her room with her early tea while the young man was there in order that she might be up to date with the movements and doings of the nobility she had extraordinarily bad luck since the bankruptcy case that was going on was concerned with the affairs of his sister and her husband and the memorial service at st jamess proved to be coincident with the obsequies of his greatuncle mrs osborne felt that these things would not happen when they were in the midst of everything in town so the momentous decision had been made and two strenuous years had followed during which time mr osborne had settled to adopt as became a man of property in these socialistic days the conservative cause in politics and after one defeat to get himself returned for one of the divisions of surrey during that time too no park lane had been pulled down and by amalgamation with no been built up again in a style that enabled mrs o to have her friends to dine with a bit of a dance afterward or caruso to sing without it being necessary for late comers to huddle together on the stairs where they could not hear a note or stand in the doorway of the ballroom without being able to get in or to dance if they did and though as has been stated the years had been strenuous and the struggle continuous neither mrs osborne nor her husband ever felt that it was a losing game that they were playing apart from this one defeat in the conservative interest and one dismal attempt at a dance in the house that they had taken before no was ready to which eight men came all told and counting percy they had swiftly and steadily mounted for true to the principles on which her husband had amassed so large a fortune all that mrs osborne offered was of the very best or at any rate of the sort which momentarily most attracted the singer who was most in vogue sang at her concerts or the heels that were most admired danced there and beyond doubt the extreme pleasure that the excellent woman took in her own hospitality contributed largely to its success she was no careworn anxiouseyed hostess but bubbled with goodhumour was genuinely glad to see the world fill her rooms and always welcomed the suggestion that any guest should bring a friend whose name was instantly entered by her admirable secretary on her visiting list and thus she rose and prospered till on the date at which this story opens she had crowned the work of her season by giving this immense fancydress ball which to give it its due had whipped up again to full activity the rather moribund energies of the season somehow the idea had taken on at once there had been no fancydress function of any importance that season and by one of those whims that govern the flow and ebb of the social world london had thrown itself with avidity into the notion it was soon clear that everyone would be there and everyone was and at last in her own house mrs osborne heard the strains of the national anthem it had been of no particular period the point was not to have a strict and classical function but any amount of jewels and fine dresses and queens of sheba cleopatras and marie antoinettes joined hands in the quadrille with napoleon piers gaveston and henry viii she herself had been an admirable mistress page her husband a veritable merry knight but of all the brilliant figures in that motley crowd there was none perhaps more admired than the slim dark piers gaveston and that was claude chapter ii dora west was trimming her hat it was a straw hat that had cost a shilling or two when it came into her deft hands and the trimming would only prove to have cost a shilling or two when it became attached to the hat and leaving the deft hands was put onto her extremely pretty head but by that time the hat would certainly have become a very pretty hat this she was explaining with great volubility to her friend you are rich darling may she said and in consequence your attitude toward hats is a little opulent and vulgar i can put the feathers and the flags and the birds eggs in exactly the same place as biondinetti or whoever it is who sells you hats no not exactly said mary with the quietness that real conviction brings she was quite certain about that point and so did not care to shout over it it is only when people are not certain about what they say that they drown their want of conviction in arguments conviction always swims dora had several pins in her mouth and so did not reply at once in itself the pinreason was excellent and more excellent was the fact that she did not wish to reply knowing the quiet truth of marys conviction especially since she could not settle the exact angle at which a very large white feather should be put it pierced the hat once inward once outward that was biondinetti all over but where in heavens name ought it to start from so she only made a little impatient noise with her lips and even that was difficult since there was a danger of causing a pin to be sucked into her mouth but she made it successfully she poised the feather a moment focussing its appearance against the hat the effect produced by the impatient noise was sufficient to ensure her against any immediate reply then suddenly the inspiration came and with a pair of tiny scissors she cut a strand or two in the straw and stuck the quill feather through the holes there she said and you pay biondinetti two guineas for doing that i cant and i wouldnt if i could austell wrote to me last week and said the swans were moulting and i telegraphedthat cost sixpence and a little thought instead of two guineasto tell him to send me big wing feathers hes a dreadful ass we all know that but he had the sense to see i wanted feathers and to catch a swan and pluck what a disgusting butcher said may i dont mean butcher i mean vivisectionist and how do you think you get your feathers darling asked dora i dont know i never ask the hat comes from the shop then dont ask now because i will tell you your horrid shop has birds killed and then plucks them it does you cant deny it whereas with me the swan was just moulting and austell assisted nature which we all do he caught its head in a landingnet and it tried to peck he says dora west stopped suddenly in the middle of these surprising remarks and held out the hat at arms length in order to observe the effect of the feather she had one of those enchanting faces that are overwhelmingly pretty for no particular reason you could if you chose argue her prettiness away by maintaining with justification that no single feature on it had warrantable claims they were all passable it is true but it was not clear how it came about that the sum of them was so delicious her eyes were gray and had nothing striking to recommend them her nose turned up at the tip far too markedly to be able to claim beauty and the mouth was quite certainly too large yet even allowing for the charm of her extreme youth and the vigour and vividness of her vitality there was no accounting for the supreme prettiness that was there so the sensible thing was to stop arguing and look at it again and more sensible yet to say something that should make her laugh for her laugh was the most enchanting thing of all then every feature laughed there was no telling where it began or where it ended may before now had declared that from quite a distance off when doras back was turned she had in a ballroom seen she was amused because the back of her neck and her shoulders were laughing so much oh nature wants a lot of assistance she went on she is perfectly hopeless if you leave her to herself look at the flowers even which are quite the nicest thing she does roses for instance all she could think of in the way of roses was the ordinary wild dog rose i dont say it is bad but how paltry if you have had simply millions of years to invent roses in then man comes along who is the only really unnatural being and in quite a few years invents all the heavenly roses which we see now of course nature did it in a sense but she did it with his assistance but why do you call man unnatural asked may why because he saw at once how stupid nature was and had to invent all the things that make life tolerable he lit fires and built houses and made laws and motorcars and shops andand boats and button hooks motorcars too all that nature could think of in the way of locomotion was horses the feathers were inserted in absolutely the right place and dora breathed a heavy sigh of satisfaction laid the hat down on the end of the sofa hovered over the tea table for a moment and selected an enormous bun and nature gives us brains she continued with her mouth full and the moment we begin to use them as i have been doing over that hat which is biondinetti she decrees that we shall be so hungry that we have to stop and eat instead the same with talking she gives us a tongue to talk with and after quite a few minutes talking makes us hungry too and we have to use our tongue to help us to swallow did you know you swallowed with your tongue darling i never did till yesterday i thought i swallowed with my throat but apparently the tongue helps thats why we cant talk with our mouths full as i am doing may thurston looked at the hat on the end of the sofa for a while and then transferred her gaze to her friend i dont think i agree with you she said at least i allow that many people dont know what being natural means but i think all the nicest people are natural you for instance and me and mrs osborne last night at her dance never before have i seen a hostess really enjoying herself at her own ball she stood at the top of the stairs and beamed she danced and beamed and never before have you seen a person like mrs osborne dance remarked dora well not often anyhow she enjoyed herself tremendously and was perfectly natural dora shook her head it wont do darling she said i allow that mrs osborne beamed all the time and enjoyed herself enormously but why because everybody was there was she ever so much pleased at sheffield do you suppose or wherever it was they came from i am sure she was not but last night she was pleased because every duchess and marchioness who counts at all was there as well as heaps that dont count at all shes a snob probably the finest ever seen and by what process of reasoning you arrive at the fact that a snob is natural is beyond me i agree that heaps of nice people are snobs but snobbishness is in itself the most artificial quality of an artificial age snobs are the crowning and passionate protest against nature oh well said may in deprecation of this rather lengthy harangue i didnt mean to rouse you dora i daresay not and in that case you have done so without meaning but really when you say that mrs osborne is natural i am bound to protest you might as well say that your mother is oh no i mightnt said may quite calmly it would be simply silly to call mother natural she only does things because they are the thing she spends her whole life in doing the thing and yet i dont knowoh dora what very odd people women are when they grow up shall you and i be as odd do you think i love mother and so do you and we both of us love yours dont we but they are very very odd people dora gave a little shriek of laughter oh dont she said i want to talk about snobs a little more well im sure youve often told me that mother was one remarked may yes the darling she is isnt she she is the most delicious sort of snob a month ago she wouldnt know the osbornes and merely said i have no doubt they are very honest people with her nose at the same angle toward earth as is the matterhorn while a week ago she was clamouring for an invitation to the dance last night in the interval it had become the thing to know the osbornes my mother saw it was going to be the thing to know them long ago and called at park lane almost before they had washed the white blobs of paint off the windows or hung up those shields of heraldic glass on the stairs oh no is there heraldic glass on the stairs asked may in a slightly awestruck tone i never saw it dora as her friend often declared really did not always play fair there had quite distinctly been the satirical note in her own allusion to the heraldic glass but as soon as may reflected that in the appreciative reverence of her reply dora was down upon her at once and why shouldnt they have heraldic glass as much as your people or mine she asked smartly theyve got exactly as many grandfathers and grandmothers as we have and theres not the slightest reason to doubt that mrs osborne was a miss parkins and mr parkinss heir who i expect was far more respectable than my mothers father who drank himself to death though mother always calls it cerebral hmorrhage oh may we are all snobs and im not sure the worst snobbishness of all isnt shown by those who say they came over with william the conqueror or were descended from edward the fourth probably the osbornes didnt come over with william the conqueror but were here long before only they dont happen to know who they were i know that is just it said may calmly they dont know who they were and yet they put up their coats of arms dora looked at her friend in contempt i suppose you think you have scored over that she said not in the least i am only pointing out perfectly obvious things then why do it said dora what i am pointing out are not perfectly obvious things at least they appear not to be to you the whole affair is a game stars and garters and ancestors and coats of arms is all a game oh i dont say that it isnt great fun but it is absurd to take it seriously what can it matter to you or me whether greatgrandpapa was a peer or a bootblack it only amuses us to think that he was a peer and if it amuses mrs osborne to think that mr parkins had a coat of arms at all why shouldnt she put it up in the hall window and since as i said she was the only child of course she quarters with the osborne arms its one of the rules i believe you are jealous of them because they are richer than your horrid family nothing ever roused may except a practical assault upon her personal comfort and dora seldom attempted to rouse her it was invariably hopeless and the present attempt only added another to the list of her failures i think that is partly true said may i dont see why common people should have the best of everything they only have to invent a button or a razor and all that life offers is theirs i think its deplorable but it doesnt make me angry any more than a wet day makes me angry unless i am absolutely caught in the rain with a new hat as to coats of arms and things i think it is rather pleasant to know that ones grandfather was a gentleman dora waved her arms wildly but he probably wasnt she screamed mine wasnt he was the wicked one you know and did awful things much worse than mrs osbornes probably ever dreamed of mrs osbornes greatgrandfather would certainly have cut mine if he had had the chance he wouldnt have had the chance remarked may and also mrs osborne herself would cut nobody who wouldwould lend lustre to her house oh dora lets stop it isnt any good you are a democrat and a radical and a socialist and really it doesnt matter besides i havent seen you foroh well nearly twentyfour hours what has happened dora got up i dont think i can stop she said because i want to know what you really think about certain things two heads are better than one you know even when mine is one of them oh by the way austell has let grote to the osbornes they have taken it for seven years from the end of july it was mothers doing i think ioh may you may call me a radical and a socialist and anything else you choose but i cant quite see mrs osborne there shell fill it with plush i know she will after all i expect mother is right i suppose it is better to pay some of your debts and have other people putting plush monkeys into your house than go on as austell has been doing i expect i should be just the same if he was my son instead of my brother it doesnt seem to matter much what ones brother does as long as he doesnt wear his hair long or cheat at cards but i daresay its different if hes your son dora gave a great sigh and was silent in spite of that series of statements which had led may thurston quite reasonably to call her a radical and a socialist there was some feeling within her rather more intimate rather more herself that made her dislike the idea of the osbornes living in grote which had always been her home the austell finances especially for the past two or three years had been precarious and though her mother had a jointure that would enable her and dora to live quite comfortably in her house in eaton place and at the little bungalow at deal it had been necessary before now to let the house in eaton place during the months of the season and live at deal and to let the bungalow at deal it was of the more spacious sort during august and september and encamp so to speak in a corner of grote for jim austell her brother it could not be denied was not a person who could possibly be described as dependable his mother had made the most prolonged attempt to describe him as such but without success and she had at length seen the futility of clinging to grote a huge jacobean mansion with an enormous park in the latter being of sandy soil a public golf links had been started which brought in a year while neighbouring farmers grazed their beasts on other portions the total receipts however about paid for the flower beds and the trimming of the exquisite bank of rhododendrons that grew round the lake and after a year or so of trial the scheme had been pronounced financially unsound and for the last six months the place had been in search of a tenant austell had hoped that his wellknown skill at bridge and his knowledge of horses might save him from the extremity of letting it in this he had been disappointed they had but contributed to the speed at which it was necessary to do so all this which was part of the habitual environment of doras mind part of the data under which she lived passed through it or was presented to it like a familiar picture in the space of the sigh that concluded her last speech it was no longer any use thinking about these things grote had been let to the osbornes the bungalow at deal had also been let for august and till september she and her mother were going to live in their boxes after all they had done that as everybody else had often before and for much longer periods than one month but it was the first time that they had been compelled to live in their boxes with no house except eaton place in august to flee unto and at this moment the change struck dora for week after week before now she had stayed with friends knowing though not thinking of it that all the time there was home behind it all true now that grote had been let it would have been possible to live in the bungalow at deal but the latter had been let while the former was still uncertain and dora suddenly felt a sense of homelessness that was not quite comfortable in two weeks from now they went to the thurstons then there were three more visits then no doubt if they chose many more visits but there was nothing behind there was no home meantime the osbornes grabbed homes wherever they chose they built a palace in park lane they took grote from her own impecunious family and as mrs osborne had told her mother last night mr o had a fancy for a bit of stalking for self and friends in the autumn and had taken a little box up in sutherland she however was going to settle down at grote at the end of the season and did not intend to go north there had been badinage over this it appeared between her and mr o and he threatened her with an action for divorce on the grounds of desertion and dora felt much less socialistic and far more inclined to agree with may on the iniquity of common people having all they wanted simply because they invented a button if only she could invent a button dora as has already been seen was apt to be slightly discursive she had one of those effervescent minds to which every topic as it comes on the board instantly suggests another and in half a dozen sentences she was apt to speak of half a dozen totally different things each in turn being swiftly abandoned for some fresh and more absorbing topic which each opened up she had begun a moment before with telling may that she wanted her advice and before that was asked or offered before indeed the subject on which it was desired was so much as mentioned she had darted away afresh poising dragonfly fashion in the direction of grote and the letting of it to the osbornes the osbornes indeed had been the connecting link and now she went straight back via the osbornes to the point from which she had started yes i want your advice may she repeated or i think i do its quite serious at least its beginning to be quite serious and there are so many dreadfully funny things connected with it yes mr osborne has asked leave to call upon mother this afternoon at six and its halfpast five now oh dear oh dear i suppose he found out in a book that that sort of thing was done a hundred years ago and he wishes to be correct the osbornes are absolutely correct if you think of it every one went in to supper in the right order last night which never happens at any other house i have ever been to and where does he get those extraordinary good looks from oh i dont mean mr osborne how can you be so sillybut him yes im telling it all very clearly arent i so i hope you understand perhaps mrs osborne was a beauty once you cant tell that may perfectly understood this extraordinary farrago of observations said less for her powers of perspicacity than might have been supposed for dora was not alluding to any new thing but to a subject that had often before been mentioned between them and dora went on still discursively but intelligibly its coming to the crisis you see she said mr osbornes call on mother is of a formal nature he is going to ask permission for claude to pay his addresses to me he will use those very words unless mother says yes before he gets so far and then i shall have to make up my mind at least im not sure that i shall i believe its made up already and yet i cant be sure may i feel just like a silly sentimental girl in an impossible feuilleton he thrills me isnt it awful but he does thrills i dont believe any boy was ever so goodlooking and then suddenly in the middle of my thrill it all stops with a jerk just because he says that somebody is a very handsome lady why shouldnt he say handsome lady he said he thought mother was such a handsome lady and i nearly groaned out loud and then i looked at him again or something and i didnt care what he said and hes nice too i know hes nice and hes got excellent manners and always gets up when a lady handsome or not comes into the room instead of lounging in his chair as austell does and all other young men nowadays except a few like claude who arent exactly our sort and hes kind and hes good am i in love with him for heavens sake tell me dora paused a moment and then took a cigarette from a box that stood on the mantelpiece and lit it she never smoked cigarettes she only lit them and the mere fact that she lit one was indicative of extreme absorption in something else youre engaged may she said so you ought to know else what is the use of your being engaged what do you feel when that angel harry comes into the room may could answer that quite easily oh i feel as if it was me coming into the room she said i feel as if i am not in the room since you put it like that unless he is the conversation had been flippant enough up till this moment though as a matter of fact dora being inconsequential by nature often gave the note of flippancy when she was in earnest both of the girls in any case were quite serious now and out of the depth of her twenty years wisdom may proceeded to draw a bucket full for dora who was only nineteen oh i expect you are in love she said at least i expect you are feeling as if you were i understand perfectly about the thrill though it sounds so dreadfully family herald when it is said but one does thrill i believe that thrill is a pretty good guide i dont usually thrill in fact i never had thrilled till i saw harry but i always thrill at him i suppose all girls feel the same when they fall in love i suppose people on bank holidays thrill when they change hats or eat winkles we are all common then at least you may call it common if you choose i dont see why you should its it you havent told me about me remarked dora may thurston shifted her position slightly it was not done with any idea of manuvre she was the least dramatic of girls and she only shifted because she felt a little uncomfortable it was new to her also to take the lead dora usually strode ahead i cant advise you about things of that sort she said im oldfashioned you see oh are you darling murmured dora nobody would have guessed it but i am over things like that oldfashioned and romantic i think love in a cottage would be quite ideal not because a cottage is ideali would much sooner not live in onebut because love is and oh dora i can just advise you not to marry him unless you are in love with him i daresay heaps of girls make very nice sensible marriages where theres lots of money and where they each like the other but you do miss such a lot by not falling in love you missyou miss it all dora scrutinized her friend for a moment her head a little on one side with something of the manner of a brighteyed thrush listening for the movement of the worm that it hopes to breakfast on but theres something in your mind which you are not saying may she remarked i can hear it rustling yes there are just two little things that make me wonder whether you are in love with him the first is you said you were sure he was good that is no reason at all you dont fall in love with a person because hes good you esteem and like himor its possible to conceive doing sobecause hes good but you dont love him for that reason dora gave a little purr of laughter oh may you are heavenly she said but surely its an advantage if your promesso is good oh certainly but nobody in love stops to think about that i see well what is the second thing that makes you wonder may looked at her with her large serious blue eyes what you said about being brought up with a jerk in the middle of your thrill when he spoke of a handsome lady as if it mattered yet somehow it does to you or it would not bring you up with a jerk and you think it doesnt matter asked dora of course not if you love him and if you dont in the name of all that is sensible dont marry him that sort of marriage is called sensible i know it is really the wildest and most awful risk dora stared how do you know she asked of course i know simply because im in love with harry fancy being tied to a man for life without that gracious its nearly six and he was to call for me at home at six oh you can keep him waiting ten minutes said dora weve only just begun to talk about the great point may shook her head i could keep him waiting she said but i couldnt keep myself i must go darling i long to hear more only you see i cant stop now come and see me tomorrow morning i shall be in till lunch time dora shrugged her shoulders not in the least naturally but of design i think its a pity to fall in love then if it makes one so selfish she remarked no doubt you are right darling goodbye said may it was as may had said close on six and in anticipation of mr osbornes arrival dora removed herself from the little foreandaft drawing room which looked out in front through two windows on to eaton place and at the back through one on to the little square yard behind the house and went upstairs to her bedroom taking the hat with one swan feather fixed in it and the other still unplaced with her but even the hat though in this extraordinarily interesting condition with regard to its trimming failed at the moment to make good any footing in her mind it was not that hats were less interesting than before especially to the maker and wearer but that during this last month something else had grown infinitely more interesting than anything else had ever been the standard of interest possible in this world which dora found so full of enchanting things had been immeasurably raised life hitherto had been brilliantly full of surface brightnesses but it seemed to her now as if life the sunlike spirit of life which shone with so continuous a lustre on her struck the surface of herself no longer but penetrated down into depths that she had not yet dreamed of there in those depths so it seemed to her she sat now while on the surface so to speak there floated all the pleasant and humorous and friendly things of life the hat she held in her hand floated there dogs swam about there and flowers sparkled may thurston was there and friends innumerable but as in the exquisite picture of the birth of eve by watts a big photograph of which hung over her bed it was as if all these were but a skin a rind which even now was peeling off her showing beneath the form and the wonder of the woman herself she sat in the window seat and the hot air of the tired afternoon streamed slowly and gently in just lifting and letting lie again the bright brown of her hair outside the hundred noises of the busy town mingled and melted together and seemed to her to form even as the blending of all colours forms the apparently colourless white a general hush and absence of noise rousing herself for a moment and consciously listening she could detect and name the ingredients of it there was the sharp clip of horses hoofs the whirr of motors the chiding of swifts the agitated chirp of sparrows over some doubtful treasure of the roadway the tapping of heels on the hot pavement the cool whisper of cleansing from a water cart and the noise of news being cried round the corner but all these were blended together and formed not confused noise but quietness and from the quietness of her face and the immobility of her hands which were usually so active you might have guessed that she was tired or bored and found this hour pass heavily but a second glance would have erased so erroneous an impression there was a smouldering brightness in her eye and ever and again a little trembling at the corners of her mouth which might develop into a smile or equally easily almost be the precursor of flooded eyes for the last month now she had had moods like this when she dived down from the froth and effervescence of her surface mind and sat below in deep and remote waters it was not that she had lost the power of living on the surface for this afternoon with her friend she had been quite completely there until toward the end of their talk she had felt that she was being beckoned down again and knew that when may left her she would sink into these depths that till lately she had not known existed yet the path that had led to them had been quite natural all her life she had above all things loved beauty whether of waves or birds or sunsets or human beings thus it was without any sense of a strange or unusual thing happening to her that she had admired frankly and naturally the dark merry face of this young man he had taken her into dinner once or twice he had danced with her a half dozen times and then suddenly and quite unexpectedly he belonged to the surface of things no longer as far as she was concerned something smote at her heart and the flowers and birds peeled away like rind as from eve when she was born and the woman shone within and indeed there was little in all this to wonder at for in spite of crabbed and cynical proverbs about beauty being only skindeep it remains and will remain to those who have eyes themselves the wand of the enchanter no doubt the enchantment can be made without the wand but when eyes are keen and blood is young how vastly more easily is the enchantment effected with the aid of that weapon and claude to her thinking before ever she even wondered if she was falling in love with him was certainly not without the wand he was dark a potent colour to her who was so fair hair nearly black grew low and crisp on the forehead and eyebrows quite black met above his brown eyes then came the lean smooth oval of his face a mouth rather fulllipped and a squarish chin often before he spoke especially if he had as not infrequently happened some rather determined remark to make he jerked his head a little back and put out his chin it was a gesture of extraordinary decision and oh said dora to herself now as she thought of it i do like a man to know his mind the same signs of knowing his mind were visible too in his movements he never strayed about a room or leaned against anything if he purposed to stand up up he stood if he wished for support he sat down but as far as dora had seen he seldom wished for support those rather long slim limbs and boyish figure appeared remarkably capable of supporting themselves he moved quickly and with a certain neatness that was attractive oncethese tiny details were important in making up her impression of himshe had seen him strike a match in a windy place to light his cigarette one quick stroke had kindled it and his thin brown fingers made a cavern for it in which it burned unwaveringly as in a room and he could dance really dance not slide about in a crowded ballroom with an avoidance of collision which was really magical and withoutdoubtless these things were all of the surface but they caused the whole image to sink down with her into those depthswithout having to mop his face when they stopped which in general was not before the music stopped suddenly from the combined quietness of the noises outside a sound detached itself and made itself very clear to her ear it was a motor just preparing to start somewhere close below her in the street and dora feeling instinctively somehow that this was significant to her got up and leaned out of the window her instinct was correct enough a big short broad man with an extremely shiny tophat was just stepping into the big napier car that stood at her mothers door even as she looked out the chauffeur nipped into his place again and in answer to the footmans inquiry she heard mr osborne say ome quite distinctly then he lifted his shiny hat and carefully wiped the top of his bald head upon which dora had no doubt in reaction from her really serious half hour of thought a slight fit of the giggles but the giggles soon stopped they were but of the nature of coming to the surface to breathe and she was already beginning to sink back toward the depths again when there came a tap at her door and her mother entered lady austell was very tall and one felt at once that there was not the slightest doubt that she was not a countess it seemed somehow far too suitable a thing to have really occurred but in the endless surprises of this world in which everything unconjecturable happens and everyone is what he should not be the ideally fit thing had occurred and a countess she was in spite of the obviousness of the fact that she must be that she was dowager was no less easy a guess for though eighteen years had elapsed since her husbands death there was something about her dress a little strip of crape insertion in the violet of her gown it may be or the absence of any jewels except an amethyst cross or at other times a cap very dutch and becoming with a ribbon of black in it that sat loosely on her abundant hair that suggested though it did not notify widowhood these insignia it must be noted she did not wear simultaneously but there was never a day on which one at least of them or others like them was not present no doubt also her manner gave confirmation to the impression conveyed by her dress for it was one from which all exuberance had departed though it suggested and reminded you like a clear sunset that a brilliant day had preceded it her voice also was rather faint and regretful the voice of a widow with an unsatisfactory son and an unmarried daughter but those who knew her best had in their minds the very distinct knowledge that it was difficult if not impossible to silence that faint voice or make it say anything different to what it had already said lady austell when her views were in conflict with those of others never said very much but she never changed her tune nor indeed ceased faintly chanting it until the opposition had been borne down by her quiet persistence as for the regretfulness of which her gentle accents were full it may have been composed of grief for the fact that others not she would eventually be obliged to yield it will be seen therefore that theresa austell was an instance the more of the undoubted fact that people as well as things are not what they seem she seemed until you knew her quite well to live uncomplainingly but regretfully among the memories of dead and happier years whereas when your acquaintance with her ripened you would find that she lived with remarkable keenness in the present and kept a wide and unwavering eye on a live and happier future she appeared to be soft gentle and helpless in reality she was remarkably capable of taking care of herself and though like ivy she appeared to cling to others for support her nature was in truth that of the famous ivy that grew on the new mansion in park lane it could stand upright with perfect ease and was of metallic hardness adversityfor she had not had a very happy lifeinstead of breaking her had tempered her to an exceeding toughness what had been at the most soft iron was now reliable steel she gave a faint wan smile at dora as she entered i thought you would be here dear she said your aunt adeline has telephoned to know if we want her motor we can have it till dinnertime and it will then take us to her house i knew you liked a drive so i thanked her and said yes this was merely another way of putting the fact that lady austell wanted a drive and also wanted to talk to dora but her method of putting it sounded better and was very likely quite true dora did like a drive and since her mother knew it that might possibly have been the reason why she accepted aunt adelines offer but lady austells next reason though she had already given reason sufficient was not so probable a drive will do you good dear she said faintly you look a little fagged out and pale dora had learned not to dispute points with her mother though in general she was so full of discursive volubility she was always rather silent with lady austell of whom in some way that she scarcely understood herself she was considerably afraid but that again was typical of the effect her mother produced on people those who knew her but slightly thought she was the least formidable of women but the better she was known the more she was feared often dora argued to herself about the matter she knew that she was not afraid of anything tangible her mother could do to her she could not beat her or starve her or illtreat her and it must have been her mothers nature of which she was afraid the feeling was analogous to a childs fear of the dark it fears not what it knows of but the unknown possibilities that may lurk therein it cannot say what they are if it knew it would probably cease to fear them dora got up at once yes i should like a drive she said then put on your hat dear and lady austells pale melancholy eyes fell on the halftrimmed straw another hat dora she asked i should have thought what you had would have lasted you till the end of the season and at the words doras pleasure in her new hat fell as dead as sisera at jaels feet nobody could kill pleasure though quite innocently with so unerring an aim as lady austell it didnt cost twopence said dora jim sent me up the feathers from grote lady austell looked at the straw with an experienced eye it is very cheap for less than twopence she remarked the only question is whether it was necessary then you will join me down below dear i have a note to write and we may as well leave it instead of posting it this was illustrative of the cause that had made dora say that when women grew up they were very odd people lady austell would unfalteringly drive through miles of odious roads to deliver a note rather than post it but would on the same day drive to oxford street a twoshilling fare in a hansom in order to purchase what she would have paid sixpence more for round the corner she was the victim of the habit of petty economy in pursuit of which passionone of the most fatalshe would become a perfect spendthrift casting florins and half crowns right and left in order to save pennies she took great care of the pence and the halfcrowns presumably took care of themselves for at any rate she took no care of them but when other peoples expenditure was concerned she took care of it all the note that had to be left which concerned cessation of subscription from a library in leicester square caused them to traverse the length of piccadilly and to retrace it before they could leave the jostling traffic and turn into the park and it so happened that in this traverse of the streets the month being midjuly and the hour the late afternoon lady austell had been almost incessantly occupied though by her own word she disliked all conventionality in smiling sadly and regretfully as was her manner at all the people she knew and bowing without a smile to those who appeared to know her somehow her smile even when it was most gracious and welcoming always suggested to the person on whom it was bestowed that something had gone wrong with his affairs and lady austell knew and was most sympathetic so that mrs osborne seated in a landau that bobbed prodigiously owing to the extreme resilience of the springs that came from her husbands workshops receiving one of these felt certain for a moment that mr os mission that afternoon had not prospered until she remembered that she had seen lady austell smile like that before soon after walking gaily eastward came austell whom she had thought to be still in the country and on whom she bestowed a glance of pained wonder closely followed by claude looking in spite of the heat of the day extremely cool and comfortable in a strawhatted suit dora did not see him she was at the moment smiling violently at some one who did not see her then the motor checked for a moment at the gates of the park slid forward again into the less populous ways and lady austell abandoning the duties of recognition did her duty by her daughter as usual she began a little way off the point so that she could get well into her stride so to speak before you saw that she was going anywhere in particular this was a settled policy with her it insured in racing parlance a flying start instead of a start from rest during the drive down piccadilly she had been arranging her thoughts with her usual precision she knew not only what she was going to say but how she was going to say it she gave a little sigh what sermons there are not only in stones she said but in streets and do you know dear when one drives down piccadilly like that and sees all sorts and conditions of men and women jostling each other what strikes me is not how different people are but how alike they are all the differences she was getting into her stride now which we think of as so great are really so infinitesimal real differences the things that matter do not lie on the surface at all i think our tendency is to make far too much out of mere superficialities and to neglect or discount those traits and qualities which constitute the essential differences between one man and another dont you think so dear the ingenious latin language has certain particles used in asking questions one of which the grammarian tells us is used if a negative reply is expected another if the reply is expected to be affirmative lady austell speaking in the less rich language of our day could not make use of these but there was something in her intonation quite as effective as nonne dora without question found herself saying yes i am so glad you agree with me dear went on her mother and i am sure you will agree with me also in the fact that this being so we should try to judge people or rather to appreciate them by the true and inner standard not by the more obvious but less essential characteristics that we see on the surface lady austells voice sank a little if one may say so without irreverence she said how god must laugh at our divisions of classes we must look like children arranging books by the colour of their covers instead of by their contents we class all sorts of noble and ignoble people together and call them gentlemen neglecting the only true classification altogether it was evident now to dora that her mother had got an excellent start and she could see what she had started for there was no need for reply and lady austell having favoured a passing friend with a smile that was positively wintry in its sadness proceeded such a good instance of what i am saying occurred today dear she said mr osborne called on me at six as i think i told you he was going to do and for the first time perhaps i fully saw what true delicacy and feeling he has and how immensely these outweigh any of those things which we hastily might call faults of manner or breeding it is the same with her kind excellent woman that she is what a priceless thing to inherit all that kindness and sweetness of nature lady austell was flying along now the race so to speak was clearly a sprint dora merely waited for her to breast the tape she proceeded to do so he came on a subject that very closely concerns you dear she said and like a true gentleman he asked my permission before allowing any step to be taken can you guess dear dora as has been said stood considerably in awe of her mother but occasionally a discourse of this kind which she felt to be entirely insincere roused in her an impulse of the liveliest impatience which gave sharpness to her tongue oh dear yes she said the truly delicate mr osborne asked if mr claude might pay his addresses to me i expect he used just those words i hope you allowed him to mother lady austells manner was always admirable she appeared not to notice the sharpness of the speech at all she laid her neatly gloved hand on doras ah my dearest she said she looked at her with her sad blue eyes eyes that always looked tender and patient even when she was disputing a fare with a cabman i am sure you will be very happy dear she said after a pause he is the most excellent young man everyone speaks well of him and my dear how goodlooking a perfecti forget the name dora had a momentary tendency to giggle at the anticlimax of this but she checked it and again her impatience rose to the surface adonis she suggested but are not good looks one of those superficial things which we rate too high lady austell smiled ah you mischievous child she said you make fun of all i say i will send a note to mr osborne tonight for i told him i should have to speak to you first you will make him very happy dora and you will make somebody else happier shall we turn chapter iii the garden front of grote faced southeast and thus though all day the broad paved walk in front of it had been grilled by the burning of the august sun the shadow of the house itself had spread over it like an incoming tide of dark clear water before tea time and at this moment three footmen were engaged in laying the table for that meal while the fourth as a matter of fact was talking to the stillroom maid under pretence of seeing to the urn they were all in the famous osborne livery which was rather gorgeous and of the waspish scheme of colour there were it may be remarked only four of them because mr osborne was still in london roughing it so his wife was afraid with a kitchenmaid for cook and only two footmen besides his own man for parliamentary business had kept him there for a few days after mrs osborne had left to get things in order at grote but he was expected down this afternoon for a couple of nights before he went north and the six footmen would shine together like evening stars company also though not in large numbers were also arriving that evening among whom were lady austell her son and dora the latter was now formally and publicly engaged to claude the house was threestoried built in the jacobean style of brick and stone with smallpaned windows and the brick had mellowed to that russet red which is as indescribable as it is inimitable a door opened from the long gallery inside which was panelled and hung with portraitsinalienable luckily or austell would have got rid of them long agoonto this broadpaved walk that ran from end to end of the house on the other side of it was the famous yew hedge with square doors cut in it through which were seen glimpses of the flower garden and long riband bed below and the top of this hedge grew the grotesque shapes of birds a flight of stone steps led down into the formal flower garden below which was bordered on the far side by the long riband bed below that again two big herbaceous borders stretched away toward the lake on the far side of which there rose from the edge of the water the great rhododendron thickets to right and left lay the park full of noble timber which climbed up to the top of the hill opposite across this ran the road from the station which skirted the lake on its eastern side and passing by the flower garden came up to what mrs osborne called the carriage sweep on the other side of the house from which two wings projected so that the carriage sweep was really the interior of a threesided quadrangle the warning hoot of an approaching motor caused one of the footmen to disappear into the house with some alacrity and a few minutes afterward mr osborne emerged from the door into the gallery he still wore london clothes dark gray trousers and a black frock coat and waistcoat for he had driven straight from the house of commons to victoria but he had picked up a panama hat in the hall and had substituted it for his silk hat and tell your missus ive come he observed to one of the wasps he sat down in a creaking basketchair for a few moments to rest and cool as he expressed it to himself and looked about him with extreme satisfaction his big highcoloured face was capable of expressing an immense amount of contentment and though from time to time he carried a large coloured handkerchief to his face and mopped his streaming forehead with a whistled whew at the heat so superficial a cause of discomfort could not disturb his intense satisfaction with life things had prospered amazingly with him and his he was thoroughly contented with the doings of destiny he was still resting and cooling when mrs osborne came bustling out of the house also very hot and kissed her husband loudly first on one cheek and then on the other well and thats right my dear she said and its good to see you but you are hot eddie and is it wise for you to sit out o doors in the shadow without a wrap you were always prone to take a chill i should be prone to take an apoplexy if i put anything else on mrs o remarked he but my its a relief to get down into the country again not but what things havent gone very well this last week for me in the house commission on housing of employees i had a good bit to tell them about that and i warrant you they listened lor my dear they like a plain man asll talk common sense to them and tell em what hes seen and what he knows instead of argufying about procedure i knew my figures my dear and my cubic feet per room and my statistics about the health of my workmen and their deathrate ive been a common man myself my dear and i told them so and told them what things was when i was a lad mrs osborne was slightly aghast oh eddie i doubt thatll tell against you she said not a bit of it old lady everyone knew it to begin with else i dont say i should have told them and equally they know that they come and dance at no when mrs o invites them glad they are to come too and my dinner table is good enough for anybody to put his legs under but all thats over for the present and i didnt come away for my holiday which ive deserved to talk more politics i came away to enjoy myself and have a breath of country air eh its a pretty little box this i wish i could have bought it i should have liked to leave a country seat for per and mrs after you and me was dead and buried this turn in the conversation was not quite to mrs osbornes taste dont talk so light about dying mr osborne she said because you give me the creeps and the shivers for all its so hot theres a host of things too i want to talk to you about before the company comes without thinking of buryings theres the two pictures of you and me arrived and it would be a good thing if youd cast your eye over the walls and see where youd like them hung and wed get them up at once theyre a fine pair they are and the frames too remarkably handsome well you want a handsome frame for a handsome bit of painting said her husband and finer works ive seldom seen they was cheap at the price give me a cup of tea mrs o and well go and have a squint at em what else my dear mrs osborne poured him out a cup of tea as she knew he liked it extremely strong she put in the cream first and stirred it up before handing to him your brother alfred came yesterday she said and you must be careful how you behave to him eddie hes got a touch of the lumbago and it makes him worried poor old alfcross as two sticks i shouldnt wonder said mr osborne sipping his tea loudly never mind theres claude to look after him and claude manages him as never was hes wrapped up in that lad maria my dear and im sure i dont wonder where is the boy and my lady dora will be here this evening lord mrs o my tongue cant say dora yet it keeps saying my lady i seem as if i cant get used to it and what other of the lords and ladies have you got coming well theres lady austell and the earl and theres lady thurslady may thurston and mr franklin to whom shes engaged why were a houseful of lovers said mr osborne beaming delightedly that we are then theres alderman price and lady just run down from sheffield and sir thomas ewart and lady remind me to get out the port said mr osborne sir thomas likes a glass of that he likes a dozen glasses of that remarked mrs osborne but prayadont sit for ever over your wine at table mr o for theres thethei never can remember the name of that quartette but theyre going to give us a bit of music after lashing out lashing out said her husband youll make a pauper of me yet mrs o never you fear but dora loves music and nothing would content claude but that i must get the quartette down and dont you look at the bill mr o because its a scandal to pay that for a bit of music and then theres percy and catherine and your brother just a family party said osborne thats what i like family party and an old friend or two like sir thomas and lady times change dont they mrs o there was a time when you and me felt so flustered at being bid to dinner with sir t that we were all of a tremble not much trembling now eh ah maria for what we have received the lord make us truly thankful mrs osborne did not at once follow this and since when have you said your grace after your tea eddie she asked oh it wasnt for my tea said he i was just thinking of everything teas and breakfasts and luncheons and dinners and work and play and enjoyment alike im thankful i am thankful for it all then mrs osborne understood and held out her plump hand with its large knuckles and immense jewelled rings to her husband eddie my love she said and lor here comes alfred dont go kissing my hand before him hed think it so silly silly or not mrs o here goes said her husband and imprinted a resounding caress on it round the corner of the house had come a queer wizened little figure alfred for all the heat of the day was dressed in black broadcloth wore a species of buckled goloshes over his shoes and had a plaid rug over his shoulders from above the garish colours of this rose a very small head which would have been seen to be bald had not its owner worn over it a cap of harris tweed the peak of which almost came over his eye below that appeared a thin little aquiline nose a mouth so tight and thinlipped that it looked as if it was not meant to open and cheeks so hollow that they looked as if they were being sucked in by voluntary contraction his walk was peculiar as his dress he moved one foot a little forward and then put the other level with it the same process repeated led to an extraordinarily deliberate progression alfred was mr osbornes elder brother older than him by some ten years he had entered a brokers office as clerk at the age of fifteen and in the intervening years had by means of careful and studied speculation amassed a fortune that had made mr osborne on a former occasion remark that claude would be a richer man than his father without ever having done a stroke of work for it for alfred unmarried as yet had made claude his heir a benefaction in return for which he took it out of claudes father and mother by one of those strange fantasies of nature which must supply her with so great a fund of amusement he united to an unrivalled habit of being right with regard to the future movements of the stock market an equally unrivalled eye for the merits of pictures and had for years bought very cheaply such works as dealers and connoisseurs would run up and wrangle for at christies a few years later here the inimitable humour of the construction of his nature came in for well as he loved a picture he loved a financial transaction a little more dearly and sometimes he had collected works of an artist of no particular merit in the consciousness that when dealers knew that he was buying them they would begin to put the price up then he would gently unload and leave them with unmarketable wares on their hands he delighted in dealers because they ministered to his recondite sense of fun they did not delight in him because they never knew whether he was collecting because he saw merit in an artist or because his design was to make them think that such merit existed one or two had tried to make friends with him and asked him to dinner he ate their dinners with a great appreciation and scored off them worst of all by some further strange freak of fancy nature had made it easy for him to acquire all that which his brother and sisterinlaw could not acquire at all for brother alfred in spite of his ridiculous clothes had the manner the voice and the ways of an eccentric and highlineaged duke cynical if you will and of amazing illtemper a fancy which mrs osborne delicately alluded to as being worried he also gave the impression of infernal wickedness a quality which he was quite lacking in except as regards his illtempers it was an undoubted fact that he invariably got the better of other competitors in speculating and picture dealing and such perfectly legitimate pursuits which they might be inclined to attribute to diabolical alliances he crept toward the tea table looked at his brothers hand which was held out in salutation as if it was an insect rejected it and sat down pulling his shawl more closely about his shoulders fresh from your triumphs in the house my dear edward he said you positively reek of prosperity you seem to be hot well im what i seem then said mr osborne with great good nature he could not possibly be other than polite to brother alfred who was to make claude his heir even if he had been tempted to do so as a matter of fact he was not so tempted rum old alf was his only comment on his brother when he had been more than usually annoying i gather that the aristocracy assembles before dinner went on alfred maria my dear after giving me tea for forty years at frequent intervals it is strange that you do not remember that i take milk and not cream another cup please well and hows the lumbago alf asked his brother plumbago i call it weighs as heavy as lead round the loins not but what ive only once had a touch of it myself very humorous indeed said alfred there was certainly no doubt that brother alfred was a good deal worried and mr osborne made the mental note that his lumbago must be very bad indeed to make him like this acid he always was but not always vitriolic but luckily both mr osborne and his wife were proof against either acid or vitriol they only felt sorry that brother alf was so worried well well take your mind off it alf he said weve got a lot of fair dames coming down to cheer you up lord maria what a rip brother alf was when he was a young one opera every night and bouquets to the ladies on the stage libel remarked alfred libel it was but mr osborne had intended it for a pleasant sort of libel as the libel and not the pleasantness struck alfred he abandoned the topic bought any pictures lately alf he said no but there are two i should like to have sold you and maria never saw such daubs what did you pay for them twentyfive pounds apiece mrs osborne laughed quite good humouredly why if hes not trying to buy them cheap off us she said and sell them expensive twentyfive pounds apiece as if you didnt know that the frames came to more you and your joking alfred take a cucumber sandwich which i know you like though how you digest such cold vegetables at tea passes me why i am reminded of a cucumber sandwich for hours after where are you going to hang them asked brother alfred and if we werent just going indoors when weve finished our tea to look said mrs osborne cordially do come with us alfred and give your advice i should recommend the coal cellar said alfred they want toning why and hes at his joke again said mrs osborne with placid admiration there is probably nothing more aggravating to a man in a thoroughly bad temper than to fail in communicating one single atom of it to others but to have your most galling attacks received with perfect good humour such was the case with poor alfred now he could no more expunge the satisfaction from eddies streaming countenance or strike the smile from his sisterinlaws powdered face than he could make a wax doll cease smiling except by smashing its features altogether he tried a few further shafts slightly more poisoned its odd to me maria he said that you dont see how sabincourt or whatever the daubers name is yes mr sabincourt quite correct said mrs osborne how he has simply been making caricatures of you and my poor brother making you sit with your rings and bracelets and necklaces and tiaras just to show them off and you too edward there you sit at your table with a ledger and a cash box and a telephone just for all the world as if you were saying this is what honest hardware has done for me mrs osborne was slightly nettled by this attack on her husband but still she did not show it and im sure mr sabincourts done the telephone beautiful she said why when i stand and look at the picture i declare i think i hear the bell ringing and as for my necklace and tiaras alf my dear why it was eddie who bade me put them on no weve got no quarrel with mr sabincourt i do assure you alfred gave her one glance of concentrated malevolence and gave it up whether he would have tried it again after a short period for reflection is uncertain but at this moment claude came out of the house hullo father he said i thought i heard the motors but i was changing glad to see you my boy been having a ride yes on the new mare uncle alf gave me shes a ripper uncle alf im ever so much obliged to you and hows the lumbago alfreds face had changed altogether when claude appeared and for the look of peevish malignancy in his eyes there was substituted one of almost eager affection and certainly as mr osborne had said there was little wonder for claudes appearance might have sweetened the most misanthropic heart he was dressed quite simply and suitably in white flannels and white lawn tennis shoes and the contrast between him and his father in his thick heavy london clothes was quite amazing his brown cleanshaven face was still a little flushed by his ride and his hair was even now just drying back into its crisp curls after his bath he did not bother his mother to pour him out tea and instead made a bowl of it for himself in an unused slopbasin moving the tea things with his longfingered brown hands with a quick deftness that was delightful to watch four lumps of sugar claude asked his father youll be getting stout my boy and then whatll your young lady say to you alfred turned a glance of renewed malignancy on to his brother as claude laughed shell say im taking after my father he remarked alfred gave a little thin squeak of amusement he had entirely failed to annoy his brother but he hoped that claude would have better luck but again he was doomed to disappointment mr osbornes watch chain only stirred and shook as it did when he laughed internally claude looked about for a teaspoon took his mothers and stirring his slopbasin of tea which was half milk had a long drink at it father i thought id drive the napier over to meet lady austell and dora he said if you dont mind why theres the two landaus going and the brougham and the bus for the servants said mrs osborne what for do you want the car claude flushed a little oh i only thought i should like to drive it he said its a smart turnout too and dora likes motors mr osbornes watch chain again responded to ventral agitations blest if he doesnt want to give his girl a drive in his dads best car to show off the car and his driving he said with some jocosity which drew on him brother alfreds malignancy again its a good thing you havent got to do the driving edward he observed why shouldnt the boy have the car out ill pay for the petrol the suggestion conveyed here was not quite a random libel alfred with his inconvenient habit of observation had seen that the cost of petrol was a thing that worried his brother and promised to be a pet economy like the habit of untying parcels to save string or lighting as many cigarettes as possible at the same match or the tendency shown by lady austell to traverse miles of dusty streets in order to leave a note instead of posting it and mr osborne got up a little more hastily than he would otherwise have done if this remark had not been made oh take the car take the car claude he said very glad you should my boy now mrs o you and i will go in and see where well hang our likenesses mr alfred waited till they had gone and then drew his plaid a little closer round his shoulders with another squeak of laughter i thought that would get the car for you claude he said that vexed your father claude finished his tea i know it did uncle alfred he said why did you say it why to get you the car thats what im here for to learn what you want and see you get it theres some use in me yet my lad usually i cant make your father annoyed with me but i touched him up that time claude could not help smiling at his uncles intense satisfaction as he sat there with shoulders hunched up like a little malevolent ape still grinning over the touchup he had so dexterously delivered he himself had got up after finishing his slopbasin of tea and was balanced on the arm of his chair one slim leg crossed over the other and his hands clasping his knees his smile caused those great dark eyes nearly to close with the soft wrinkling up of the flesh at their outer corners but closing them it opened his lips and showed the even white teeth between them then with that gesture which was frequent with him he tossed back his head and broke into a laugh well its too bad of you he said but thanks for getting me the car its a handsome bit of work they told me at napiers there wasnt such another on the road anywhere and what if i do want to run dora up in style its natural isnt it somehow when claude was with his father and mother he appeared to be a perfectly wellbred boy but in spite of his extraordinary good looks and the perfect ease of his manner the moment they had gone and there was no standard of that kind to judge him by he seemed different itll be a pleasant change for her finding the house comfortable he went on with servants to answer the bells and half a dozen bathrooms where there wasnt one before and no holes in the carpets to trip yourself over the place was like an old dust heap when the lease was signed three weeks ago but you may bet i made the furnishers and decorators put their best feet foremost and i must say theyve done it all in the best style its a nice comfortable english house that is what it is mother wanted to have no end of gilding and kickshaws i put my foot on that and per backed me up alfred shuffled to the house after claude had gone and made his way to the dining room where he expected to find the portraits of his brother and sisterinlaw in process of being placed the gallery through which he had first to pass had been left more or less in the state the osbornes had found it in though it was with difficulty that mrs osborne had been persuaded not to put down a carpet on the polished oak boards but she had had her way with regard to a few persian rugs which had been there and which she pronounced not fit to be seen and had got some nice thick pieces of the best kidderminster instead otherwise the jacobean oak of its chairs tables and bookcases had been allowed to abide nor had she interfered with the portraits of wests that hung on its oakpanelled walls but with the hall it was different and she had made several striking changes here there had not even been a hatrack in it which did not matter much before since the wests had not entertained there for years and you could put your hat down on one of the low oak chests but mrs osborne intended to entertain a great deal and the first thing she did was to order two large mahogany hatstands with a sort of dock for umbrellas beneath which she had placed one on each side of the door on the white plaster walls between the oak pillars that ran up to the roof she had put up a couple of dozen stags heads ordered from roland ward and half a dozen foxes masks which gave the place a baronial and sporting air the light from the two old bronze lamps similarly was quite insufficient and she had put up four very solid yet elegant such was their official description electric standards one in each corner of the hall while over the central table she suspended another from the rafters above slightly ecclesiastic in design though indeed it might suggest an earthly coronet of overwhelming proportions as much as a heavenly crown a few stuffed tarpons killed by per in florida carried on the sporting note which was further borne out by a trophy of spears and battle axes and bead aprons which he had brought with him from the same tour finally she had introduced an enormous early victorian mahogany sideboard for laying a cloak or a coat on and on this also stood a stuffed crocodilelizard sitting up on its hindlegs and carrying in its fore paws a tray for cards this had been a birthday present to her from mrs alderman price who was expected that evening and even percy who had such taste had said it was very quaint so there it stood in the middle of the mahogany sideboard carrying in its tray only the card of the clergyman of the parish but mrs osborne had no fear about callers she was long past all that and surveying the hall only this morning she had said to herself with great satisfaction i declare i shouldnt have known it when i think what it was when i first see it alfred stood and looked about him for a moment or two when he came into this very suitably furnished hall and observed with some silent amusement that roland wards label was still attached to one of the stags heads this he did not remove indeed with the end of his stick he poked it into a rather more prominent position then he passed on into the dining room the two portraits were already hung for mr osborne had seen at once where they should go above the new mahogany sideboard which was like that in the hall and was in fact as mrs osborne said its fellow the windows took up the long side opposite to them and on the other two were some half dozen portraits which alfred had in vain tried to buy before now but had found to his chagrin that they were inalienable there was a reynolds there a gainsborough a couple of romneys and all had about them that indefinable air of race and breeding which the old english masters lucky perhaps in their sitters or at any rate in their own quality of vision render so superbly till this evening the third wall had been empty now mr and mrs osborne she in all her jewels he with the telephone and ledger shone there alfred glanced round the room but his eye came back to these two portraits sabincourt that superb modern artist had done the sitters justice justice so rough that it might be taken for revenge mrs osborne sat full face her white hair gathered beneath the allround tiara of diamonds that she felt to be so heavy close round her neck was the lands end necklace but a rope of pearls reached to her waist and was fastened there by an immense ruby her large pillowy arms were bare to the shoulder in one hand she held the perigaud fan but it was so grasped that the rings on the hand that held it as well as the bracelets were in evidence the other lay negligently knuckles upwards on the carved arms of her chair her face wore an expression of fatuous content and it was extremely like her cruelly like her and edward had fared as well or as badly at the eminent hands of the artist a vulgar kindly face peered into his ledger and as his wife said you could almost hear the telephone bell ring alfred seemed fascinated by the sight of the portraits or rather by the sight of them in contrast with the others he turned on the electric light which was attached to their frames and drawing a chair from a table sat down to observe them then he suddenly broke into a spasm of noiseless laughter and slapped his thin thigh with his withered little hand after a while he rose but ill get sabincourt to paint one of claude he said to himself and then ask any of these dealerfools if its a west or an osborne bless his handsome face dinner that night was an extremely lengthy affair but informallike quite a family party as mrs osborne explained to several of her guests as she informed them whom they were to take in or be taken in by may thurston was furnished with the most complete explanation i thought wed all be comfortable and not stuck up lady th lady may now that weve left london behind us she said and though im well aware my dear that sir thomas ought to take you in by reason of your rank since mr o takes in lady austell and the earl me i thought youd not be illpleased if i passed you off with your young man same as ive treated lady dora in sending her in with claude and so all you young people will be together and a merry time youll have ill be bound ah there is sir thomas i must explain to him sir thomas cared little for precedence but much for his dinner and more for his wine he was considered quite a courtier in manner at sheffield and bowed to mrs osborne on the conclusion of her explanation when mr osborne has the ordering of the wines and mrs osborne the commanding of the victuals he said handsomely he would be a man whats hard to please if he wasnt very well content and to take in mrs percy is an opportunity i may say of studying refinement and culture that doesnt often here mrs percy herself entered the room close to where they were standing and he broke off conscious of some slight relief for he was one of those people who can very easily get into a long sentence but find it hard to rescue themselves from being strangled by it when once there but speak of an angel he added and there comes a fluttering of wings thereafter the gathering of the clans as mr osborne usually expressed the assembly of guests for dinner came thick but before they were gathered a deafening gong announced that dinner was gathered too austell with his weak pale face came last but one and finally his mother made her slow and impressive entry she looked like an elderly dethroned princess come back after exile to the native country where she no longer ruled and stretched out both hands to mrs osborne whom she had not seen since her arrival dear mrs osborne she said how glad i am quite charming a family party clans all gathered now mrs o said her husband lets have a bit of dinner the dinner was served throughout on silver a grove of wine glasses stood at the right hand of each guest in deference to alfreds lumbago all windows were closed and the atmosphere soon became very warm and comfortable indeed an immense glass chandelier hanging above the table and studded with electric lights was the chief author of illumination but clumps of other lights were on the walls and each picture had its separate lamp sir thomass courtierlike speeches soon ceased and he was content to eat and listen to the cultured conversation that flowed from mrs pers lips while his face gradually deepened in colour to a healthy crimson and his capacity for bowing must certainly have ceased also he asked the butler whom he called waiter which was the year of each particular vintage that was so lavishly pressed upon him and occasionally after sipping it interrupted the welling of the cool springs of culture to look codfishlike up the table toward mr osborne and say capital ninetytwo this and then mrs per would begin again her talk was like the flowing of a syphon it stopped so long only as you put your finger on the end of it but the finger removed it continued uninterrupted pellucid without haste or pause she was the daughter of a most respectable solicitor in sheffield whose father and grandfather had been equally highly thought of and per openly acknowledged that some of the most chaste designs in the famous ornamental tinware were the fruits of her pencil but with the modesty of true genius she seldom spoke of drawing though she was so much wrapped up in art but discussed its kindred manifestations and in particular the drama she gave a sweet little laugh oh sir thomas you flatter me she said in response to some gross and preposterous compliment about her age while he was waiting for a second helping of broiled ham to which mrs osborne had successfully tempted him indeed you flatter me i am quite old enough to remember irvings hamlet what an inspired performance it made me quite ill from nervous exhaustion for a week i had a silly little schoolgirl hamlet of my ownyes i will allow i was at school though nearly on the point of leaving and i assure you irvings hamlet killed it annihilated it made itis it naughty of memade it stillborn it was as if it had never lived how noble looking he was sir thomas raised his eyes towards mrs osborne best peachfed ham i ever came across he said wonderful man wasnt he mrs percy great artist eh dora from opposite had heard the end of this claude dear she said who is that nice fat man i never saw anybody like his dinner so much what an angel it is funny to me you know coming back here and finding you of all people in that heavenly car ready to drive me up from the station we didnt go quite the shortest way did we last time i was here there was only our old ponytrap to take me and my luggage so i had to walk and do you know mrs osborne has put me in my own room claude turned towards her in spite of the awful heat caused by the shut windows and the rich exhalation of roast meats he was still perfectly cool i did that pretty well then he said do you remember my asking you about the house and where your room was and all that so you never guessed why i asked it was just that you might have your old room again such a business as there was with the mater she said you ought to be on the first landing where those big handsome rooms are but i said no give dora the room on the second floor beyond the old school room and you wont hear any complaints ah that makes it even nicer to know that you did it said she the conversation round the table for the moment had risen to a roar mrs osborne was tempting alderman price to the sorbet he had refused mrs per had got on to the bells which she allowed incorrectly that she had not seen mr osborne was shouting the year of the liqueur brandy which went with the ice to sir thomas and may and mr franklin were wrangling at the tops of their voices over some question of whether a certain dance had been on tuesday or wednesday lady austell only looked slightly aloof and followed the direction of her sons eyes which were fixed as by enchantment on the picture of his hostess and the crowd and the noise seemed to make a silence and isolation for the two lovers but it was a business getting my way he said i never should have but that i was always the maters favourite dora heard the words and something suddenly jarred somehow he should not have put it like that he thought of himself he took credit and then before this rather disconcerting little moment succeeded in disturbing her she looked at him again there was the cool strong face the smouldering eyes that upward tilt of the chin each inimitable each claude and no other favourite she said do you expect me to be surprised quails out of season but probably delicious had come and gone and with the iced fruit salad that followed port was handed round and with that first glass of port mr osborne rose to his feet now its the first glass of good old port from oporto sir thomas he said and i ask the company to drink a health not of this happy couple nor of that as we well might do god bless you my dears but to someone else toasts i know are in general given after the dinner is over and i hope mrs o has got a savoury for you yet and a peach or two but its been my custom to propose a health with the first glass of port such as i see now in my hand sir thomas gave a choked laugh wish all toasts were drunk in such a glass of port osborne he said very kind im sure but silence for the chair sir thomas this is the first little dinner as weve had here and may there be many to follow it with all present as i see now ladies and gentlemen who has had the privilege of entertaining you why mrs osborne maria my dear your health and happiness and no speech required god bless you mrs o it was a complete surprise to mrs osborne and for one moment she felt so shy and confused she hardly knew which way to look then she knew and with her kind blue eyes brimming she smiled at her husband everyone drank something sir thomas his complete glass with a hoarse murmur of no heeltaps mrs per a little sip of water being a teetotaller with her little finger in exclusive elevation lady austell something at random out of the seven glasses at her right hand which had all been filled at different periods of dinner without her observing and dora radiant turned to claude old darlings she said enthusiastically and resumed her conversation with mr franklin on her right but claude was not quite pleased with this heartfelt interjection it was affectionate loving even but something more was due to the son of the house the interjection ought to have been a little more formal and appreciative it should have saluted the importance and opulence of his parents as well as their kindliness after all who had done the house up and made it habitable and then instantaneously this criticism expunged itself from his mind dora always said the thing that was uppermost in her mind and old darlings was a very good thing to be uppermost harry franklin and claude found themselves side by side when not so very long afterward the ladies left the room and mr osborne glass in hand went round the table and sat between austell and sir thomas the others with the exception of alfred who did not stir but continued sitting where he was at the end of the room far away from door and window closed up also and another decanter of the port was brought and when youve given me news of that lord austell and sir thomas said mr osborne genially i warrant therell be another to come up from my cellar without leaving it empty neither the prospect seemed to invigorate sir thomas and he emptied and filled his glass austell meantime was taken to task by his host for not doing the same but was courteously firm in his refusal in spite of mr osbornes assurance that you could bring up a child on this port without its knowing the meaning of a headache harry franklin and claude also were not doing their duty so mr osborne reminded them but the rest were sufficiently stalwart to satisfy him and the navron quartette are playing afterward are they not asked harry may told me so claude frowned slightly yes but when theyll be able to begin i dont know he said when the pater gets somebody to appreciate his port you cant tell when anything else will begin except another bottle what i want is a cigarette and a talk to dora ive got some said harry innocently producing his case and taking one himself he lit it i say youd better wait claude began when the hoarse voice of sir thomas interrupted him its dishonour to the wine he said mr osborne sir your wine is being dishonoured by that young gentleman opposite harry did not catch the meaning of this at once and was put at his ease again by mr osborne before he knew that he was not there already youre all right mr franklin said his host though in general we dont smoke till the wine has finished going round but if my guests maynt do what they like in my house id sooner not have my friends round my table at all drink your wine sir thomas and let those smoke who choose the second bottle which was not to leave mr osbornes cellar denuded had appeared before this and the indignant drinker cooled down over it a faint little squeak of laughter was heard from alfred who had sent for his plaid again and till now had sat perfectly silent emptying and filling his glass as many times as possible at this point he produced a large cigar and lit it himself i disagree with sir thomas he said good tobacco and good wine go very well together very well indeed and he embarked on the nauseating combination it was now halfpast ten and a message came in from the drawingroom as to whether the gentlemen would take their coffee in the dining room or have it with the music this caused a breakup the three young men austell claude and franklin going out leaving the rest at the table those young fellows will please the ladies more than we old fogies would hey sir thomas said mr osborne well follow them byandby its not every day that one meets ones old friends and has a glass of good wine together per my boy i hope youre taking care of yourself per was doing this very adequately he was a fat white young man of nearly thirty with an immensely high forehead from which the tide of hair had already receded far he wore pincenez and a large diamond ring and looked rather older than he was and considerably stouter than he should have been thank you yes dad he said im going strong this furnished sir thomas whose indignation over the cigarette had not quite yet subsided with a text yes my boy he said and long will you when youre not afraid of your dinner and your glass of wine half the young fellows i see now drink barley water to their dinner and some of them dont eat hardly no meat and thats why were losing the trade of the world as well as all the boat races and what not in my day we ate our beef and drank our wine and so did our fathers before us and i never heard that we lost many boat races then sir thomas did not say whether he personally had ever won any nor did percy give testimony to the value of generous diet by the enumeration of any athletic feats of his own a little shrill laugh again came from the other end of the table but sir thomas did not hear it look at those three young fellows who went outno offence to you mr osborne he continued why there wasnt a spare ounce of flesh on any of their bones and that means no stamina theyd shut up like a pocketknife if it came to a tussle and i doubt if their bones are much more than grizzle with the messes they eat and that not enough of them no give me a lad who eats his steak and drinks his bottle of wine and ill tell you whom to back in business or across country well theres sense in a steak to my thinking said mr osborne and to be sure our fathers ate their beef and drank their beer or their port more free than the young fellows do now but id be sorry to put my money against claude if it came to a run or a cricket match hes a wiry young fellow though hes not such a hand at his dinner as is percy the cackle from the end of the table grew louder but no voice followed alfred was one of those to whom his own sense of humour is sufficient in itself without a word he got up and shuffled still wearing his overshoes out of the door the quartette played in the long gallery and claude knowing that music to his family meant nothing except a tune which as mrs osborne said you carry away with you had steered a very happy course in the selection of it so as to satisfy the impulses of filial piety and yet give pleasure to those who like dora and it may be added himself did not want so much to carry tunes away but to listen to music thus a selection from the mikado admirably boiled down for strings put everybody in a good humour and sir thomas to sleep later on a similar selection from patience made mrs osborne again beat time with her fan without disturbing sir thomas and for the rest the exquisite inevitable melodies of bach and scarlotti filled an hours programme and when it was over claude turned to dora with whom he was sitting in a window seat and his eyes glowed like hot coals lets come out he said and stroll down to the lake we cant stop indoors after that bach should always be played out of doors that was finely and justly felt the next moment came a jar they charged the mater a hundred and fifty guineas for coming down he said but its cheap i shall tell her for real good music theres no price you can put upon a thing like that again with dora the check the jar lasted but an infinitesimal time as she turned aside to pick up her fan which had dropped and as she met his eye again she felt that divine discontent which so vastly transcended in her opinion all other happiness and it appeared that he too was in tune with that come out my darling he said lets get away from these people just for a bit a five minutes i dont want any more music even though it was more bach and i dont want any supper do you theyre going to have supper now up went his head with that little unconscious toss of the chin and dora half laughed to hear how at this moment he seemed to put bach and supper on quite the same level when there was the prospect of strolling with her outside there was intense sweetness to her in that and there was mastery also which she loved she felt that even if she had not cared for him and even if she was particularly hungry she would have to go with him but as she rose she could not help commenting on this wanting womanlike to hear the reply that her heart had already shouted to her you speak as if bach and supper were equally unimportant she said of course theres not a pin to choose between them if youll just come out with me and if i wont but you will he said not even please he shook his head anything sooner than please he said come or not just as you like to dora this was tremendously attractive the absolute refusal to ask anything of her as a favour even when he so intensely wanted it was a revelation of the eternal masculine not opposed to but in accord with the eternal feminine nothing seemed to her more fantastic and sickly than the sort of devotion that begged for a flower and sighed and pined under a womans unkindness or caprice here is my heart he had in effect said to her take it or leave it but if you take it give me yours man gave and was not woman to give too in her own kind she too longed to come out into the warm halfdarkness of the stars with him and why in common fairness should he be supposed to sue for a favour that which she longed to grant so out they went on to the dimpaved terrace walk above the sky was clear and the stardust strewn thick over the floor of the heaven and the fantastic shape of the birds on the yew hedge stood clear out against the luminous and velvet blue a little draught of flowerscented air stole up through the square doorways in the hedge from the drowsy beds that but dreamed of their daylight fragrance and somewhere not far away in the park a night jar throbbed its bourdon note making vibration rather than sound dora put her hand through his arm and laughed i laugh for pure happiness she said andand oh claude its the real me who is with you now do you understand i expect not so i will explain there are several mes you rather liked no which was the chattering and extremely amusing me that was the one you saw first and you did like her thenoh well the other mes are all varieties of that and right below them all is the real me it doesnt know sometimes whether it wants to laugh or cry or to talk or be silent it only wants oh its like you with bach and supper about equal laughing and crying dont particularly matter if there is you just as to you bach and supper didnt matter if there was me and there is its me as the children say and you and i make us it comes in the grammars i only wanted to tell you that and now well instantly talk about something else claude stopped and against the faint luminance of the sky she saw his chin protrude itself i dont see any reason for doing that he said its much the most interesting thing i know he drew her toward him well you might give a fellow a kiss he said chapter iv the morning delicacy to which lady austell was so subject was due to the fact that when staying in other peoples houses she found she saw enough of her hosts and fellowguests if she denied herself the pleasure of their company at breakfast in all other respects she was stronger than most horses and could go through programmes which would have prostrated all but the most robust without any feeling of unpleasant fatigue provided only that the programmes interested or amused her or in any way furthered her plans but she really became tired the moment she was bored and since sitting at breakfast with ten or twelve cheerful people with the crude morning sunlight perhaps pouring in at a window directly opposite her bored her very much she chose the wiser plan of not joining in those public festivities but with her excellent tact she knew that at a house like mrs osbornes everybody was expected to come down to be in admirable spirits and to eat a great deal of solid food and so she explained to mrs osborne that she never ate any breakfast hence it was that about halfpast nine next morning her maid carried upstairs a tray groaning with coffee hot milk toast just one poached egg and a delicious plate of fruit mrs osborne had given her a very pleasant sitting room next her bedroom furnished with messrs linkwaters no white boudoir suite for like half the house it had been practically unfurnished and austell who had ascertained those comfortable facts when he bade his mother goodnight the evening before caused this particular groaning tray to be brought here also and paddled in to join her in carpet slippers and a dressing gown i call this a devilish comfortable house nowadays he observed which is far more than could be said for it in our time what a pity the osbornes and we cant run it together they would pay the bills and we could give tone i wish it was possible to be comfortable though poor but it isnt everything comfortable costs so much now darling mother let loose and tell me what you think of it all really youryour absence of breakfast looks quite delicious they have given me chops and beef and things may i have a piece of your melon jim and his mother were rather fond of each other but they seldom met without having a quarrel for while both were agreed in the general plan of grabbing at whatever of this worlds goods could be appropriated each despised and in private exposed the methods of the other he so his mother was afraid was one of the very few people who was not afraid of her and she often wished he was he had lit a cigarette after the bath and was standing in front of the fireplace on the thick white sheepskin rug smoking the end of it dear jim she said do you think you had better smoke in here mrs osborne may not like it oh she will think it is you said jim calmly and so wont dare to say anything she fears you i cant think why now do tell me how it all strikes you can you bear it for three days i can easily i could bear it for months and years it is so comfortable now what did you and mrs osborne talk about at dinner mr o and i talked about the royal family sir thomas seems a nice man doesnt he lady austell gave him a very generous share of her half melon it looked rather like a bribe she was going to indulge in what jim called humbug and hoped he would let it pass i think dear as i said to dora the other day she remarked that we are far too apt to judge by the surface we do not take enough account of the real and sterling virtueshonesty kindness hospitality austell cracked his egg i did not take enough account of the effect of hospitality last night he remarked because i ate too much supper and felt uncommonly queer when i awoke this morning you always were rather greedy my darling said lady austell softly scoring one i know i suppose i inherited it from my delii mean cerebralhmorrhage grandfather but i dont drink this brought them about level jim proceeded with a smart and telling stroke i refer mymy failures to my grandfather he said so whatever you say about our hosts dear mother i shall consider that you are only speaking of their previous generations their hospitality is unbounded their kindness prodigious but i asked you how long you could stand it or perhaps thethe polish the culture the breeding of our hosts really does seem to you beyond question did you see the stuffed crocodilelizard in the hall i will give you one for your birthday i think you are odiously ungrateful jim she said i have got them to take grote for seven years at a really unheardof price and all i get in return is this jim opened his pale weak eyes very wide what have i done he said i have only agreed with you about their kindness and asked your opinion about their breeding you are sarcastic and backbiting said his mother only as long as you talk such dreadful nonsense darling mother he said you dont indulge in rhapsodies about the honesty of your housemaid honesty in a housemaid is a far finer quality than in a millionaire because millionaires are not tempted to be dishonest whereas poor people like housemaids or you and me are really i only wanted to have a pleasant little chat about the osbornes only you will make it serious serious and insincere lets be natural ill begin he took one of his mothers crisp hot rolls and buttered it heavily i find mr and mrs o quite delightful he said and should have told you so long ago if you had only been frank i do really there isnt one particle of humbug about them and they have the perfect ease and naturalness of good breeding lady austell tossed her head that word again she said you seem to judge everybody by the standard of a certain superficial veneer which you call breeding i know one cant help it i grant you that lots of wellbred people are rude and greedy but there is a certain way of being rude and greedy which is all right im greedy so was the cerebral grandpapa only he was a gentleman and so am i im rude i dont get up when you come into the room and open the door for you and shut the window claudebrother claudedoes all these things and yet hes a cad i consider claude a perfect gentleman said lady austell with finality i know that perfect spoils it all said jim meditatively now mr osborne is a frank cadthats how i put itand claude a subtle one thats why i cant stand him i daresay youll do your best to live on him said lady austell certainly though i shall probably succeed without doing my best it will be quite easy i expect and do you think that is a gentlemanly thing to do asked his mother when behind his back you call him a subtle cad oh yes quite though no perfect gentleman would dream of doing it i think claude has masses of good points he simply bristles with them but he gives one such shocks he goes on swimmingly for a time and then suddenly says that somebody is noble looking or that the carpet is tasteful or superior now mr osborne doesnt give one shocks you know what to expect and you get it all the time lady austell thought this over for a moment though austell was quite unsatisfactory in almost all ways of life it was impossible to regard him as a fool and he had the most amazing way of being right certainly this view of the frank cad and the subtle cad had an air of intense probability about it but it was one of those things which his mother habitually chose to ignore and if necessary deny the existence of i hope you will not say any of those ridiculous things to dora she remarked ah then it is just because they are not ridiculous that you wish me to leave them unsaid if they were ridiculous you would not mind jim waited a second to give his mother time to contradict this if she felt disposed apparently she did not and he interrupted her consenting silence i shall not say them to dora i promise you he said because in case they had not occurred to her she might see the truth of them and it might put her off that would damage my chances of living on him it would be very foolish of me besides i have no quarrel with dorai like dora but my saying these things to her is superfluous i am afraid she sees them all perfectly though to you they apparently seem ridiculous or am i wrong mother and do you only pretend to think them ridiculous lady austell felt she could fight a little on this ground they seem to me quite ridiculous in so far as they apply to dora she said she is deeply in love with him dear child and do you suppose that she stops to consider whether he says tasteful or not jim smiled with faint malice no she does not stop to consider whether he says it or not he replied because it is perfectly clear that he does but when he does she pauses not for long but just for a second she doesnt exactly wince not a whole wince at least but just a little bit of one you cant help it if you are not accustomed to it if i was going to marry mrs osborne i should wince a little now and then i dont in the least wonder that shes in love with him i wish you would find me a girl who would marry me as handsome and rich as claude the only thing is jim finished breakfast and was going slowly round the room looking at the furniture he paused in front of a saddlebagged divan with his head on one side the only thing is that though she may get accustomed to tasteful she may also get accustomed to his extraordinary good looks of course then theres the money to fall back upon i dont think i should ever get accustomed to so much what isis uncle alfred going to allow him on his marriage fifteen thousand a year i believe said lady austell gently as if mentioning some departed friend jim gave a little sigh in the same style he had a dreadfully inconvenient memory and remembered that the original sum suggested was twelve thousand which his mother had thought decent but not creditable there was no doubt so he framed the transaction to himself that she had screwed this up to fifteen so he sighed appreciatively and his comment that followed was of the nature of a testimonial when i marry i shall leave the question of settlements completely in your hands if you will allow me he said i think you are too clever for anybody it was not once or twice but many times that lady austell had told her son the complete truth in answer to some question of his and when she had said fifteen thousand i believe it was only reasonable to expect that the answer would be satisfactory but jim always remembered something else and his memory was terribly good it was not that he considered twelve thousand a poor sum he only recalled to his mothers mind the fact that she had successfully suggested fifteen and he had not openly stated the fact he had merely requested her kindly aid with regard to his own marriage settlements if there were ever to be any that should have been to her a completely gratifying request as it was it left her with the sense of having been found out the complete correctness of this impression was shown by austells next words i think you have been fearfully brilliant about it he said and i am sure you have made them all think that you considered fifteen thousand far too much do tell me didnt you say that you thought it was a great responsibility for so young a couple to beto be stewards of so much wealth lord how i wish somebody would make me a steward come in somebody had tapped at the door and to tell the truth lady austell was not very sorry to have an interruption for she had actually used the words that jim had conjectured in a little talk with mr osborne and his brother in which settlements were very genteelly and distantly alluded to but there had been a distinct twinkle in alfreds eye at this point and she did not want more crossexaminations the interruption therefore was welcome mrs osborne entered looking hot and pleased jim at this moment was looking at a large engraving of landseers monarch of the glen part of the no white boudoir set in an angle of the room parallel to the door and she did not at once see him good morning lady austell she said i thought i would just step up and see what you would fancy doing this beautiful day theres some of the party going to motor over to pevensey mrs osborne caught sight of jim and gave a faint scream and im sure if i dont beg your pardon lord austell she said with averted head for i never guessed you were here paying a morning visit to your mamma in your bath wrapper but i thought somebody said come in for i always tap at every door now or clear my throat to give warning with so many lovers about bless them yes i said come in said austell maynt i come and talk to you and my mother i thought my dressingbath wrapper was rather smart it was rather being of blue silk new and unpaid for and with mrs osbornes permission he joined them it had given her quite a turn for a moment to find that she had intruded on an earl in his dressing gown but she rapidly recovered why its beautiful she said and such a figure as mr o is in his old green padded wrapper as hardly comes to his knees it was the thought of that that gave me such a turn at finding a gentleman in his dressing gown but im sure i neednt have minded and what will you be thinking of doing lord austell its liberty hall as mr o and i always tell our guests and the more they say what they like to do the better were pleased lady austell had lit a cigarette just before mrs osbornes entrance and still looking at her with her usual bereaved regretful smile was making efforts to pass it to jim behind the shelter of the table he observed this and with a stealthy movement took it from her for though they exposed each other in private they were firm allies in the presence of others ive been having such a scolding from my mother he said for smoking in here but i told her you were far too goodnatured to mind have i done very wrong mrs osborne beamed and me just saying that the more our guests pleased themselves the better we were pleased she exclaimed well what is it to be lady austell a drive to pevensey with sir thomas and mrs percy and im sure therell be no difficulty about getting another gentleman when its known as you are going or a stroll or whatnot and a bit of lunch quietly at home and maybe a drive afterward give it a name lady austell and its settled lady austell turned one glance of gratitude at her son and continued to smile at her hostess you are too kind she said but as ive just been telling austell what i should really like to do best would be to spend the morning quietly by myself going over the dear old place again and then may we see how the afternoon turns out this pathetic mention of the dear old place though dilapidated old barrack would have been a far more accurate description of grote as it was made mrs osborne feel quite apologetic she spoke to her husband about it afterwards i assure you my dear she said to see her sitting there with that sad smile it was quite touching as if it ought to have been she who asked me what i would fancy doing well its one up and another down in this world and after all weve done something in taking the place off their hands and putting a stick or two of furniture in it and keeping the rain out and the white boudoir suite it looks beautiful i hadnt seen it since they put it in well im sure the oftener lady a favours us with her visits the more we shall be pleased said mr osborne and we give them a rattling good rent for it my dear when alls said and done why theres the motor coming round now and the clock striking twelve already sir thomas would like a glass of sherry ill be bound before his long drive and i must see cook said mrs osborne and half the morning gone already have you any fancy for dinner tonight my dear mr osborne thought for a moment no peace and plenty my dear he said such as weve always had maria i shall be in for lunch too thank god old claude doesnt want any music tonight we was hurried away from table last night and i think sir thomas felt he hadnt done justice to my port maria and needs a lot of justice but tonight he shall have his skin full well but claude has said as how pleased dora was with the music said mrs osborne and were going to have a second go this evening you cant deny them their music mr o mr osborne paused on his way to the door nor i dont want to he said though myself i hate that scratching sound but last night mrs o i dont mind telling you what with youngyoung franklin lighting up before wed got into the wine at all and claude and he leaving the room to join the ladies and im sure i dont wonder the dining room was a sort of clapham junction and you telling me not to stop too long there and all tonight give us time to sit and think and if claude wants his concert god bless the boy let him have it but let it be made clear that those who want their wine and a talk sit and have it and dont feel theyre expected its little i drink myself as well you know but theres sir thomas whos a fish for his liquor and little harm it seems to do him i like my guests to have what they want maria and theres no reason why some of us shouldnt stay quiet and pass the bottle while others listen to them fiddles thats the way weve got on old lady by giving everybody what they want and of the best quality well lets do so still those that care to leave the table this evening let them leave but dont let there be any pressure on such as like to remain lord if theres mrs per not coming out already with all her fallals on i must go and get sir thomas his glass of sherry mr osborne was in every way the most hospitable of men and he would have felt it as a personal disgrace if as never happened any guest of his had not all the wine he wanted even as he would have felt it a personal disgrace if any guest was not met at the station or did not have sufficient breakfast but wine to his mind was something of quite a different class to all other hospitalities and was under his personal control so that if sir thomas liked his drop of sherry in the middle of the morning mr osborne if the sherry decanter as proved to be the case this morning was empty had personally to go down to the cellar followed by thoresby with a taper and fish out from the bin the bottle he wanted moreover as the motoring party had finished breakfast nearly two hours ago and would not get their lunch for nearly two hours after mrs osborne had ordered a tray of the more sustaining sorts of sandwiches a cold ham and a dish or two of fruit to be put ready in the diningroom to fortify them for their drive for when they did have lunch it would only be a cold picnic kind of lunch which they carried with them in a huge wicker basket like a coffin which two of the resplendent footmen were even now staggering under and bearing out to the motor for the sake of good fellowship several of the party who were not going on this prodigious expedition joined the travellers in this collation for as mr osborne said with a large plate of ham in front of him it made a bit of a break in the morning to have a mouthful of sherry and a dry biscuit help yourself per my boy for youre the guard of this personally conducted tour and youll need a bite of something before you get your lunch jim austell meantime had gone back to his room from which he ejected two flurried housemaids who were emptying things into each other and dressed in a leisurely manner he found a letter or two on his dressing table and among them a note from mr osbornes secretary containing an extremely satisfactory cheque for the first quarters rent of grote and with great promptitude he despatched it to his bank then coming downstairs and out on to the terrace he found claude rather impatiently waiting for the return of dora who had strayed off after breakfast with may thurston and challenged him to a game of croquet in which the two were still engaged when the girls came back from their walk they refused to join and may went into the house while dora drew a chair to the edge of the ground and watched jim wallowing in the remembrance of his cheque had proposed a sovereign on the game and claude had accepted the game therefore since money was concerned was serious but dora not knowing this was not she had a great deal to say i think englishmen are perfect butchers she said the whole of the long glade is simply one mass of the most heavenly young pheasants who ran to us in flocks to be fed then comes october and when they run to be fed you shoot them in the eye there youre wrong dora said jim calmly taking aim you shoot at running rabbits but not oh well you know what i mean and you call it sport there that serves you right jim now its claudes turn and hes got you oh claude what a beautiful shot wasnt it lucky it hit the wire first if it hadnt it would have missed blue altogether claude did not reply even though it was dora who was talking the fact that at the present moment he was playing a game overrode all other considerations he would have much preferred to stop playing the game and talk to her instead but since that was impossible he continued to be entirely absorbed in what he was doing the balls after the beautiful shot were well placed for a break but a little consideration was necessary then a somewhat lengthy and faultless exhibition followed at the end he came and sat down on the grass by dora not a bad break he said i shall have a cigarette what are we going to do after lunch asked she gently as jim walked off to the far end of the ground just exactly whatever you like so long as we do it by ourselves i havent seen you all morning i know its been beastly said she but mays a dear you know and she wanted to talk about harry and i rather wanted to talk about you so we both talked together and i cant remember a word she said claude was lying face downward on the grass nursing his match and dora was looking at the short hair on the back of his neck then quickly and suddenly she looked up oh jim you cheated she cried i saw you move that ball with your foot what a brute he is he always cheats at croquet and is always found out i dont cheat i only lose my temper claude dear keep an eye on him or perhaps you cheat too do you oh what a heavenly day do lets go on the lake after youve finished your game you shall row and steer and i shall encourage you dora passed over the fact of jims cheating as she passed over the other numerous topics of her conversation things to be alluded to and left behind and claude sitting up again when he had got a light made no comment whatever to it jim continued to play calmly and correctly and at the end of his break came toward them leaving an unpromising position you talk more rot in a short space of time than anyone i ever saw he remarked what with shooting at running pheasants and saying i cheat you make my head whirl oh but you did i saw you said dora calmly why not grant it she paused a moment as claude aimed and then continued oh claude what bad luck or did it hit it i almost thought i saw it tremble and in a minute i shall be sure of it i thought it hit said jim no im sure it didnt said claude full inch between them the game was over in a couple of turns after this but dora finding it hot on her grassy bank had gone down to sit in the boat and wait for claude at the conclusion of the game he produced a sovereign and handed it to jim you gave me a good thrashing he said couldnt get in but that once thanks yes you had bad luck all through i say youre satisfied that dora was talking nonsense about what when she said i cheated of course i did nothing of the kind why of course im satisfied if you tell me so said claude are you coming down to the lake not i dora would hurl me overboard claude strolled away and jim walked aimlessly about taking shots across the lawn with various balls he knew perfectly well that he had cheated but it was the worst luck in the world that dora had looked up that moment there had been a ball quite close to his but as far off as if it had been in a better world by reason of the fact that it was lying neatly and inaccessibly behind the stump he had just moved it with his foot as he went by without so he told himself more than half meaning to that was quite characteristic of him he but rarely fully meant that sort of thing something external to himself seemed to suggest a paltry little manuvre of this kind and he yielded to it in an absentminded sort of way without any particular intention had the game in fact gone on without attention being called to it he would probably have nearly forgotten about it by now but claudes remark though innocent and even cordial considering what he himself privately knew irritated him a good deal he had said that of course he was satisfied since jim had told him so that looked as if he would not have been satisfied if he had not been told an utterly unjustifiable attitude since he had never given claude so far as he knew the very smallest grounds for supposing that he himself was capable of cheating at croquet or anything else perhaps in sheffield it was the right thing to cheat and at the end of the game everyone who had not cheated told his opponent so who then kindly accepted his word claude would find however that among the sort of people he now moved it wasnt correct to cheat in fact it was distinctly advisable not to indeed in a very few minutes jim felt rather as if claude had cheated and he was himself kind but a little troubled about it thenhe felt almost ashamed of himself for dwelling so long on so small an incidenthe looked at the matter afresh he had cheated and pocketed a sovereign probably in consequence that was a very small sum of money to cheat for but he distinctly wished that it had not occurred and then he threw down again the mallet he had taken up fact is im a rotten chap he said to himself and there was no dissentient voice in his brain claude meantime had gone down to the lake after dora if he had been obliged to give his thoughts the definiteness of words he would certainly have said that he thought the whole thing rather odd but then being of an extremely loyal unsuspicious nature he would have endorsed his remark to jim that his word was quite sufficient and have turned his thoughts resolutely elsewhere he did not want to think about such very nasty little things as cheating at croquet whether there was a penny or a sovereign or nothing at all on the game and he did not wish to examine a certain doubt that lurked in the bottom of his mind as to whether dora had seen correctly or not it was in the shade anyhow and he let it lie there but if anyone had told him or jim either that the incident was a trifling and microscopic one both would have been quite right to deny that it was true that a game only and a sovereign were concerned but the directing power no less important a personage than honour it really makes a great difference in the daily journey through life if that charioteer is at his post or not sorry for keeping you darling he said to dora but we had to finish the game it didnt take long did it i got my head knocked off dora had already established herself and he pushed out through the shallow water where the weeds trailed whispering fingers against the bottom of the boat to deeper water how clever of you to screw it on again so quick said she yes its quite straight oh claude ive been thinking such a lot since i left you how funny it is how little tiny things like jims cheating just now suggest such a lot of other ones not at all tiny claude gave a little short uncomfortable laugh i say darling do you know he said if i were you i shouldnt say that sort of thing even to me he didnt cheat he told me so so you must have been mistaken and its an awful pity to let things like that ever be talked about but lets go on to the big things which it though it didnt happen suggested dora paid no attention whatever to these excellent moral reflections but merely waited with her mouth open till he had finished in order to speak again oh but he did he did she cried i saw him with both eyes we never could play together because he always cheated and i always lost my temper how funny of him not to confess claude did not reply for the moment it was all rather uncomfortable well now for the big things he said oh bother the big things said dora i know you think i am wrong and im not im never wrong im perfectly certain she stopped suddenly and leaned over the side of the boat dabbling her hand in the water she saw some unuttered trouble in claudes face and a rather dreadful conjecture occurred to her claude you werent playing for money were you she asked in a low voice he made up his mind in a moment and acted with promptitude good gracious no he said what will you be suggesting next but dora was still grave oh i am glad she said with relief and do lets talk about something else i daresay i was quite wrong about jim moving that ball oh i know i wasnt she cried it was only a game you see and there was nothing on it and oh poor jim you see he always used to cheat it was just the same at billiards if the balls were touching he used to go on before he really looked to see if they were and that leads on to the big things he had stopped rowing and with the impetus which the boat had acquired in those vigorous strokes he made to get clear of the weeds they were drifting toward the little island in the centre of the lake where the swans made their nests it was rimmed about with softbranched willows that trailed yielding boughs toward the water and the boat glided in under their drooping fingers and ran on to a soft sandy promontory where it beached its bows while the enfolding willow gave shade yes the big things said dora its just this darling youve got heaps of attractions but im not sure that one of your nicest things isnt that you are so safe it is such fun being able to trust a person quite completely and entirely and know one was right in doing so i dont believe you ever scheme or make plans mother does and jim does and people get so keen on their plan that other things get rather out of focus they gooh its like hounds when they are really running well they dont look at the scenery you know they put their dear noses down and follow follow and its all because of moneyno not the hounds dont be so foolishbut it is an advantage not to want to bother about money i do like to know that i neednt bother any more at all and that if i want to take a cab i can somebodypierre loti i thinksaid it must be exquisite to be poor well it isnt its far more exquisite to be rich of course i had great fun about trimming a hat for twopence and making it look as if it came from mays shopbiondonetti isnt it but really i should much prefer to order hats direct wouldnt you claude happened to be hatless but he passed his hand over his head instead as if to recapture the sensation of ordering hats i suppose i order mine he said im sure i never made one i shouldnt know how to set about it no darling you dont wear two feathersandnothing else a hat of two feathers is fearfully smart are these the big things you proposed to talk about asked claude no as if hats mattered oh claude youre moulting a short black hair and theres another sticking out may i pull he bent his head a little down she pulled and he screamed the hair remained where it was and is that a big thing asked he again no donkey darling donkey you will interrupt so about hats as if anybody cared where you got your hats and you havent got one how did you lead the conversation round to hats lets see it was austell first and then then oh yes i said you were safe and now i think ill go on you may sit down here if you like theres room for us both lets be common as may said aboutabout people like us the other day i would change hats with you if you had one as it is dora pulled the thick black curls oh i wish you had a wig she said and nobody knew but me i shouldnt mind and everybody would say what beautiful hair you had and i should know it wasnt real and shouldnt tell it would be such fun then some day you would annoy me and i should tell everybody it was only a wig claude when i am old and wrinkly and quite quite ugly do you suppose you will care the least little bit any more for me oh dear i felt so extraordinarily gay all the morning and now ive gone sad all in a minute oh do comfort me there is such a lot of graybusiness in life unless one dies quite young which it would immensely annoy me to do i wonder how we shall stand the graybusiness you and i when we see each other getting older and more wrinkled and stiffer stiffer not only in limb and that is bad enough but stiffer in mind which is infinitely worse no dont look at me like that but sit up and be sensible it has got to be faced unconsciously or at the most half consciously she was sounding him she knew quite well that there were beautiful things to be said and said truly about what she had called the graybusiness of life and she wondered longing that it might be so whether there was within him that divine alchemy which could see how the gray could be changed into gold never had she felt his physical charm so potent as now when he sat up obedient to her orders and leaned forward toward her with a look a little puzzled a little baffled in his eyes almost she was tempted to say to him oh it doesnt matter nothing matters beside this exquisite day and you you as i know you already but some very deeplying vein of curiosity wholly feminine and very largely loving made her not interrupt her own question but wait with just a touch of anxiety for his reply she and claude she felt would have some day to be far more intimately known by each other than they were now of him she knew little but his personal beauty though she felt sure that as she had said to may he was good and as she had said to him that he was safe and of her she guessed that he knew no more that he loved her she had no doubt but she felt that she had shown him as yet but little beyond that which all the world saw her quick and eager attitude toward life the iridescent moods of her effervescent nature there was something that sat below these her real self she wanted claude to know that even as she wanted to know his real self this was all vague to her though real instinctive rather than describable and flashed but momentarily through her mind as she waited for his reply but that reply came at once claude seemed to find no difficulty about the facing of the graybusiness theres no cause to worry he said just look at dad and the mater isnt he in love with her still and i expect what you call the graybusiness for a woman cannot begin while her husband loves her i dont suppose either of them ever gave a look so to say at anybody else think of the way he proposed her health last night not much graybusiness about that why it was as if she was his best girl still and that hed just come acourting her instead of their having been married over thirty years and she is his best girl still just as you will ever be mine and as for her why hes her man still hows that for the graybusiness dora felt one dreadful moments inclination to laugh she had asked for a sign that he could turn the gray into gold and for reply she got the assurance that she might put her mind at rest with the thought of what mr and mrs osborne were to each other she knew that for that moment she only saw the ludicrous side of it and that a very real and solid truth was firm below it but somehow it was not what she wanted she wanted she hardly knew what but something of the spirit of romance that triumphantly refuses to acquiesce in the literal facts of life and see all things through the manycoloured blaze of its own light she wanted the graybusiness laughed at she wanted the assurance that she could never grow old given with a lovers superb conviction to be received with the unquestioning credulity of a child no doubt it ought to have been very comforting to think that the years would leave with them the very warm and comfortable affection which the father and mother had for each other and she ought to be glad that claude felt so sure of that but to her mind there was about as much romance in it as in a suet pudding he saw the eagerness die from her face and the shadow of her disappointment cross it and what is it now dear he asked dora tossed her head back a trick she had caught from him it isnt anything now she said it all concerns years that are centuries away i think it was foolish of me to ask at all i dont think it was in the least said he you said it had to be faced and i think ive given it a facer at least the example of the governor and the mater has besides there are other things that will colour up the graymatter children we hope sons going to school and daughters growing up again dora knew that he spoke with excellent sense but again she felt that it was not sense she wanted so much as lovers nonsense which is more essentially real than any sense she wanted something airy romantic golden and then she looked at him again and her wants faded from her he brought her himself she gave a little sigh and raised herself till her face was on a level with his o claude i should be a donkey if i was not content she said lord thered be a pair of us then if i wasnt said he sunday succeeded and breakfast in consequence was put an hour earlier so that any servant in the house could go to church mr osborne himself though the day was already of scorching heat came down in a black frockcoat suit of broadcloth and his wife rustled in black satin it was clearly expected that all their guests would go also for at halfpast ten a stream of vehicles drove to the door past the window of the smokingroom got to start early said he so that the men may put up the cattle and come too but theres no call for you gentlemen to put out your cigars the ladies wont mind a whiff of tobacco in the open air sir thomas and the church is but a step outside the park gates so that you can sit and finish there there are the ladies assembling time to go never keep the fair sex waiting hey or else the most indulgent of them will turn a cold shoulder the church as mr osborne had said was but a stones throw beyond the park gates and as they all arrived at twenty minutes to eleven there was time before the groaning of the organ summoned them in to have a turn under the trees and finish the cigars that had barely been begun it had been so taken for granted that everybody was coming to church that out of all the party there was only one absentee namely austell to whose room mr osborne had sent with inquiries if he was ready and the suggestion to send back the motor for him if he was not but he certainly was not ready and the motor had not gone back for him since he had said that he was not very well otherwise the whole of the party were there and by degrees strayed into church mrs osborne had gone there at once from the carriage with lady austell in order to escape from the heat and they were already seated in the big square family pew which belonged to the house when the others began to come in sir thomas and mr osborne were the last because they had been discussing the recent rise in the price of tin up till the last moment they entered indeed so shortly before the procession of four choir boys two men and the vicar that mr osborne had barely time to sit down by his wife in the place she always kept for him next her in church after standing up and putting his face in his hat before he had to stand up again sir thomas sat next lady austell the two looked rather like a codfish in conjunction with a withered lily the pew was foursided the fourth side opening into the body of the church through the easternmost of the arches of the south aisle in the centre of it was a very beautiful alabaster monument to the first earl and his wife while the window was of exquisite early german glass to the memory of the second elsewhere in numbers round the walls were other smaller tablets some bearing medallions others merely catalogues of the cardinal virtues with which the deceased were blessed but the whole place was historical established and here this morning sat mr osborne and his family and friends among whom were lady austell and her daughter who was going to join together the two families she sat just opposite claude and of them all he alone to the most observant eye was ambiguous he might as well so far as appearance went have been of the austells as of the osbornes dora it was to be feared was not very attentive and her face wore that peculiarly rapt look which as may thurston had once told her was a certain indication that she was not thinking about what was going on as far as the service of the church went that was true she was completely occupied with the occupants of the pew the sermon was in progress and her mother sat with eyes mournfully fixed on the elizabethan monument in the centre just as if the first earl had been her husband while next her sir thomas had his eyes fixed on nothing at all for they were tightly closed his wife next to him and round the corner made futile little attempts to rouse him to consciousness again by pretending to put her parasol in a more convenient place so that it should incidentally hit his foot this eventually she succeeded in doing and he opened one eye and rolled it drowsily and reproachfully at lady austell as if she had interrupted some celestial reverie then he closed it again claude as dora felt had observed this and was looking at her so she passed over him for fear of catching his eye and went on to uncle alfred who sat next him he was closely wrapped up in a shawl that went over his shoulders and a certain stealthy movement of his lower jaw caused her to suspect that he was eating some sort of lozenge then came mrs osborne dora could hear her rather tight satin bodice creak to her breathing she had the bible in which she had verified the text open in her lap and she was listening intently to the sermon which was clearly to her mind for her plump pleasant face was smiling and her eyes fixed on the preacher were a little dim her smile was clearly one of those smiles of very simple happiness which are allied to tenderness and tears and then dora focussed her ear and heard what was being said so this earthly love of ours said the preacher is of the same immortal quality years do not dim it it seems but to grow stronger and brighter as the mere purely physical part of it and then doras eye was focussed again by a movement on the part of mrs osborne and her ear lost the rest of the sentence mrs osborne gave a great sigh and her dress a great creak and simultaneously she took away the hand that was supporting the bible in which she had verified the text so that it slid off the short and steeply inclined plane between her body and her knee and fell face downward on the floor she did not heed this she laid her hand making kaleidoscopic colours in her rings as she moved it on the hand of her husband who sat next her he too had been following the sermon with evident pleasure and it was hard to say to which of them the movement came first for within the same fraction of a second his hand also let fall the silk hat which he had already gathered up in anticipation of the conclusion and in the same instant of time it was seeking hers his head turned also to her as hers to him and a whispered word passed between them then they smiled each to the other and the second whisper was audible right across the monument of francis first earl to dora where she sat opposite to them maria my dear whispered mr osborne if that isnt nice then mrs osbornes belated consciousness awoke she withdrew her hand and picked up her bible mr osbornes instinct in taking up his hat had been quite correct the doxology followed and a hymn was given out he and his wife so it was clear to dora had no consciousness except for each other and the hymn she was the first to find it in her hymnbook while he still fumbled with his glasses and when they all stood up he shared the book with her and put down his own then the organ indicated the first lines of the tune and again the two smiled at each other for it was a favourite as it had been sung at the service for the dedication of the church in sheffield they both remembered that but that did not wholly account for their pleasure it had been a favourite long before mrs osborne sang what is commonly called second that is to say she made sounds about a third below the air mr osborne sang bass that is to say he sang the air an octave or thereabouts below the treble they both sang very loudly so also did percy so also did mrs per who sang a real alto and then without reason doras eyes grew suddenly dim in the last verse mrs osborne closed the large giltedged hymnbook with tunes and looked at her husband he moistened his lips as the last verse began and coughed once then mrs osbornes rings again caught the light as she sought her husbands hand and she started fortissimo a shade before anybody else and so through all the length of days mr osborne did not sing his fat fingers closed on his wifes rings and he listened to her he would not have listened then to melba he would not have been so completely absorbed if the seraphim had sung to him and then finally dora looked at claude she thought she understood a little more but she only saw a little more chapter v it was about two of the afternoon in the last week of may and this sudden heat wave which had spread southward over europe had reached venice making it more than ever a place to dream and be still in and less than ever a place to see sights in so at any rate thought its foreign visitors for the grand canal even and the more populous of the waterways were empty of pleasureseeking and churchinspecting traffic and but little even of the mercantile or more necessary sort was on the move here and there a barge laden with coke and wood fuel was being punted heavily upstream clinging as far as might be to the side of the canal where it would feel less of the tide that was strongly setting seaward or here another carrying the stackedup furniture of some migratory household passed down midstream so as to get the full aid and current of the tide avoided by the other but apart from such traffic and the passage of the gray halfempty steamers that churned and troubled the water at regular intervals sending the wash of their slanting waves against the walls of the white palaces and making the moored and untenanted gondolas slap the water with sudden hollow complaints and grind their sides uneasily against the restraining pali there was but little stir of movement or passage no lounger hung about on the steps of the iron bridge and the sellers of fruit picture postcards and tobacco had taken their wares into the narrow strip of shade to the north of the accademia and waited unexpectant of business till the cool of the later hours should bring the forestieri into the street again even the native population shunned the glare of the sun and preferred if it was necessary to go from one place to another to seek the deep shadows of the narrow footways rather than face the heat and glare of the canals and the boatmen in charge of the public ferries had moored their craft in the shade if possible or with heads sheltered beneath their discarded coats passed the long siestahour with but little fear of interruption or call on their services the domes and towers of the town glittered jewellike against the deep blue of the sky and their outlines trembled in the quiver of the reverberating air on the north side of the grand canal the southwardfacing houses dozed behind lattices closed to keep out the glare and the heat and the air was still and noiseless but for the staccato chiding of the swallows which pursued their swift and curving ways with nothing of their speed abated over the horizon hung a purplish haze of heat so that the edge of the sea melted indistinguishably into the sky and alps and euganean hills alike were invisible dora had lunched alone today for claude had gone to milan to meet his father and mother who were coming out for a fortnight and would arrive this evening and at the present moment she was looking out from the window of her sala on to the lower stretch of the grand canal which as her intimacy with it deepened seemed ever to grow more inexplicably beautiful the flat which they occupied was on the south side of the canal and though no doubt it would have left the room cooler to have closed all inlet of the baked air she preferred to have the windows open and lean out to command a larger view of the beloved waterway deep into her heart had the magic of the city of waters entered a thing incomparable and incommunicable she only knew that when she was away from venice the thought of it caused her to draw long breaths which hung fluttering in her throat that when she was in it her eyes were never satisfied with gazing or herself with being soaked in it she loved what was splendid in it and what was sordid what was small and what was great its sunshine its shadows its moonlight the pleasant italian folk and whether she sat in the jewelled gloom of st marks or shot out with the call of her gondolier from some dark waterway into the blaze of ivory moonlight on the grand canal below the rialto or whether the odour of roasting coffee or the frying of fish came to her as she passed some little caffe ristorante in the maze of mean streets that lie off the merceria or whether she lay floating at ease in the warm sustaining water of the lido or watched in the church of st georgio the mystic wreaths of spirits and archangels assembled round the table of the last supper peopling the beamed ceiling of the upper chamber and mingling mistlike in the smoke of the lamp with which it was litshe knew that it was venice the fact of venice that lay like a gold thread through these magical hours binding them together a circle of perfect pearls two threads indeed ran through them all they were doubly strong for it was in venice last autumn that she and claude had passed three weeks of honeymoon and with the glory of the place was mingled the glory of her lover it was that perhaps that gave to details and such sights and sounds as were not remarkable in themselves their ineffaceable character it was because she and claude had wandered pleased to find themselves momentarily lost in the higheaved labyrinths of narrow streets that the dingy little interiors the trattorias with their smell of spilt wine and their vineleafstoppered bottles their sharp savour of cooking and sawdustsprinkled floors were things apart from anything that could be seen or perceived in any other town in the world a spire of valerian sprouted from mouldering brickwork the reflection of a marble lions head on snowwhite cornice quivered in the graygreen water below little sidewayscuttling crabs bustled over the gray mud of the lagoons bent on private and oblique errands of their own seagulls hovered at the edge of the retiring water graystemmed pali with black heads leaned together marking the devious course of deepdug channels there came a cry of stali and a gondola with higharching neck some beautiful black swan shot out of a canal by the bridge where they lingered and these sights and sounds trivial in themselves were stamped in her mind with the royal mintmark that belonged to those weeks when she and claude were in venice after their marriage her emotion had streamed from her soaking them with it they were part of venice part of herself and so wholly hers some seal had been set on those things then that could never be melted out it was claude who had set it there and he had so imprinted that seal upon venice that to her now all that was venice had the memory of her honeymoon upon it like a hallmark on silver that time had been a score of divine days luminous with the southern sun warm with stillness or clement wind and yet made vigorous with the youth and freshness of the immortal sea and here six months afterward she had returned with claude to spend a month of late may and early june before the weeks of london in the autumn she had come home under the enchantment and by way of a neat christmas present mr osborne had prospectively given her the rent the journey the expenses of food and wine the servants and their journeys and their wages of a month or call it five weeks my dear and you wont find me pulling you up short he had said of that house on the grand canal that took your fancy palazzo but there ive no head for foreign names you leave london you do with your maid and your cook and your housemaid and what not and dont forget claude hey or hell be quarrelling with you and me taking his side too though its only my fun and you take a few english servants with you as you can fall back upon and you send me in a bill for all the tickets and the wages and your living bills and your gondolas and thats my christmas present to you dont you bother but make yourself comfortable you go as you please as we used to say for a month or call it five weeks and enjoy yourself and let me know how much its all stood you in i shouldnt wonder if mrs o and i didnt come and join you oh not to make you uncomfortable no fear but to take another piazza ah palazzo you call it and have a look at the italians and see whats to be seen dora had an excellent aural memory and as she sat at her window today watching the flickering reflection in the water of the sunstruck houses opposite she could almost hear mr osbornes voice saying these hospitable and freehanded things but they did not get between her and her memory of the weeks in october she was aware that during the last six months she had seen things differently to the way in which they were presented to her during those weeks but it was not venice that had altered it was still venice as per last october as her fatherinlaw might have said they had rowed out to malamocco one day and another they had gone to torcello the ancient mother of venice and she had found there a sort of tenderness for the earlier and now ruined and fevered town just asjust as she found a tenderness for her husbands mother torcello was the beginning of the magic from torcello the creation of what she so loved had come on another day they had taken dinner out on to the great lagoon had tied up to a clump of hoary grayheaded pali notching the ferro of their gondola into the disc of the setting sun then some tide had slowly swung them a little sideways so that they still faced toward the brightness of the west long after the sun had gone and the glory of its departing had been infused into and flooded the heavens a great cumulus cloud reared itself out of the western horizon in tower and pinnacle of ineffable rose with transparent aqueous blue dwelling in the folds of it and at the base of it lay the campaniles and roofs of venice and claude had been beside her he whose beauty intoxicated her so that she interpreted all he said or did through the medium of that he had often yawned at things that engrossed her he had often felt that long lingering before certain pictures was tedious but his reason for it had ever been the same and the reason was an intoxicating one then pictures and campaniles absorbed her and in consequence he so he complained got the less of her put me down in clapham junction he had said once and if i find you there i shant ask for venice tintoret yes no is by tintoret how did you guess i see no label on the frame they should have them all labelled what a handsome frame on another day the only one on which the halcyon weather had played them a trick they had gone out in the morning to burano rowing at full tide over the shadows and water of oily calm with above them a sky that was turquoise but for a few pale combed wisps of cloud northward it had been very clear and the white range of snow mountains so sharp cut that it seemed that even on an autumn day they could row across and ascend those cliffs of white thenclaude had noticed it firsta great tattered edge of gray vapour streamed southward off the alps and spread with the swiftness of spilt water along the floor in pool and promontory of vapour over the northern heavens he and she had been talking italian in ridiculous fashion to their head gondolier and now claude pointed dramatically northward and said curioso cloudo on which all the gaiety and laziness of that child of the south vanished and he and his poppe put the boat about and rowed top speed for venice they had come in expectation of fine weather with no felse but before they were halfway home a squall of prodigious wind and blinding rain struck them and for an hour she and claude nestled close beneath one mackintosh hearing the squeal of the wind the buffet of the rain and by degrees the gradual rising of waves they made a bolt for it across the last open water between san michele and venice narrowly escaping being swamped somehow to dora now that seemed the best of all the days the gondola was three inches deep in savage sprayblown water she knew there was danger of some sort abroad when they had already started and had gone too far in the maniac wind that descended on them to get back but crouching beneath the one mackintosh with claude with the rain streaming in from a hundred points and with the danger of capsize imminent she found a glory and triumph in the moment which indeed was independent or almost so of venice and was pure claude he had lit a cigarette after succeeding in striking a match with infinite trouble saying now for the last smoke this side the grave and dora found a sublimity of sangfroid in this remark but at that time all he said or did was golden he gilded all things for her in those days she was incapable of criticism with regard to anything that concerned him for to her lover of beauty as she was his beauty which now was a possession of hers was a thing of dazzling and blinding quality it blinded her still but it must be supposed that the enthrallment of it was quite absolute no longer since now at any rate she knew it was that which had taken the very command and control of herself out of her hands she was in love with him that was perfectly true but it was with his beauty an inextricable part of him that she was in love and now today as she leaned out of her window over the summer stillness she found that she was beginning to be able to look undazzled at him to see the qualities and nature of her husband as they were themselves not as they had appeared to her in the early months of her marriage when she could not see him at all except through the enchanted haze which surrounded him before she married him she had been able to do as she did today to know that at times something trivial it always was as when he spoke of some woman as a handsome lady made her check suddenly but when they were married when he and his wonderful beauty were hers and she was his that power of criticism had altogether left her and it was only with a sort of incredulous wonder that she could remember that she had ever been capable of it today now that he was absent for she had not seen him for over twentyfour hours she for the first time consciously registered the fact that the power of judgment and criticism as regards him had come back to her dora drew herself in from her leaning out of the window and settled herself in a chair this discovery rather startled her insignificant as it might sound if she had described it to may franklin or some other friend it seemed to herself to be indicative of some essential and radical change in her relation to her husband and it concerned itself not with the present only and with the future but reached back into the past so that a hundred little scenes and memories bore a different aspect to her now from that which they had hitherto borne it had been enchanting to her for instance that he had said he would as soon be at clapham junction as at venice provided she was with him at the time she had only thrilled with ecstatic wonder that she could be so much to him now she made the comment that he did not really care for venice that was a pity it was a defect in him that he was indifferent to the exquisite beauties with which he was surrounded she had not seen that before it made him so to speak have no part in her venice which strangely enough he had created for her it was as if a father disowned did not recognize his own child dora had no desire to pursue this train of thought for there was something vaguely uncomfortable at the back of it at which she did not wish to look closer so she mentally brushed it aside and a thing that was a daily if not an hourly habit of hers took her mind back to the first days in which they had been together and let it float her slowly down the enchanted weeks that had followed till it landed her at the present day again such retrospect had indeed passed out of the range of voluntary thought it was like the pillow on which her mind when at rest instinctively reposed itself after venice they had wandered a week or two longer in north italy until toward the end of october a foretaste of winter caught them on the italian lakes and they had started for home arriving there at the beginning of november they had but passed through london spending a couple of days at claudes little flat in mount street and had then gone down to grote for the first big pheasant shoot of the year she found both her mother and austell there dora was essentially appreciative of all the delightful things in life which can only be obtained by abundant money and hitherto very few of these had been within her reach true she was sensible enough to enjoy pictures that were not hers to look at beautiful things exposed for the public in museums and art collections but she did not belong to that slightly unreal class of enthusiasts who say that as long as they are able to see fine pictures and fine statues they get from them all the pleasure which such things are capable of giving nor again was she deficient in her appreciation of comfort and she knew that it was infinitely nicer to telephone from the flat at mount street as they had done on the two evenings they were there and get a box at the theatre than getting seats at the back of the dress circle or if times were exceptionally bad having an egg with her tea and taking her humble place in the queue for the pit she was humorist enough and of a sufficiently observant type to find entertainment of a kind while waiting in the queue but it seemed to her insincere to say that you preferred going to a theatre in such mode similarly though you had such a beautiful view and got so much air on the top of a motor bus that such a mode of progression along the london streets was quite enjoyable it was really far more enjoyable to have your own motor though your outlook was not from so elevated a perch and there was probably not quite so much air and she was perfectly aware that she took the keenest pleasure in all the ease and comfort with which she had been surrounded since her engagement pierre loti as she had once quoted to may franklin had said that it was exquisite to be poor but for herself she found it having had long experience of poverty much more exquisite to be rich but there were things about that shooting week in spite of her newly awakened love and her newly found opulence which was in such resounding evidence there which gave her bad moments moments when she was between bitterness and laughter nearer perhaps to laughter than the other but to laughter in which bitterness would have found the reflection at any rate of itself a rather ponderous plan evolved by the geniality and kindness of her fatherinlaw underlay that week he had been in london for the inside of one of the days that she and claude had stopped in town after their return from venice en route for grote and had lunched with her claude had been out uncle alf had sent for himrather peremptorily so it seemed to dorato come down to richmond and since uncle alf was purseholder for them both and had intimated that he wished to see him on matters connected with the purse the invitation had the authority of a command consequently she and mr osborne lunched alone and you look rarely my dear her fatherinlaw had said giving her a loud smacking kiss claude seems to agree with you bless his heart and yours for there is nothing like being married is there when alls said and done provided you find him as your heart points out to you and youll give old dad a bit of lunch and leave to smoke his cigar with you afterward and tell him about venice my dear ive looked forward to your return with that boy of mine so as never was and im blessed if i dont believe mrs o wouldnt be jealous of you if it wasnt that you were his wife but she thinks noughts too good for claude even if its you she says i run on about you like a clock that wont stop striking and i dare say shes in the right of it it was not very easy to tell mr osborne about venice because it was hard to think of any common ground on which he and venice might conceivably meet and appreciate each other but the description seemed to satisfy him for it was largely claude and i and what satisfied him even more was the evident happiness of the girl she was in love with life with love and with claude and with beautiful things claude he had given her beautiful things he could give her and he asked if it was possible to pick up a tintoret or two then came the plan unfolded to her with almost boisterous enjoyment mrs o and i have put our heads together he said and im her ambassador accredited dont they say by her and with authority to put propositions before you well its just this when that dear boy and you come down to grote tomorrow we want you to be master and mistress of the house and mrs o and me and per and all the rest of them to be your guests itll be for you to say what time we breakfast and to see cook and claude will arrange the shoots and give us a glass of wine after dinner if he thinks it wont hurt us and itll be found it wont if he sticks to the cellar as ive laid down for myself and of which ill give him the key itll give you a sort of lesson like my dear as to how to make your guests comfortable as ill be bound you will it required no gifts of perception whatever to be able to appreciate the kindness and affection of that speech and dora did them full justice at the same time she could not help being conscious of many little jerks she remembered also the party there had been at grote shortly after her engagement wondered if the same sort of gathering would be assembling again and tried to think of herself as hostess to mrs price lady ewart and mrs per they were really very terrible people and on this occasion of her homecoming with claude it was beyond all question that the badinage would be of the most superlative order she remembered with fatal distinctness how her motherinlaw had alluded to mrs per before dora met her as very superior and it seemed to her that no long and conscientious analysis of character could have arrived at a report so definitely and completely true as was the verdict conveyed by those two words yet she had married claude she loved claude to accept the burden of this honour was clearly one of the obligations entailed upon her for it was mr osbornes wish his very kindly wish backed and originated by his wife and there was no shadow of excuse to shelter under for declining it so her pause before replying was not greater than could be well filled by the smile with which she greeted the proposal ah but how dear of you she said cordially but we shall make all kinds of mistakes are you sure you and mrs osborne are willing to risk our making a hash of your party i shall probably forget most things and claude will complete it by forgetting the remainder mr osborne laughed my dear you fill my plate with that hash and ill ask for more he said ill send up my plate twice for that hash hey thats capital and it will give mrs o a bit of a rest for shes a little overdone indeed i was thinking of putting off the party but she wouldnt hear of it and theres another thing my dear couldnt you manage to call me dad as the boys do it isnt in nature that you should call claudes father mr osborne i know its a favour to ask like but you and me hit it off from the first didnt we you was the right wife for claude and no mistake that met with a far more spontaneous response from dora there was affection kindness as always in what he said but there was more than that nownamely a pathos of a very touching kind in his making a favour of so simple a request dora was ashamed of not having complied with it before it was asked why of course she said dad dad doesnt it come naturally and if you talk such nonsense dad about its being a favour i shalli shall call claude mr osborne junior he patted her hand gently thank you my dear thank you he said mrs per calls me mr osborne as youve often heard and i dont know that with her somehow that i want her to call me different but i know with people like you born in another rank of life thats not the custom you make pet names and what not not that i ask that but i should feel it as a favour my dear i should indeed if you felt you could manage to say dad like the boys do dora held up a reproachful forefinger now i warn you dad she said in one moment claude shall be called what i said he should be then not a word more about it well give my love to that rascal whos got so much more than he deserves bless him and we expect you both tomorrow gone to see uncle alf has he poor old alf a mass of lumbago he was when i saw him two days ago and acid i should scarce have thought that anyone could have felt so unkind and a beautiful day it was too with the sun shining and all nature as you may say rejoicingall but poor old alf god bless him but claude always does him more good than a quart of liniment or embrocation either though what he spends on doctors stuff is beyond all telling such was mr osbornes plan and as has been said the accomplishment of it gave dora some rather bad moments the party was terrifically illassorted lady ewart mrs price and one or two more like them and their husbands being balanced against her mother and austell the hungarian ambassador and his wife and several others of that particular world in which both mr and mrs osborne so much wished to be at home dora in consequence was positively tossed and gored by unremitting dilemma she was obliged to make herself what she would have called both cheap and vulgar in order to convey at all to the prices and ewarts that particular pitch of cordiality to which they were accustomed alderman price for instance habitually declined a second helping not because he did not want and intend to have it but because good manners made him say no the first time and yes the second as for asking for more as austell did he would not have considered that any kind of behaviour he was used to be pressed or tempted and dora had to press and tempt hima thing which though she would have been delighted if he had eaten a whole haunch of venison she found difficult to do naturally you had to call the footman back mrs osborne did it quite easily and get him to put mr prices plate aside and wait till he had given the affair a second thought then he said well i dont know as if and the matter was brought to a triumphant conclusion yet it was not easy to manage if the procedure was new to you or again his wife particularly liked a glass of port after dinner which after all was a completely innocent desire but her gentility was such that she would never have thought of accepting it when it was casually offered her but every night it had to be accepted in order to oblige dora mrs osborne before giving up the reins of government to her daughterinlaw had imparted this diplomatic instruction and dora had been subsequently assured that her pressing and tempting was held to be the perfection of hospitality the flow of badinage too that went on incessantly from morning till night and was almost exclusively matrimonial in character was difficult to live up to for whatever she or claude did was construed by mr osborne or sir thomas with whom dora so she was assured by lady ewart had become a favourite into having some connubial bearing if as happened one day claude drove mrs price home from the shooting lady ewart with an inflamed and delighted countenance told dora that she wouldnt wonder if they lost their way and said the motor had broken down to explain their coming in late or again dora was pompously asked by sir thomas on a morning of streaming wet when no shooting was possible to have a game of billiards and accepting this proposal was expected to be immensely amused by the suggestion that claude would be found hiding in the window seat to hear what went on the joke was allembracing if she spoke to claude somebody wondered audibly what she was saying if she spoke to anyone else it was again audibly imagined that claude was looking jealous and if for the moment she did not speak to anybody wonder was expressed as to what was on her mind all this was trivial enough in itself and as she well knew oceans and continents of kindliness lay behind it her gueststhis section of them at any ratewere pleased and well entertained as far as her part was concerned and were charmed with her but during all those seven stricken daysfor the party was of the most hospitable order and embraced a complete weekshe had to nail a brave face so to speak over her own and set her teeth inside the smiling mouth the prices and the ewarts had come here to enjoy themselves and clearly they did but there was a certain thickskinned robustness which was necessary to anyone who had to enter into the spirit of their enjoyment had the party consisted entirely of ewarts and prices and pers dora would have found her own conduct an affair of infinitely less difficulty as it was her mother and austell were there and some six or seven more of her own world who looked on with faint smiles at such times as humour was particularly abundant and to do the barest justice to it it must be said that it seemed unfailingly ubiquitous one night sir thomas had taken madame kodjek the wife of the hungarian ambassador into dinner and in an unusual pause in the conversation dora had heard her say in her faint silvery voice how very amusing sir thomas what fun you must have in sheffield then she turned her back on him put a barrier of a white elbow on the table between him and her and talked to dora herself three places off for the rest of dinnera thing which as sir thomass indignant face silently testified was conduct to which he was unaccustomed clearly such breach of ordinary manners was a thing unheard of in sheffield dora halfway between giggles and despair at the incident had not though longing to know the heart to ask mimi afterward what was the particular incident that made her conclude that life in sheffield was so humorous an affair but sir thomas had confided in his favourite that he thought the baroness a very haughty lady and without any sense of what was due to the gentleman who took you in to dinner it had been difficult therefore to steer a course and as in the case of those wandering channels in the lagoons there were here no friendly groups of pali to guide her she had to guess her way turn her helm swiftly this way and that to avoid running aground had she not been dora osborne she would if she had found herself in a house party of this description have had entrancing bedroom talks to mimi and others about sir thomas and the ewarts andthe osbornes such talks would not have been unkindly she would have seen even as she saw now that all manner of excellent qualities underlay the irredeemable vulgarity and a thing more difficult in her present position she would have seen the humorous side of affairs but as it was she could not have any bedroom talks at all of this description indeed mimi and others pointedly avoided as they were bound to do any mention of these other guests from the amiable desire not to say things that would embarrass her dora had married an osborne and by that act had joined another circle true she had not in the least left her own but she had taken on by necessity the relations and friends of her husband indeed looking at the transaction as a whole there was not one of her friends who did not think she had done right and few who did not a little envy her there were some slight inconveniences in marrying into such a family but they weighed very light indeed if balanced against the consequent advantages and it was the business of her friends to minimize these disadvantages for her pretend that sir thomas made no particular impression on them and be deaf to doras insidiousness in getting mrs price to have her glass of port and the advantages were so great she had gained superabundant wealth in exchange for crippling poverty the osbornes house was now one to which everybody of any sense and many of no sense went if they were so fortunate as to be asked and above all she had married that charming and quiet adonis of a husband who looked anyhow leagues away from and above his effusive parents and claude during all this week dora had been filled with an almost ecstatic admiration of him he took the place corresponding to that which she herself so difficultly occupied with perfect ease and success and without apparent effort to mrs prices most outrageous sallies he found a reply that convulsed her with laughter or made her as the case might be call him a naughty man and the thing seemed to be no trouble to him and for the time anyhow such replies gave her no jerks or if they did they were jerks of relief i shall warn sir thomas lady ewart he would say and you will find yourself watched and without pause or hint of discomfiture continue a bach conversation with madame kodjek dora had set herself with a heartfelt enthusiasm to study and find out the secret of this wonderful performance and she came to the conclusion that it was consummate tact grafted on to a nature as kindly as his fathers or mothers that produced this perfect flower of behaviour and the tacta rare phenomenon rather for tact implies the tactician the pleasant schemerwas apparently unconscious at least if it was conscious it was claudes delightful modesty that disclaimed the knowledge of it one evening she had a word with him about it darling i dont know how you manage she said and oh claude i wish you would teach me everyones delighted with you and you do it all so easily how can you flirtyes darling flirtwith mrs price one moment and without transition talk to mimi on the other side oh the price woman isnt so bad said he shes a kind old soul really and if you chaff her a bit she asks no more he had come in to see her before going down to the smoking room again where the best cigars in england were so to speak on tap and where per and sir thomas between the cigars a little brandy and soda and the recollections of their prowess among the pheasants during the day always sat up late in mr osbornes house it was one of the rules of honour that the host should express a wish to sit up later than any of his guests or wait at any rate till they all had yawned before proposing retirement and claude after this cheerful remark about mrs price turned to leave the room again dora knew what was expected of him and suddenly rebelled surely you can leave them to drink and smoke and turn out the lights she said do stop and talk to me i have sent hendon away and who is to brush my hair besides i want to talk ive got better right to talk to you than sir thomas has oh claude teach me you are yourself all the time and yet you can say things to mrs price which if it wasnt you dora broke off he had unpinned the tiara which was one of his fathers many wedding gifts to her and which she wore knowing it was a ludicrous thing to do in the country because it pleased him and next moment her hair unpinned also by a movement or two of his deft fingers fell in cataracts round her face i dont see the trouble he said lady ewart isnt your sort darling but its you who are so clever its you who manage so well not me why she said only today that she was quite jealous of you for sir thomas thought such a lot of you though of course that was only her chaff and they say hell be in the running for a peerage at the next birthday honours for the moment dora was silent simply she could not speak she saw in the looking glass in front of her looking over his shoulder that face which to her was the most beautiful thing in the world and simultaneously she heard what that beautiful mouth said for that instant her mind was divided it could not choose between beauty and the hopelessness of what was said as if anybody cared who was made a peer or as if a peerage conferred not only nobility but a single ounce of breeding as if a problematic lord ewart could be for that reason even a shade more tolerable than a sir thomas of the same name what could it matter except to guards and railway porters who might count on a rather larger tip and then the greater potency of her lovers face absorbed her and she lifted up her hands and drew it down to her ah well what does it all matter she said so long as theres you and me but go down dear if you think you had better and be sure to yawn a great deal so that they wont sit up very late but after he had gone she wondered whether she guessed the reason why claude made himself appropriate so easily to lady ewart and mrs price was it simply because he found no difficulty in doing so was not his cleverness his tact shown rather in the fact that he could talk to mimi appropriately and it was at that moment as she remembered now that a certain trouble vague and distant as yet and couched in the innermost recesses and darkness of her mind began to stir she scarcely then knew what it was she knew only that there was veiled trouble somewhere after this week of the shooting party she and claude had returned to town still occupying the flat in mount street where they remained till christmas with weekends in the country most of these had been passed at the houses of doras friends and it could not but please and gratify her to find how claude was welcomed and liked so that if at grote there had been trouble astir it was still again he did all the usual things better than the average he shot well he played golf excellently he was a quiet and reliable partner at bridge he talked pleasantly always got up when a woman entered the room and always opened the door for her to leave it such accomplishments did not it is true reach down very far below the surface but a young man if he happens to be quite exceptionally goodlooking and has such things at his fingers ends will generally be a welcome guest dora had never actually wanted comforting with regard to him but it pleased her to see that he took his place easily and naturally for the rest he was busy enough for in view of the next general election he was nursing a suburban constituency which promised well he spoke with fluency and good sense he was making an excellent impression in public and he earned a considerable personal popularity in the domestic circles of his voters and in this connection dora had another uncomfortable moment as was frankly admitted between them she could help him a good deal here and she often went down with him and made innumerable calls at west brentworth on miles of detached and semidetached villas it was an advantage beyond doubt in this sort of place that claude had married a girl of title and lady dora osborne or as she was more generally addressed lady osborne charmed a large section of constituents not only because she was delightful but because her brother was the earl and her mother the countess there was no use in denying or failing to make the most of this adventitious advantage and dora made the most of it by being completely natural and entering with zest into the questions of boardwages and the iniquities of tweenies she could do that with knowledge and experience to back her since such minuti had formed a very real part of her life up to the time of her marriage and her mother was an adept in getting the most out of those who were so fortunate as to be the recipients of the somewhat exiguous wages she could speak about beer money and the use of coals when the household was on boardwages with point and accuracy and it charmed west brentworth to find that lady osborne was not too high to take interest in such matters at other houses however there reigned a more aristocratic tone there would be a peerage and a copy of the world on the table and a marked unconsciousness of the existence of anybody who was not a baronet there the parties for newmarket were discussed and mrs sandford pouring out tea and tempting lady osborne to a second cup would say that the whole world seemed to have been in town lately and was lady osborne dining at the carlton two nights ago when so many distinguished people were there upon which would ensue a very enlightened conversation mrs sandford knew quite well that the earl of wendover was doras first cousin and the viscount bramley her second cousin for that came out of the peerage and what a beautiful terrace there was at bramley for that came out of country life thenand this was the uncomfortable momentshe and claude got into their motor having made the last call and started for town claude said what a superior woman mrs sandford seems to be all these things and others of which these were typical dora thought over as she sat in the window of her sala looking over the grand canal on that baking afternoon in june when claude had gone to milan to meet his father and mother they were all trivial enough each at any rate was trivial but today she wondered whether there was an addition sum to be done with regard to them each if she took them singly might be disregarded just as halfpennies have no official status on cheques and are not treated seriously but did they add up to something to something that could not be disregarded she did not know and very wisely forebore to conjecture besides the gross heat of the day was subsiding and a little breeze had begun to stir below the window giovanni had already finished the toilet of the gondola and was putting in the tea basket since she had said she would have tea out on the lagoon venice called to her beckoned her away from thoughts where something sombre or agitating might lie concealed into the sunlight and splendour of the day chapter vi mr and mrs osborne as has been mentioned had no idea of planting themselves on dora and her husband in their visit to venice and since the visit was to be thoroughly bohemian in character and they hoped and expected to rough it it had seemed to them equally unsuitable to go to an hotel where no doubt medivalism would have been supplanted by modern conveniences they both wanted with that inexpressible elasticity and love of experience which was characteristic of them to behave native fashion and do like the venetians as mrs osborne put it and indeed the phrase pleased her husband no less than herself so they had taken the palazzo dandoli for a fortnight at a prodigious weekly rent which included however the wages of the servants and the use of the gondolas with a view to roughing it thoroughly mrs osborne had only brought her maid with her and her husband was completely unattended it was to be a jaunt a wedding trip a renewal of old times probably there would be little to eat and drink and heaven only knew what kind of a bed to sleep in while an italian manservant would probably not know how to fold trousers but all these possible inconveniences were part of behaving nativefashion and were not only to be expected but welcomed as being part of the genuine article the house stood on the eastern outskirts of venice with a garden facing san michele and the lagoon and here dora strolled with her fatherinlaw on the morning after their arrival waiting for the appearance of mrs osborne who since they had arrived late the night before was taking it easy and was not expected down till lunch time at halfpast twelve dora knew the owner of the place and had been there before but never in these early days of summer while yet the gardens were unscorched and the magic of spring had woven its ultimate spell all the past was redolent in the walls of mellowed brick the niches empty for the most part save where a bust or two of stained carrara marble still lingered in the gray of the ivyhung fountain in the grilles of curving ironwork that gave view across the lagoon to the cypresses of san michele and farther away the dim tower of torcello long alleys of cut and squared hornbeam with hoplike flowers led like green church aisles down the garden and spaces of grass between them were hedged in by more compact walls of yew and privet with its pale spires of blossom faintly sweet round the fountain stood three sergecoated sentinels of cypress encrusted over with their nutlike fruits and flamelike against their sombre foliage were azaleas in bright green tubs and the swooning whiteness of orange blossom elsewhere the formality of the cut hornbeam alleys and clipped hedges gave place to a gayer and more sunny quarter though even there italy lingered in the pavement of red and white stone that led between the more englishlooking flower beds peach trees in foam of pink flower and white waterfalls of spira were background here in front of them stood rows of stiff foxgloves and in front again a riot of phlox and columbine and snapdragon covered the beds to the edge of the path to the left lay the rose garden approached by a walk of tall madonna lilies already growing fatbudded and prepared to receive the torch of flowerlife from the roses when their part in the race should be done and homely pansies with quaint trustful faces made a velvetlike diaper of deeper colour here too stood another fountain that from leaden pipe shed freshness on the basin below where clumps of japanese iris were already beginning to unfold their great butterfly flowers imperial in purple or virginal in white and over the green marble edge of it quick lizards flicked and vanished dora had arrived at the palazzo while yet the morning was young and dewy and leaving word that she had come passed through the white shady courtyard of the house and down the long alleys of the garden to look out on the lagoon from the far end of it the tide was high and the cool water shimmered over the flats that an hour or two ago were still exposed and lay in expanse of glistening ooze or green with fields of brilliant seaweeds but the redsailed fishing boats had to pass between the rows of pali that marked the channels and a little company of them were even now going seaward the wind blew gently from the north tempering the heat and to the north were visible the remote summits of snowclad alps just opposite were the orange walls and black cypresses of san michele but in the gaiety of the gay day even those associations were gladdened it was good to be anything in venice even to be dead and resting there in sound of the whispering lagoon then came the interruption she had waited for her name was jovially called and down the pergola of vines which led to the grille between the clumps of syringa and riot of rambler came mr osborne he had left england with the intention of roughing it and enjoying the experience and was clad in the way that had seemed to him appropriate he wore a norfolk jacket and knickerbockers below which his short fat calves looked like turned oak posts clad in thick worsted and set in strong brown boots on his head he wore a felt hat with a puggaree attached to it and round his shoulders was a strap that carried a large binocular glass in a word he appeared like a man deerstalking in the tropics like this he was equal to any foreigneering vicissitudes and provided against all accidents that might happen in a town where instead of walking from one place to another you went in a black sort of punt with a strange battleaxe at the prow well dearie and here we are he said and pleased we are to be here i do assure you passed a comfortable night too and so i warrant you has mrs o for she was asleep still when i came downstairs but my dear theyve got but a paltry notion of furnishing these rooms we had supper last night when we got in in a great room as big as the hall at grote and nothing there but a table and a few chairs and some painted canvas on the walls and on the floor a rug or two as you could scarcely get both feet upon however we were hungry and the food was good enough macaroni they gave us and a bit of veal and some cheese and strawberries and this seems a pretty bit of garden where mrs o can sit and be cool if she finds the heat oppressive and its good to see you my dear and blooming you look he gave her a loud kind kiss and continued to pour forth his first impressions of venice claude met us at milan as hell have told you he said and saw us safe here last night its strange though going to your house in a boat and such a smell as there was at the last corner but one before we got here i never encountered i should have had it looked into in no time if such a thing had occurred in the works at sheffield but it seems fine and open here and ive no doubt we shall be well enough off but to think of those old doges with never a bathroom in their houses nor hot water laid on nor nothing but i enjoy that my dear i want to see the old life as they had it and look at their palaces ah and live in one and see their pictures and think what manner of folk they was being born and getting married and dying and all in the very rooms we now occupy dora suddenly laughed oh dad she said you are too heavenly but why have you put on those thick clothes its going to be a roasting day i am glad to see you im sure you will find the house comfortable and oh did you ever see such a morning look out there across the lagoon its venice you know venice mr osborne looked out through the iron grille well im sure its pretty enough he said and talk of sea air why the seas all round you we must have come a matter of a mile over the viaduct last night after we left the mainland and sea air is what i want for mother she wants a bit of setting up and if she feels inclined to keep quiet and not look at the galleries and churches and sights every day my dear youll know its because she isnt quite up to the mark well well no im not anxious about her for she takes her food and was as pleased to come out here such as never was but shes been a bit tired and must take a rest shes not ill asked dora theres nothing wrong not a bit of it tis true i wanted her to see the doctor before she left home but she wouldnt hear a word of it just to go to venice so she said and see claude and dora and not do much thats the prescription for me she said and so here we are my dear lunch at halfpast twelve too how strange it seems but after the breakfast they gave me just a bit of toast and an egg i dont doubt i shall be ready for it but the coffee was prime though it came up in an earthenware pot i suppose it was that way the doges took it lor to think of it all wedding the sea too every year i read it in the guidebook on the journey a curious custom that was heathenish you may say it takes one back doesnt it it was still an hour before lunch time and at doras suggestion they went out for a turn in her gondola which was waiting since mrs osborne was not to be expected down till lunch time mr osborne still feeling the insecurity of a foreign land refused to change into more suitable clothes and already perspiring profusely embarked with a sense of being prepared for anything as they got in dora gave some short direction to her gondolier in italian and this roused his admiring curiosity its a strange thing too he said that you say something of which i cant understand a syllable and round the boat goes as if youd said right about turn such a bother as we had with luggage and what not before claude met us but mrs o saw the hang of it and kept saying venice palazzo dandoli whenever one of them brigands looked in on us and it seemed they wanted no more than that brigands they looked my dear though i dare say they were honest men in the employment of their company and whats that now that big telegraphlooking thing he pointed at the huge disfiguring posts that brought the electric power into venice oh electric light i think said dora or perhaps its telephone my word and i never expected to find either here said mr osborne do you mean they have got the light and the phone and why if thats so arent they installed in the dandoli oh dad she said where do you want to telephone to no dearie i dont want to telephone but youd have thought that in a place like that ive taken theyd surely have had the modern conveniences if such were to be had and where are we coming to now dora did not answer at once this was one of the best places of all in that city of best places there was a sharp turn from a narrow canal overhung by tall redstained walls and they shot out into the grand canal just above the rialto oh she said look look the bowshaped bridge lay to their left as from the huddled houses they swept into the great waterway a troubled reflection of palaces gleamed in the tide the curve of the grand canal was flung outward and onward reeling in the heat just opposite was the fish market newly rebuilt with columns of ornamented iron work mr osborne pointed an admiring forefinger at it well i never he said to think to see the fellow of one of pers designs in venice i shall have the laugh of per over that and tell him he copied them from some old courtyard of the doges or what not beautiful i call them after all they were wonderful old folk werent they when we think that they put up there a design that might have been made in sheffield today i assure you dearie they are just like pers drawings for no light arcade same as is in the showroom at the works dora had not been attending very closely those who love venice are apt to be inattentive when some new magic comes into view and to dora the bowarch of the bridge with the bowarch of the canal below grew in wonder the oftener that she saw it arches she asked arches like one of pers designs oh do show me why that open place there said mr osborne still immensely interested that arcade just opposite with the ornamental arches in open work dora could not help laughing oh dear dad she said very likely they are pers designs thats the new fish market just being rebuilt and then it struck her that her laugh might sound unkindly it is quite possible they are pers designs she said would it not be thrilling if they were giovanniagain she spoke in italianjust land at the market and ask some of the workmen where the iron arches came from i see one not yet put up wrapped in straw there is some label on it see if it is from osborne sheffield giovanni floated the gondola to the side of the landing place with the flick of a quickturned oar and got out in a moment he came back having read the stamped label on the packing and reported the gratifying news oh its too thrilling cried dora to think that they came from your works dad youre a perfect wizard to see that and guess it was pers you must write to him and tell him that his ironwork is going up in venice and that you recognized it the first moment youyou saw the grand canal mr osborne gave a little inward tremolo of laughter oh im not so blind yet he said and its seldom you see work like pers theres something as you may say so individual about it god bless the boy how hell like to hear that i spotted his design right across the grand canal eh he might have been here my dear and studied the style of the architecture when one sees how it fits in with the other monuments ill write to tell him that mr osborne remembered that dora had told him that venice was the most beautiful place in the world and the grand canal the most beautiful thing in venice and he made a concession that he did not really feel not but what he hadnt got a lot to compete against he said that bridge now thats a fine thing and the curve of it looks built for strength i warrant theres no iron girder made that would cause it to be safer and the houses beautiful im sure but i dont see any that id sooner take than the palazzo dandoli suddenly dora felt something dry up inside her that at any rate was how she mentally phrased the sensation to herself her fatherinlaw was kind and wise and good he was anxious to please he was anxious to be pleased but at the concessionfor so she felt it to bethat per had had a lot to compete with when the excruciating iron arcade of the fish market was erected within stonethrow of the rialto and within peashooting distance of the wondrous canal she felt for the moment the impossibility of herself and mr osborne being together at venice the situation was one that she had not faced without a tremor now for the moment when it was actual and accomplished it was inconceivable but this mercantile discovery had delighted mr osborne it had clearly raised his previous estimate of venice a town that could so aptly enshrine this design of pers was a town that must receive the best attention there was probably more in it than he had been at first disposed to imagine he gave it his best attention a gray fussing steamboat going seaward on the tide and raising a huge wash of churned water next engaged his admiration well and if i didnt think when we took so long to get to the palazzo last night that the italians would be wiser to build a big sea wall somewhere and raise the level of the canal so as you could drive a horse and carriage down them he said but if youve got a ferry steamer that goes the pace of thatlor my dear how it makes us rocki dont see what theres to complain of and calling first on this side and then on that same as they used to do on the thames what could you ask for more convenient again dora had to enlist her sympathy on a foreign side i know she said and they go right out to the lido where well go and bathe this very afternoon dad it will be awfully hot after lunch so well join the steamer at san marco and send the gondola out to meet us on the lido and take us back when it gets cooler one gets roasted in a gondola on the lagoon when its as hot as this mr osborne was clearly a little troubled at this suggestion ah no doubt there are sets of bathing machines he said at length a dip in the briny very pleasant dora did not at once grasp the cause of his embarrassment well swim right out together she said you can swim for ever in this sea its so buoyant and then we sit on the sand and eat strawberries while the sun dries us again then she saw that some portentous doubt on the question of propriety was in mr osbornes mind guessed it and hastened to remove the cause of it or perhaps coming straight out from england you dont want to bathe she said besides theres the matershe had adopted this from claude so we wont bathe well take her out for a giroa rowin the gondola and have tea out on the lagoon dad youll love the lagoon all gray and green and the electric light poles cross it to the lido eh that will be nice said mr osborne quickly and appreciatively and heres another bridge why beautiful isnt it i think i like it better than that curved one there seems more sense in it you dont have to mount so high they had passed round the last corner of the canal and in front of them lay the straight lower reach of it that passes into the great basin opposite st marks and the doges palace to right and left the stately houses stood up from the water side in glimmer of rose and blue and orange beneath the smiting glory of the noonday since yesterday the north wind blowing lightly from the alps had banished the oppression of yesterdays heat and the glitter of the city had awoke again pearly in the shadow and jewelled in the sun and in the immediate foreground the only blot of disfigurement was the object of mr osbornes admiration the flat execrable iron bridge opposite the accademia there it lay convenient and hideous and impossible and he liked it better than the curved one it had more sense in it but there was no need for dora to rack her brains to find some response which should steer a middle way between lack of cordiality to her fatherinlaw on the one hand and artistic perjury on the other between the fish market the iron bridge and the vile convenient speed of the steamboats venice was going up in his estimation by leaps and bounds and he was delighted to find he was almost able to endorse doras opinion on the town well i call it all beautiful my dear he said and its as i said to mother mother i said if dora says venice is a nice place you may be sure there is something in it and we were right to come out and have a look at it ourselves but whod have thought there was so much of modern convenience and comfort and these gondolas too im sure im as comfortable sitting here as in my own brougham and except when the steamers go by they glide as smooth as on an asphalt road pretty the water is too though not clear i should have thought that here in the south thered have been more of blue in it but im a bit surprised my dear that you with your eye for colour shouldnt have done up the gondola more brightly had some blue curtains maybe or picked out that handsome carved work on the prow with a touch of red theres a thought too much black about it for my taste seems to tell of a funeral almost dora could not argue about this she could not give mr osborne eyes which should see the value of the black blots of boats against the brightness of the sky mirrored in the canal but it was easy to find praise in his speech to which she could respond though the praise was expressed in a way that somehow set her teeth on edge oh they are the most comfortable things in the world she said and i even like the indignant slap they give when the wash of the steamer crosses them beautiful thing with its arching neck like some great black swan ah theres twelve striking we shall just have time to look into our house and fetch claude and then get back to the dandoli for lunch i hope theyll have put it in the garden oh dad how this place has got into my heart you never did such a nice thing as when you gave claude and me a month here mr osborne did not think much of doras waterentrance to the great gray palace of which she had the first floor but the size of the huge sala which she remembered to tell him was a hundred and ten feet long was most satisfactory to him but with its polished stoneplaster floor and the venetian emptiness of it it seemed to him rather bare and comfortless well im sure its a handsome room enough in point of size he said and in this hot weather it looks cool and restful but it seems strange to have never a strip of carpet on the floor and scarce a picture on the walls lord my dear dont it make your teeth chatter to think of coming down to this of a winters morning when even now it strikes so cool but isnt there some tintoret now my dear that you could fancy or if not that half a dozen big photographs of the canal and the bridge you liked so much to hang on the walls and as for the floor to be sure its a big job to cover it but a proper carpet for that end of it where youve got your chairs and table looking out over the canal you shall have if i have to telegraph to town for one instead of those few rugs or mats i should call them fancy advertising this as a house to be let furnished i call it misrepresentation dora took his arm oh dad you are the kindest man that ever was she said but indeed i want neither pictures nor a carpet though it is darling of you to offer me them i like it empty its thethe right style with these rooms you found your dining room rather emptier than you liked you know but in a day or two you will get more than used to it you will see how suitable it is and i love this great empty room now well just go into the other rooms and then we must get back for lunch claude seems to be out i expect we shall find him at the dandoli lunch as they found when they got back had been laid as dora hoped in the garden in the centre of a gravelled space sheltered from the sun by the mellow brick wall and a clump of overarching delicatefingered acacia trees and made cool to the ear by the plash of the fountain into its marble basin down the sides and at the corners of this space were tubs of orange trees and the heaviness of their drowsy fragrance mingling with the large dilution of this tide of warm seascented air was translated into something exquisitely light and vigorous claude had already arrived and was waiting with his mother for them who was in excellent spirits why dearest dora she said here we are and ready im sure for lunch to speak for myself though its not gone halfpast twelve yet and in england we shouldnt be sitting down for another hour and claudes been telling me that in england now its not gone halfpast eleven and here we are wanting our lunch at such an hour as that eh whats that what did he say to me pronto it sounded like guiseppe the smiling italian butler had approached mr osborne and said exactly that yes pronto said dora it means ready mrs osborne beamed back at guiseppe and im pronto too she said lets sit down mrs o will be having the whole italian language by heart before the weeks out said her husband and such a morning as ive had with dora mother bridges and canals and steamers and churches ah and youd never guess so ill tell you without teasing you they are rebuilding the fish market with arcades of iron pillars very handsome and who do you think supplies them osborne sheffield and no other my dear and its pers no light arcade same as is in the showroom or im the more mistaken mrs osborne was as delighted as her husband ill get a photograph of that this very afternoon she said if theres such a thing as a photograph shop in venice dora my dear have they a photograph shop in venice or hasnt that got here yet dora threw back her head laughing oh mother how divine of you she said considering i sent you literally hundreds of picture post cards when claude and i were here in the autumn to be sure you did my dear said mrs osborne cordially and it had gone clean out of my poor head so a photograph of the fish market ill send to per this very afternoon if i have to turn over all their scrapbooks for it mr o youll never manage macaroni that way wrap it round your fork my dear as you see claude doing and in it goes without any bother well mother youre not so much of a hand at it yourself observed mr osborne in selfdefence if im to take pattern by claude you take pattern by dora now i call that an excellent dish you couldnt have it better done not in your own house what does he say to me dora my dear banke is it bianco said dora white will you have white wine or red thats another word for mrs o said her husband i told you shed get it all off by heart in no time yes ill have a go at the bianco one wants something light and cool on a morning like this especially if the true time is only halfpast eleven i declare it makes me feel quite greedy said mrs osborne but such an appetite as i have today i havent had since the middle of april and what else have you seen this morning mr osborne give an account of the sights my dear or i shall think youve had no eye except for dora they waited in the cool greenness of the garden till the heat of the day began to abate and then went all together in one gondola at mrs osbornes particular wish to begin the sights of venice it was in vain that dora suggested that everybody would be much more comfortable if they took two gondolas and arranged their rendezvous for mrs osbornes heart was set on a family party and she wasnt sure that she would trust mr o with dora alone any more that day so as badinage loomed on the horizon dora hastily and completely withdrew her opposition and they all four squeezed into one gondola the plan was to row out over the lagoon and have tea at santa rosa tea made the centre of the afternoon round which the rest appeared to be grouped in the minds of the osbornes then they were to return to venice in time to look in at st marks and loiter in the piazza where mrs osborne it was hoped would find at one of the photograph shops the representation of the fish market on which she had set her heart accordingly the labouring gondoliers propelled the laden craft across to the little island tied up to the bank and procured strawberries from the fruit farm to add to their tea mrs osborne at first had a sort of vague prejudice against them for abroad it was impossible to tell who hadnt been touching them and it is to be feared it was only because the rest of the party found them remarkably good that she joined them but she was charmed with their picnic and saw a great similarity between the little waterway of the island and the regents park canal they dined that evening at doras housemeals somehow had leaped into sudden importance and preponderance since the arrival of her fatherinlaw in venice though they had no more meals than usualand mrs osborne as well as her husband was voluble over all they had seen just to think that all the floor of st marks is in marble said she why it seems almost a shame doesnt it im sure theres not a cathedral in england thats got such a grand floor and st marks so you saiddidnt you dorawas only roman catholic well well mother said mr osborne its the church of the country you see just as the english church is ours youd think more of the roman if youd been brought up to it but im surprised at their letting the floor get into that state it was all ups and downs and im sure i scarcely knew where i should be setting my foot next so dark it was too that one couldnt see as much as one would like if i were them i should send for some good english architect as knows when a buildings safe and when it isnt and make him cut half a dozen sensible windows somewhere or perhaps take down one of them domes and put in a glass roof to it instead five domes there are for i counted them and thats beyond all reason dora felt that this was too much for her simply she could not think of any reply whatever if somebody proposed putting a glass dome in st marks what answer was possible but there was no need for one mrs osborne instantly joined in again and never did i think to see such shops in venice she said why there was electric fittings at one i passed beautiful they were with nymphs and suchlike holding up the globes the same as you might get in the most superior shops in town and i need never have brought out stationery with me for there was a stationers there as i could have bought the best creamlaid at and not expensive either if you recollect that a lira is but tenpence though its strange to have your silver coins worth tenpence instead of a shilling it wants a deal of thinking back into pounds and shillings they seem to have a notion of building too said mr osborne im sure that great square tower they were building was as solid a piece of work as you could find anywhere and to think that the original had stood there five hundred years how it takes you back claude nodded at dora what did i tell you he said didnt i say the mater and pater would like venice near as much as you do yes dear you were quite right said dora with a sort of despairing acquiescence in even this and what should you like to do tomorrow dad she asked eh theres more yet to see is there he said and to think that ive been sightseeing all day and not finished even now who would have thought there was so much in such a small town well my dear im in your hands and whatever you show me ill be bound i shall like it if it comes up to the sample of venice weve had today and what says mrs o well theres all the pictures we havent seen yet said she perhaps dora would take us to see the pictures in the morning but as for the afternoon i want nothing better than to have another look at st marks and do a bit more shopping and perhaps have a bit of a row afterward for i declare its a pity not to be out up till its time to dress the next three or four days were it must be confessed a sort of nightmare to dora for she took venice too seriously to see anything humorous in what she had to go through she took them to the accademia and the paul veronese of the marriage of cana had an instant and amazing success owing to its size mr osborne doubted if it would have got into the picture gallery at grote at all and mrs osborne had no doubt whatever about it she saw at a glance that it would not without you took its frame off other pictures pleased for other reasons the procession of the cross because st marks and the campanile came into it the tintoret of the adoration of the doges because st george was sitting by the virgin and he was an english saint but before titians assumption of the virgin a picture which unfortunately dora detested criticism with regard to its dimensions and even appreciation was mute and its size and frame passed without remark mrs osbornes eyes filled with dear heartfelt tears and mr osborne said lor maria it was worth coming to venice for to see this alone my dear well now they could paint in those days and immediately thereon he bought an enormous copy of it vilely executed which an elderly english lady was just finishing with an uncertain strippling touch she explained in quavering tones that she was obliged to charge very high for her copies because she spent weeks in study before she began to paint in getting at the spirit of the original and mr osbornes alacrity in securing her work no doubt made her wish that she had charged higher yet for the spiritual tension required for its production on another day they went to san rocco for mr osborne found to his amazement that it was impossible to see all the pictures in venice in one go even if you spent the whole morning at it this seemed strange since you could see the whole of the royal academy in a less time but the remedy was simple why not build a new picture gallery hang all the pictures in venice there charge two lire and have them all catalogued in one book that was the kind of suggestion that cornered dora it seemed scarcely worth while to say that many were in the churches and that it would be a pity to move them since they were painted for the places which they occupied but trying to be patient and kind she did say so and mr osborne was fired with the brilliant thought of having copies made for the churches claude thought this an excellent idea the govs hit the nail on the head this time he said and was surprised when dora turning aside said oh claude to him but apart from the pictures at san rocco which did not have a great success the visit was memorable because mrs osborne said bon giorno to the custodian just as if she did it every day of her life he understood perfectly and made a suitable reply about the loveliness of the day that was a little beyond mrs osborne so she said grazie and her husband admiringly commented lor you speak it like a native i told you the mother would have it by heart in no time he said on this morning they had still an hour to spare before lunch since the tintorets were not interesting or beautiful and they rowed across to the giudecca to see a garden the garden was fairly appreciated though to mrs osbornes mind the borders where the southern june was rioting were not quite so trim as she would have had them but the great sugar factory was found to be most attractive and mr osborne was much surprised to find that dora did not know whether it was possible to see over it or not however claude made inquiries and found it could be shown he took his father there next day and they were late for lunch but mrs osborne and dora were late too they had been ordering a very handsome gilt frame for the copy of the assumption and the pattern on it wanted a lot of choosing dora and claude dined that night at the dandoli and mr osborne announced that he and the mother had settled to stay on another week for they were both thoroughly delighted with venice and its grateful to you my dear that we both are said mr osborne for telling us about it and making us feel as how we should like to see it theres fifty different things in venice i should like to see a score of times and if were spared my dear well spend another month next year as per this sample now dora did her best when this little speech was made but sirocco had been blowing all day and as usual it had made her feel rather jerky and irritable also it must be remembered mr osborne with the best and most appreciative intention in the world had as may be conjectured from the foregoing details of their days succeeded in spoiling everything for her who could look at and enjoy a picture while he was wondering why tintoret hadnt given st john something more on or feel the magic of the approach across the lagoon when mrs osborne said that the gray shining mudflats called to mind the fal below truro at low tide and mr osborne confirmed the accuracy of this impression but maria had such an eye for likenesses in consequence dora had a little failed in cordiality of tone on the receipt of the news for by this plan they would leave venice all together and every day till their departure would be taken up with these nightmare excursions for it was part of the plan that they should do everything together her words whatever they were had been expressive of delight at their remaining but claude at any rate had noticed the failure in tone and on their way back after dinner he spoke about it in kindly fashion but so it seemed to dora with a matchless awkwardness sorry youre a bit off colour dear he said i know sirocco always makes you feel like that dora saw the obviously tactful intention her conscience also a little accused her and she knew quite well what he had in his mind and was probably going to say feel like what she said though she knew this to be useless fencing oh feel like what you felt when you said you were so glad the pater and mater were going to stop here i dont say that they noticed but i did i expect im quicker than them at feeling what you feel what you said was right enough it was just the way you said it he leaned forward in his seat a little looking her full in the face and somehow the sight of him and the proximity failed for once to make themselves felt his presence did not mitigate what he said or stamp it with the old magic i wish you would explain she said as if there was any need darling he said as if you dont understand as well as i do you said you were delighted they were stopping but only your voice said it whats wrong theres something up and i thought we were having such jolly days together father and mother are enjoying it ever so much and if they pretend they find it just a shade more delightful than they really do why its just to please you and make you feel its a success that they do it they settled to stop on i believe just for that this made matters no better dora felt she ought to be delighted they were doing so and ought to be touched and pleased with the reason claude had conjectured but she was not venice as a matter of fact or rather these days of venice were being spoiled for her she would as soon as claude had once said to her though with inverted meaning have spent them at clapham junction if the osbornes were to be with her it was a great pity that they should stop on if their motive in doing so was to gratify her she hoped it was not that oh i dont think that is it claude she said dad likeslikes the sun and theoh lots of things stuckis sugar factory for instance and your mother likes the pigeons and the shops but it isnt venice they like thats just what i say said he they stop to make you think they do they think the world of you you know yes the darlings said dora quickly thatthat makes it so pathetic pathetic you mean that you dont think so highly of them doras heart suddenly sank she had not meant that she had meant only that it was a pity they stayed in venice to please her when in reality she was not enjoying their stay she knew well that they were out of place in venice it was hopeless to try to explain but even if she had meant the other it would have been a fatal error on claudes part to put it into words he called this kind of frankness getting at the bottom of the thing she felt he was certain to use that phrase now he did so lets get at the bottom of it dear he said and as we always do i shall speak my mind just like you perhaps it will sound harsh to you im sorry if it does he leaned back again but without looking at him she could see that he tilted his head back and put his chin a little out the identical gesture which before she had found so attractive so fascinating even she had told him so too a hundred times had said she loved a man to know his mind to be firm and decided especially with those he loved best no doubt he remembered that at this moment perhaps even he was doing it consciously or at least halfconsciously so as to present what he had to say in the most attractive guise but suddenly and disconcertingly she found the gesture scarcely less than odious i think the paters been awfully good to you dear he said hes done a lot for you given you all sorts of things you had no reason to expect theres this month in venice to go no further than that well it will stand him in a pot of money and its just because he doesnt grudge you one penny of it that i think you ought to feel rather more cordial to him about their stopping i dont say that you behaved not cordially because i think what you said was all right and neither of them noticed that anything was awry but you hadnt got the right feelings to back up your tongue wait a moment ive not finished theres something more yet but i want to find words that wont hurt you and yet will express what i mean there was something in this that roused a certain sense in dora that she knew had been often present in her mind but which she hoped would always remain dormant but now it began to awake his words kind as they were implied an impossible attitude he was judging so it seemed to her making himself jury and judge all rolled into one and it was understood that she put in the dock before him would make no defence he knew that he was rightthat was what it came toand was going to tell her as kindly as possible what was right and on the instant she found herself refusing to be judged and condemned by his standards he did not know what venice meant to her or how essentially his fathers attitude toward the things and the place that she loved jarred on her and unfortunately the affair was typical of hundreds of other affairs that mr osborne had no artistic sense of any sort or kind did not matter but what was beginning to matter was that claude who apparently could not see that the entire absence of it in a person with whom she was brought into daylong contact made something rather hard to bear had put on his wig and was going to sum up on a matter about which he knew nothing her behaviour had never broken down he had said that himself and she believed it to be true the matter was that he could not understand that she had to struggle against the disappointment of spoiled days and was yet serenely confident that he had the complete data dont mind about hurting me she said quickly i want you to say exactly what you feel they had arrived at the watergate of their home without her noticing it and giovanni was already standing hat in hand to give her the support of his arm on to the steps which were slippery with the receding tide claude was conscious of this first he was quite conscious also of doras tone not before the servants he said get out dear and take giovannis arm the steps are like ice again dora was in revolt it seemed to her that he was advising her against a thing he might have done himself but which she could not have dreamed of she had been absorbed in thisthis dispute was ithad not noticed he had noticed and warned her against an impossible thing giovanni unlocked the door for them received orders for the next day and they went up the stairs together in silence and as they went up all the womanhood in doraand there was much of it and it was all sweet and goodrose flooding for the time the bitter gray mud flats that had appeared and at the top of the stairs she turned to him oh claude she said were not quarrelling are we takes two to make a quarrel he said and im not one but i want to say something yet and i think youd better hear it i ask you to in fact she unpinned her hat and led the way to the end of the big sala that overlooked the canal she sat down in her accustomed chair flinging the window open for the night was very hot say it then she said again claudes head went back he felt perfectly certain he was right well its just this youve told me not to choose my words so i wont bother to do so you havent felt right toward the pater and mater all this time here when he wanted to go and see a factory you wondered at himand yes you despised him a bit for it when he admired some picture you didnt think much of you wondered again now he never wondered at you if you wanted to sit half an hour before some adoring doge he never wondered any more than i wonder for there are lots of people in the world and theyve got their different tastes and every right to them but he only said to himself gosh theres something there and shes right only i dont know what it is shes looking at he never thought you wanting in perception because you didnt admire the iron in the fish market he only thought to himself lets go and see something this afternoon that dora does like how often has he gone to the national gallery in london never you bet he doesnt know a picture from a statue and how often has he gone to look at some mouldy old titian here because you thought it worth a look well isnt that anything its no use you and me not saying things straight out and so i say it straight out hes been boring himself fit to burst over your botticellis and been trying to admire them saying this was the biggest picture hed ever seen and this was the smallest and yet dear old dad wasnt boring himself because he was with you and trying to take an interest in what you showed him well then i ask you there close in front of her was the beautiful face the beautiful mouth which she loved saying things which as far as they went her essential nature entirely approved but at the moment his beauty did not move her and the account he had given was correct she had been having on her nerves the fact that mr osborne took more pleasure in the steamboats than in san rocco in the fish market than in the frati he might be right she might be right but in any case the attitudes were incompatible and claude at the moment clearly took up the attitude that was incompatible with hers there was much more too he did not see he did not see that indifference on doras part did not destroy his fathers pleasure in the speed of the steamboats whereas his artistic criticisms blackened her pictures for her and then womanlike again she knew only that claude was her man that he was beautiful that he loved her i dare say i am quite wrong she said i dare say you are quite right shall we leave it then darling i will tryi will try to do better i am sorry and there speaks my darling girl said claude chapter vii the stay in venice had naturally curtailed for mrs osborne the weeks of her london season but she had never intended to begin entertaining on the scale required by the prodigious success of the fancydress ball last year till after whitsuntide before leaving town in may she had sent out all invitations for the larger functions except those which her invited guests subsequently asked for on behalf of their friends and which she always granted and it was clear that the world in general was going to pass a good deal of its time at no indeed when she went through her engagement book on her return from venice to grote hospitable though she was and greatly enjoying the exercise of that admirable virtue she was rather appalled at the magnitude of what she had undertaken she was going to give three balls real balls three concerts two big dinner parties every week and a series of weekends down at grote while on such other nights as she was not dining out herself there were a series of little parties in addition sheffield friends coming to stay with them for the insides of weeks to finish up with one of the grote weekends these visits she looked forward to with peculiarly pleasant anticipations for the dear soul could not but feel an intense and secret gratification at the thought of such local celebrities as sir thomas and the prices seeing her and mr o absolutely at the top of the tree and entertaining princes and duchesses and what not just as they had entertained aldermen and manufacturers at sheffield also there was a secret that mr osborne had told her which filled her with feelings that were almost too solemn to be glee the secret was not to be talked about yet but in private he no longer called her mrs o but my lady she hoped sir thomas would be with them when the honours were published for secretly she still took her bearings so to speak by the stars as they appeared in sheffield there sir thomas ewart bart and lady had been the very polestar to which quite important constellations reverently pointed but now as by some new and wonderful telescope she saw herself and mr o high above sir thomas why even per would be the honourable per and sir thomas would have to say after you per my boy she and mr o had already had more than one broken night in thinking of a title which he could submit for approval mrs osborne was all for something old and territorial theres hurstmonceaux my dear she said that ruined old castle which we drove over to see when you was down at hastings with your attack of gout i dont doubt you could buy it for a song and there youll be and then next youd be wanting me to do up the castle and live in it said he besides its a regular stumper to say and french at that no my dear we must think of something more british than that theres plenty of good names without crossing the channel so to speak for something to call yourself by but its puzzling work and new to me to have to think of christening yourself afresh lor mr osborne you dont mean to say that youve got to change your christian name too no no my dear theres no christian name to bother about i dont deal any more in christian namesnot officially anyhow he blew out the light good night my dear he said and god bless you it was all very well to say good night but mrs osborne could no more sleep than she could think of a name after an interval she heard mr osborne turn himself ponderously round in his bed and knew that he was awake too theres some things called hundreds she said i seem to remember that all england is cut up into hundreds which is a queer thing to think upon itll be worth while seeing in what hundred the east end of sheffield lies theres something in that said mr osborne and it would bring the business into it lor mrs osborne my lady im glad i had nothing to say to a knighthood five years ago id have been put on the shelf for good if id jumped at it but not i its this parliamentary business coming on top of all i did at sheffield that has given the extra turn and ive been liberal im sure to the party what was the name of the street now where i built the church in sheffield i declare its gone out of my head thinking of new names drives the old ones out commercial road my dear said mrs osborne for i thought of the name myself when you was building the street then we aint no further on yet grote too thats not to be thought of as its lord austells second title after all we only take the place on hire said mrs osborne and it doesnt bring the business in thats what beats me said mr osborne how to bring the business in lord hardware tinware that would be a thing to laugh at the matter was still in debate on that morning when mrs osborne went through her engagement book down at grote and found so heavy a programme in front of her and somehow today she did not feel markedly exhilarated by it the journey back from venice had tired her very much and though she had felt sure that a good nights rest coupled with a day or two of solid english food would set her up again she still felt overdone and devitalized she was disposed to attribute this in the main to the unnutritious character of venetian diet where if you got a bit of veal for your dinner that was as much butchers meat as you were likely to see while to make up there would be nothing more than a slice of some unknown fish and the half of a chicken that was no bigger than a blackbird as for a nice filet of beef or a choice leg of lamb it was a thing unheard of yet she had not felt much inclined for the filet of beef when it was accessible again it seemed to suit her as little as the rice and maccaroni had done for the last week too she had had from time to time little attacks of internal pain no doubt it was of no consequence but it was a pain that she did not know and could not quite localize once or twice she had thought of consulting a doctor a thing that mr osborne had urged on her before the venetian visit but some vague and curious fear prevented herthe fear of being told that something was seriously wrong and that she would have to give up their london programme which she had planned so delightedly that was a thing not to be contemplated the london plans were to her mind part of the immutable order of things and it was therefore essentially important that mr osborne should not guess that she was out of sorts for she well knew if he had so much as a guess of that he would have carried her off by force if necessary and not let go of her till he had deposited her in some eminent consulting room with specialists dangling at the end of the telephone but she had never been lacking in spirit and it would be a singular thing if she could not be genial and hearty to all the world for a few weeks more but what she doubted was her power of getting through the physical strain of it she knew how tiring the standing about and the receiving was and every day now she felt tired even before the fatigues of it had begun if only she had a daughter who could quite naturally take some of this off her hands and let her sit down while the company were arriving and then an idea struck her dora and claude were intending to occupy the flat in mount street till the end of the summer after that they would come down to grote and soon please god the flat in mount street would be too small for them and what would be theirsthis elegant circumlocution was exactly the phrase that passed through mrs osbornes mindand when they returned to london again in the autumn it would be to a house of their own in green street with place for a nursery this however they were only going to take at michaelmas but dora had written to her motherinlaw this very morning and her innocent letter suggested possibilities to mrs osborne saying that mount street really seemed to be hotter than venice and dreadfully stuffy which venice was not what if dora and claude would come and live with them in park lane till the end of july she remembered how dora had acted hostess down at grote in the winter and they might play the game again but this time there would be a real object to be served by it dora would help her in the entertaining which prospectively as she planned it had seemed so delightful but now appeared so difficult it was an excellent idea if only she could compass it the large indian gong had already boomed through the house announcing that lunch was ready and next moment mr osborne came into her boudoir announcing that he was ready too venetian habit still lingered with him well lunch is pronto my lady he said but youre busy yet and still at the plan of campaign for the summer but in your plan of campaign dont forget the commissariat and heres your lieutenant marie come to tell you that my lady is served balls concerts dinners dinners balls concerts my lady is a regular whiteley to the lite she gives them all theres to be had youll be pauperizing the dukes and duchesses my dear theyll be thinking of nothing but the amusements you provide for them mrs osborne was not without the rudiments of diplomacy though it may be remarked nothing in the least advanced in that line was necessary with her husband still it was better that if possible he should suggest dora and claude coming to them than that she should she laughed dutifully at mr os joke about the dukes and duchesses and proceeded i had a note from dora this morning she said as they sat down bless her heart said mr osborne parenthetically for what we are going to receive my lady amen my dear theres some of that rice with bits of chicken in it as i got the recipe of from pietro and i could fancy a bit myself well she wrote and said she was very well and shed seenshed been to call in harley street mr osborne again interrupted and was anything said about september he asked there was some mention of september and there was something else too oh yes she finds that pokey little flat in mount street hotter than venice she says well then why dont she and claude take a cab round to no and let the luggage follow said mr osborne rather hotly claudes not got a grain of sense he should have thought of it long ago if dora feels it stuffy and hot there and suggested their installing themselves there cool and comfortable bless the boy all the same but after ive had my lunch ill get one end of the telephone and him the other and see if you dont hear the front door slam and them drive away to park lane before ive lit my cigar thatll suit you my lady will it youll like to have them dear children in the house i know bless them let them come said mrs osborne and the longer they stop the better i shall be pleased dora will be a help too she will help me with the dinners and what not the two were alone on this their last day at grote but all six waspcoloured footmen marshalled by thoresby formed a sort of frieze round the table occasionally changing a plate or handling a dish generous though he was with money mr osborne had very distinct notions about getting his moneys worth when he had paid it and since the house required six footmen he saw no reason why they should not all wait at table even when only he and mrs o were having their lunch nor was the number of dishes curtailed because they were alone mr osborne always ate of them all and because there was no company that was no reason why he should go starved it was not therefore for nearly an hour after the time they sat down that he went to the telephoneso accurately depicted by sabincourtand rang up claude he joined mrs osborne on the terrace a minute or two afterwards claudes willing enough and thank you he said but he says he must speak to dora first so youd better telephone to my lady and tell them to make ready whatever rooms you think right give them a nice sittingroom my dear so that they can feel independent better hear from dora first said mrs osborne just as you please but when the girl says as the flat in mount street is hot and stuffy and theres the coolest house in london waiting for her just round the corner i dont see theres much call to wait well my lady i must be off theres a committee been sitting in the lords on the bill about the employers liability act and i must get all theyve talked about at my fingers ends who knows but mrs o but that ill be able to tell them a thing or two in that chamber before the summers out its a strange thing to me how clever men such as have taken degrees and fellowships at oxford should have so little common sense on other matters as if there wasnt a difference between one sort of risk and another and they want to lump them all on to the employer i doubt most of them liberals are either socialists or afraid of the socialists but there the noble lords have had a committee and i must see whats been said and done just to think of it and have you got any idea about your new name yet no i daresay something will suggest itself after all i shall smell as sweet by any other name hey lor my dear said mrs osborne with a slight accent of reproof for thoresby had come to see if there were any orders and must have heard the question however about this move of dora and claude to park lane was not so foregone a conclusion as mr osborne had anticipated claude had gone to the telephone when he was rung up and came back beaming to tell dora of this delightful offer dad and the mater invite us to go to park lane till the end of july he said im blowed if there are many fathers who would want a son and daughterinlaw in the house all the time of course i said that i must consult you first that was only proper oh claude said she of course its awfully kind but but do you think so but why not its just like the governor to have guessed that we should feel stuffy and cramped in the flat during this hot weather dora remembered her letter im afraid i may be responsible for that she said at least i wrote to your mother yesterday saying it was very hot and airless here oh dear i hope she wont think i hinted at this not she you dont catch her imputing motives specially when there werent any shes got more to think about than that i say dora are you sure you didnt have that in your mind awfully sharp of you if you did dora resented this indignant that he could have supposed her capable of it and a little of this indignation coloured her words im afraid that i cant lay claim to sharpness she said because the fact is that if i had thought such an offer was possible i should have said it was cool and airy here claudes profile was outlined against the hot hard blue of the sky outside and dora noticed how perfect it was but she noticed it in some detached sort of way it did not seem to concern her at this he turned round and came across the room to her whats the matter dear he said why is it you dont want to go oh claude if you dont see you wouldnt understand if i explained she said and i cant quite explain either try he said well i married you do you see and you are master of the house and im mistress and it isnt quite the same thing if we go and live with other people they are angelic of course to suggest it but oh i wish people wouldnt be quite so kindor rather that they would mix a little tact with their kindness theyve made it hard to refuse telephoning like that itsits like a wordofmouth invitation for a month ahead youve got to say yes claude took up a rather listless hand of hers that lay on the arm of her chair ah then i do understand he said and i love your reasons i guessed it before you said it you want to be alone with me well its the same here but ive no doubt theyll give us a sitting room and all that though dora had meant something very like that it sounded rather dreadful to hear claude say it and say also that he had guessed he oughtnt to have guessed although he assured her it was the same here there was an unconscious complacency about his guessing that she did not like but he went on without pause as for its being tactless he said i think youre rather hard on the governor when a mans as kind as he can be and as devoted as he is to you i dont think you should say that claude stuck out his chin a little over this and dora though she knew he was right from his point of view knew that she had been right too kindness even the most sincere can easily be embarrassing it needs refining like sugar but that was the sort of thing that claude could not understand the tact of good nature had been left out of him just as it had been left out of his father so her reply was sincere yes dear it was a pity i said that she said but somehow the admission was bitter the truth was that it was a pity to say it because she ought to have been more careful in what she said to him not because the impulse that prompted her speech was a mistaken one but all that was unconjectured by him my darling he said you are so sweet with me if i have to criticise anything you do you never take it amiss and now ill tell you another reason why i think we had better go apart from the comfort and convenience of it it is that i dont think the mater is very strong for all that she eats so heartily she gets very easily tired and shes laid down a programme for the next six weeks which might well knock anybody out now it would be awfully good of you if you would help her with it that appealed to dora much more oh then lets go lets go she said telephone at once no i think i will i think dad would like me to you think of everything he said i hoped you would think of that hell be so pleased at your telephoning lewes you know claude had a meeting at brentwood that afternoon and had to leave immediately taking a cab to the station and the train from there so that dora might use the motor if she wished he felt that this was a perfectly natural and ordinary thing to do but at the same time he had to tell her he had done it it takes but a very little longer he said in answer to her urging him to take the motor himself and a walk from the station at the other end will do me good i wish i was going to prowl about with you all afternoon but men must work you know though when i come back i hope i shant find that youve been weeping but you wouldnt like your claudius imperator to be a drone goodbye my darling i shall be back in time to dine and take you to the play he lingered a moment still if you havent got anything special to do you might go down to richmond and have tea with uncle alf he said hed like it and you havent seen him for some time yes ill go by all means she said thanks dear you see after all he gives us fifteen thou a year dora ordered the motor and set off on her drive to richmond at once the day was exceedingly hot and the reverberation of the sun from the grilling pavements struck like a blow when she went out a languid airless wind raised stinging grit from the wood pavements and the reek of the streets hung heavy in the air she longed with an aching sense of physical want for the soft dustless atmosphere of venice the cluck and ripple of its green waterways and with no less an ache and thirst of the spirit for all that those things had once symbolized to her yet this last visit had not been the rapturous success of the one before venice was there unchanged with the gold mist of romance that claude had woven for her about it but he the magical weaver or she the woman for whom it had been woven had altered somehow and perhaps even in the enchanted city a certain vague but growing trouble that was in her mind would not be completely dissipated in general outline she knew what it was but hitherto she had not focussed her vision on it but now she felt that it had better be examined for it cried out to her from the darkness of her mind where she had been at pains to hide it perhaps on examination it might prove to be imagination only to have no real existence except in her own mind and the trouble was claude it seemed to her ages ago though in point of fact it was still scarcely twelve months that she had told may franklin that sometimes he said things that gave her a check but it seemed almost longer ago though it was only a few weeks that she had sat alone one afternoon when claude was at milan meeting his father and mother and registered the fact that he again gave her checks between those two occasions lay romance a golden dream an experience which common though it may be in this world of men and women was none the less marvellous miraculous he his love for her and her love for him had lifted life out of the levels on which it had hitherto moved had made of it a winged and iridescent thing which had soared manycoloured into sunlight and moonlight and that marvel the enchantment of it had seemed to her then to be a thing indestructible and eternal while she was she and while claude was claude it could never change nor shed one feather from its rainbow wings often had she whispered to him or he to her it will be like this for ever more often had the tense silence testified with greater authority than any voice even his in those months whatever her senses perceived was glorified she looked at the world through the radiance of love that conviction that their romance would last for ever was part of the divine madness of love she saw that now clearly enough she who had believed that they and they alone were different from all others had not been truly sane when she believed it she had been living in a world real no doubt while it existed yet not only capable of being extinguished but doomed to extinction once before their marriage she had talked to claude about what she called the graybusiness of life and he she remembered had given the graybusiness a facer to use his words by pointing to the example of his father and mother that had seemed to dora already ripening for romance to fall very short of the reply she wanted she had wanted lovers nonsense which would assure her that for them romance could never fade but it had faded it always faded the question now was concerned with what was left did even the consolation of claudes facer remain to her had she to put her part of it baldly and brutally got as great an admiration respect and affection for her husband as mrs osborne had for hers she knew she had not today she could look undazzled at the materials out of which her romance had been constructed and analyse them it was made of her passion for beauty she had fallen in love with his good looks and she was getting used to them she had got used to them what else was there what was left to learn now she had that by heart there was a great deal left so she told herself but without emotion there was his character left which was sterling his qualities which were excellent his kindness his safeness histo go to purely material thingshis wealth and his vulgarity the word was coined her thought for the first time definitely allowed it to pass into currency and she had to reckon with it what a topsyturvy affair it had been how strikingly different a disposition from that which she had contemplated had come about she had told herself that she must for ever be in love with that beautiful face that slim active body those deft decided movements and she had told herself that his vulgarities were things of no moment things to which she would swiftly get used but events had been evolved otherwise she was used to his beauty his vulgarities were cumulative in their effect on her instead of getting used to them she was daily more irritated by them andmore ashamed of them she had imagined even that it would be easy to cure them to eradicate them but it proved to be a task like that of emptying a spring with a teacup she had thought that they lay so to speak like casual water on the surface of the ground a mere puddle that the sun would swiftly drink up it was not so they sprang from his nature and came welling up bubbling and plenteous and inexhaustible and there was something about them so it seemed to her now that tinged and made unpalatable all the good qualities in which he was so rich you could draw a gallon of pure fresh kindness from that wellspring which was inexhaustible but even before you had time to put your lips to it and drink of it some dropquite a little dropwould trickle in from the source of his vulgarity and taint it all it was even worse than that there was a permanent leak from the one into the other the kindness was tainted at the source dora did not indulge in these reflections from any spirit of idle criticism or morbid dissection she wanted to see how they stood how bad things were and what chance there was of their righting themselves they were no longer mere surface vulgarities in him or so she believed that got on her nerves she no longer particularly minded whether he said handsome lady or not what she did mind was the impulse that prompted him for instance to suggest that she might go down and see uncle alf because he gave them fifteen thou a year she minded his saying he had guessed the reason why she did not want to establish herself in park lane namely because she wanted to be alone with him she minded the suggestion that she had written to say the flat was stuffy in order to be asked there it was all common common he judged her by impossible standards standards that were inconceivable and yet all the time he was good he was kind he had all the qualities that should make her love him make her devotion an imperishable thing as it was they had been married scarcely six months and already she knew that at times he so got on to her nerves that she could have screamed already as she began to look closely at these things she felt she was glad they were going to park lane she was glad that limitations were placed on her being alone with him it was a little cooler out of town and richmond park was in the full luxuriance of its summer beauty they had entered by the roehampton gate she had still half an hour to spare before the time she had said she would be at uncle alfreds and she directed her driver to turn up to the left past the white lodge and go round by robin hood gate and kingston gate a delicious smell of greenness and coolness came from the noble groves of trees beneath the clear shade of which kneedeep in the varnished green of the young bracken stood herds of fallow deer with twitching ears and switching tails warding off the persistence of the flies all the sweet forest sights and sounds were there the air was full of the buzz of insects and hidden birds called to each other from among the branches distantly on the right she could see gleams of water where the pen ponds lay basking in the sunlight and the flush of mauve and red from the great rhododendron thickets above them all the triumph of summer time was there all the joy of the ripeness and maturity of the year of the kindled and immortal vitality of the world but for herself though every day brought nearer to her the miracle of motherhood it seemed as if summer had stopped once more she faced the situation as she conceived it to be the time of romance those months in the autumn were over the red and gold of the autumn were withered from the trees brief had been their glory which should have shed its light over many years yet but as far as she was concerned what had made their flame was just the personal beauty of her husband and out of them should already have sprung a deep and tender affection the friendship which is not only the true and noble sequel of love but is an integral part of love itself perhaps even loves heart but was it there it seemed to her rather that something bitter had come out of it something in which regret for the past was mingled with the gall of disillusionment and even regret had but small part in it those months of gold seemed already unreal to her she felt that she was regretting a dream it was the same in little things too for the little things all took their colour from what had been to her then the one great reality he had referred to himself for instance that very afternoon as claudius imperator and it was with a sense of unreality that she remembered the genesis of that very microscopic joke she had bought a roman coin in venice with that inscription on it and had given it to him saying it was his label in case he was lost today she could not conceive doing such a thing she could not recapture the state of mind in which she did it the impulse even that made such a trifle conceivable in any case the thing was one that might be said once and then be forgotten but claude had the retentive osborne sense of humour with him it was once a joke always a joke and from time to time as today he brought out the claudius imperator again the osborne humour had a heavy treada slow heavy slouching rustic treadand a guffaw of a laugh there is a spectator within each of us who for ever watches our thoughts and words and criticises them it may be called conscience or guidance or the devil as the case may be for some folk are gifted with a spectator that is their best self others with a spectator which is but a parody of themselves doras spectator was above the average he was optimistic anyhow and kindly and at this point he came to her aid with so to speak several smart raps over her knuckles whatever was the truth of the whole matterif indeed there is any absolute truth to be arrived at in the fluid and evervarying adjustments of our relationships with othersonly one attitude is compatible with selfrespect namely to find out and hoard like grains of gold all that is fine and generous and lovable in others and do our best to find something in ourselves worthy of being matched with it instead of this so said doras spectator to her now she had with acute and avid eye been picking out all that in claude seemed to her to be trivial or ludicrous or tiresome and been finding in herself to match it intolerance and want of charity there had been no difficulty so said her spectator in laying hands on plenty of those she had but one word to say in selfdefence and the moment it was said she perceived that it amounted to selfaccusation she had fallen in love with his beauty how could she not despond when she found that she was in love with itlike thatno longer it had blinded her to all else she had seen his vulgarities but dimly if at all even as she had seen his panoply of excellent qualities but dimly now she saw only the vulgarities or at any rate she saw them right in the foreground big and blinding while behind in the distance so to speak sat the rest of him was it not reasonable that her outlook which must take its colour from the past should be pessimistic and then even that piece of selfdefence was turned into selfaccusation if that was the case the fault had been hers from the beginning but that was what she had done she had separated him the man into packets she had fallen in love with one packet and now she was spreading in front of her another that only irritated and almost disgusted her she had yet to learn the true and the wider outlook to feel that fire of love that fuses all things together and loves though it can tenderly laugh and is gentle always and rejoices in the weaknesses and imperfections and faults of the beloved simply because they are his for though there are many ways of love the spirit that animates them all is just that they are all swayed by one magical tune but that dora did not yet know she had not heard a note of it she did not even know the region of the soul where it made melody all day long all that she had learned in the last few minutes was that she had with considerable acuteness been spying out causes for complaint excuses for dissatisfaction she could do a little better than that by this time she had arrived at uncle alfs and though the severe remarks of the spectator had partially braced her again after the rather sloppy abandonment of selfpity and dejection into which her introspection had brought her it must be confessed that there was something about uncle alf caustic and malicious though he was that restored her more efficaciously for out of all the weapons with which it is fair to fight the disappointments and despondencies that are incidental to human life there is none sharper or more rapierlike in attack or defence than the sense of humour and uncle alf was well equipped there not even the picture dealer whom he habitually worsted would have denied that he had that it was lambent and illnatured it twinkled and stung but it had the enviable trick of perceiving what was ludicrous and i hear poor old eddie has been out with you and claude in venice my dear he said and i cant say which im the most sorry foryou or him or claude or venice oh why claude asked she for she had not thought of being sorry for claude because you had taught him probably to admire tintoretor say he didand eddie would want him to admire the railway station he would have to trim a very funny party you must have been my dear dora laughed till this moment she had thought of them all as a rather tragic party and the other aspect had not occurred to her do you know i expect we were she said and all the time i took it seriously i wonder if that was a mistake uncle alf to be sure it was theres many things in this world that will depress you and make you good for nothing if you take them seriously and that cheer you up if you dont that was not exactly wisdom out of the mouths of babes and sucklings since uncle alf was a very old man but it was a sort of elementary wisdom which a child might have hit on and she felt that below the surface of this wizened crabbed little old man there was something that was human she had never suspected it before in her shallowness she had been content to look upon him as a mask with a moneybag to be sure he was devoted to claude she had not even reckoned with what that implied not given him credit for the power of feeling affection i believe you are right she said and when youre as old as me my dear you will know it said he lord ive had a lot of amusement out of lifedigging for it you understand not picking it up poor old eddie amuses me more than i can say why his hair is turning gray with success and pleasure ah not a word against him said dora hes the kindest dad that ever lived i daresay but there are things to laugh at in poor old eddie thank god he and his grote and his park lane and all did you ever see such a setout my dear but eddie in venice must have been a shade finer yet tell me about it he and maria on the grand canal and you and claude all in the same gondola ill be bound so as to make a family party this is the way we english go good lord i wouldnt have been your gondoliers on a hot day not even for the entertainment of seeing you all like noahs ark your gondoliers were thin men that evening my dear poor devils alfred had guessed the situation with the unerring eye of cynical malice and his words brought the scene back to dora with amazing accuracy that day had depressed her at the time she had never guessed how funny it was and here she was laughing at it now when it was a month old alfred continued eddie among the pictures too he said a bull in a china shop would have been more suitably housed why i nearly came out myself in order to see the fun what a holy look theres about that maria hed say or my i dont believe it would go into the gallery at grote unless you took the roof off and he wrote to me yesterday that he had bought a copy of that housemaid among the clouds by titianwhat a daub my dearwith a frame to match it was too much for uncle alfred and he gave a series of little squeaks on a very high note shaking his head eddies a silly man he said a very silly man is poor old eddie and he gets sillier as he gets older what does he want with his assumption of the virgin and his six powdered footmen what good do they do him as little as my liniment does me lord my dear he says something too in his letter that makes me think theyre going to make a peer of him he hints it ah i wish id kept the letter but it made me feel sick and i threw it away but eddie a peer my dear and i saw in a leader in the times the other day that the prime minister hadnt got a sense of humour i reckon theyll sack that leader writer if its true that eddies going to have a peerage lord deliver us lord saucepan lets think of half a dozen names and send some picture post cards of venice to lord saucepan care of mr osborne park lane lord lavatory lord kitchensink fancy per too an honourable and mrs per my dear i hate that woman worse than poison i should like to smack her face she thinks shes a lady and maria thinks shes a lady why marias more of a lady herselfand thats not saying much to see mrs per and you talking together about art or acting would make a cat laugh i wonder at your marrying claude when you thought of his relations dora smiled at him but thats just what i didnt do she said i only thought of claude and well you might my dear i love that boy hes got into proper hands too you can make a lot of him lord toastingfork lord eggwhisk lord fryingpan uncle alfred could not get away from inventing titles for poor old eddie and he did it with a malicious relish that was rather instructive to dora it could not be called kind but it hurt nobody and his frank amusement at the idea of the peerage was certainly better than the heartsinkings with which the prospect of the event had inspired dora when she thought of the genial pomposity with which it would be received throughout she had been too heavy too ponderous she had pulled long faces instead of laughing had seen the depressing side of expeditions like the family party in the gondola instead of its humorous aspect that was a hint worth attending to she had got a sense of humour so she believed yet somehow it had never occurred to her to look at those spoiled days of venice in a humorous light soon she rose to go uncle alfred she said youve done me good do you know it is better to be amused than depressed isnt it yes my dear and i hope youll laugh at me all the way back to town me and my greatcoat on a day like this and my goloshes to keep the damp out and a strip of flannel i assure you round the small of my back eh i had the lumbago bad when first i saw you down at grote but the sight of those pictures of sabincourts of eddie and maria did me more good than a pint of liniment what a pair of guys lord and lady biscuittin dora laughed again how horrid of you she said well i must go claude and i are going to the theatre tonight and we are leaving the flat in mount street uncle alf and are to live in the house in park lane till the end of the season wasnt it kind of dad to suggest it not a bit of it youll help entertain marias fine friends half of whom she dont know by sight not but what i envy you marias as good as a play down at grote and maria in london must be enough to empty the musichalls she does too so they tell me she asks everybody in the london directory and they all come goodbye my dear come down again some time and tell me all they do and say write it down every evening else ones liable to forget the plums dora had given orders that their personal luggage should be transferred from the flat to no during the afternoon and on her return she drove straight to that house claude had already arrived and was sitting in the big italian drawing room he had had a most successful meeting and was in excellent spirits this is a bit better than the flat he said i went in there just now and it was like a furnace but here you wouldnt know it was a hot day its a handsome apartment the governor bought nothing but the best when he had it done and hows uncle alf very well i thought and very amusing said she oh claude he had a greatcoat on and goloshes he is too funny claude did not reply for a moment darling i hate criticising you he said at length but i dont think you ought to laugh at uncle alf considering all he does for us but he recommended me to said she he said he hoped i should laugh at him all the way back to town in fact we talked about laughing at people and he said what a good plan it was claude paused again he felt strongly about this subject did he laugh at the governor he asked well yes a little said dora i hope you stuck up for him im sure you did dora gave a hopeless little sigh she wondered if uncle alfred could have seen the humorous aspect of this personally she could not it was no question of sticking up for him she said it was all chaff fun claude got up with his chin a good deal protruded ah fun is all very well in its right place he said and im sure no one likes a joke more than me but there are certain things one should hold exempt from ones fun dora tried the humorous plan recommended by uncle alfred darling i hope you dont consider yourself exempt she said i am laughing at you now you are ridiculous dear you take things heavily and i do too we must try not to so i hereby give you leave to laugh at mother and austell as much as you likeand me dora i am serious he said i know that is just the trouble she said still lightly claudes face darkened well its a trouble you must learn to put up with he said rather sharply i daresay im oldfashioned you may call me what you like but i ask you to respect my father i daresay he and the mater seem to you ridiculous at times if they do i ask you to keep your humorous observations to yourself i hate speaking like this but i am obliged to dora felt her hands grow suddenly cold and damp she was not afraid of him exactly but there was some physical shrinking from him that was rather like fear i dont see the obligation she said perhaps not it is sufficient that i do now lets have done we spoke on the same subject your attitude to my father in venice dont let us speak of it again you say your say and i am to make no reply is that it she asked yes that is it i know i am right come dora but the appeal had no effect and for the moment she did not know how to apply uncle alfs wise counsels and if i know you are wrong she asked if i tell you that you dont understand it will make no difference look here the governor has done lots for you youve never expressed a wish but what he hasnt gratified then ask him if he is satisfied with my attitude toward him said dora see what he says tell him that uncle alfred has laughed at him and i laughed too tell him all i wouldnt hurt him like that said claude dora walked to the window and back again she felt helpless in a situation she believed to be trivial but she could not laugh it off she could think of no light reply that would act as a dissolvent to it and if she could find no light reply only a serious answer or silence was possible she chose the latter if more words were to be said she wished that claude should have the responsibility of them eventually he took it and im sure weve all been good enough to your people he said made them welcome at grote for as long as they chose and behaved friendly and it was only ten minutes before you came in that i wrote to jim telling him he could live in the flat and welcome till the end of july i dont see what i could do more the logical reply was on the tip of doras tonguethe reply that did not cost you anythingbut she let it get no further only she rebelled against the thought that it was a kindness to do something that did not cost anything he thought it was kindand so in a way it wasto give jim the flat rent free he might perhaps have let it for fifty pounds but he did not want fifty pounds yet he thought that it was kind it seemed to him kind it must be taken at that it was no use arguing going into the reasons for which it was no real kindness at all and he had told her that now she felt sure to contrast his friendliness to her relations with her ridiculeso he would put itof his but he had done his best she was bound to take it like that not point out the cheapness of it claude dear that was nice of you she said searching for anything that should magnify his kindness and jim will be an awful tenant he will leave your books about and smoke your cigars i hope youve locked them up not a thing said he he just steps in hell find a sovereign on my dressing table i believe if he looks and a box of cigars in a drawer of my writing table which hes welcome to one doesnt bother about things like that that was the worst the parade of generosity could not go further than saying that there was no parade at all dora could not reply any more to that she could only repeat its awfully kind of you she said again we must go and dress if we are to be in time for the first act chapter viii though it was true that claudes kindness in lending austell his flat did not cost him anything it conferred a great convenience on his beneficiary and jim who had been living at the bath club had his luggage packed without pause and wrote the letter of acceptance and thanks to claude from the flat itself on claudes writing paper the letter was quite genuine and heartfelt or at the least pocketfelt for jim had had some slight difference of opinion with his mother on the subject of being seen in a hansom with a young lady who in turn was sometimes seen on the stage and eaton place where he had meant to spend those weeks was closed to him but claudes flat filled the bill exactly it was far more comfortable than his mothers house and there was nothing to pay for lodging so that it was better than the club his satisfaction was complete when he found that claude had left his cook there with no instructions whatever except to go on cooking nor any orders to have catering bills sent to the tenant so jim made himself charming to the cook gave her the sovereign which he had at once found on claudes dressing table when he explored his bedroom and said he would be at home for lunch plovers eggs yes by all means and a quail and a little macdoine of fruit and by way of burying the hatchet with his mother and incidentally making her green with envy for it would have suited her very well if claude had offered her the flat since somebody wanted to take her house he instantly telephoned asking her to lunch and mentioned that he was in mount street till the end of july the lunch she declined and made no comment on the other but jim heard her sigh into the telephone she could not hear him grin as had been mentioned before jim had no liking for claude and up till the present he had done little living upon him but this loan of the flatespecially since there was free food goingwas extremely opportune for at the present moment jim was particularly hard up having been through a derby week of the most catastrophic nature he had done nothing rash too which made his misfortunes harder to bear he had acted on no secret and mysterious tips from the stables but had with the most plebeian respectability backed favourites only but the favourites had behaved in the most unaccountable manner and their blighted careers had very nearly succeeded in completely blighting his but he had raised money on the rent of grote which would be paid him at the end of the month and had paid up all his debts that process however had made fearful inroads on his receipts for the next quarter and strict economy being necessary claudes kindness had been most welcome and as he ate his quail jim planned two or three pleasant little dinner parties he would certainly ask claude and dora to one of them or was that a rather ironical thing to do since claude would be paying for the food that they all ate he would pay for the wine as well it seemed for a bottle of excellent moselle had appeared since he had expressed a preference that way coming he supposed from claudes cellar jim looked round the room as he ate and drank pleased to find himself in this unexpected little haven of rest but feeling at the same time envious of and rather resentful towards its possessor he quite sympathised with the doctrine of socialism and asked himself why it should be given to claude to live perpetually in that diviner air where financial anxieties are unknown where no bills need ever remain unpaid except because it was a nuisance to have to dip a pen in the ink and draw a cheque whereas he himself was as perpetually in want of money the particular reason why he was in this moment in want of it namely because he had had a very bad week at epsom did not present itself to his mind or if it did was dismissed as being an ephemeral detail perhaps in this one instance that was the reason why just now he was so absurdly hard up but the general question was what occupied him claude was rich he was poor where was the justice of it he liked prints too and why should claude be able to cover his dining room walls with these delightful first impressions while he could not indeed he had no dining room at all in which he could hang prints even if he possessed them his dining room was let to mr osborne who it was said was going to be made a peer and on their walls hung the stupendous presentments of him and his wife and claude had married his sister everything came to those who had chequebooks well perhaps the ascot week would make things pleasanter again he had a book there which could hardly prove a disappointment if it didbut so untoward a possibility presented no features that were at all attractive to contemplate he finished his lunch and then made a more detailed tour of the flat it was delightfully furnished probably uncle alf was responsible for all this since it was clearly out of the ken of any other osborne and everything breathed of that luxurious sort of simplicity which is so far beyond the reach of those who have to make sovereigns exercise their utmost power of purchase by the way he had taken a sovereign which was lying about on claudes dressingtable and given it to the cook he must remember to tell claude that for claude might remember if he did not and pay him next that room was the bathroom whitewalled and whitetiled with all manner of squirts and douches to refresh and cool then came a second bedroom then the dining room in which he had just now so delicately fed then the drawing room out of which opened a smaller sitting room clearly claudes there was a big writing table in it with drawers on each side and jim amused himself by opening these for they were all unlocked and looking at their contents certainly claude did things handsomely when he lent his flat for in the first drawer that jim opened was a box of cigarettes and one of cigars these latter smelt quite excellent and jim put back the cigarette he had taken from the other box and took a cigar instead in another drawer were paper and envelopes stamped with a crest no doubt the outcome of the ingenuity of the heralds college in another a pile of letters some of which jim recognized to be doras handwriting this drawer he closed again at once it was scarcely a temptation not to do so since he only cared quite vaguely to know what dora found to say to her promesso in another drawer were a few photographs a few invitation cards an engagement book and a chequebook this latter was apparently an old one for it was stiff and full toward the back with counterfoils while the covers drooped together halfway down it jim could not resist opening this nor did he try to he wanted to know and there was no harm done if he did what sort of sums claude spent but on opening it he saw that it was not quite empty of its cheques yet the last but one in the book had not been torn out but was blank as was also the counterfoil then came the last counterfoil on which was written the date which was yesterday and a scrawled books dora and an item of some then he turned over the earlier counterfoils there was a big cheque to daimler no doubt for his car another scandalously large it seemed to jim to his tailor more books several entered simply as venice and several on which there was nothing written at all apparently in such instances claude had just drawn a cheque and not worried to fill in the counterfoil that again was the sort of insouciance that jim envied it was only possible to very rich people or remarkably careless ones whereas he was poor but remarkably careful as to the payment of money the blank cheque forgotten apparently for the chequebook tossed away with a heap of old invitation cards looked as if it was thought to be finished with was an instance the more of this enviable security about money matters and jim felt more socialistic than ever he shut the drawer up and examined the rest of the room having lit the cigar which he had taken from the box and which he found to be as excellent to the palate as it was to the nostril the room reeked of quiet opulence there was a bookcase full of wellbound volumes a pianola of the latest type two or three more prints the overflow from the dining room and a couple of empire armchairs in which comfort and beauty were mated and on the floor was an aubusson carpet and though feeling envious and socialistic jim felt that it would be quite possible to be very comfortable here for the next six or seven weeks like most people who have suffered all their lives from want of money and have yet managed to live in a thoroughly extravagant manner jim had been so often under obligations to others that heaven suiting we must suppose the back to the burden had made him by this time unconscious of such he accepted such offers as this of the flat with a gay lightheartedness that was not without its charm and made also the undoubted difficulty of conferring no less than accepting a favour gracefully easy to the giver but he did not like claude and had a sufficiently firm conviction that claude did not like him to take the edge off his enjoyment why claude should not like him he could not tell he had always been more than pleasant to his brotherinlaw and when they met they always owing to a natural and easy knack of volubility which jim possessed got on quite nicely together this minute inspection of the flat had taken jim some time and when it was completed he strolled out to pay a call or two see if there was any racing news of interest and go round to the osbornes to have a talk to dora whom he had not seen since she had returned from venice and in person express his gratitude for the timely gift of the flat he found her in but alone mr and mrs osborne were expected that afternoon it was really extremely kind of claude to think of it he said and most opportune i had the rottenest epsom and really was at my wits end you are probably beginning to forget what that means oh by the way i found a sovereign of claudes on his dressing table and gave it to the cook in order to promote good feelingor was it ten shillings dora laughed this was characteristic of jim but she was used to it and did not make sermon to him i feel quite certain it was a sovereign jim she said i will bet if you like we will ask the cook what you gave her i daresay you are right ah you expect claude though i will give it him when he comes in have you seen mother she and i are not on terms just now but it does not matter as i have claudes flat what have you been doing nothing she did it all i hadnt the least wish to cut her in fact i wanted to stay in eaton place until the flat came along and when it did i wished to give her a slice of my luck and i asked her to lunch she said no but sighed the sigh was not about lunch but about the flat she would have liked it by jove dora youre nicely housed here its a neat little box as mr o would say dora gave a short laugh not very merry in tone ah thats one of the things we mustnt say she observed ive been catching it from claude he says hes respectful to my family but im not respectful to his jim paused with his cup in his hand been having a row he asked make it up at once say you were wrong but i wasnt said she that doesnt matter what does matter is that you should let the purseholders have everything all their own way then everything slips along easily and comfortably oh money she said who cares about the money jim opened his eyes very wide i do very much he said and so did you up till a year ago it is silly to say that money doesnt matter just because you have a lot its only the presence of a lot that enables you to say so yes thats true she said and it adds to ones pleasure but it doesnt add to ones happiness not one jot im just as capable of being unhappy now as ever i was not that i am unhappy in the least jim nodded sympathetically you look rather worried he said so youve been having a bit of a turnup with claude thats the worst of being married if i have a shindy with anyone i walk away and unless the other fellow follows the shindy stops but you cant walk away from your husband dora was silent a moment considering whether she should talk to her brother about these things which troubled her or not she had tried to find a solution for them by herself but had been unable and she had a great opinion of his practical shrewdness it was not likely that he would suggest anything fine or altruistic because he was not of that particular build but he might be able to suggest something yes weve been having a bit of a turnup as you call it she said that doesnt matter so much but what bothers me rather is our totally different way of looking at things im awfully fond of dad i am really but it would be childish if i pretended that i dont seewellhumorous things about him you see one has either to be amused by such thingsi only learned that yesterday from uncle alfor else take them tragically at venice i took them tragically i thought it dreadful that he liked to see the sugar factory better than anything else and if it isnt dreadful its got to be funny its either funny or vulgar theres nothing else for it to be and then claudeoh dear i told him he was at liberty to laugh at you and mother as much as he chose but he didnt appear to want to i dont think hes got any sense of humour there are heaps and heaps of ridiculous things about you both good gracious you never thought he had any sense of humour did you asked jim earnestly i dont know i dont think i thought about it at all and thats not the worst jim put his head on one side and doras estimate of his shrewdness was justified do you mean that you are beginning to mind about his beingernot quite he asked delicately dora nodded yes thats it she said what a pity i hoped you wouldnt mind you appeared not to at first one hoped you would get used to it before it got on your nerves cant you put it away wrap it up and put it away do you suppose i keep it in front of me for fun she asked oh jim is it beastly of me to tell you theres really no one else to tell i couldnt tell mother because sheswell shes not very helpful about that sort of thing and talks about true nobility being the really important thing that and truth and honour and kindness that is such parrottalk you know it is just repeating what we have all heard a million of times no doubt it is true but what if one cant realize it i used always to suppose shakespeare was a great author till i saw hamlet which bored me and i had to tell somebody what am i to do why apply to claude what youve been saying about mr osborne said he there are things about him which are dreadful unless you tell yourself they are funny well tell yourself they are funny i hope they are wont that help i dont know perhaps it might but there are things that are funny at a little distance which cease to amuse when they come quite close uncle alf made me think that the humorous solution would solve everything but it doesnt really it only solves the things that dont really matter dora dined quietly at home that night with mr and mrs osborne and claude and after dinner had a talk to her motherinlaw while the other two lingered in the dining room why it was like seeing a fire through the window to welcome you when you got home of a cold evening said mrs osborne cordially to see your face at the head of the stairs my dear mr osbornes been wondering all the way up whether you and claude would be dining at home tonight bless you if hes said it once hes said it fifty times i love being wanted said dora quickly well its wanted that you are by him and me and everyone else and my dear im glad to think youll be by my elbow at all my parties to help me and say whos who and we lead off tomorrow with a big dinner theres thirty to table and a reception after just to let it be known as how the house is open again and all and sundry will be welcome of course youll have your own engagements as well my dear and many of them im sure and no wonder and theres nothing i wish less than to stand in the way of them but whenever youve an evening to spare you give a thought to me and say to yourself well if im wanted nowhere else theres motherll be looking out for me at the head of the stairs dora laughed i accept your invitations to all your balls and all your concerts and as many as possible of your dinners she said youll get sick of the sight of my face before the season is over that i never shall my dear said mrs osborne nor afterward neither and youll come down to grote wont you after july and stay quiet there till the little blessed one comes if you dont mind my alluding to it my dear as im going to be its grandmother though its a thing i never should do if there was anybody else but you and me present lord and it seems only yesterday that i was expecting my own firstborn and mr o in such a taking as you never see and me so calm and all just longing for my time to come and thinking nothing at all of the pain for such as there is dont count against seeing your baby but you leave claude to me and ill pull him through bless him i warrant hell need more cheering and comforting than you and are you sure your rooms are comfortable here dearie i thought the suite at the back of the house would be more to your liking than the front being quieter for to be sure if you are so good as to come and keep us old folks company the least we can do is to see that you have things to your taste and dont get woke by those roaring motorbuses or the stream of vegetables for the market but they are delightful said dora theyve given me the dearest little sitting room with bedroom and bathroom all together mrs osborne beamed contentedly she had had a couple of days without any return of pain and as she said she had had a better relish for her dinner tonight than for many days well then lets hope we shall all be comfortable and happy she said and i dont mind telling you now my dear that ive been out of sorts and not up to my victuals for a fortnight past but today i feel hearty again though i get tired easily still but dont you breathe a word of that promise me to mr osborne or claude for what with the honour as is going to be done to mr o and the thought of his grandchild getting closer and him back to work again which after all suits him best i wouldnt take the edge off his enjoyment if you were to ask me on your bended knees which i should do if he thought i was out of sorts lord there he comes now arminarm with claude i declare hes like a boy again with the thought of all as is coming the evening of the next day accordingly saw with flare of light and blare of band the beginning of the hospitalities of no park lane the doors of which so it appeared to dora were never afterward shut day or night except during the weekends when the doors of grote flew open and the scene of hospitality changed to that of the country yet cordial though it all was it was insensate hospitalityhospitality gone mad had some hotel announced that anyone of any consequence could dine there without charge and ask friends to dine on the same easy terms such an offer would have diverted the crowds of carriages from park lane and sent them to the hotel instead full as her programme originally was mrs osborne could not resist the pleasure of added hospitalities and little dances got up in impromptu fashion with much telephoning and leaving of cards were wedged in between the big ones and became big themselves before the night arrived scores of guests utterly unknown to their hosts crowded the rooms and for them all known and unknown alike mrs osborne had the same genial and genuine cordiality of welcome it was sufficient for her that they had crossed her threshold and would drink mr os champagne and eat her capons she was glad to see them all she had a shocking memory for faces but that made no difference since nothing could exceed the geniality of her greeting to those whom she had never set eyes on before it was a good moment too when not so long after the beginning of her hospitalities her secretary whose duty it was to enter the names of all callers in the immense volume dedicated to that purpose reported that a second calling book was necessary since the space allotted to the letters with which the majority of names began was full she could not have imagined a year ago that this would ever happen yet here at the beginning of her second season only more space had to be found and doras name for the second volume supplement to the court guide was most gratifying alfs allusion to the london directory though equally true would not have been so satisfactory but her brave and cheerful soul needed all its gallantry for it was an incessant struggle with her to conceal the weariness and discomfort which were always with her and which she was so afraid she would in spite of herself betray to others there were days of pain too not as yet very severe but of a sort that frightened her and her appetite failed her this she could conceal without difficulty for the most part since the times were few on which her husband was not sitting at some distance from her with many guests intervening but once or twice when they were alone she was afraid he would notice her abstention and question her her high colour also began to fade from her cheeks and lips and she made one daring but tremulous experiment with rouge and lipsalve to hide this she sent her maid out of the room before the attempt and then applied the pigments but with disastrous results lor mr o will think its some woman of the music halls instead of his wife she said to herself and wiped off again the unusual brilliance but though sometimes her courage faltered it never gave way she had determined not to spoil these weeks for her husband it was to be a blaze of triumph afterward she would go to the doctor and learn that she had been frightening herself to no purpose or that there was something wrong and those endless hospitalities this stream of people who passed in and out of the house though they tired her they also served to divert her and take her mind off her discomforts and alarms she had to be in her place though dora took much of the burden of it off her shoulders to shake hands with streams of people and saywhich was perfectly truehow pleased she was to see them friends from sheffield for she never in her life dropped an old acquaintance came to stay and the pleasurable anticipation she had had of letting them see a bit of real london life fell short of the reality best of all sir thomas and lady ewart were in the house when the list of honours appeared in the paper it happened dramatically and the drama of it was planned and contrived by claude he came down rather late to breakfast having given orders that this morning no papers were to be put in their usual place in the dining room and went straight up to his father good morning my lord he said hey what said mr osborne poking your fun at me are you theres something about you in the papers my lord well i never lets see said mr osborne he unfolded the paper claude had brought him my lady he said across the table to his wife thisll interest you list of honours peerages edward osborne esquire m p it was a triumphant success sir thomas actually thought that it was news to them both and went so far as to lay down his knife and fork bless my soul he said well im sure there never was an honour more deservedly won nor what will be more dignifiedly worn mr osborne could not keep it up well well he said of course weve known all along but claude would have his joke and pretend it was news to us thank ye sir thomas im sure maria my dear im told your new coronets come home pass it to my lady claude as if by a conjuring trick he produced from under the table cloth an allround tiara of immense diamonds which had been previously balanced on his knees mrs osborne had had no idea of this that part of the ceremony had been kept from her put it on maria my dear he said and if theres a peeress in the land as better deserves her coronet than you i should be proud to meet her let the honourable claude settle it comfortable for you my dear claude my boy im jealous of you because youre an honourable which is more than your poor old dad ever was the deft hands of the honourable adjusted the tiara for her and she got up to salute the donor if it isnt the measure of my head exactly she said well i never and me not knowing a word about it meantime as june drew to its close in this whirl of engagements and socialities the estrangement between dora and claude grew though not more acute in itself more of a habit and the very passage of time instead of softening it rendered it harder to soften had they been alone in their flat it is probable that some intolerable moment would have come breaking down that which stood between them or in any case compelling them to talk it out or a thing which would have been better than nothing bringing this cold alienation up to the hot level of a quarrel which could have been made up and which when made up might have carried away with it much of the cause of this growing constraint as it was there was no quarrel and thus there was nothing to make up claude on his side believed that his wife still rather resented certain remarks he had made to her at venice and here on the subject of her attitude toward his father contrasting it unfavourably with the appreciation and kindness which his family had shewn hers in his rather hard thoroughly wellmeaning and perfectly just manner he examined and reexamined any cause of complaint which she could conceive herself to have on the subject and entirely acquitted himself of blame he did not see that he could have done differently he had not been unkind only firm and his firmness was based upon his sense of right but in this examination he of course utterly failed to recognize the real ground of the estrangement which was as dora knew not any one particular speech or action of his but rather the spirit and the nature which lay behind every speech every action this she was incapable of telling him and even if she had been able to do so no good end would have been served by it she had married him not knowing him or at the least blinded by superficialities and now getting below those or getting used to them she found that there were things to which she could not get used but which on the contrary seemed to her to be getting every day more glaringly disagreeable to her he not knowing this did his best to remove what he believed had been the cause of their estrangement by praise and commendation of what he called to himself her altered behaviour for there was no doubt whatever that now at any rate dora was behaving delightfully to his parents she took much of the work of entertaining off mrs osbornes hands made but few engagements of her own in order to be more actively useful in the house and was in every sense the most loyal and dutiful of daughtersinlaw she also very gently and tactfully got leave to revise mrs osbornes visiting list and drew a somewhat ruthless lead pencil through a considerable number of the names for in the early days to leave a card meant as a matter of course to be asked to the house this luxuriant and exotic garden wanted a little weeding all this seemed to claude to be the happy fruits of his criticism and the consciousness of it in his mind did not improve the flavour of his speeches to dora they were but little alone owing to the high pressure of their days but one evening about a fortnight after they had moved into park lane he found her resting in her sitting room before dressing there you are dear he said how right of you to rest a little what have you been doing there were people to lunch said she and then i drove down with dad to the house he was not there long so i waited for him and we had a turn in the park then a whole host of people came to tea and ii multiplied myself they are ever so pleased with you said claude and im sure i dont wonder ever since they came up you have simply devoted yourself to them in his mind was the thought ever since i spoke to you about it it was not verbally expressed but the whole speech rang with it dora tried for a moment following uncle alfs plan to find something humorous about it failed dismally and tried instead to disregard it im glad she said that one is of use then she made a further effort i think it was an excellent plan that we should come here she added it suits us doesnt it and it suits them claude smiled at her leaning over the head of the sofa where she lay i knew you would find it a success he said i felt quite certain it would be again dora tried to shut her ears to the personal notethis ring of how right i was it suits jim too she said it really was kind of you to let him have the flat may tells me she went to dine there last night he had a bridge party claude laughed hes certainly making the most of it he said just as i meant him to do i think im like dad in that do you remember how he treated us over the venice house this year not a penny for us to pay jims giving lots of little parties im told and parker came round to me yesterday to ask if he should order some more wine as jims nearly finished it also cigars and cigarettes of course i told him to order whatever was wanted i hate doing things by halves the household books will be something to smile at but hes having a rare good time its not much entertaining he has been able to do all his life up till now dora sat up but claude do you mean hes drinking your wine and letting you pay for all the food she asked yes its my own fault i ought to have locked up the cellar and made it clear that he would pay for his own chickens as a matter of fact it never struck me that he wouldnt but as that hasnt occurred to him i cant remind him of it but you must tell him hes got to pay for things said dora why he might as well order clothes and just because he was in your flat expect you to pay for them oh i cant tell him said claude it would look as if i grudged him things i dont a bit i like people to have a good time at my expense poor devil he had a rotten derby week no wonder he likes living on the cheap and it must be beastly uncomfortable living on the cheap if its your own cheap so to speak i expect you and i would be just the same if we were poor but the idea was insupportable to dora and the more so because of the way in which claude took it generous he was no one could be more generous but there was behind it all a sort of patronizing attitude he gave cordially indeed but with the cordiality was a selfconscious pleasure in his own openhandedness and a contempt scarcely veiled of what he gave and the worst of all was that jim should have taken advantage of this insouciance about money affairs that sprang from the fact that he had no need to worry about money claude did not like jim dora felt certain of that and this made it impossible that jim should take advantage of his bounty it was an indebtedness she could not tolerate in her brother whats there to fuss about claude went on if the whole thing runs into a hundred and fifty pounds it wont hurt and after all hes your brother dear i like being good to your kin dora was not doing claude an injustice when she told herself that his irreproachable conduct to her family was in his mind it was there he did not mean it to be in evidence but insensibly and unintentionally it tinged his words the whole thing was kind kind kind but it was consciously kind that made the whole difference but it cant be she said if you wont speak to jim about it i will it is impossible that he should drink your wine and smoke your cigars and have dinner parties at your expense i cant let him do that sort of thing if i can possibly help it i would much sooner pay myself than that you should pay for him my dear what a fuss about nothing said claude it isnt as if it mattered to me whether i pay for his soup and cutlet no thats just it said dora quickly thats why you mustnt if it cost you something oh claude i dont think i can make you understand she said anyhow i shall tell jim what i think and if the poor wretch hasnt got any money then i must pay oh i dont suppose hes got any money said claude and as for your paying my dear what difference does that make i give you your allowanceand i wish youd say you wanted more for uncle alfs always wondering whether youve got enoughand you want to pay me out of that well its only out of one pocket and into another dont fuss about it dear i wish i hadnt told you but it isnt quite like that said dora i could deny myself something in order to pay if jim cant i can tell them not to send me the dress and then the hopelessness of it all struck her she was in the same boat as her husband she could not deny herself anything she wanted because there was no need for selfdenial and without that she could not make atonement for jims behaviour nor could she say to herself that he had done it without thinking jim always thought when there was a question of money for that he took seriously it was only his own conduct his own character and other little trifles of that sort for which he had so light a touch so easy a rein he had been giving little dinners at his flat instead of dining out as he usually did he would never have done that if he thought he was going to pay for the quails and the peaches that he should do it was the thing that was irremediablethat and the contemptuous kindness of claude claude saw there was some feeling in her mind of which he did not grasp the force she wanted to pay herself or to think she paid for jims hospitalities it did not make a pennyworth of difference he would pay a cheque into her account which would make her square again and she would never notice it just as you like dear he said but you mustnt tell jim you are doing it he would think that i was reluctant to pay for his food and drinks and im not i cant stand being thought mean theres no excuse for a fellow with plenty of shekels being mean oh you are not that said dora quickly her voice without volition following the train of thought in her mind no dear i hope not said he and believe me i havent got two ill feelings to rub against each other with regard to jim its only by chance i knew if thered been another box of cigars in the flat and a few more dozen champagne parker would never have come to me as for the household bookswhy dear theyd have been sent up to you and i bet youd never have seen no its just a chance as has put us in the knowledge of it all and i for one should hate to take advantage of it so cheer up dear pay me if it makes you feel easier but dont say a word to jim i like doing a thing thoroughly as im doing this he lingered a moment by the door perhaps that clears things up a bit dora he said with a touch of wistfulness in his voice and dora tried tried to think it did she tried also to put all possible simplicity into her voice as she answered but what is there to clear up dear she asked thats all right then said he and left her but once outside the door he shook his head bottled simplicity so to speak is not the same as simplicity from the spring he was quite shrewd enough to know the difference he was shrewd enough also to know that he did not quite understand what had gone wrong something certainly had and after his compliments to her on the subject of the admirable way in which she was behaving to his parents he knew that it was no longer his strictures on that subject that made this barrier true it was that during these past weeks neither of them had had much leisure or opportunity for intimate conversation but there were glances single words silences even that had passed between them when they were in venice first that had taken no time if measured by the scale of minutes or seconds yet which had been enough to fill the whole day with inward sunshine and he had not changed to her that he knew quite well it was not that he was less sensitive now less receptive of signals of that kind for his part he gave them in plenty just now he had leaned over her smiling when she lay on her sofa a thing that in early days would have been sufficient to make her glance at him with perhaps a raised hand that just touched his face with perhaps an oh claude below her breath honestly as far as any man can be honest with himself he was as hungry for that as ever he made his private code just as before and no answer came something was out of tune the vibrations wireless psychical did not pass from her to him as they had done and his own messages so it seemed throbbed themselves out and found none to pick them up but were lost in the unanswering air claude was of a very simple and straightforward nature but he felt none the less keenly because he was not capable of feeling in any subtle or complicated manner love had come into his life and his part in that burned within him still in no way less ardently he believed that dora had loved him also believed it that is to say in a sacred sense it had been a creed to him just as his own love for her was a creed with body and soul he loved her not fantastically but deeply and as he left her this afternoon it seemed to him that his love was being poured into a vessel in which was bitterness they had talked only about what to him was a trivial thingnamely the completeness with which jim had made himself at home in the flat but in the earlier days it made no difference what they talked about tenderness love came through it all like water through a quicksand engulfing them their days had been passed in such a quicksand they were always joyfully foundering in it but now it was not so some bitter encrustation had come on it which bore their weight quite easily and there was no risk of going through nor any chance of it honestly he did not believe that he was responsible for the formation of that crust he had not changed was not other than he had always been once for a moment his mind poised and hovered above the truth and he half said to himself i wonder if she finds me common but he rejected that it was the wildest freak of imagination besides she had not found him common at first and he had not grown commoner on the contrary she had taught him muchlittle things no doubt but many of them he had noticed she was always polite to servants and shop people and though a year ago his tendency had been to be rather short with them as inferiors he had instinctively followed her example that was only one instance out of many but so the poor fellow told himself they were all little things like that which could make no real difference to anybody yet he thought over this a little longer he himself for instance had always known that his father and mother and per were so to speak common beside him that seemed perfectly natural for he had been sent to eton and oxford and had picked up all sorts of things as to the way gentlemen behaved which they did not know he would not press his guests to have more wine as his father did when they had refused nor tempt them to a second helping as his mother did there were little tricks of language too infinitesimal affairs but he so he thought had got into the way of it whereas they had not he for instance never said lor as his father constantly did and his mother if she was not on the watch but he said good lord because fellows said that and not the other but what did that really matter there was a certain boisterousness of manner also that characterized them which he and mrs per for instance who was certainly a perfect lady did not practise often half in jest his father had said old claudes getting too much of a swell for me and though he deprecated such a conclusion he understood what was meant and knew that if half was jest half was serious but all this made it the more impossible that dora should find him common eton and oxford he felt quite sure had taken all the commonness out of him and how little it mattered he saw a hundred things day by day in which if he had been disposed to peer and dissect and magnify he would have felt that there was a difference between his father and himself but how measure so small a thing but what did that matter he saw the kindness the honour the truth of his parents and he was as likely to cease respecting and caring for them because of that difference as he was likely to cease to love dora because once he had found a gray hair in her golden head besidesand his mind came back to thatif she found him common now she must always have found him common but nothing was short of perfection in their early weeks in venice once on his way downstairs to be ready to greet per and his wife who were expected that evening he half turned on his foot intending to go back to dora and try to get to the bottom of it all but he knew that he would find nothing to say for there was nothing he could suggest in which he had fallen short and even as he paused wondering if it would be enough that he should go back and say dora what is it he heard the sound of the hall door opening that was per no doubt he must go down and welcome him chapter ix the question of the title had at length been settled the simplest solution was felt to be the best and mrs osborne need not have felt so strange at the thought of changing her name for she only changed the mrs into lady the eminently respectable name of osborne after all was associated as seen on the labels in the fish market at venice with the idea of hardware all the world over a thing which mr osborne had been anxious to bring in and at the same time it had a faintly territorial sound lady osborne however was a little disappointed she would so much have enjoyed the necessity of getting quantities of table linen with the new initial worked on it as it was it was only necessary to have a coronet placed above it indeed within a week coronets blossomed everywhere with the suddenness of the coming of spring in the southon the silver on the hotwater cans on writing paper and envelopes on the panels of carriages and cars and an enormous one cut solid in limestone the delivery of which seriously impeded for a while the traffic in park lane was hoisted into its appropriate niche above the front door of no by the aid of a gang of perspiring workmen and a small steam crane it had been a smart mornings work so said lord osborne who looked out from the gothic windows of his snuggery every now and then to see how it was getting on and it became even smarter in the afternoon when goldleaf had been thickly laid on it it was on the evening of that day that lady osborne had only a family party she had planned that from the very beginning of the settlement of the summer campaign had declined a very grand invitation indeed in order not to sacrifice it and was going to send it to the morning post and other papers just as if it had been a great party lady austell was there and jim dora and claude uncle alf per and mrs per and her husband and herself that was absolutely all and there was nobody of any description coming in afterward nor was any form of entertainment except such as they would indulge in among themselves to be provided the idea was simply to have a family gathering and not heed anybody else for just this one evening to be homely and cosy and comfortable so there they all were as lady osborne thought delightedly to herself as she sat down with jim on her right and alfred on her left just a family party and yet they were all folk of title now except alfred it showed that money was not everything for alfred was the richest of them all while the austells who were the highest were also the poorest she had looked forward immensely to this evening but not without trepidation for if alfred was worried he could spoil any party alfred however seemed to be in the most excellent humour and when as they sat down she said to him well alfred its your turn next to be made something he had replied that he had just received a most pressing offer of a dukedom and the witticism was much appreciated there was no keeping relations apart of course since they were all relations and claude was sitting next his father with mrs per between him and jim and it was his voice that his mother most listened for with the unconscious ear that hearkens for sounds that are most beloved he was apologizing to his father for the mislaying of some key im really awfully sorry he said but im such a bad hand at keys i never lock anything up myself everythings always open in the flat isnt it dora but im very sorry dad it was careless ah well never mind said his father and im not one as locks up overmuch either give me the key of my wine cellar and my cash box and the drawer of your mothers letters to me when i was acourting her and the tantalus and the drawer where i keep my chequebook and cash box and i dont ask for more im no jailer thank heaven but dont you even have a key to your cellar my boy oh i suppose there is one and i suppose parker has it he said jim too had caught some of this and turned to lady osborne by jove thats so like claude he said lady osborne beamed delightedly upon him well and it is she said there never was a boy so free with his things lor he used to get into such hot water with his father when first he went to oxford there was no question as you may guess of his being kept short of money but naturally his father wanted to hear where it went and theres no denying he was a bit extravagant when he first went up as they say but when claude got his chequebook to look where and how it had all gone why there wasnt as much as a date or anything on one of the bits you leave in i never can remember the name counterfoils suggested jim yes to be sure and ill be bound he doesnt enter half of them now and his uncle here played him a trick the other daydidnt pay in his quarters allowance did you alf and claude never knew till he was told just said he was hard up and didnt know why bless him well he being his fathers son it would be queer if he was tighthanded jim laughed i shall be down on mrlord osborne like a knife he said if he doesnt pay me his rent ill be bound you will and quite right too for money is money when alls said and done said lady osborne cordially well im sure that sea trout is very good i feel as i can take a mouthful more thoresby and give lord austell some more im sure i can tempt you lord austell nothing easier said jim uncle alf came and sat next dora in the drawing room when after a rather prolonged discussion of the port the gentlemen joined the rest of the circle again i came up here from richmond making no end of smart speeches in the carriage my dear he said in order to make maria and eddie jump but ive not said one shes a good old sort is maria and she was enjoying herself so my dear whats that great big gold thing theyve put up above the front door oh a coronet i think said dora i thought it was but i couldnt be sure lord what a set out but those two are having such a good time i hadnt the heart to make them sit up and i daresay theyve got a lot of men in the house of lords not half so honest as eddie i should never have forgiven you uncle alf said she if youd vexed them well its a good thing i didnt then said he and whats going to happen now you dont mean to say mrs pers going to sing it appeared that this was the case naturally she required a certain amount of pressing not because she had any intention of not singing but because a little diffidence a little fear that she had been naughty and hadnt sung for weeks was the correct thing uncle alfred heard this latter remark shes been practising every day per told us in the dining room he said lord if sabincourt would paint her as she looks when she sings id give him his price for it that woman will give me the indigestion if i let my mind dwell on her mrs per sang with a great deal of expression such simple songs as did not want much else indeed her rendering of be good sweet maid and let who will be clehever was chiefly expression there was a great deal of expression too in the concluding line which she sang with her eyes on the ceiling and a rapt smile playing about her tight little mouth one lorng sweet sorng she sang on a quavering and throaty f one lorng sweet sorng and she touched the last chord with the soft pedal down and continued smiling for several seconds with that lost look as per described it that lizzie gets when she is singing her motherinlaw broke the silence if that isnt nice she said and i declare if i know whether i like the words or the music best one seems to fit the other so lizzie my dear youre going to give us another wont you now lizzie had every intention of doing so but again a little pressing was necessary and she finally promised to sing once more just once if claude would do something afterward so she ran her hands over the keys and became light and frolicsome and sang something about a shower and a maid and a little kissing which was very pretty and winsome after that she sang again and again jim had seated himself opposite dora and in the middle of this their eyes met for a moment a faint smile quivered on the corner of jims mouth but the moment after mrs per came to the end of a song and he warmly complimented her eventually she left the piano and called upon claude for the fulfilment of his promise claude on occasion recited he did so now the piece he chose was a favourite of his fathers a little hackneyed perhaps for it was the sands of dee and lord osborne blew his nose when it was finished thank ye my boy he said you said that beautiful just to think of it poor thing her caught by the tide like that and her hair getting into the salmon nets im glad we didnt have that before dinner i couldnt have eaten a morsel of that salmon my dear youre so fanciful said his wife and it was sea trout but claude said it beautiful im sure ive heard them at the music halls often and often not half so good as that for all that they are professionals so that if your uncle cuts you off with a shilling claude said his father you can still make a home for dora hey dora and then per did several very remarkable conjuring tricks which nobody could guess you put a watch into a handkerchief and held it quite tight and then there wasnt any or else it was a rabbit or something quite different again whatever card you chose and wherever you put it back into the pack per was on it in no time or you thought of something and per blindfold with the help of mrs per told you what you had thought of and the zanzics were held not to be in it after the strain and bewilderment of these accomplishments it was almost a relief to sit down to a good round game the basis of which was a pack of cards some counters a system of forfeits and plenty of chaff and about twelve after a little light supper the party broke up alf driving down to richmond and lady austell who had made up her little disagreement with jim dropping him at his rooms it was but a step from park lane there but they held a short and pointed conversation on their way a delightful charming evening she said all so genuine and honest with no forced gaiety or insincere welcome how happy and content dora ought to be the question being whether she is remarked jim my dear have you noticed anything asked his mother rather quickly certainly during that recitation she looked a littlea little inscrutable what a deplorable performance was it not and if that odious woman had sung any more i think i should have screamed but dora and claude do you think the dear fellow is a little on her nerves yes i think the dear fellow is a little on her nerves said jim with marked evenness of tone can you not imagine the possibility of that consider it was very likely that lady austell considered she did not however think good to inform jim of the result of this consideration and he she asked i am not in his confidence said jim i am only in his flat and here it is thanks so much dear mother for the lift wont you come in no i must speak to dora said she as the brougham stopped i think that would be very unwise of you she knows all you would say about his honour his kindness and so on but at the present moment i think she feels that all the cardinal virtues do not make up forwell for things like that recitation lady austell thought over this for a moment as jim got out you are friends with claude she asked real friends i mean no i cant stand him and i think he cant stand me lady austell could not resist giving her son a little dab and yet you use his flat she said oh yes and drink his wine and smoke his cigars you would rather have liked the flat wouldnt you perhaps hell lend it you another time he likes doing kind things that dont incommode him i think he likes feeling it doesnt matter to him and i feel that the fact that we dislike each other gives a certain piquancy to them good night im so glad you liked your party it is refreshing after the glitter and hollowness of the world to get close to family affection again it seemed to her that a little flame of true bitterness quite unlike his usually genial cynicism and insouciance shone in these words good night dear she said very softly i hope nothing has disagreed with you jim laughed a little to himself as he ascended the thickly carpeted stairs to the flat on the first floor but the laugh was not of long duration or of very genuine quality he felt at enmity with all the world in spite of the excellent dinner he had eaten he felt that dora was a fool to let little things likewell like that recitationcome between her and the immense enjoyment that could be got out of life if only you had as was the case with her a limitless power of commanding its pleasures and yet if those pleasures were to be indissolubly wrapped up with an osborne environment he felt he almost understood her absence of content to put a caseif he was given the choice of going to newmarket tomorrow with lady osborne in her twothousandpound seventyhorsepower napier or of travelling there third class at his own expense what would he do certainly if the choice was for one day only he would go in the car but if the choice concerned going there every day for the rest of his life or hers the question hardly needed an answer the thing would become unbearable and dora had to go not to newmarket only but everywhere everywhere with claude and for himself he would sooner have gone anywhere with mrs osborne than with him it is more blessed to give than to receive in many cases it is certainly easier to give with a good grace than to receive in the same spirit and if the gift is made without sacrifice it is unless the recipient is genuinely attached to the giver most difficult to receive it charitably it may be received with gratitude if it is much wanted but the gratitude here is felt not toward the giver but toward the gift toward the giver there is liable to spring up especially if he is not liked before a feeling compared with which mere dislike is mild it was so with jim now he squirted some whisky into a glass put a lump of clinking ice into it and added some perrier water all these things were claudes so was the chair in which he sat so was the cigar the end of which he had just bitten off this latter operation he had not performed with his usual neatness there was a piece of loose leaf detached which might spoil the even smoking of it and he threw it away and took another they were all claudes and if his drinks and his cigars had been made of molten gold jim felt he would sit up till morning even at the cost of personal inconvenience in order to consume as much as possible of them the evening too the charming pleasant party of which his mother had spoken so foolishly had enraged him there had been all there that money the one thing in the world he desired so much could possibly buy and they had found nothing better to do than listen to ridiculous songs hear an unspeakable recitation and play an absurd round game he hated them all not only because they were rich but because they were illbred and contented jovial happiness the more to be resented because of its joviality a happiness he knew well that was really independent of money trickled and oozed from them like resin from a healthy fir tree happiness was their sap their life they were sticky with it and he was afraid he knew where that came from it came not only from their good digestion but from their kindness their simplicity their nice natures but if he at this moment had the opportunity of changing his own nature with that of any of these osbornes to take their kindness their joviality their simple contentment with and pleasure in life with all their wealth thrown in he would have preferred himself with all his disabilities and poverty there was something about them all some inherent commonness that he would not have made part of himself at any price only a day or two ago he had been telling dora to put the purseholders in a good temper at whatever cost not to mind about their being not quiteand now he saw her difficulty it was not possible even to think of them in a humorous light they were awful grotesques nightmares for all their happiness and wealth if you were obliged to have much to do with them jim finished his whisky and took more of all those tragic and irritating figures the one who appeared to him most deplorable and exasperating was claude on whom he was living at this moment and on whom he proposed to live till the end of the month after that he would no doubt search out some means of living on him further rich people were the cows provided for the poorer it was quite unnecessary because you fattened on their milk to like them you liked their milk not them and it was this very thing this fact of his own indebtedness to his brotherinlaw that made claude the more insupportable that claude was kind and generous that dora had married him aggravated his offence and the unspeakable meanness of his own relationship to him in being thus dependent on him aggravated it further yet his own meanness was part of claudes offence he would not have felt like this toward a gentleman but claude as he had said long ago to his mother was a subtle cad the worst variety of that distressing species so he lit another of his cigars the butt of the one he had just thrown away had fallen inside the brass fender and the persian rug in front of the fender had been pulled a little too far inward so that its fringe projected inside the smouldering end fell on to this fringe and jim watched it singe the edge of the rug without getting up to take it off justifying himself the while the interior of a fender was a proper receptacle for cigar ends and if the edge of a rug happened to be there too it was not his fault and the fact that he sat and watched it being singed was wholly and completely symptomatic of his state of mind he liked seeing even an infinitesimal deterioration of claudes property what business had claude with prints and persian rugs and halffilledin chequebooks he was generous because the generosity cost him absolutely nothing had jim been able to hear the conversation that took place in the drawingroom of no after he and his mother had gone his evil humour would probably have been further accentuated lord osborne started it well give me a family party every night he said and i ask for nothing more my lady though to be sure i like your grand parties second to none dora my dear that brother of yours is a sharp fellow he beat us all at our round game i hope hes comfortable in your flat eh claude youve left some cigars and suchlike i hope so that he wont wish to turn out saying theres more of comfort to be had at his club claude reassured his father on this point and mrs per glided up to dora she usually glided what a dear lord austell is dora she said and so aristocratic looking i wish i had a brother like that do you think that he liked my little songs per and i wondered if he would come down to sheffield in the autumn per has some good shooting i believe though i cant bear the thought of it poor little birds to be shot like that when theyre so happy i always stop my ears if they are shooting near the house lizzie my dear youre too kindhearted said lady osborne what would our dinners be like if it wasnt for the shooting perpetual beef and mutton nothing tasty mrs per wheeled around with a twist of her serpentine neck ah but you can never have read that dear little story by gautieror is it daudetabout the quails she said i have never touched a quail since i read it but lord austell dear dora we were going to have a little party very select about the middle of september and per and i wondered if lord austell would come there are the races you know for two days and with two days shooting and perhaps an expedition to fountains i think he might like it he told me he was so interested in antiquities and if you and claude would come too mrs per broke off in some confusion she had forgotten for the moment and she drew dora a little aside dear dora she said i quite forgot quite quite quite so stupid but claude perhaps if all is well they are great friends are they not claude told me that lord austell was keeping his flat warm for him so kind and so nice of claude to lend it too of course then lord osbornes voice broke in again yes the family party is the party to my mind he said no pomp just a plain dinner and a song and a conjuring trick and no fatigue for my lady with standing up and saying glad to see you a thousand timesnot but what she isnt glad as we all are to see our friends but lord mrs oi beg your pardon my ladyhow nice to have a quiet evening such as tonight with my lady austell and her son just dropping in neighbourlike and no bother to anybody per my boy youve made a conquest of lord austell he was wrapped up in your tricks and each puzzled him more than the last as he said to me you dont know what to expect it may be an egg or a watch or the ten of spades well i expect it would take a professional to see through my tricks said per and even then id warrant id puzzle him as often as not theres a lot of practice goes to each and theres many evenings when lizzie and i have been alone when weve gone through them and she pulled me up short if ever she saw so i might say the wink of a shirt cuff but they went off pretty well tonight though i say that who shouldnt and im sure i dont know what pleased me best tonight said lady osborne whether it was the conjuring tricks or lizzies singing or the sands of dee or the round game bless me and its nearly one oclock its time we were all in bed for theres no rest for anybody tomorrow im sure not after the clocks gone ten in the morning till two the next morning and later lord osborne gave a gigantic yawn im sure i apologize to the company for gaping he said but it comes upon one sometimes without knowing and what has my lady planned for tomorrow as if it was me as had planned it said his wife when you would have half the cabinet take their lunch with you and a mercy league of some kind in the ballroom in the afternoon three hundred teas ordered and by your orders mr o which will but give you time to dress if youre thinking to make a speech to them but do be up to the time for dinner for we sit down thirty at table at a quarter past eight and out of the ballroom you must go for if the servants clear it and air it for my dance by eleven oclock its as much as you can expect of flesh and blood and she carries it all in her head said her husband as if it was twice fives ten maria my dear youre right and its time to go to the land of nod not that therell be much nodding for me i shall sleep without them sort of preliminaries well and im sure you ought to after all the snoring exercise you went through last night said lady osborne genially i couldnt have believed it if i hadnt heard it there there my dear its only my joke and they tell me it shows a healthy pair of lungs to make all that night music as i may say and dora be sure as your brother knows hes welcome to dinner as well as the dance afterward in case i didnt say it to him i can always find an extra place at my table for them as are always welcome lord osborne got up not but what you didnt fair stick him over your conjuring tricks per he said and did you cast your eye over the coronet ive had put up above the front door its a fine bit of carving well good night to all and sundry claude my boy you take good care of per and mind to put out the lights when you come to bed one oclock i should never have guessed it was past twelve the newmarket meeting began next day and jim was not put to the odious degradation of paying for his own ticket as he motored down with a friend no more delightful way of spending the morning could be desired than this swift progress through the summer air over these smooth roads and that with a confident belief in the soundness of his betting book and the anticipation of a pleasant and lucrative afternoon entirely dissipated the evil humour of the evening before after all in this imperfect world it was wiser to take the bad with the good and if the manners and customs of the osborne family got on his nerves it must be put down to their credit not to the aggravation of their offences as he had been disposed to think last night that they treated him in so openhanded a way certainly they would appear in a far more disagreeable light if they were closehanded with their money it was of course a sin and an iniquity that other people should have money and not he but since providence and that deplorable derby week had chosen to make this disposition of affairs it was as well that certain mines of bullion should be accessible to him and here already was the heath and the crowds and the roar of the ring like most gamblers jim though practical enough in the ordinary affairs of life had a vein of fantastic superstition about him and it occurred to him after the first race in which he had the good fortune to back the winner that his luck had turned and he cast about to think of the cause that had turned it at once he hit on it he had paid claude back the sovereign which he had found on his dressing table and had given to the cook that had been a happy inspiration of his the action itself had been of the nature of casting bread on the waters for claude probably was unconscious of having left a sovereign there and in any case would not ask for it and here not after many days but the very next day he had picked up fifty of them before lunch apparently some sort of broadminded guardian angel looked after his bets and his morals and if he was good turned the luck for him for this broadminded angel clearly did not object to a little horse racing and enabled him to back winners and after this initial success jim went back to his friends motor and ate an extremely good lunch whether the broadminded angel looked back over jims past record and found something that he could not quite stand jim never reasoned out with any certainty all that was certain was that after that first race the carefully made up almost giltedged book went to pieces once in a sudden access of caution he hedged over a horse he had backed that was the only winner he was concerned with for the rest of the day jim returned to town that evening in a frame of mind that was not yet desperate but sufficiently serious to make him uncomfortable outwardly he took his losses admirably was cheerfully cynical about them and behaved in nowise other than he would have behaved if he had been winning all afternoon he had promised to dine at the savoy but on arrival at the flat he found a telephone message written out which had come from dora after his departure that morning asking him to dine at no at that his mood of last evening flashed up again ill be damned if i ever set foot in that house again he said to himself and regretted into the telephone there was a telegram for him as well it was from a very wellinformed quarter giving him the tip to back callisto an outsider for the big race tomorrow he crumpled it up impatiently how many wellinformed tips he wondered had he acted on and what percentage of them had come off scarcely one in a hundred no backing outsiders was a good enough game if you were on your luck and also happened to be solvent he did not go to newmarket next day but sat all afternoon in his club making frequent journeys to the tape that ticked out inexorably and without emotion things so momentous to him it was a little out of order and now and then after the announcement newmarket it would reel off a rapid gabble of meaningless letters like a voluble drunkard or give some extraneous information about what was happening at lords then it pulled itself together again and he saw that callisto had won harry franklin was looking over his shoulder as this information came out and gave a cackle of laughter hurrah fur coat for may and new gun for me he said lucky dog said jim i thought you never betted oh once in a blue moon moon was blue yesterday somebody gave me this tip last night and i had a shy i didnt shy said jim rather a pity twentyfive to one wasnt it yes that fiver of mine will go a long way said harry come and dine tonight dora and claude osborne are coming thanks awfully but im engaged said jim he went back to his flat when the last race was recorded to see just where he stood he had nothing more on for the last day of the meeting and thus his accounts were ready to be made up a rather lengthy addition with a very short subtraction of winnings showed him just what he had lost and he owed nearly five hundred pounds more than he could possibly pay the exact sum was it would have to be paid by monday next it was true in a sense that as he told harry franklin he was engaged that night though the engagement was to himself only it was necessary to sit and think the money was necessary to him and necessity is a lawless force the money had to be obtained so much might be taken for granted it was no use considering what would happen if it was not obtained therefore all that might be dismissed for it had to be obtained that was the terminus from which he started he had telephoned from the club that he would be in for dinner and would dine alone and claudes admirable cook it appeared understood the science of providing single dinners as well as she understood more festive provisions dinner was light and short and parker without prompting gave him a halfbottle of veuve clicquot iced to the right point and no further and a glass of port that seemed to restore him to his normal level what he had to face was no longer unfaceable he felt he could go out and meet necessity other possibilities detained him but little it was no use applying to his mother for money for he might as well apply to the workhouse and he could not apply to the osbornes he tried to think of himself asking claude to lend him this sum he tried to picture himself going to lord osborne with his story but the picture was unpaintable it had no possible existence and the other waythe way which already had taken form and feature in his mindwas not so difficult far less impossible of contemplation simply because his nature was not straight and the moral difficulty of stealing appeared to him to be within his power to deal with he had never been straight but even now he made excuses for himself said that it was a necessity that forced him into a path that was abhorrent to him perhaps he did dislike it a little certainly he did not take it for amusement simply there was no other way open to him there remained only to consider the chances of detection they did not seem to him great the chequebook with which he would shortly be concerned had clearly been left in its drawer as finished with for the last cheque was used though not the one immediately preceding it claude too had almost bragged about his carelessness with regard to money and the truth of his boast had been endorsed by his mother only two nights ago when she told him how he had never noticed that his quarters allowance had not been paid in that was a matter of nearly four thousand pounds this of hardly more than the same number of hundreds besides it if were detected what would claude do proceed against his wifes brother he believed he need not waste time in considering such a possibility for to begin with the possibility itself was so remote then for a moment some little voice of honour made itself heard and he had to argue it down not to pay such debtsdebts of honour as they were calledwas among those very few things that a man must not do and for which if he does them he gets no quarter from society in general no doubt he could get his debts paid if he went to the osbornes but that he could not do it was much harder for him than that which he proposed to do so the little voice was silenced again almost before it began to speak but it was used to being taken lightly to be not listened to he was not often at home in the evening but when he was he usually sat in claudes room which though small was cooler than the southwardfacing drawing room and he took his cigar there now a tray of whisky and perrier had already been placed there but since he did not wish to be disturbed he rang the bell to tell parker he wished to be called at eight next morning and wanted nothing more that night and then he took some writing paper from a drawer in the kneehole table and drew up his chair to it he had found there also a carefully written out speech by claude designed for his constituents he read a page or two and found it dealt with local taxation large sums like five million were written in figures smaller sums as in phrases fivepence in the pound were written out in full this was convenient there was also a frequent occurrence of myself in the speech part of that word concerned jim and claude wrote with a stylograph there were several of them in the pen tray jim had used them regularly since he came into the flat dora was to call for him next morning at twelve with the design of spending the afternoon at lords to see the cricket and arriving there a little before her appointed time was told that he was out but had left word that he would be back by twelve accordingly since the heat was great in the street she came up to the flat and waited for him there she felt rather fagged this morning for the last week had been strenuous while privately her emotional calendar had made many entries against the days that estrangement from claude that alienation without a quarrel and therefore the more difficult to terminate had in some secret way got very much worse his presence even had begun to irritate her and he certainly saw that irritation it did not require much perspicacity and spared her as much as he could never if possible being alone with her instead he threw himself into the hospitalities of the house looked after mrs per taking her to picturegalleries and concerts until per had declared that he was getting to feel quite an othello and performed with zeal all the duties of a resident son of the house and bitterly dora saw how easy it was to him how without any effort he caught the rle like some mysterious stain appearing again after years the resemblance between him and his family daily manifested itself more clearly the sight of the flat caused these thoughts to inflict themselves very vividly on her mind and sitting here alone waiting it was almost with shuddering that she expected claude to enter how often in these familiar surroundings she had sat just here expecting and longing for him to come to know that he and she would be alone together in their nest and now the walls seemed to observe her with alien eyes even as with alien eyes she looked at them it was a blessing anyhow that they had gone to park lane the dual solitude here would have been intolerable she had not got to wait long for jims step soon sounded in the passage she heard him whistling to himself as he went into his bedroom and next moment he came in im not late he said so dont scold me its you who are early which is the most outrageous form of unpunctuality well dora how goes it she got up and came across the room to him it doesnt go very nicely she said but you seem cheerful which is to the good jim it is so nice to see somebody cheerful without being jocose we are all very jocose at park lane and claude flirts with mrs per dora gave a little laugh i didnt mean to speak of it she said and i wont again lets have a day off and not regret or wonder or wish what lots of times you and i have gone up to lords together though we usually went by underground now we go in a great noble motor lets have fun for one day i havent had fun for ages jim nodded at her that just suits me he said i want a day off and well have it pretend youre about eighteen again and me twentyone after all its only putting the clock back a couple of years and i feel a hundred said dora pathetically well dont i felt a hundred yesterday and it was a mistake jim i was so sorry about your bad luck at newmarket somebody told me you had done nothing but lose what an ass you are dear why do you go on jims face darkened but for a moment its nothing the least serious he said i did have rather a bad time but ive pulled through and have paid every penny in fact that is what kept me this morning i hate to give away all those great crisp crackling notes i hate it and then on my way home i determined not to think about it any more nor about anything unpleasant that had ever happened and i get here to find you had come to the same excellent determination lets have a truce for one day amen said dora it is astonishing what can be done by acting in pairs dora would have been perfectly incapable alone of watching cricket with attention far less as proved to be possible with rapture and it might also be open to reasonable doubt as to whether alone jim could have found any occupation that would have deeply interested him but together they gave the slip to their anxieties and preoccupations and jim did not even want to bet on the result of the match all afternoon they sat there and waited till at halfpast six the stumps were drawn then dora gave a great sigh oh dear its over she said and i suppose weve got to begin again what a nice day weve had ii quite forgot everything jim came home rather late that night and found letters waiting for him in the little room where he had sat the night before there was nothing of importance and nothing that needed an answer and in a few minutes he moved toward the door in order to go to bed and then quite suddenly with the pentup rush of thought which all day he had dammed up in a corner of his brain he realized what he had done and his face went suddenly white and strange noises buzzed in his ears and his very soul was drowned in terror but it was too late his terror should have been imagined by him twentyfour hours ago now it was authentic there was no imagination required and he was alone with it chapter x claude as became the future candidate for the constituency of west brentwood was sedulous and regular in reading the house of common debates and two mornings later was sitting after breakfast with his times in front of him to which he devoted an attention less direct than was usual with him for he expected every moment to be told that the visitor whom he was waiting for would be announced and he could form no idea of what the visitors business might be half an hour ago he had been summoned to the telephone and found that he was speaking to one of the partners in graysons bank who asked if he could see him at once no clue as to what so pressing a business might be was given him and mr humby the partner who spoke to him only said that he would start immediately he had first telephoned it appeared to claudes flat and his servant had given him the address in itself there was little here that was tangibly disquieting for claude stood outside the region of money troubles but other things combined to make him usually so serene rather nervous and apprehensive for the last day or two he had been vaguely anxious about his mother who appeared to him not to be well though in answer to his question she confessed to nothing more than july fatigue while his relations with dora or rather his want of them continued to perplex or distress him she was evenly polite to him she went out with him when occasion demanded but that some barrier had been built between them he could no longer doubt he had not only his own feeling to go upon for his mother had remarked it and asked if there was any trouble lady osborne was the least imaginative of women he was afraid and her question had so emphasized it to his mind that he had determined should no amelioration take place to put a direct question to dora about it he would gladly have avoided that for his instinct told him that the trouble was of a sort that could scarcely be healed by mere investigation but the present position was rapidly growing intolerable all these things made it difficult for him to concentrate his attention on the fiscal question and it was almost with a sense of relief to him that the interruption he had been waiting for came he shook hands with mr humby who at once stated his business i may be troubling you on a false alarm mr osborne he said but both my partners and i thought that one of us had better see you at once in order to set our minds at rest you have only just caught me said claude i am going into the country before lunch then i have saved myself a journey said mr humby gravely he produced an envelope and took a cheque out of it the cheque came through today he said it was cashed two days ago at shepherds bank quite regularly but it is drawn by you to self over a week ago that was a little curious since cheques drawn to self are usually cashed at once also though that is no business of ours it is a rather large sum five hundred pounds to take in cash you have banked with us for some years mr osborne and we find you have never drawn a large sum to yourself before but the combination of these things seemed to warrant us in making sure the cheque wasah genuine the handwriting appears to be yours claude looked at the date june he said i did draw a large cheque about that time for a motorcar that has been presented it was drawn to daimlers said mr humby claude turned the cheque over it was endorsed with his name but search how he might he could not recollect anything about it and slowly his inability to remember deepened into the belief that he had drawn no such cheque if you would refer to your chequebook said mr humby we could clear the matter up i am sorry for giving you so much trouble the question is where is my chequebook said claude i came over here a week ago but before that i was at my flat but i will look he went upstairs into the sitting room which was his and doras she was sitting there now writing notes and looked up as he came in claude can i speak to you for a minute she said yes dear but not this moment i have to find my chequebook where do you suppose it is one must attend to business you know oh quite so said she and resumed her letter again claudes heart sank perhaps she wanted to speak to him about things that were of infinitely greater moment and he had made a mess of it repulsed her by his foolish speech dora what is it he asked is it she must have known what was in his mind for she made an impatient gesture of dissent no if you can give me a minute later on it will be all right she said his search was soon rewarded but proved to be fruitless for the chequebook was a new one and he had only used it for the first time three days ago but perhaps she would remember something dora did i give you a rather big cheque for household bills or anything while we were in the flat he asked yes i remember that you did she said and i remember endorsing it as you drew it to me why only that there is a cheque that i appear to have drawn for five hundred pounds just before i left the flat and for some reason my bankers want to be sure that i did draw it you mean they think that it may be forged yes but who can have got hold of your chequebook asked dora you have found it havent you yes but this is no use the cheque in question was drawn before i began this book i suppose i left it at the flat dora had continued writing her note as she talked for it was only a matter of a few formal phrases of regret but at this moment her hand suddenly played her false and her pen sputtered on the paper and though she did not know at that second why this happened a moment afterward she knew below his chequebook in the drawer lay claudes passbook it had been very recently made up for his allowance from uncle alfred paid on june appeared to his credit and on the debit side a cheque to dora of cashed on the previous date that no doubt was the cheque for books of which she had spoken she had gone on writing again and claude apparently had noticed nothing of that pensplutter yes here are cheques i have drawn up till the th he said and none of it looks rather queer ill be back again in five minutes i must just see mr humby and tell him i cant trace it claude went rather slowly downstairs again the matter was verging on certainty he had drawn a cheque for five hundred pounds on june and it had not been presented till two days ago the cheque for the car was entered and the cheque for books to dora he hated to think that parker had forged his name but if he had good servant though he was there was no clemency possible may i look at the cheque again he asked he examined it more closely i can find no trace of drawing any such cheque he said and i believe it is a forgery it is very like my handwriting but i dont believe i wrote it that is what we thought said mr humby then what are you going to do asked he find out who presented the cheque and prosecute i am very sorry it is an unpleasant business but the bank can take no other course he folded up the cheque again put it in his pocket and left the room but claude did not at once go back to dora there had started unbidden into his mind the memory of a morning at grote before they were married of a game of croquet of a sovereign next minute he too had left the room and the minute after he was in the road walking quickly to mount street his old chequebook no doubt was there and he would be able to find it and all the way there he tried desperately to keep at bay a suspicion that threatened to grip him by the throat and upstairs dora waited for him the same doubt threatened to strangle her jim was out but was expected back every moment and claude went into his small room and began searching the drawers of his writing table there was a sheaf of letters from dora in one a copy of his speech on municipal taxation in another and in the third a heap of old cards of invitation and the butt end of his chequebook sun blinds were down outside the windows the room was nearly dark and he carried this out into the large sitting room and sat down to examine it there was a whole batch of cheques most of which he could remember about drawn on june then came a blank counterfoil and then the last counterfoil of the book bearing a docket of identification as cheque to dora for that was drawn on the th he heard a step outside the door opened and jim entered he was whistling as he came round the corner of the screen by the door then he saw claude his whistling ceased and his face grew white once he tried to speak but could not claude saw that the blank face the whitened lips it was as if jim had been brought face to face with some deadly spectre instead of the commonplace vision of his brotherinlaw sitting in his own room looking through the useless but surely innocuous trunk of an old chequebook and instantaneously automatically claudes mind leaped to the conclusion which he had tried to keep away from it but it could be kept away no longer the inference closed upon him like the snap of a steel spring in the same instant there came upon him his own personal dislike of jim and his distrust of him how deep that was he never knew till this moment then came the reflection that he was doing jim a monstrous injustice in harbouring so horrible a suspicion and that the best way of clearing his mind of it was to let the bank trace the cheque and prosecute but he knew that it was his dislike of his brotherinlaw that gave birth to this not a sense of fairness and on top of it all came the thought of dora and his love for her and mingled with that a certain pity that was its legitimate kinsman the pause psychically so momentous was but short in duration and claude jumped up his mind was already quite decided it seemed to have decided itself without conscious interference on his part good morning jim he said i must apologize for making an invasion in your absence but i had to refer back to an old chequebook jim commanded his voice nothing wrong i hope he said again claude had to make a swift decision he could tell jim that a cheque of his had been forged and that the matter was already in the hands of the bank that probably would force a confession if there was cause for one but it would still be his dislike though he might easily call it justice that was the mover here there was a wiser way than that a way that for all the surface falsehood of it held a nobler truth within no nothing whatever is wrong he said excuse me i must telephone to the bank to say the cheque is all right ah ill telephone from here if you will allow me the telephone was just outside and jim heard plainly all that passed the number was rung up and then claude spoke yes im mr claude osborne i am speaking to mr grayson am i it is the matter that mr humby came to speak to me about this morning yes yes the cheque for i find i have made a complete error the cheque was drawn by me and is perfectly correct yes it was very stupid of me please let mr humby know as soon as he gets back yes thank you good morning claude paused a moment with the receiver in his hand then he called to jim cant stop a moment he said ive the devil of a lot to do goodbye he walked back again at once to park lane still thinking intently still wondering if he could have done better in any way honest all through he hated with a physical repulsion the thought of what he felt sure jim had done but oddly enough instead of feeling a crescendo of dislike to jim himself he was conscious only of a puzzled sort of pity by instinct he separated the deed from the doer instead of bracketting them both in one clause of disgusted condemnation and then he ceased to wonder at that it seemed natural after all he went straight up to doras room and found her still at her table with letters round her but when he entered she was not writing she was staring out of the window with a sort of terror on her face claude guessed what it was that perhaps had put it there and what lurked behind that look of agonized appeal that she turned on him im sorry for being so long dear he said but ive been making a fool of myself that cheque i spoke to you about is quite all right i found the counterfoil in my old book at the flat i drew it right enough mr humby expects a fellow to carry in his head the memory of every halfcrown he spends dora gave one great sobbing sigh of relief which she could not check im glad she said i hated to think that parker perhaps had gone wrong oneone hates suspicion and its atmosphere claude heard could not help hearing the relief in the voice could not help seeing that the smile she gave him struggled like mistridden sunlight to shine through his dispelled clouds of nameless apprehension nor could his secret mind avoid guessing what that apprehension was for it was no stranger to him he had been sharer in it till he had seen jim when it deepened into a certainty which was the opposite to that which at this moment brought such relief to his wife the other certainty his own must of course be kept sealed and locked from her and claude hastened to convey it away from her presence so to speak by talking of something else for fear that it might in despite of him betray some hint of its existence but there was something you wanted to speak to me about he said yes it is about your mother do you think she is well no i havent thought so for the last three or four days said he what have you noticed i went into her room just now said dora and she was sitting and doing nothing and she was crying claude paused in astonishment crying he said the mater crying yes she clearly did not wish me to see it and so i pretended not to i had thought she wasnt well before now we must do something claude make her see a doctor but why hasnt she been to see a doctor all these days he asked the governor goes to a doctor if his nails want cutting i dont know why she hasnt been there might be several reasons but i thought i would speak to you first and then if you approved i would go to her and try to find out what is the matter i wish you would he said dora got up but her mind went back to that which she had been brooding over in his absence that which frightened her did you see jim she asked yes he came in when i was there how was he she asked negligently oh much as usual i couldnt stop because i wanted to get back to you will you come and tell me about the mater after you have seen her dora went back to lady osbornes room and knocked before she entered the apparition of her sitting and crying all alone had frightened her more than she had let claude see for as a rule her motherinlaws cheerfulness was of a quality that seemed to be proof against all the minor accidents of life and dora remembered how one day in italy when they had missed a train at padua and had to wait three hours lady osbornes only comment had been well now that will give us time to look about us she was afraid therefore that the cause of her tears was not trivial and now when she went in again receiving a rather indistinct answer to her knock she found lady osborne hastily snatching up the days paper so as to pretend to be occupied but her face wore an expression extraordinarily contorted as if her habitual geniality found it a hard task to struggle to the surface and im sure the paper gets more and more interesting every day said she though its seldom i find time to have a glance at all the curious things that are going on in the world what a dreadful place morocco must be i couldnt sleep quiet in my bed if i was there what is it my dear on her face and in her voice the trace of tears bravely suppressed still lingered and a great wave of pity suddenly swept over dora something was wrong something which at present lady osborne was bearing in secret for it was quite clear that her husband whose cheerfulness at breakfast had bordered on the boisterous knew nothing nor did claude know her motherinlaw as dora was well aware was not a woman of complicated or subtle emotion who could grieve over an imagined sorrow or could admit to a personal relation with herself the woe of the world for with more practical wisdom she gave subscriptions to those whose task it was to alleviate any particular branch of it her family her hospitalities her comfortable though busy life had been sufficient up till now to minister to her happiness and if something disturbed that dora rightly thought that it must be something tangible and personal so she went to the sofa and sat down by her and did not seek to be subtle what is it she said is there anything the matter the simplicity was not calculated it was perfectly natural and had its effect lady osborne held the paper in front of her a moment longer but it was shaken with the trembling of her hands then she dropped it my dear i am a selfish old woman she said but i cant bear it any longer ive not been well this long time but ive tried to tell myself it was my imagination and not bother anybody and i could have held on my dear a little longer if you hadnt come to me like this i warrant you there would have been plenty of laughing and chaff at grote this weekend as always but the pain this morning was so bad that i just thought i would have a bit of a cry all to myself but why have you told nobody said dora not claude nor dad nor me lady osborne mopped her eyes bless your heart havent we all got things to bear and best not to trouble others she said i know well enough how youd all spend your time in looking after me and having the doctor and what not and i thought i could get through to the end of the season and then go and rest and see what was the matter and my dearie im a dreadful coward you know and i couldnt abear the thought of being pulled about by the doctor and maybe worse than that anyhow ive not given in at once some days my colour has been awful and no appetite but ive kept my spirits up before you all and i cant bear to think now that i must give in and have to take doctors stuff and lie up spoiling all your pleasure but i dont think as i can go on much longer like this perhaps its best that you know poor eddie him and his jokes this morning at breakfast chaffing me about sir thomas lor my dear what spirits he has i declare he quite took my thoughts off and about claude and lizzie too as if claude ever gave a thought to anyone but yourself lady osborne patted doras hand a moment in silence she was not sure that dora had relished her husbands fun at breakfast now was the time to set it right but then eddie knew that else hed never have made a joke of it she said and you my dearie have been so sweet to me these weeks not that you havent been that always as if you was my own daughter indeed not that i complain of lizzie for i dont often and often shes behaved high to mr o and me when you who have excuse enough have never done such a thing often ive said to him its as if dora was an osborne herself thank you my dearie for that and for all youve done and been i daresay its been difficult for you at times but there i daresay you think ive not noticed but i have my dear and youve behaved beautiful always i wanted just to say that and youre behaving sweet and kind to me still somehow deep down this cut dora like a knife there was a wounding pathos about it that made those efforts she had put forth to behave decently appear infinitely trivial humiliatingly cheap and the gentle patting on her hand continued and now dearie im going to ask you to do another thing yet said lady osborne and that is to take my place down at grote this sunday and let me stay up here and see my doctor this afternoon if you hadnt such quick and loving eyes i should have gone through with it and held on my dear even if there was more mornings like this in store but with you knowing my dear ill not wait longer and maybe make matters worse though perhaps its me as has been making a fuss about nothing and a bottle of medicine will make me as fit as a flea again as mr o used to say now we must put our heads together and contrive so that he may think its just a touch of the liver and nothing to be alarmed for else hell never go and leave me hes gone off already to some committee and the car is to call for him at twelve and drive him straight down so that hell find himself at grote before he knows anything is wrong and then my dear you must do your best to make him think its nothing as please god it isnt what a trouble our insides are though to be sure mines given me little enough to complain of all these years ive always eaten my dinner and got a good nights rest until this began they talked long contriving as lady osborne had said the sole point of the contrivance being that her husband should enjoy his day or two at grote and have everything to his liking and not fret about her once and again and again once dora tried to lead the conversation back to lady osborne herself to get from her some inkling of what her indisposition might be what its symptoms were with a view of encouraging her to face the doctor with equanimity for this was clearly an ordeal she dreaded and on doras third attempt she put an end to further questions i think dearie well not talk about that she said because as i told you im such a coward as never was and the more i think about it the more coward i shall be when i get to the doctors door it was just the same with me about my teeth before i lost them all if one had to come out i had such a shrinking from a bit of pain that if i thought about it i knew i shouldnt go to the dentist at all so i used to busy myself with other things and plan a treat maybe for the working folk or an extra good dinner for mr o or a surprise for per or claude and its a similar to that what ill do now if you dont mind and i assure you im so bothered over the thought of you and dad being at grote without me that ive little desire to think about anything else thirtyfive years it is last may my dear since we took each other for better or worse and its always been better and not a night since then i assure you have we not slept under the same roof and in the same room save when i had a cold and feared to give it him and hes got to depend on me gold bless him and knows that i shall see he has a biscuit or two on a plate by his bedside and a glass of milk against he wakes the night servants are never to be trusted my dear though im sure its a shame to say it when ours are so attentive but hes got a new valet just of late and if you could peep in at my lords bedroom door when you went up to bed and see as all was prepared and that his slippers was put where he can see them in his dressing room else hell walk to bed in his bare feet and step on a pin or a tack someday which i always dread for him and if he comes in hot as hes taken to do in this weather from his walk just you behave as if you was me and say to him mr o you go and change your vest and your socks else i dont pour out your cup of tea and knowing as youll do that will take a load off my mind and i shall go to the doctor this afternoon knowing as you are looking after him as if i was there as comfortable as if i was going to have a cheque cashed for me and my dear if youd sit next him in church and just nudge him if he attempts to follow the lesson without putting his glasses on its small print in his bible and never another one will he let me give him just because it was that one he used to read out of to me when we were in cornwall on our wedding trip and sometimes no church within distance but be sure he changes his underwear my dear when he comes in for he catches cold easy and his skin acts so well that its as if hed had a bath and give him plenty of milk in his coffee at breakfast not that he likes it but he will have the coffee made so strong that its enough to rasp the coats of the stomach as they say unless you drown it in milk and youll cheer him up i know my dear if he gets anxious and just say to him stuff and nonsense dad mrs os had a bit of an upset same as you have times without number and shes always nervous about herself and has gone to see the doctor and as like as not will come down tomorrow afternoon with a couple of pills in her pocket and ready to be laughed at to your hearts content thats what i want you to say my dear though youll put it in your own words and much better im sure but today its as if i feel i couldnt go and look after my friends now that i know youll take my place for when theres a multitude in the house sometimes the mistress cant get to bed till it maybe is one oclock or worse and i want a good long night i shall try to see sir henry as soon as may be and after that i dont doubt i shall just get to bed and sleep the clock round im so tired my dear and theres something well i make no doubt that before many hours are out we shall all be laughing together over my silliness and mr o will be asking if i have taken enough phosphorus jelly or what not lor hell never let me hear the last of it that was a triumphant conclusion the whole speech punctuated by silences punctuated by a little dropping of tears and by a little laughter was hardly less triumphant once ages ago so it seemed to dora claude had held up his father and mother as examples of the ideal antidote against the graybusiness of middle age and it had failed to satisfy her then she would have thought it comical had not there been some very keen sense of disappointment about it that a lover should speak to his beloved in such language but now with rekindled meaning she remembered the incident and its setting she had asked him for consolation with regard to the graybusiness that awaited everybody hoping to hear words of glowing romance and had found it half comical half tragic that he refuted her doubts by the visible example of his father and mother he had said that she was his best girl still but now dora did not feel either the comedy or the tragedy of his reply she felt only the truth of it and she did not wonder that her motherinlaw was dads best girl still but for herself though there was heartache in much that had been said there was the beginning of understanding also or at any rate the awakening of the sense that there was something to understand lady osborne had called herself a coward and reiterated that charge with regard to seeing a doctor only but lovea golden barrier of solid defence no filagree workhad come between her and her fear yet it was scarcely true to say that it had come there it was always there once dora had thought that compared to romance any relation that could exist between claudes parents must necessarily be of an ashcold quality but was it she herself had known the romantic but in comparison with all that she had been conscious of with regard to claude for the last few weeks she could not call lady osborne ashcold in her there was some glow some authentic fire that had never known quenching it might have altered in superficials for flames there might have been substituted the glowing heart of the fire but it was the same fire there had not been ashes at any time the fire always burned unconsumed with no waste of cinder it was immortal radiumlike then for the first time the beauty of it struck her before this moment she had seen something that appeared comical then with better vision she had seen something that struck her as pathetic now with true vision she saw all she had missed beforebeauty it was that she had worshipped all her life thinking that she would always recognize and adore but she had missed it altogether in that which was so constantly under her eyes she had been too quick in seeing all that was obvious wealth indiscriminate hospitality vulgarity since she had chosen to call it so but the big thing that which was the essential she had missed altogether once before when mr and mrs osborne shared a hymnbook in church she had seen and thought she understood now she was beginning to understand she began to want to take other hearts into her own the desire was there the beauty she had at last seen attracted her drew her to it strangely had it been unveiled by tale of slippers and biscuits and underwear she never had expected to find it in such garb but claude had known it was there he had not been diverted by superficial things but had seen always that the mater was the governors best girl still dora left her motherinlaw that morning with a sense of humility a sense also of disgust at herself for her own stupidity all these months a thing as beautiful as this great love and tenderness had been in front of her eyes and she had not troubled to look at it with enough attention to recognize that there was beauty there but now the tears that dimmed her own eyes quickened her vision at last she saw the picture in its true value and it made her ashamed was she equally blind too with regard to claude was there something in him some great thing which mattered so much that all which for months had got on her nerves more and more every day was if seen truly as trivial as she now saw were those things that had blinded her in the case of lady osborne it might be so all she knew was that if it was there she had not troubled to look for it at first she had so loved his beauty that nothing else mattered nor did it seem to her possible that love could ever be diminished or suffer eclipse but that had happened even before she had borne a child to him and to take its place and more than take its place there had sprung up no herbs of more fragrant beauty than the scarlet of that first flower she had nothing in her garden for him but herbs of bitterness and resentment that at least was all she knew of till now she paused a moment outside the door of the sitting room where she had left him before entering for she knew his devotion to his mother and was sorry for him and somehow she felt herself unable to believe that lady osbornes optimistic forecast would be justified she did not think that in a few hours they would be all laughing over her imaginary ailment and claude must see that she was anxious it would be better to confess to that and prepare him for the possibility of there being something serious in store he looked up quickly as she came in throwing away the cigarette he had only just begun well he said dora heard the tremble and trouble in that one word and she was sorry for him that particular emotion she had never felt for him before she had never seen him except compassed about with serene prosperity claude im afraid she is ill she said she feels it herself too she has been in great pain but how long has it been going on he asked why hasnt she seen a doctor because she didnt want to spoil things for us she thought she could hold on but she is going now today what does she think it is asked he she wouldnt talk of it at all said dora i think she could hardly think of it because she was thinking of dad so much she wont come down to grote you see but stop up here unless she is told it is nothing and so we must do our best that he shant be anxious or unhappy until we know whether there is real cause or not she wants me particularly to go down there or of course i would stop with her the mater must feel pretty bad if shes not coming to grote said he yes i am afraid she does oh claude i am so sorry for her and you all her bravery has made us all blind i ought to have seen long ago i reproach myself bitterly no no theres no cause for that said he gently shes taken us all in and its just like her besides who knows it may be nothing in the least serious i know that said she and we wont be anxious before we have cause go and see her dear before we start and make very light of it just say you are glad she is being sensible at last in going to be put right there is no cause for anxiety yet i shall go round to sir henrys and arrange an appointment for her this afternoon if possible and get him to write to us very fully this evening so that we shall know tomorrow and then if we are to get down by lunch it will be time for us to start i ordered the motor for twelve lord osborne was a good deal perturbed at the ne with which dora met him at grote and it was an affair that demanded careful handling to induce him not to go back at once to town and see her bless me maria not well enough to come down and you expect me to take my sunday off and eat my dinner as if my old lady was aseated opposite me he asked not i my dear marias and my place is together wherever that place may be but you cant go against her wish dad said dora and whats to become of me if you do ive been sent down on purpose to play at being her youve got to have a glass of milk by your bed and a couple of biscuits oh i know all about it to think of your knowing that he said rather struck by this detail yes but only this morning did i know it said dora i sat with her a long time and all she could think about was that you should be comfortable down here well it goes against the grain not to be with her said he but as you say theres no cause to be alarmed yet and sir henrys going to see her this afternoon yes and telegraph to me afterward dad if you upset all our beautiful arrangements neither she nor i will ever speak to you again oh do be good but it wont be like home not to have lady o here said he she knows that but claude and i have to make as good an imitation as we can and youll put me in a dreadful hole if you go back to town she will say i have made no hand of looking after you at all i shall be in disgrace as well as you well god bless you my dear said he and thank you for being so good to us here ill stop if its the missuss wish no i dont fancy any pudding today thank you dora laid down her spoon and fork dad not one morsel do i eat unless you have some she said and im dreadfully hungry lord osborne laughed within himself eh youve got a managing wife claude he said she twists us all round her little finger the expected telegram arrived in the course of the evening and though it contained nothing definite lord osborne was able to interpret it in the most optimistic manner well sir henry tells you that mrs os in no pain and that hes going to see her again tomorrow he said why i call that good news and it relieves my mind my dear bless her shell get a good nights rest i hope now and feel a different creature in the morning theres nothing else occurs to you my dear surely he would have said if he had found anything really wrong dora read the telegram again no i think you are quite right to put that interpretation on it she said truthfully enough well hope to get good news again tomorrow i am glad she is out of pain but secretly she feared something she did not saynamely that there was something wrong but that sir henry had not been able without further examination to say what it was yet after all that interpretation might be only imagination on her part but there was nothing in the telegram which appeared to her to be meant to allay the anxiety which he must know existed dora went to bed that evening with a great many things to think about which had to be faced not shirked or put aside the day which by the measure of events had been almost without incident seemed terribly full of meaning to her lady osborne had seen a doctor she had talked over domestic affairs with dora that was not quite all claude had thought that a cheque had been forged but found on examination that he had made a mistake set out like that there seemed little here that could occupy her thoughts at all still less that could keep away from her the sleep that in general was so punctual a visitor to her but tonight it did not come near her and she did not even try to woo its approach she had no thought of sleep though she was glad to have the darkness and the silence round her so that she might think without distraction all these things trivial as events seemed to her to be significant to hold possibilities potentialities altogether disproportionate to their face value it might prove not to be so when she examined them it might be that for some reason a kind of nightmare inflation was going on in her mind so that as in physical nightmare things swell to gigantic shape in her imagination these simple little things were puffed to grotesque and terrifying magnitude she had to think them over calmly and carefully it might easily be that they would sink to normal size again she took first that affair of the cheque which had turned out apparently to be no affair at all claude had made a mistake so he had himself said and the cheque which he and the bank had suspected was perfectly genuine but dora between the time of his thinking there was something wrong and of his ascertaining that there was not had passed a very terrible quarter of an hourone that it made her feel sick to think of even now there was no use in blinking it she had feared that jim had forged her husbands cheque she had hardly given a thought to what the consequences might be what turned her white and cold was the thought that he had done it her pen had spluttered when the thought first occurred to her but she believed claude had not noticed that but had he noticed the sob of relief in her voice when he told her that the cheque was all right he was not slow to observe his perceptions especially where she was concerned were remarkably vivid and it seemed to her that he must have noticed it yet he had said nothing anyhow the cheque was correct and she was left with the fact that it had seemed to her possible that jim had been guilty of this gross meanness and just as if the thing had been true she found herself trying to excuse him saw herself pleading with claude for him poor jim was not was not quite like other people he did not seem to know right from wrong he had always cheated at games she remembered telling claude so one day down here at grote when he and jim had been playing croquet and jim had cheated but they had not been playing for money so claude had told her and he had told her the cheque was all right that was all there was nothing more to be thought of with regard to this yet she still lingered on the threshold of the thought of it jim had got cleaned out his own phrase in the derby week had pledged the quarters rent of grote in advance to pay his derby debts and somebody had told her that jim had lost heavily at newmarket afterward and he had told her that he had paid and was upright before the world in the matter of debts of honour she had passed the threshold of that thought and was inside again where had he got the money from well anyhow not by forgery claude had said that the mistake was his but how odd that he should not have been able to recollect about a cheque for five hundred pounds drawn only ten days before dora still lingered in the precincts of that thought though she beckoned so to speak another thought to distract her what a wonderful thing how triumphant and beautiful was the love of which she had seen a glimpse today it was all the more wonderful because it seemed to be common to be concerned with biscuits and coffee a hundred times she had seen lady osborne wrapped up in such infinitesimal cares as these and had thought only that her mind and her soul were altogether concerned with serving that the provision for the comfortable house and the good dinner was aspiration sufficient for her spiritual capacity yet there had always been a little more than that there had been the moment in church when the sermon was to her taste and the hymn a favourite and she and her husband had tunelessly sung out of one book that had touched dora a little but she had then dismissed it as a banal affair of goodygoody combined with a melodious tune when she saw the great lunch that they both ate immediately afterward but now these details these marthacares had taken a different value this morning lady osborne had been in great pain had broken down in her endeavour to carry on somehow and was face to face with a medical interview which she dreaded but still she could think with meticulous care of her husbands milk of his slippers of his tendency toward strong coffee what if below the martha was mary if it was marys love that made martha so sedulous in serving all that she had overlooked not caring to see below a surface which she said was commonplace and prosperous the surface was transparent enough too it was not opaque she could have seen down into the depths at any time if she had taken the trouble to look before her marriage and for a few months after it she had thought she knew what depths meant she thought she knew what it was to be absorbed in another then had come her disillusionment she had worshipped surface only she knew no more of claude than that she had loved his beauty she had got accustomed to it she had at first disregarded what she had grown to call his vulgarity and had not got accustomed to it she had known he was honest and true and safe but she had grown to take all that for granted she had never studied him looked for what was himself she had had few glimpses of him no more than she had had of his mother but today she felt that with regard to her these glimpses were fused together they made a view a prospect of a very beautiful country but as yet there had no fusing like that come with regard to her husband now that she saw even the country the country of the graybusiness was beautiful and at present in her own warm country her young country beauty was lacking perhapshere the third subject came inperhaps even in the trouble that she felt threatened them there were elements that might be alchemized she was willing at least to attempt to find gold to transform what she had thought was common into the fine metal some alchemy of the sort had already taken place before her eyes she no longer thought common those little pathetic anxieties which she had heard this morning for days and months the same anxieties the same care had been manifest there was no day no hour in which lady osborne had not been concerned with the material comfort of those whom she loved she was always wondering if her husband had got his lunch at the house and what they gave him whether the motor had got there in time and if he remembered to put his coat on nor had her care embraced him alone one day she had come up to doras sitting room and found that there was a draught round the door and so had changed her seat but next day there was a screen placed correctly or claude had sneezed at dinner and a mysterious phial had appeared on his dressing table with the legend that directed its administration he had come in to dora to ask if she had any explanation of the bottle but she had none and they concluded mrs osborne had put it there fussily no doubt for a sneeze was only a sneeze but with what loving intent she remembered everything of that sort per liked kidneys his wife liked cocoa it was all attended to martha was in evidence but mary was there doras thoughts had strayed again she had meant to think about the trouble that she felt was threatening and to see if by some alchemy it might be transformed into a healing of hurt she did not believe that she was fanciful in expecting bad news she wished to contemplate the effect of it if it came supposing lady osborne was found to be suffering from something serious how was she herself to behave she had to make things easier for her fatherinlaw she had to be of some use that was not so difficult a little affection meant so much to him he glowed with pleasure when she was kind but for claude that was more difficult she had to be all to him it was much harder there to meet the needs she ought to meet and should instinctively meet without thought once if she had said oh claude all would have been said because the simple words were a symbol but now she could not say oh claude like that she could be martha that was easy but it was not martha who was wanted the door from his dressing room opened and he came in shielding with his hand the light of his candle so that it should not fall on her face the outline of his fingers even to her halfshut eyes was drawn in luminous red where the light shone through the flesh he had often come in like that fearing to awaken her often she had been awake as she was now tonight she feigned sleep and she heard the soft breath that quenched the candle she heard a whisper of voice close to her words of one who thought that none heard good night my darling he said chapter xi jim had been engaged to spend this weekend with a party of which it is sufficient to say that though it would probably be amusing it would not appear in the columns of the morning post but on the saturday afternoon he sent an excuse and remained in town instead much as he hated solitude he had got something to do which made solitude a necessary evil he had got to sit down and think and continue thinking till he had made up his mind he had to adopt a certain course of action or by not acting at all commit himself to another course claude had not come back into the room after sending that message by the telephone and calling to him the farewell he had been unable to answer a few seconds before only when he himself had come into the room and found claude examining the counterfoils of his chequebook he had thought that all was over and had claude said nothing to him just looked at him and pointed with a finger to the blank counterfoil close to the end of the book jim would have confessed but claude had spoken at once those incredible words and the moment after had confirmed the reality of them by the message to his bank the immensity of that relief had taken away jims power of speech had he tried to use his voice he must have screamed then he heard the door of the flat shut and the next moment he was rolling on the sofa his face buried in its cushions to stifle his hysterical laughter the incredible had happened the impossible was now part of the sober history of the month the bank had called in question the cheque evidently claude had come down here to see whether he had drawn a cheque of corresponding date had found a blank counterfoil not the first in the book and had accepted that as evidence that the cheque was of his own drawing the possibility of a forgery never apparently occurred to him his vaunted carelessness about money matters was strikingly exemplified he had not exaggerated it in the least what a blessed decree of providence that ones brotherinlaw shall be so rich and such an idiot jim felt almost satisfied with the world but next moment with the same suddenness as this spasm of relief had come it ceased swift and huge as the genie of some arabian tale a doubt arose and before it fully developed itself it was a doubt no longer but a certainty for one moment his relief had tricked him into believing that claude thought the cheque to be of his own drawing the next jim could no more delude himself with that rich as claude was fool as he was it was not possible that he should believe himself to have drawn five hundred pounds in cash but a week ago and today find no trace of it nor any possible memory of how he had spent it no the cheque had been called in question claude therefore must know that forgery had been committed that was certain but he had told his bankers that the cheque was genuine jim got up from the sofa put the cushion in its place and smoothed it with mechanical precision what did this mean did he guess by whom the forgery was committed in a moment jim felt injured and indignant at the idea of such a possibility crossing claudes mind he had never given him the shadow of ground for thinking that such a thing as forgery was possible to him it was an insult of the grossest kind if such a notion had ever presented itself to him but claude was of a suspicious nature once before jim remembered dora had talked some nonsense about jims having cheated at croquet and claude had said that he was satisfied that this was not the case when jim told him it was not he won a sovereign over that silly game of croquet but it was monstrousif truethat claude should suspect him of this it was impossible for any selfrespecting person however unworthy of selfrespect to stop in his rooms accept his hospitality until he had made sure that such an idea had never crossed claudes mind his sense of injury bordered upon the virtuous and then with disconcerting rapidity sense of injury and virtue all vanished he could not keep it up he saw through himself once more his mind went back to the rapturous possibility that had caused him to bury his face in the sofacushion was there any chance of claudes believing that the cheque was genuine but already the question did not need an answer that possibility was out of sight below the horizon and he was here alone swimming drowning that claude knew forgery had been committed was certain then and for some reason he shielded the forger either he suspected jim the sense of injury and virtue did not make themselves felt now or he did not if he did not good if he did well good also since he shielded him quickwitted and mentally nimble as he was jim took a little while to realize that situation in the normal course of life he would necessarily meet claude often and he could not see himself doing so he could not see how social intercourse was any more possible or would claude avoid such intercourse manage somehow that they should not meet that might be managed for a time but not permanently dora would ask him to dine or lady osborne would ask him to stay and either he or claude would always have to frame excuses yet claudes words of farewell to him had been quite normal and cordial there was nothing there that anticipated unpleasantness or estrangement in the future perhaps claude harboured no suspicion against him then whom did he shield there was only one person himself who could have done this whom there could be sufficient motive for shielding and then suddenly his own dislike of his brotherinlaw flared up into hatred the hatred of the injurer for the injured which is one of the few things in this world that are pure black and have no ray of reflection of anything good however inverted and distorted in them and he was living in the rooms eating the food drinking the wine of the man whom he hated that claude had loaded him with benefits made as once before his offence the greater and he was in claudes power at any moment even if he did not suspect jim now of having done this he had but to send a further message to the bank saying that their suspicion was correct and he had not drawn the cheque and he would suspect no further for he would know the hot hours of the sunny afternoon went by not slowly at all but with unusual speed though he passed them doing nothing but occasionally walking up and down the room he had told parker when he sent his telegram of excuse about the river party that he would dine at home and alone and it was a matter for surprise when he was told that dinner was ready and after dinner he sat again in the room where this morning he had found claude with his chequebook as far from his decision as ever but about one thing he had made up his mind he believed claude knew or at any rate suspected who had done this there was no other explanation that could account at all reasonably for his shielding the culprit it was no time to invent utopian explanations and even they would be elusive to the seeker jim wanted to see the things that were actually the case on this evening what was to be done what was to be done he could not tell claude that his suspicions were grossly and gratuitously insulting for claude had expressed none he had said there was nothing to suspect no ground for suspicion nor did jim see that it was possible to continue seeing claude feeling that he was in his hands that at any moment he might disown the cheque and let the bank pursue the usual course claude had been generous quixotically generous that morning but who knew whether that might not only be a momentary impulse or even a move merely to gain time to consider it was a serious step to let ones wifes brother be prosecuted but very likely he had only done it to stay immediate proceedings very likely he wanted to talk it over with dora first and at that thought the breaking point came through these solitary hours jim had faced a good deal and the fibres of endurance were weakened and he could not face that anything was more tolerable than the picture of dora being told generous that word had occurred in his thoughts and it had been applied by him to claude it was no less than his due he had always been generous his generosity had not cost him much had not entailed selfdenial but it had been there it had been given first in very little ways as when he gave jim free living at the flat then in larger ways when for the sake of dora he imputed mere carelessness to himself instead of letting crime be brought home to another the price of his generosity concerned nobody and jim was beaten the worst of him surrendered to something a little better than the worst the surrender was not nobly made it was made from necessity because every other course was a little more impossible than that claude had to be told he knew that he was in claudes hands already the most he could do and the least was to seem to put himself there and then suddenly he felt so tired that thought was no longer possible and he fell asleep where he sat it was deep in the night when he woke for the noise of traffic had almost sunk to silence but from the dreamlessness of exhausted sleep he passed straight into full consciousness again and took up the tragic train of thought where he had left it he did not reconsider his decisionit was cut in steelnor did he desire to for to wish for the impossible requires the strong spring of hope and of hope he had none he was beaten he resigned and then on the outer darkness there shone a little ray claude whom a few hours ago he had hated with the rancour of the injurer had been generous appallingly generous was there nothing he could do for claude yes one thing the hardest of all the utmost for weeks he knew things had not gone well with him and dora he got on her nerves his vulgarities as was most natural irritated her and she could no longer see in him anything but them but there was more in claude than that she did not know it but he might tell her perhaps if she knew she would see would understand or had claude already told her that had seemed possible before a thing easily pictured but he did not think it likely now it was not consistent with what claude had already done for it must have been for his wifes sake that he had acted thus a little while before it had seemed to jim the worst possible thing the one unbearable thing that dora should know but looked at from this new standpoint it was different if claude told her it was one thing it was another if he did if he did if he could it might help dora to see that there was something in claude beyond his commonness andjim was a long time coming to itit might in some degree atone not in claudes eyes for he would not tell claude what he meant to do but inin those eyes which look on all evil things and all good things and see the difference between them there were a few arrangements to be made on sunday but he made them without flinching claude and dora were at grote and a line to claude there asking to see him as soon as possible on monday and a line to dora at park lane saying that he wanted to see her alone in the afternoon was all that was necessary it was better to take those interviews in that orderhe could not help being clever over itfor it was easier to face dora when able to tell her that he had already confessed to claude what he had to say would come with more force thus she would see that for the sake of helping claude and her he had done something that could not have been easy all that day down at grote they waited for news from sir henry but none came lord osborne always optimistic saw the most hopeful significance in his silence depend upon it my dear he said to dora as she went to bed that night depend upon it sir henry has seen my lady again and has quite forgotten that we might be in some anxiety because as he knows now forgetting he aint told us theres nought to be anxious about thats like those busy menlord my dear fancy passing your life in other peoples insides so to speakwhy it would make you forget your own name but if there had been any cause for us to worry depend upon it hed have let us know i bet i shall be making a joke of my ladys ailments before im twentyfour hours older ill be getting a few ready for her as i do my undressing tonight and its me as is cheering you up my dear this moment you go to sleep quiet or else ill tell mrs o that youve given me such an uncomfortable sunday as ive not had since first we was married then came monday morning dora had her early post brought up to her bedroom but since she had received saturday posts forwarded from town yesterday there was nothing sent on in fact there was only one letter for her directed to her here and she opened it and read it claude had already left by an early train when she got down she did not expect this since as far as she knew he had no engagements that morning and had intended not to leave till a later train but he had gone lord osborne and she were going to lunch in the country and drive back afterward but after breakfast when the last guests had gone she went to him he was in the room he called the libry and was reading the morning post see here my dear he said and think how were all at the mercy of the press theres my lady giving a little party this evening and im blest if they dont know all about it already listen here lady osborne has a small party tonight to meet ah dont said dora not meaning to speak but knowing she had to instantly the paper fell to the ground what is it my dear he said i have heard from sir henry she said she gave him a moment for that then she went on dad dear she said there is trouble he saw her again yesterday and has written to me about it there is something wrong he does not know for certain what it is but they will have to find out oh it is no use my hinting at it youve got to know yes my dear yes said he they have got to operate it may be very bad indeed they cant tell yet they dont know till they see dora drew a long breath it may be cancer she said and by instinct she put her hand over her eyes so that she should not see him mrs o he said very quietly dora heard the buzzing of honeyquesting bees in the flowerborder outside the window the clicking of a mowing machine on the lawn and from close beside her the slow breathing of lord osborne without looking at him she knew that he had pursed up his lips almost as if whistling a habit of his in perplexed moments he had been smoking a cigar when she came in and she heard him lay this down on a tray by his elbow and then he spoke well my dear he said weve all got to help her bear it whatever it is dora found it impossible to speak for a moment she could have given him sympathy had there been anything in his words that suggested it was wanted she could have told him that they must hope for the best that the worst was by no means certain yet there were a hundred quite suitable things to say if only he had appeared to need them in the least but quite clearly he did not he did not happen to be thinking about himself at all or to want any consolation and in face of this simplicity she was dumb it was perfect there was nothing to be said except give the sign of assent and my dear if youll order the motor round at once ill put a few papers together as i must take up with me and then i think ill be off and whatll you do my dear hadnt you better stop as planned and have your morning in the country not but what i should dearly like to have you by my side ah dad said she and kissed him he smiled at her holding her hand tight a moment weve got to keep our pecker up my dear he said so as to help her keep hers shell be brave enough when she sees were brave god bless her and brave we are and will be my dearie wed scorn to be cowards and im glad we didnt know this till this morning for shell be pleased to hear as we had such a pleasant sunday yes she could think of nothing else when she talked to me on saturday said dora what little more there was to be told she told him on their way up but otherwise their drive was rather silent once or twice he leaned out of the window and spoke to the chauffeur you can get along a bit quicker here he said theres an empty road then he turned to dora if you dont mind going a bit above the average my dear he asked twould be a good thing too if we got home before claude and its but a slow train hell have caught and once again as they crossed the great heathery upland of ashdown forest redolent with gorse and basking in the sun seems strange on a beautiful day like this he said but there who knows but that we shant have some pleasant weather yet claude meantime getting jims letter by the same post that had brought his news to dora had left by an earlier train in order to see jim as soon as possible he had gone before dora came down and thus heard nothing of sir henrys letter and though he was anxious to know as soon as he got to town how his mother was he determined to go to the flat on his way to park lane that would not take long whatever it might be that jim wished to tell him a few minutes he imagined would suffice all the way up he pondered over it but think as he might he could find only one explanation of jims request and that was that he was going to confess that was the best thing that could happen and as far as he could see it was the only thing but the thought of his own part embarrassed him horribly he had no liking for his brotherinlaw and guessed that on jims side there was a similar barrenness of affection all this would make the interview difficult and painful he could forgive him easily and willingly but instinctively he felt how chilly a thing forgiveness is if there is no warmth of feeling behind to vitalize it but when first he suspected that jim had done this he felt sorry for him if it turned out that he was going to confess his pity was certainly not diminished on the threshold he paused his repugnance for what lay before him was almost invincible and all his pondering had led to nothing practical he was still absolutely without idea as to what he should say himself but the thing had to be done waiting made it no easier and he went in he would have to trust to the promptings of the moment all he was sure of was that he did not feel unkind but only sorry sohad he known ithe need not have been so very uncomfortable jim was standing in the window looking out on to the street he turned as claude came in but said nothing something had to be done and claude spoke you asked me to come and see you he said so i came up as early as i could oh good morning jim he looked up and saw that jim did not speak because he could not his face was horribly white and his lips were twitching and at the sight of him helpless and whatever he had done suffering horribly a far greater warmth of pity came over claude than he had felt hitherto all his kindness was challenged and the prompting of the moment was not a mistaken one oh i say old chap he said and stopped short for jim broke during all those two hideous days he had nerved himself up to encounter abuse disgust any form of righteous wrath and contempt he knew well that claude had spared him not for his own sake but for doras and in this confession he was going to make he was prepared to be treated as he deserved though claude had spared him public disgrace but what he had not nerved himself up to encounter was kindness such as that which rang in those few words and once more but now not with hysterical laughter but with the weeping of exhaustion and shame and misery he buried his head in that same sofa cushion claude felt helpless awkward brutal but it was no use doing anything yet there was no reaching jim till that violence had abated and he sat there waiting just crossing over once to the door and bolting it for fear parker should come in and at length he laid his hand on jims shoulder its knocked you about awfully he said i can see that im awfully sorry you must have had a hellish two days you neednt tell me you know jim pulled himself together and raised his head thats just what i must do he said i forged your cheque well well said claude but jim had got the thing said and now he went on with suppressed and bitter vehemence ive always been a swindler i think he said im rotten thats what the matter with me ive cheated all my life i cant even play games without cheating i cheated you at croquet once and won a sovereign dora saw again claudes instinct not his reason prompted him and not amiss it only told him he was sorry for jim and could a little reassure him over this but she didnt know we were playing for money said he quickly in fact i told her we were not so its twice that you have spared me her rather said jim claude accepted the correction it was an obvious one to him no less than to jim yes shed have been awfully cut up if she had known he said simply jim got up i wonder if you can believe i am sorry he said i am my god ive touched bottom now why yes of course i believe it said claude its broken you up i can see that fellows dont break unless they are sorry but as for the thing itself if you dont mind my saying it i think all cheating is touching bottom its a rotten game you know that now though and if you can believe me im awfully sorry too its a wretched thing to happen but im so glad you told me it makes an awful difference that jim was silent a moment i want to ask you something he said at length when did you first suspect me was it when i came in and found you here on saturday claude bit his lip he did not at all like answering this no before that he said at least i was afraid it was you as soonas soon as i found i had left a chequebook here im sorry but as you ask me there it is from your previous knowledge of me asked jim quietly well yes i suppose so though you make me feel a brute i say i dont think its any good going back on that either for your sake or mine yes it is it hurts thats why its good claude shifted his place on the sofa a shade nearer jim and again laid his hand on his shoulder well i think youve been hurt enough for the present he said i dont like seeing it youve had as much as you can stand just now jim shook his head theres another thing too he said im absolutely cleaned out and i cant repay you till next quarter claude considered this it was perfectly cheap and easy to say that he need not think of paying at all but his judgment gave him something better to say than that well well wait till then he said i dont want to be unreasonable again jims lip quivered and claude seeing that rose to go well i must get back he said i want to hear how the mater is she hasnt been well and sir henry franks saw her on saturday and again yesterday look round after lunch will you i dont think dora and the governor get back till then and youll come on to the musical show this evening therell be some good singing right oh but still jim could not speak and there was silence again then claude spoke quickly finally buck up old chap he said and went straight to the door without looking back he let himself out and went for a turn up and down the street before going to park lane he had been a good deal moved for kindhearted to the core it was dreadful to him to see as he expressed it a fellow so awfully down in his luck and he was conscious of another thing that struck him as curious he had liked jim during those few minutes he had seen him today a thing he had never done before and he wished he could have made things easier for him which again was a new sensation for all that he had ever done for his brotherinlaw he had done frankly for doras sake but he could not see how to make this easier it was no use telling him that cheating was a thing of no importance it was no use telling him he need not pay back what he owed that was not the way to make the best of this very bad job of course jim must feel miserable it would be a thing to sicken at if he did not luckily however there was no doubting the sincerity of his wretchedness and yet the boyish sort of advice implied by the buck up was in place too but he felt vaguely that he could have done much better than he had done in that had he known it he would have found that jim disagreed with him he was told to his surprise by the servant who let him in that dora and his father had arrived a few minutes ago and that dora wished to see him as soon as he came in accordingly he went straight to her room oh claude she said you have come we didnt know where you were i had no idea you had left grote till i came down to breakfast there was trouble in her voice and he noticed it wondering if by any chance it had something to do with the trouble he had seen already that day but clearly it could not what is it he said quickly your mother she said for it was no use attempting to break things sir henry saw her again yesterday there has to be an operation there is some growth they cant tell what it is for certain until they operate dad is going to see her now they have settled it is best for him to tell her of course he wont tell her what the fear is oh claude i am so sorry it is so dreadful how does the governor take it asked claude exactly as you would expect but it will be awful for him telling her said he i had much better per or i anyhow itll tear his heart out he wont let you when sir henry spoke of telling her he said at once thats for me to do and then he went away to have a few minutes alone before going to her a tap came at the door lord osborne always tapped before he entered doras room it was her bit of a flat he called it and his tap was ringing the bell and asking if she was in well claude my lad he said dora will have told you weve all got to keep up a brave heart for your mothers sake claude kissed his father and somehow that went to doras heart he had once said to her that kissing seemed pretty meaningless when she was not concerned yes dad said he that we will thats right my boy and that blessed girl of yours has been so good to me such as never was and if shell give her dad a kiss too why there we are and thank you my dear now im going to see mother and tell her and i daresay shell like to see you both some time today though if she doesnt why youll both understand wont you theyve fixed it for tomorrow if shes agreeable dad do let me do that for you said claude its better for me to tell her no my lad thats for your father and no other said he though its like you to suggest it and thank you my boy ill come straight back to you my dears and tell you how all goes and how she takes it and pray try to quiet mrs per shes carrying on so silly wringing her hands and asking is she better is she better and telling me to bear up and all as if i didnt know that small thanks to her per takes her back to sheffield this afternoon thank the lord and may i be pardoned for that speech but its how i feel with her ridiculous ways he went straight to his wifes room and was admitted by the nurse lady osborne was in bed of course but smiled to him with neither more nor less than her usual cheerfulness well and theres my eddie she said and i hope youve had a

dinner i think claude do you go and telephone to her now for me and you mr o go down and help him and ill chat to dora the while there was no mistaking the intention of this diplomacy and the two men left the room then lady osborne turned to dora my dear she said youll have heard all there is to know and i just want to tell you that im facing it o k as claude says therell be nothing on my part to make anybody else shake and tremble but youll have an eye to your dad dear he feels it more than me though god knows im coward enough really its got to be and though i hate the thought of the knifewell my dear those as are born into the world and have the pleasure of it have to take the troubles as well as the joys and if they find the worst im prepared for that as long as i know youll stick to mr o and help him and theres claude too sometimes ive thought youve not been so happy together as i could have wished i dont know what is wrong but ive thought sometimes as all isnt quite right i wanted to say just that to you that was why i sent them down together so crafty but he loves you my dear and you cant do more than love and youre going to bear him a child please god my dear thats the best thing god ever thought of if i may say so for us women ive had two bless them and i should have liked to have had a hundred id have borne each one with thanksgiving she was silent a moment claudes a kind lad she said he takes after father and he loves you too im not presuming i hope my dear thats all thats been on my mind and i wanted to get it said youll forgive an old woman as is your boys mother thank you my dear for giving me that kiss ill treasure that ill think of that when they send me off to sleep tomorrow the others came back at this moment with the news that lady austell would come to dinner now thats nice for your brother said lady osborne hell like to find his mamma here dora had telephoned to jim to say she would come and see him after lunch since receiving his note that morning she had given but little thought to what he might have to say to her for these other events banished all else from her mind in spite of that which lay before them all she could hardly feel sad she could hardly feel anxious for the noble simplicity and serenity of the other three infected her to the exclusion of all else with its own peace she had not got to comfort anybody to make any effort herself she was lifted off her feet and borne along in these beautiful shining waters of courage and quietness indeed it seemed to her that no one was making any effort at all she did not find her fatherinlaw sitting with his head in his hands and rousing himself when she came in to a semblance of cheerfulness she did not see claude trying to suppress signs of emotion they all behaved quite naturally at first it amazed her for she knew at any rate that there was no lack of love and tenderness in either of them it seemed that they must be exerting some stupendous control over themselves then she saw slowly but surely how wide of the mark such an explanation was they were exerting no control at all they behaved like that because they felt like that because their attitude toward life and death and love was serene and large and quiet all these months it had been there for her to see but inexplicably blind as she now felt she had been she had needed this demonstration of it before she began even faintly to understand it was no wonder then that jims affairs had been obliterated from her mind but now as she entered that flat she wondered what he wanted that should make him wish to see her in this appointed way for a moment with a sickening qualm she went back to that quarter of an hours suspense on saturday morning when she had allowed herself to fear that he was connected in some hideous fashion with the cheque claude could not recollect about that had haunted her afterward too when she lay long awake at grote on saturday night but claude had said so emphatically that the cheque was all right that she felt her fear to be fanciful meantime jim did not yet know about lady osborne and as soon as she entered she told him oh jim she said we are in trouble lady osborne has got to have an operation there is something wrong and they want to see what it is there is a growth of some sort and oh i have been so blind so blind they are all behaving so splendidly and yet behaviour is the wrong word they behave splendidly just because they are splendid i never guessed they were like that ill tell you all about it but first what did you want to see me about you dont look well dear what is it im all right said he but what is it asked dora again vaguely frightened jim leaned forward with his elbows on his knees propping his head on his hands this was worse than the telling of claude had been but it had to be done he had promised some humble sorry little denizen within him that he would do it did claude speak to you about a cheque he asked which he could not remember drawing yes and then afterward he said it was all right said she then ive got to tell you he said then her fear seized her again in full force dont jim she cried dont tell me theres anything wrong its no use beating about he said i forged that cheque and cashed it claude knows i told him dora sat still a moment then she put her hands up to her head open the window she said i am stifling he got up and threw open the window away from the street then he walked over to the chimney piece and leaned his elbows on it with his back to her at first dora felt nothing but hard anger and indignation and she knew that if she spoke at all it would be to say something which could do no good and perhaps only make a breach between them that could never be healed and it was long that she waited it was long before any spark of pity for him was lit then she spoke oh jim what a miserable business she said but why did you tell me couldnt you have spared me knowing or perhaps you were afraid claude would tell me no i dont tell you for that reason he said after i saw claude this morning i knew he would never tell you why then because i want to tell you about claude it may do some good well claudes treated me in a way thats beyond my understanding he is beyond your understanding too at present and thats why i am telling you i wish you could have been here when i told him he was only sorry for me if he was god he couldnt have been more merciful and it wasnt put on he felt it and i wanted for once to see if i couldnt be of some use he turned round and faced her i want you to know what sort of a fellow claude really is he said i know you dont get on well and thats because you dont know him you judged him first by his facethat and perhaps a little bit by his wealth and then you judged him by what you and i call vulgarity and want of breeding thats not claude either claudes the fellow who treated a swindler and a forger in the way ive told you hes got a soul thats more beautiful than his face you know and hes the handsomest fellow i ever saw i wanted you to get a glimpse of it it might help things thats all ive got to say im sorry for giving you the pain of knowing what ive done but i thought it might do good hes just broken me up with his goodness thats claude the anger was quite gone now and it was a tremulous hand that dora laid on his shoulder oh jim she said thank you i am so sorry for you you know and im grateful i shall go back and tell claude i know andand thank him and be sorry yes that is the best thing you can do said jim claude was alone in their sitting room when she got back and as he always did he rose from his chair as she entered for a moment she stood looking at him mute beseeching then she came to him thank you about jim dear she said he has just told me about it to make memake me see what you were oh claude i didnt know and then the tears came but his arm was around her and her head lay on his shoulder chapter xii uncle alf was seated with dora on the terrace at grote one afternoon late in august dora herself was hatless and cloakless for it was a day of windless and summer heat but uncle alf had an overcoat on and a very shabby old gray shawl in addition cast about his shoulders his face wore an expression of ludicrous malevolence and i had to come out here my dear and take refuge with you he said for maria will drive me off my head with talk of that tumour of hers why she speaks as if nobody had ever had a tumour before i said to her maria if it had been cancer now and youd got over as you have it might have been something to make a tale of but tumour god bless me and benignant so sir henry said at that dora gave a little shriek of laughter uncle alf sometimes i think youre the unkindest man in the whole world she said and even when youre most unkind i cant help laughing i wonder if you are unkind really i dont expect so uncle alf took no notice of this and went on with his grievances as for eddie im sure i dont know what to make of him he said i shouldnt wonder if hes going softheaded for he was always threatened that way to my thinking he can talk of nothing but the brave and beautiful maria lord my dear its a wonder to me that you can stand it doesnt it get on your nerves doesnt it make you feel sick and ill to hear how they go on dora laughed again no uncle alf it doesnt do you know you see i was with them through all those dreadful days in the summer after the operation when they still didnt know what it was for certain and had to make an examination and it made a tremendous impression on me i always used to think that they all including claude were very ordinary people well theyre not they were very wonderful they were cheerful even when they were waiting for a verdict that might have been so terrible bah said uncle alf yes if you wish they used to get on my nerves that is quite true and you gave me a hint about it once which was very useful you told me to see the humorous side of dad and mother lord its dad and mother is it said alf in a tone of acid disgust yes dad and mother just as you are uncle alf but ill call you mr osborne if you prefer very well then i took that hint and sometimes now i laugh at them which i never did before i often laugh at them now and let them see me laughing and dad says to mother theres dora at her jokes again what have you said they know how i love them dear dont make such awful faces they were so splendid you know and claude asked his uncle after a pause i didnt do justice or anything like it to claude till then she said he used to get on my nerves too very badly indeed i dont mind telling you since ive told him and weve laughed over that but all that time in july combined with something very fine that i found out he had done made me see that what got on my nerves did not matter in the least what mattered was claude himself whom i didnt know before i love that boy said uncle alf with unusual tenderness and im glad you do my dear because he deserves all the love you can give him but i am glad you laugh at him too theres no sense in not seeing the ridiculous side of people oh yes i laugh at him often said dora i think he likes it you see hes so dreadfully fond of me that he likes all i do uncle alf gave a contemptuous sniff yes hes off his head about you he said i thought he had more sense but theres very little sense in anybody when you come to know them i know its foolish of him said dora i tell him so but then im foolish about him i expect if two people are foolish about each other they can stand a lot of the others folly though i expect it isnt grammar it is rather nice to be foolish about a man if he happens to be your husband it seems to me you married him first and fell in love with him afterward said uncle alf thats exactly what i did do said dora softly and whats this fine thing claude did asked the other gave a cabman a sovereign i suppose and told him to keep the change much hed miss it and you thought that was devilish noble eh i cant tell you what it was said she nobody must know that uncle alf was silent a minute he wanted to say something illtempered but could not think of anything well im glad the boys done something to deserve you my dear he said though that sounds as if i was getting softheaded too and perhaps i am joining like this in this chorus of praise thisthis domestic symphony but i can stand you and claude what i cant stand is eddie and maria lord if they arent coming out here when i thought i had escaped she in her bath chair and he pushing it a man of his age and as stout as that hell be bursting himself one of these days and then we shall have maria making us all sick with telling us how beautifully he bore it and nobody behaved so bravely over a burst as her eddie dora giggled hopelessly oh you are such a darling she said i dont mind what you say the bath chair had approached and lady osborne put down her sunshade as they came into the strip of shadow where dora and uncle alf sat he edged away from her as far as the angle of the house and the flower beds would permit well and if this isnt pleasant she said eddie my dear well stop here a bit and have a rest if were not interrupting and indeed its near teatime and i want my tea badly today i do but my appetites been so good since my operation alf broke in maria if i hear any more about you and your operation i leave the house he said well and im sure thats the last thing i want you to do said lady osborne genially for im enjoying this little family party such as never was why all the time i was getting better in london i was looking forward to it and dreamed about it too there now alf dont be so tetchy stopping your ears in that manner as if you had the neuralgia and was sitting in a draught i was only going to say id been looking forward to a week or two of quiet down here with you all and pleased i was to know that you would join us instead of setting on richmond hill with the motors and all buzzing round you and raising clouds of dust with germs uncountable mr o my dear youre all of a perspiration with pushing me and thank you wont you be wise to put a wrap on same as your brother does when he sits out of doors especially with you in that heat no my dear im comfortable enough i was only wondering whether dora was wise to sit here in that thin dress itll strike chill before sunset dora again burst out laughing dad we shall drive uncle alf off his head if we all think so much about each other she said hes been making a formal complaint to me about it he finds us all very trying and wheres claude and jim asked alf i hope theyre taking great care of each other claude cut his finger this morning and he bore it wonderfully never a cry nor a sob but i wonder at you maria letting them ride horses all about the country without a doctor or a pair of surgeons to follow them in case of accidents they might fall off and be hurt a savage and dangerous beast is a horse and more especially a mare such as claude was riding lady osborne entirely refused to notice the sarcastic intent of this well to be sure weve all got to take our risks she said thered be no sense in passing your life wrapped up in cottonwool and waiting for the doctor why and you used to ride too when you was a lad alf said her husband youre making dora laugh at you and i dont wonder i could laugh myself alf got up from his chair i think youd both be the better for an operation you and maria he said i should have a bit of humour put in instead of a bit of tumour taken out not but what its a far more serious affair i doubt if either of you would get over it well and its you who talked about my tumour this time said lady osborne triumphantly this was too much for alf he walked shufflingly back to the house leaving his sisterinlaw in possession of the field but she used her victory nobly with pity for the conquered lady osborne looked round in a discreet and penetrating manner after he had gone and was out of hearing dora my dear you mustnt mind what alf says she remarked with much acuteness he gets a bit sour now and then and im sure i dont wonder with his lumbago and no one to look after him if only he had found a nice girl to look after him when he was young poor old alf but you can take it from me as knows him he doesnt really mean all he says its his joke and im not one to quarrel with a joke and bless him why shouldnt he joke in his own way just as the rest of us do and if sometimes he seems a bit illhumoured over his jokewell you let him get his bit of illhumour off his mind and hell be all the better for it i never take no notice and it dont hurt me alf and his joke i say over to myself and no harm done rum old cove is alf said her husband he seems sometimes to want to quarrel with us all but it takes two to make a quarrel and hell have hard work to find the second in this house if i know who lives in it and he was just as anxious as he could be maria when you was at your worst in the summer telephoning five and six times in the day till i said down the tube marias love and shes asleep till morning and what itll be when dora here mr o you go too far said his wife in a shrill aside but as you were saying about alf if theres crust outside theres crumb within its a soft heart like your own mr o though he dont know it dad when last were you angry with anybody asked dora can you remember lord osborne considered this it was a question that required research well my dear if you leave out things like my being angry with the mother for giving us all such a fright last julytheres one for you mariai couldnt rightly say i had a dishonest foreman i remember at the works whom i had to dismiss summary too one monday morning but i think i was more sorry for his wife and children than i was angry with him nine children there was and another expected poor lamb and stillborn when it came for i inquired dora saw lady osborne shoot out a furtive finger at him and he understood then i was angry with claude one day he continued when he was a little lad i think the devil must have been in the boy for what must he do but rake out the fire from his mothers drawing room grate and dump it all on the hearthrug and yet i could scarce help laughing even when i gave him his spanking what was in the boys head that he should think of a trick like that perhaps it was his joke too something that looks mischievous at first like old alfs jokes ill take another cup of tea mother for heres claude coming with jim and such a teapot drainer as claude i never saw yes i doubt hell injure his stomach said lady osborne for im told that tea tans the coats of it like so much leather sir henry told me so when we were having a chat one morning after hed dressed the place for me well the less we know about our insides the better to my way of thinking said her husband until theres some call to see whats going on eat your dinner and drink your wine and get your sleep of nights and youve done what you can to keep it contented and im sure nones got a better right to tell us how to keep well than you my dear said lady osborne appreciatively for bar a bit of gout now and then as it isnt reasonable you should be spared theres not an hours anxiety your healths given me since first we met mr o and heres the boys ready for their tea ill be bound old alf and his saying that he wondered at me allowing them to go horseback all this these quiet ordinary domestic conversations as well as things of far greater import had entirely changed in character for dora but it was for her only that they had changed in themselves they were exactly as they had been before there came those days which so she put it to herself had opened her eyes and given sight to them for she had labelled them trivial or tiresome according as her own mood had varied and though discussion on subjects of high artistic or spiritual import was not rare but unknown among the osbornes she had now the sense to see that the kindly utterances of simple people possibly illustrated though they did not allude to qualities that were not at all trivial for she saw now the personalities that lay behind these details of their life the hearts out of which the mouths spoke it was that which gave its tone to what had become music and if lord osborne lingered in his cellar to find a bottle of wine that sir thomas appreciated it was no longer sir thomass undoubted greediness that concerned her but his hosts desire that his guest should enjoy himself and she knew now that the spirit which did not think it trivial to see that the dinner was good or that the wine was plentiful was perfectly capable of rising to higher levels than these when there was a call for courage courage of a very wonderful sort had answered when endurance was needed endurance was there when charity as in the case of jim the charity that met the difficult and disgraceful situation was complete and had all the fineness and delicacy which only perfect simplicity can give how claude had done it she did not know there seemed no question of finesse or of diplomatic behaviour he had merely behaved without difficulty like claude and but a few weeks afterward there was jim sensitive and highly strung as he always was staying with them all not like a guest but as one of the family as lady osborne loved to think and it was not that he was lacking in the sense of shame that made his friendship with claude possible it was that he like dora had had his eyes opened a heart as kind as claudes counted for something after all they both it must be supposed had taken it for granted until it was shown them but the sight of it the practical knowledge of it worked the miracle worked it easily as if there was no miracle about it dora had gone to her room shortly after tea to rest on the diplomatic prompting of her motherinlaw with so many gentlemen present lady osborne would never have said dora the doctor told you to rest for a couple of hours before dinner but she had reminded her that she had several letters to write for the post and dora secretly and kindly smiling had remembered at once though like the almug trees there were no such letters and with her to her room she took up the parcel of thought that has been indicated for she wanted to examine its contents a little more closely before claude came up as he always did to read to her for a while before she dressed right at the bottom of the packet she knew there lay something very precious she would look at that by and by with him perhaps but in spite of the preponderance that qualities of the heart had now gained in her mind compared to what must be called qualities of the surface to which belonged such things as beauty and breeding she found that the latter had not at all lost their value but she saw such things differently they had assumed so it seemed to her not a truer value but the true value she loved claudes beauty more than even in those enchanted days of honeymoon in venice not only now because it was beauty but because it was claudes while such superficial failings as were undoubtedly his she laughed at still but now without bitterness or irritation they were funny to say a handsome lady was still ludicrous but now since it was claude who said it it could not help being lovable indeed she and jim had invented what they called the claude catechism which began are you a handsome lady no but i am a perfect gentleman and then claude would throw whatever was handiest at jims head and how like pharaoh had she at one time hardened her heart refusing to give admittance so it seemed to her now to that sunshine of beautiful qualities that was always ready to stream in upon her he had never failed her he had always been patient waiting for the door to open for the closed windows to be unbarred true in the early days he thought they had been unbarred that he had full admittance but in the weeks that followed when it was clear to him that ingress was given him no longer he had waited waited without bitter thought of her she had made him after their reconciliation try to explain what he had felt to her and he had done it unwillingly but not failing to answer her questions you see it was like this darling he had said i saw something was wrong and i tried to find out if i had done anything or how i could set things right but it didnt seem to me that i had altered at allat least i knew i hadnttoward you from the time that you said you loved me and so the best thing i could do was just to keep on at that i thought of all sorts of things tried to wonder at your reasons for not being pleased with me but that was no use id always been myself to you andand i thought you might care for me again later on of coursei suppose it was in a selfish wayi was glad when poor old jim made such a mistake because that gave me an opportunity you see towell treat him decently not that i ever thought it would get to your ears however it did jim was a trump over that going and telling you i didnt mean him to but when it happened like that i couldnt help being pleased you had been a bit hard on me you know thank god you were for it makes it better now that you are not lord what a jaw this was the outcome of her talk with him but the jaw was punctuated by questions of hers it was another claude catechism but this one was not funny nor had jim any part in it yes she had separated this man who loved her into packets there was her mistake first she had loved his beauty and then had taken that for granted next she had felt growingly irritated with all in him that did not correspond to the particular little tricks of conversation and life in which she had been brought up then she had got accustomed to those sterling qualities which she had taken for granted from the first and then had come the little more and how much it was he had but shown in practical demonstration that he was kind and brave and reliable all that she had thought she had given him credit for at first but the effect was immense she fell in love at first real sight with his qualities that fused the whole at last she was in love with the man not with his face not with his character taken by itself but with him as a whole that splendid body was his his too were the greater splendours of character and if his also were the things dealt with in the public claude catechism they were no longer rejected they were no longer even accepted they were welcomed and hugged the reason for this was plain it was claude who said and did all that which was symbolized under the title of handsome lady and since it was claude it was a thing to be kissed though laughter came too he was no longer packets they were fused into one dear whole the thought of which and the presence of which made her heart ache with tenderness and now thinking of these things she had a thirsty eye for the opening of the door a thirsty ear for the sound of his foot in the passage outside but she knew he would not come quite yet for at tea some silly discussion had arisen between him and jim as to whether it was possible to get with a run from the bottom of the terrace to the lake in twelve strides jim had been vehement on the impossibility of it and though claude cordially agreed that it was a feat of which jim was pathetically incapable he backed himself to do it for the sum of one shilling even now she could hear him running along the terrace below the window and jims voice counting the strides dora got up and strolled on to her balcony the last attempt had apparently been unsuccessful for claude was starting again and next moment with great strides his long legs were taking him across the grass that sloped down to the lake this time it looked as if he would easily succeed for the sixth leap had taken him well beyond the halfdistance the eleventh took him within a couple of yards of the edge and next moment dora joined in the shout of laughter that came from jim for it had not apparently occurred to claude what happened next if you leap at top speed to the margin of a lake but he knew now as he vanished in a fountain of spray it was the deep end of the lake too jim had collapsed altogether on the ground by the time claude swam to shore and dora was equally helpless on the balcony but by the time the involuntary bather had wrung his clothes out jim had recovered sufficiently to find the shilling he had lost to him oh it was cheap at the price he said i wish it had been a florin claude walked up the terrace to the house leaving a trail of water on the paving stones and in a moment his dressing room door opened with a crack and a head and naked shoulder came round the corner darling ive been making a fool of myself he said i must change first and then shall i come in to read to you yes do she said still laughing i saw it i thought i should have a fit cant you do it again before you change it was too heavenly yes if you wish said he but i shall have to put on my wet clothes again she laughed again no there would be no first fine careless rapture the second time she said whats that asked claude nothing browning change and then come and read to me it was not long before he joined her and seated himself on the floor by the side of the sofa where she lay with his back against it the book he was reading was esmond and that evening they came to the chapter in which harry comes home on december th and goes to the service in winchester cathedral and claude read she gave him her hand her little fair hand there was only her marriage ring on it the quarrel was all over the year of grief and estrangement had passed they had never been separated doras hand lay on her husbands arm and he felt a soft pressure of her fingers oh claude she said how nice he was so faithful and patient and it all came right he let the book fall to the ground as soon as she spoke he ceased to think of esmond and though doras words referred to him she was not thinking of him either they had never been separated she went on still quoting but still not thinking of the book they hadnt really been separated because their love was present all the time but she had let it get covered up with irritation and impatience was it like that it happened i cant remember he said indeed i cannot everything seems unreal that isnt perfect and there is something more coming she said coming soon perhaps in a few days now so tonight dear let us talk a little instead of reading even that beautiful chapter i am glad we got to it today i like stopping just at those very words and i want you to tell me

knelt by her side she leaning on her elbow toward him in the humility of the simple words there was something exquisite to him they flooded his heart with a tender protectiveness oh my darling you say that to me indeed indeed i never reproached you dora was still grave i know that she said but i reproached myself how could i help it but claude the sting has gone out of my selfreproach i cant help

on the balcony for a little she said what an evening the sun had set but not long and in the west a flash of molten red lay along the horizon that melted into orange which again faded into pale green higher up the sky was of velvet blue and little wisps of feathery cloud flushed with rose colour were flecked over it the stars were already lit and some noble planet near to its setting flamed jewellike in that green strip of sky already the colours were half withdrawn from the garden beds but a hint of the flower presences came to them in the little fragrant breeze that fluttered mothlike in the stillness beyond lay the lake screened from the glory of sunset by the tall clumps of rhododendrons on its far side and in the shadow the water was dark and steellike in tone birds still chuckled in the bushes and from far away came the pulse of some hurrying train and in the hush and quiet of the hour they spoke together of the dear event that was coming and would not be long delayed so i wanted she said at last to clear everything off my mind which could make me look backward i want nothing to exist for me except you and our love for each other even dad and mother must get a little dim i cant explain i think i understand very well said he and you wont be frightened for me claude she asked yet i neednt ask you i saw what you were when mother was ill he did not answer what

was so extraordinarily appropriate and he persuaded jim to come back to richmond with him lady austell had very thoughtfully let the house at deal most advantageously for the whole month of september and intended to have a nice long stay at grote really it was quite too wonderful that doras baby should be born at grote it was a clear case of special providence then came a day when the house was very still and the hot hours passed with leaden foot to claude it seemed that the morning would never pass to noon and when noon was over each hour the more seemed an eternity twice told but just before sunset there was heard the cry of a child later he was allowed to see dora for a moment and in a cot by her bed tiny and red and crumpled lay that which had come into the world oh claude she
