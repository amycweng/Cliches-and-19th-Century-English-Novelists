produced from images available at the internet archive mrs ames by e f benson author of dodo the angel of pain the climber juggernaut etc etc toronto the musson book company limited london hodder stoughton richard clay sons limited brunswick street stamford street s f and bungay suffolk chapter i certainly the breakfast tongue which was for the first time that morning was not of the pleasant reddish hue which mrs altham was justified in expecting considering that the delicacy in question was not an ordinary tinned tongue you had to take things as you found them if your false sense of economy led you to order tinned goods but one that came out of a fine glass receptacle with an eminent label on it it was more of the colour of cold mutton unattractive if not absolutely unpleasant to the eye while to the palate it proved to be singularly lacking in flavour altogether it was a great disappointment and for reason when mr altham set out at a quarterpast twelve to stroll along to the local club in queensgate street with the ostensible purpose of seeing if there was any fresh telegram about the disturbances in morocco his wife accompanied him to the door of that desirable mansion round which was grouped a variety of chainedup dogs in various states of boredom and irritation and went on into the high street in order to make in person a justifiable complaint at her grocers she would be sorry to have to take her custom elsewhere but if mr pritchard did not see his way to sending her another tongue of course without further charge she would be obliged so this morning there was a special and imperative reason why mrs altham should walk out before lunch to the high street and why her husband should make a morning visit to the club but to avoid misconception it may be stated at once that there was on every day of the week except sunday some equally compelling cause to account for these expeditions if it was very wet perhaps mrs altham might not go to the high street but wet or fine her husband went to his club and exactly the same thing happened in the case of most of their friends and acquaintances so that mr altham was certain of meeting general fortescue mr brodie major ames and others in the smokingroom while mrs altham encountered their wives and sisters on errands like her own in the high street she often professed superior distaste for gossip but when she met her friends coming in and out of shops it was but civil and reasonable that she should have a few moments chat with them thus if any striking events had taken place since the previous afternoon they all learned about them simultaneously there was a similar interchange of thought and tidings going on in the smokingroom at the club so that when mr altham had drunk his glass of sherry and returned home to lunch at onethirty there was probably little of importance and interest which had not reached the ears of himself or his wife it could then be discussed at that meal queensgate street ran at rightangles to the high street debouching into that thoroughfare at the bottom of its steep slope while the grocers shop lay at the top of it the morning was a hot day of early june but to a woman of mrs althams spare frame and active limbs the ascent was no more than a pleasurable exercise and the vivid colour of her face so unlike the discouraging hues of the breakfast tongue was not the result of her exertions it was habitually there and though that and the restlessness of her dark and rather beady eyes might have made a doctor on a cursory glance especially if influenza was about think that she suffered from some slight rise of temperature he would have been in error her symptoms betokened not an unnatural warmth of the blood but were the visible sign of her eager and slightly impatient mind like the inhabitants of ancient athens she was always on the alert to hear some new thing though she disliked gossip but her mind appreciated the infinitesimal more than the important the smaller a piece of news was the more vivid was her perception of it and the firmer her grip of it large questions produced but a vague impression on her her husband a retired solicitor was singularly welladapted to be the partner of her life for his mind very much akin to hers and his appetite for news was no less rapacious indeed the chief difference between them in this respect was that she snapped at her food like a wolf in winter whereas he took it quietly in the manner of a leisurely boaconstrictor but his capacity was in no way inferior to hers similarly they practised the same harmless hypocrisies on each other and politely forbore to question each others sincerity an instance has already been recorded where such lack of trust might have been manifested but it never entered mrs althams head to tell her husband just now that he cared nothing whatever about the disturbances in morocco while she would have thought it very odd conduct on his part to suggest a sharply worded note to mr pritchard would save her the walk uphill on this hot morning but it was only sensible to go on their quests had they not ascertained if there was any news they would have had nothing to talk about at lunch as it was conversation never failed them for this little town of riseborough was crammed with interest and incident for all who felt a proper concern in the affairs of other people the high street this morning was very full for it was marketday and mrs althams progress was less swift than usual barrows of itinerant vendors were crowded into the road from the edge of the pavements leaving a straitened channel for a traffic swelled by farmers carts and occasional droves of dusty and perplexed looking cattle being driven in from the country round more than once mrs altham had to step into the doorway of some shop to avoid the random erring of a company of pigs or sheep which made irruption on to the pavement but it was interesting to observe in one such enforced pause the impeded passage of sir james westbournes motor with the owner broadfaced and goodhumoured driving himself and to conjecture as to what business brought him into the town then she saw that there was his servant sitting in the body of the car while there were two portmanteaus on the luggagerail behind there was no need for further conjecture clearly he was coming from the southeastern station at the top of the hill and was driving out to his place four miles distant along the maidstone road then he caught sight of somebody on the pavement whom he knew and stopping the car entered into conversation for the moment mrs altham could not see who it was then as the car moved on again there appeared from behind it the tall figure of dr evans mrs altham was not so foolish as to suppose that their conversation had necessarily anything to do with medical matters she did not fly to the conclusion that lady westbourne or any of the children must certainly be ill to a person of her mental grasp it was sufficient to remember that mrs evans was sir james first cousin she heard also the baronets cheerful voice as the two parted saying saturday the twentyeighth then ill tell my wife that of course settled it it required only a moments employment of her power of inference to make her feel convinced that saturday the twentyeighth would be the date for mrs evans gardenparty there were a good many gardenparties in riseborough about then for strawberries might be expected to be reasonably cheap probably the date had been settled only this morning she might look forward to receiving the athome card four to seven by the afternoon post the residential quarters of riseborough lay both at the top of the hill on which the town stood clustering round the fine old norman church and at the bottom along queensgate street which passed into the greater spaciousness of st barnabas road on the whole that might be taken to be the park lane of the place and commanded the highest rents every house there in addition to being completely detached had a small front garden with a carriage drive long enough to hold three carriages simultaneously if each horse did not mind putting its nose within rubbing distance of the carriage in front of it while the foremost projected a little into the road again but there were good houses also at the top of the hill where dr evans lived and those who lived below naturally considered themselves advantageously placed in being sheltered from the bleak easterly winds which often prevailed in spring while those at the top wondered among themselves in sultry summer days how it was possible to exist in the airless atmosphere below the middle section of the town was mercantile and it was here that the ladies of the place both from above and below met each other with such invariable fortuitousness in the hours before lunch today however though the street was so full it was for purposes of newsgathering curiously deserted and apart from the circumstance of inferentially learning the date of mrs evans gardenparty mrs altham found nothing to detain her until she had got to the very door of mr pritchards grocery but there her prolonged fast was broken mrs taverner was ready to give and receive and after the business of the colourless tongue was concluded in a manner that was perfectly creditable to mr pritchard the two ladies retraced their steps for mrs taverner was of st barnabas road down the hill again mrs taverner quite agreed about the strong probability of mrs evans gardenparty being on the twentyeighth and proceeded to unload herself of far more sensational information she talked rather slowly but without ever stopping of her own accord so that she got as much into a given space of time as most people even if she was temporarily stopped by an interruption she kept her mouth open so as to be able to proceed at the earliest possible moment yes three weeks as you say is a long notice is it not she said but im sure people are wise to give long notice otherwise they will find all their guests are already engaged such a quantity of parties as there will be this summer mrs ames has sent out dinnercards for exactly the same date i am told i daresay they agreed together to have a day full of gaiety perhaps you are asked to dine there on the twentyeighth mrs altham no not at present well then it will be news to you said mrs taverner if what i have heard is true and it was mrs fortescues governess who told me whom i met taking one of the children to the dentist that would be edward said mrs altham unerringly i have often noticed his teeth are most irregular one here another there she spoke as if it was more usual for children to have all their teeth on the same spot but mrs taverner understood very likely indeed i think i have noticed it myself well what i have to tell you seems very irregular too edwards teeth are nothing to it it was talked about so missi can never recollect her name and from what i hear i do not think mrs fortescue finds her very satisfactoryit was talked about so mrs fortescues governess told me at breakfast time and it was agreed that general fortescue should accept for if you are asked three weeks ahead it is no use saying you are engaged no doubt mrs ames gave that long notice for that very reason but what is it that is so irregular asked mrs altham nearly dancing with impatience at these circumlocutions did i not tell you ah there is mrs evans i was told she was asked too without her husband how slowly she walks i should not be surprised if her husband had told her never to hurry she did not see us otherwise we might have found out more about what asked the martyred mrs altham why what i am saying mrs ames has asked general fortescue to dine that night without asking mrs fortescue and has asked mrs evans to dine without asking dr evans i dont know who the rest of the party are i must try to find time this afternoon to call on mrs ames and see if she lets anything drop about it it seems very odd to ask a husband without his wife and a wife without her husband and we do not know yet whether dr evans will allow his wife to go there without him mrs altham was suitably astounded but i never heard of such a thing she said and i expect my memory is as she nearly said long but stopped in time clear and retentive as that of most people it seems very strange it will look as if general fortescue and his wife are not on good terms and as far as i know there is no reason to suppose that however it is none of my business and i am thankful to say that i do not concern myself with things that do not concern me had mrs ames wanted my advice as to the desirability of asking a husband without a wife or a wife without a husband i should have been very glad to give it her but as she has not asked it i must suppose that she does not want it and i am sure i am very thankful to keep my opinion to myself but if she asked me what i thought about it i should be compelled to tell her the truth i am very glad to be spared any such unpleasantness dear me here i am at home again i had no idea we had come all this way mrs taverner seemed inclined to linger but the other had caught sight of her husbands face looking out of the window known as his study where he was accustomed to read the paper in the morning and go to sleep in the evening this again was very irregular for the watch on her wrist told her that it was not yet a quarterpast one the hour at which he invariably ordered a glass of sherry at the club to fortify him for his walk home possibly he had heard something about this revolutionary social scheme in the club and had hastened his return in order to be able to talk it over with her without delay for a moment it occurred to her to ask mrs taverner to join them at lunch but after all she had heard what that lady had to tell and one of the smaller bundles of asparagus could not be considered ample for more than two so she checked the hospitable impulse and hurried into his study alert with suppressed information though she did not propose to let it explode at once for the method of them both was to let news slip out as if accidentally and even as she crossed the hall an idea for testing the truth of what she had heard which was both simple and ingenious came into her head she despised poor mrs taverners scheme of calling on mrs ames in the hope of her letting something drop for mrs ames never let things drop in that way though she was an adept at picking them up her own plan was far more effective also it harmonized well with the system of mutual insincerities i have been thinking my dear she said briskly as she entered his study that it is time for us to be asking major and mrs ames to dinner again yes pritchard was reasonable and will send me another tongue and take back the old one which i am sure i am quite glad that he should do though it would have come in for savouries very handily still he is quite within his rights since he does not charge for it and i should not think of quarrelling with him because he exercises them mr altham was as keen a housekeeper as his wife its colour would not have signified in a savoury he said no but as pritchard supplies a new tongue without charge we cannot complain about mrs ames now we dined with them quite a month ago i do not want her to think we are lacking in the exchange of hospitalities which i am sure are so pleasant on both sides mr altham considered this question caressing the side of his face there was no doubt that he had a short pointed beard on his chin but about halfway up the jawbone the hair got shorter and shorter and he was quite cleanshaven before it got up to his ear it was always a question in fact among the junior and less respectful members of the club whether old altham had whiskers or not the general opinion was that he had whiskers but was unaware of that possession it is odd that the idea of asking mrs ames to dinner occurred to you today he said for i was wondering also whether we did not owe her some hospitality and major ames of course he added mrs altham smiled a bright detective smile next week is impossible i know she said and so is the week after as there is a perfect rush of engagements then but after that we might find an evening free how would it suit you if i asked mrs ames and a few friends to dine on the saturday of that week let me countseven fourteen twentyone yes on the twentyeighth i think that probably mrs evans will have her gardenparty on that day it would make a pleasant ending to such an afternoon and it would be less of an interruption to both of us if we give up that day it would be better than disarranging the week by sacrificing another evening mr altham rang the bell before replying it is hardly likely that major and mrs ames would have an engagement so long ahead he said i think we shall be sure to secure them the bell was answered a glass of sherry he said i forgot my dear to take my glass of sherry at the club young morton was talking to me though i dont know why i call him young and i forgot about my sherry yes i should think the twentyeighth would be very suitable mrs altham waited until the parlourmaid had deposited the glass of sherry and had completely left the room with a shut door behind her i heard a very extraordinary story today she said though i dont for a moment believe it is true if it is we shall find that mrs ames cannot dine with us on the twentyeighth but we shall have asked her with plenty of notice so that it will count but one never knows how little truth there may be in what mrs taverner says for it was mrs taverner who told me she said that mrs ames has asked general fortescue to dine with her that night without asking mrs fortescue and has invited mrs evans also without her husband one doesnt for a moment believe it but if we asked mrs ames for the same night we should very likely hear about it was anything said at the club about it mr altham affected a carelessness which he was very far from feeling young morton did say something of the sort he said i was not listening particularly since as you know i went there to see if there was anything to be learned about morocco and i get tired of his tittletattle but he did mention something of the kind there is the luncheonbell my dear you might write your note immediately and send it by hand for james will be back from his dinner by now and tell him to wait for an answer mrs altham adopted this suggestion at once she knew of course perfectly well that the thrilling quality of the news had brought her husband home without waiting to take his glass of sherry at the club a thing which had not happened since that morning a year ago when he had learned that mrs fortescue had dismissed her cook without a character but she did not think of accusing him of duplicity after all it was the amiable desire to talk these matters over with her without the loss of a moment which was the motive at the base of his action and so laudable a motive covered all else so she had her note written with amazing speed and cordiality and the bootandknife boy who also exercised the function of the gardener was instructed to wash his hands and go upon his errand criticism of mrs ames action based on the hypothesis that the news was true was sufficient to afford brisk conversation until the return of the messenger and mrs altham put back on her plate her first stick of asparagus and tore the note open a glance was sufficient it is all quite true she said mrs ames writes we are so sorry to be obliged to refuse your kind invitation but general fortescue and millicent evans with a few other friends are dining with us this evening well i am sure so after all mrs taverner was right i feel i owe her an apology for doubting the truth of it and i shall slip round after lunch to tell her that she need not call on mrs ames which she was thinking of doing i can save her that trouble mr altham considered and condemned the wisdom of this slipping round that might land you in an unpleasantness my dear he said mrs taverner might ask you how you were certain of it you would not like to say that you asked the ames to dinner on the same night in order to find out no that is true you see things very quickly henry but on the other hand if mrs taverner does go to call mrs ames might let drop the fact that she had received this invitation from us i would sooner let mrs taverner know it myself than let it get to her in roundabout ways i will think over it i have no doubt i shall be able to devise something now about mrs ames new departure i must say that it seems to me a very queer piece of work if she is to ask you without me and me without you is the other to sit at home alone for dinner for it is not to be expected that somebody else will on the very same night always ask the other of us as likely as not if there is another invitation for the same night it will be for both of us for i do not suppose that we shall all follow mrs ames example and model our hospitalities on hers mrs altham paused a moment to eat her asparagus which was getting cold as a matter of fact my dear we do usually follow mrs ames example he said she may be said to be the leader of our society here and if you gave me a hundred guesses why we do follow her example said mrs altham rather excitedly picking up a head of asparagus that had fallen on her napkin i am sure i could not give you one answer that you would think sensible there are a dozen of our friends in riseborough who are just as well born as she is and as many more much better off not that i say that money should have anything to do with position though you know as well as i do that you could buy their house over their heads henry and afford to keep it empty while all the time i for one dont believe that they have got three hundred a year between them over and above his pay and as for breeding if mrs ames manners seem to you so worthy of copy i cant understand what it is you find to admire in them except that she walks into a room as if it all belonged to her and looks over everybodys head which is very ridiculous as she cant be more than two inches over five feet and i doubt if shes as much i never have been able to see and i do not suppose i ever shall be able to see why none of us can do anything in riseborough without asking mrs ames leave perhaps it is my stupidity though i do not know that i am more stupid than most henry altham felt himself to blame for this agitated harangue it was careless of him to have alluded to mrs ames leadership for if there was a subject in this world that produced a species of frenzy and a complete absence of fullstops in his wife it was that desperately before now had she attempted to wrest the sceptre from mrs ames podgy little hands and to knock the crown off her noticeably small head she had given parties that were positively lucullan in their magnificence on her first coming to riseborough the regimental band part of it at least had played under the elmtree in her garden on the occasion of a mere afternoonparty while at a dance she had given a thing almost unknown in riseborough there had been a cotillion in which the presents cost up to five and sixpence each to say nothing of the trouble she had given a party for children at which there was not only a christmastree but a conjuror and when a distinguished actor once stayed with her she had instead of keeping him to herself which was mrs ames plan when persons of eminence were her guests asked practically the whole of riseborough to lunch tea and dinner to all of these great parties she had bidden mrs ames with a view to her deposition and on certainly one occasionthat of the cotillionshe had heard afterwards unimpeachable evidence to show that that lady had remarked that she saw no reason for such display therefore to this day she had occasional bursts of volcanic amazement at mrs ames undoubted supremacy and made occasional frantic attempts to deprive her of her throne there was no method of attack which she had not employed she had flattered and admired mrs ames openly to her face with a view to be permitted to share the throne she had abused and vilified her with a view to pulling her off it she had refrained from asking her to her own house for six months at a time and for six months at a time she had refused to accept any of mrs ames invitations but it was all no use the vilifications so she had known for a fact had been repeated to mrs ames who had not taken the slightest notice of them nor abated one jot of her rather condescending cordiality and in spite of mrs althams refusing to come to her house had continued to send her invitations at the usual rate of hospitality indeed for the last year or two mrs altham had really given up all thought of ever deposing her and her husband though on this occasion he felt himself to blame for this convulsion felt also that he might reasonably have supposed the volcano to be extinct yet such is the disconcerting habit of these subliminal forces they break forth with renewed energy exactly when persons of exactly average caution think that there is no longer any life in them he hastened to repair his error and to calm the tempest by fulsome agreement well my dear he said certainly there is a great deal in what you say for we have no reason to suppose that everybody will ask husband and wife singly or that two of this new set of invitations will always come for the same night then too there is the question of carriagehire which though it does not much matter to us will be an important item to others for every time that husband and wife dine out there will be two carriages needed instead of one i wonder if mrs ames had thought of that not she said mrs altham whose indignation still oozed and spurted why as often as not she comes on foot with her great goloshes over her evening shoes ah i have it a brilliant idea struck her which did much to restore her equanimity you may depend upon it she said that mrs ames means to ask just husband or wife as the case may be and make that count that will save her half the cost of her dinners and now i come to think of it i am sure i should not be surprised to learn that they have lost money lately major ames may have been speculating for i saw the financial news on the table last time i was there i daresay that is it that would account too for the very poor dinner we got salmon was in season i remember but we only had plaice or something common and the ordinary winter desert just oranges and apples you noticed it too henry you told me that you had claret that couldnt have cost more than eighteenpence a bottle and but one glass of port afterwards and the dinner before that though there was champagne i got little but foam poor thing i declare i am sorry for her if that is the reason and i am convinced it is mrs altham felt considerably restored by this explanation and got briskly up i think i will just run round to mrs taverners she said to tell her there is no need for her to call on mrs ames since you have heard the same story at club so that we can rest assured that it is true that will do famously it will account for everything and there is pritchards cart at the gate that will be the tongue i wonder if he has told his man to take away the pale one if not as you say it will serve for savouries summer had certainly come in earnest and mr altham when he went out on to the shaded verandah to the east of the house in order to smoke his cigar before going up to the golflinks found that the thermometer registered eighty degrees in the shade consequently before enjoying that interval of quiescence which succeeded his meals and to which he felt he largely owed the serenity of his health he went upstairs to change his cloth coat for the light alpaca jacket which he always wore when the weather was really hot last year he remembered he had not put it on at all until the end of july except that on one occasion he wore it over his ordinary coat for it was loosely made taking a drive along an extremely dusty road but the heat today certainly called for the alpaca jacket and he settled himself in his chair after tapping the barometer and observing with satisfaction that the concussion produced an upward tremor of the needle which was at set fair already feeling much more cool and comfortable life in general was a very cool and comfortable affair to this contented gentleman even in youth he had not been of very exuberant vitality and he had passed through his early years without giving a moments anxiety to himself or his parents like a good child who eats and digests what is given him so mr altham even in his early manhood had accepted life exactly as he found it and had seldom wondered what it was all about or what it was made of his emotions had been stirred when he met his wife and he had once tried to write a poem to hersoon desisting owing to the obvious scarcity of rhymes in the english language and since then his emotional record had been practically blank if happiness implies the power to want and to aspire that quality must be denied him but his content was so profound that he need not be pitied for the lack of the more effervescent emotions all that he cared about was abundantly his there was the times to be read after breakfast news to be gleaned at the club before lunch golf to be played in the afternoon and a little wellearned repose to be enjoyed before dinner while at odd moments he looked at the thermometer and tapped the aneroid he was distinctly kindly by nature and would no doubt have cheerfully put himself to small inconveniences in order to lighten the troubles of others but he hardly ever found it necessary to practise discomfort since those with whom he associated were sunk in precisely the same lethargy of content as himself being almost completely devoid of imagination no qualms or questionings as to the meaning of the dramas of life presented themselves to him and his annual subscriptions to the local hospital and certain parish funds connoted no more to him than did the money he paid at the station for his railway ticket he was in fact completely characteristic of the society of riseborough which largely consisted of men who had retired from their professions and spent their days with unimportant variations in precisely the same manner as he did necessarily they were not aware of the amazing emptiness of their lives for if they had been they would probably have found life very dull and have tried to fill it with some sort of interest as it was golf gardening and gossip made the days pass so smoothly and quickly that it would really have been hazardous to attempt to infuse any life into them for it might have produced upset and fermentation but these chronicles would convey a very false impression if they made it seem as if life at riseborough appeared dull or empty at riseborough the affairs of other people were so perennial a source of interest that it would only be a detached or sluggish mind that was not perpetually stimulated and this stimulus was not of alcoholic character nor was it succeeded by reaction and headache after undue indulgence mr altham woke each morning with a clean palate so to speak and an appetite and digestion quite unimpaired as yet he had not to seek to fill the hours of the day with gardening like major ames or with continuous rubbers of bridge in the cardroom at the club his days were full enough without those additional distractions which he secretly rather despised as signs of senility and wondered that major ames who was still he supposed not much more than fortyfive should so soon have taken to a hobby that was better fitted for ladies and septuagenarians it was not that he did not like flowers he thought them pretty enough things in their place and was pleased when he looked out of the bathroom window in the morning and saw the neat row of red geraniums which ran along the border by the wall between calceolarias and lobelias very likely when he was older and other interests had faded he might take to gardening too at present he preferred that the hired man should spend two days a week in superintending the operations of james certainly there would be some sense in looking after a vegetable garden for there was an intelligible end in view therenamely the production of early peas and giant asparagus for the table but since the garden at cambridge house was not of larger capacity than was occupied with a croquet lawn and a couple of flower borders it was impossible to grow vegetables and the production of a new red sweetpea about which major ames had really rendered himself tedious last summer was quite devoid of interest to him especially since there were plenty of other red flowers before his cigar was already halfsmoked before he recalled himself from this pleasant vacancy of mind which had succeeded the summer resumal of his alpaca jacket and for the ten minutes that still remained to him before the cab from the liverystables which was to take him up the long hill to the golflinks would be announced he roused himself to a greater activity of brain it was natural that his game with mr turner this afternoon should first occupy his thoughts he felt sure he could beat him if only he paid a very strict attention to the game and did not let his mind wander a few days ago mr turner had won merely because he himself had been rather late in arriving at the clubhouse and had started with the sense of hurry about him but today he had ordered the cab at ten minutes to three instead of at the hour thus he could both start from here and arrive there without this feeling of fuss their appointed hour was not till a quarterpast three and it took a bare fifteen minutes to drive up also he had on his alpaca jacket he would not as on the last occasion of their encounter be uncomfortably hot as usual he would play his adversary for the sum of halfacrown that should pay both for cab and caddie his thoughts took a wider range certainly it was a strange thing that mrs ames should ask husbands without their wives and wives without their husbands of course to ask mrs evans without the doctor was less remarkable than to ask general fortescue without his wife for it sometimes happened that dr evans was sent for in the middle of dinner to attend on a patient and once when he was giving a party at his own house he had received a note which led him to get up at once and say to the lady on his right i am afraid i must go maternity case which naturally had caused a very painful feeling of embarrassment succeeded by a buzz of feverish and haphazard conversation but to ask general fortescue without his wife was a very different affair it was not possible that mrs fortescue should be sent for in the middle of dinner and cause dislocation in the party he felt that if any hostess except mrs ames had attempted so startling an innovation she would even with her threeweeks notice have received chilling refusals coupled with frankly incredible reasons for declining thus with growing radius of thought he found himself considering the case of mrs ames undoubted supremacy in the riseborough world most of what his wife had said in her excited harangue had been perfectly wellfounded mrs ames was not rich and a marked parsimony often appeared to have presided over the ordering of her dinners while so far as birth was concerned at least two other residents here were related to baronets just as much as she was mrs evans for instance was first cousin of the present sir james westbourne whereas mrs ames was more distant than that from the same fortunate gentleman by one remove her mother that is to say had been the eldest sister of the last baronet but one and older than he so that beyond any question whatever if mrs ames mother had been a boy and she had been a boy also she would now have been a baronet herself in place of the cheerful man who had been seen by mrs altham driving his motorcar down the high street that morning as for general fortescue he was the actual brother of a baronet and there was the end of the matter but though riseborough in general had a very proper appreciation of the deference due to birth mr altham felt that mrs ames supremacy was not really based on so wholesale a rearrangement of parents and sexes nor again were her manners and breeding such as compelled homage she seemed to take her position for granted and very seldom thanked her hostess for a very pleasant evening when she went away nor was she remarkable for her good looks indeed she was more nearly remarkable for the absence of them yet somehow mr altham could not perhaps owing to his lack of imagination see anybody else not even his own wife occupying mrs ames position there was some force about her that put her where she was you felt her efficiency you guessed that should situations arise mrs ames could deal with them she had a larger measure of reality than the majority of mr althams acquaintances she did not seem to exert herself in any way or call attention to what she did and yet when mrs ames called on some slightly doubtful newcomer to riseborough it was certain that everybody else would call too and one defect she had of the most glaring nature she appeared to take the most tepid interest only in what every one said about everybody else once not so long ago mrs altham had shown herself more than ready to question on the best authority the birth and upbringing of mrs turner the election of whose husband to the club had caused so many members to threaten resignation but all mrs ames had said when it was clear that the shadiest antecedents were filed so to speak for her perusal was i have always found her a very pleasant woman she is dinning with us on tuesday or again when he himself was full of the praise of mrs taverner to whom mrs ames was somewhat coldly disposedthough that lady had called three times and was perhaps calling again this afternoon mrs ames had never once asked her to lunch or dine and was believed to have left cards without even inquiring whether she was inmrs ames had only answered his panegyrics by saying i am told she is a very goodnatured sort of woman mr altham hearing the stopping of a cab at his frontdoor got up it was still thirteen minutes to three but he was ready to start indeed he felt that motion and distraction would be very welcome for there had stolen into his brain a strangely upsetting idea it was very likely quite baseless and illfounded but it did occur to him that this defect on the part of mrs ames as regards her incuriousness on the subject of the small affairs of other people was somehow connected with her ascendency he had so often thought of it as a defect that it was quite a shock to find himself wondering whether it was a quality in any case it was a quality which he was glad to be without the possession of it would have robbed him of quite nine points of the laws that governed his nature he would have been obliged to cultivate a passion for gardening like major ames of course if you married a woman quite ten years your senior you had to take to something and it was lucky major ames had not taken to drink he felt quite cynical and lost the first four holes later but too late he pulled himself together but it was poor consolation to win the bye only chapter ii mrs ames put up her black and white sunshade as she stepped into the hot street outside dr evans house about halfpast six on the evening of the twentyeighth of june and proceeded afoot past the halfdozen houses that lay between it and the high street in appearance she was like a small goodlooking toad in halfmourning or to state the comparison with greater precision she was small for a woman but goodlooking for a toad her face had something of the sulky and satiated expression of that harmless reptile and her mourning was for her brother who had mercifully died of delirium tremens some six months before this scarcely respectable mode of decease did not curtail his sisters observance of the fact and she was proposing to wear mourning for another three months she had not seen him much of late years and as a matter of fact she thought it was much better that his inglorious career since he was a hopeless drunkard had been brought to a conclusion but her mourning in spite of this was a faithful symbol of her regret he had had the good looks and the frailty of her family while she was possessed of its complementary plainness and strength but she remembered with remarkable poignancy even in her fiftyfifth year birdsnesting expeditions with him and the alluring of fish in unpopulous waters they had shared their pocketmoney together also as children and she had not been the gainer by it therefore she thought of him with peculiar tenderness it would be idle to deny that she was not interested in the riseborough view of his blackness it was quite well known that he was a drunkard but she had stifled inquiry by stating that he had died of failure what organ it was that failed could not be inquired into any one with the slightest proper feelingand she was well aware that riseborough had almost an apoplexy of proper feelingwould assume that it was some organ not generally mentioned she felt that there was no call on her to gratify any curiosity that might happen to be rampant she also felt that the chief joy in the possession of a sense of humour lies in the fact that others do not suspect it riseborough would certainly have thought it very heartless of her to derive any amusement from things however remotely connected with her brothers death riseborough also would have been incapable of crediting her with any tenderness of memory if it had known that he had actually died of delirium tremens in this stifling weather she almost envied those who like dr evans lived at the top of the town where in castle street was situated the charming georgian house in the garden of which he for a little while only and his wife for three hours had been entertaining their friends and detractors at the gardenparty though the house was in a street and not a road it had a garden which anybody would expect to belong to a road if not a place streets seemed to imply small backyards looking into the backs of other houses whereas dr evans house did not at its back look on other houses at all but extended a full hundred yards and then looked over the railway cutting of the southeastern line on open fields should you feel unkindly disposed it was easy to ask whether the noise of passing trains was not very disagreeable and indeed mrs taverner in a moment of peevishness arising from the fact that what she thought was champagne cup was only hock cup had asked that very question of millicent evans this afternoon in mrs ames hearing but millicent in her most confiding and childlike manner had given what mrs ames considered to be a wholly admirable and suitable answer indeed we do she had said and we often envy you your beautiful big lawn for everybody of course knew that mrs taverners beautiful big lawn was a small piece of black earth diversified by plantains and overlooked and made odorous by the new gasworks mrs taverner had as was not unnatural coloured up on receipt of this silken speech until she looked nearly as red as mrs altham for herself mrs ames would not even under this provocation have made so illnatured a reply though she was rather glad that millicent had done so and to account for her involuntary smile she instantly mrs altham to lunch with her next day indeed walking now down the high street she smiled again at the thought and mr pritchard standing outside his grocery store thought she smiled at him and raised his hat and mrs ames rather hoped he saw how different a sort of smile she kept on tap so to speak for grocers mrs ames knew very well the manner of speeches that mrs altham had been indulging in during the last three weeks about the little dinnerparty she was giving this evening for she had been indiscreet enough to give specimens of them to millicent evans who had promptly repeated them to her and it is impossible adequately to convey how unimportant she thought was anything that mrs altham said but the fact that she had said so much was indirectly connected with her asking mrs altham and your husband of course as she had rather pointedly added to lunch tomorrow for she knew that mrs altham would be bursting with curiosity about the success of the new experiment and she intended to let her burst she disliked mrs altham but that ladys hostility to herself only amused her of course mrs altham could not refuse to accept her invitation because it was a point of honour in riseborough that any one bidden to lunch the day after a dinnerparty must even at moderate inconvenience accept for otherwise what was to happen to the remains of salmon and of jelly too debilitated to be served in its original shape even though untouched but still excellent if eaten out of jellyglasses so much malice then must be attributed to mrs ames that she wished to observe the febrile symptoms of mrs althams curiosity and not to calm them but rather excite them further mrs ames would not naturally have gone for social purposes to the house of her doctor had he not married millicent whose father was her own first cousin and would have been baronet himself had he been the eldest instead of the youngest child as it was dr evans was on a wholly different footing from that of an ordinary physician for by marriage he as she by birth was connected with county which naturally was the crown and cream of riseborough society mrs ames was well aware that the profession of a doctor was a noble and selfsacrificing one but lines had to be drawn somewhere and it was impossible to contemplate visiting dr holmes a dentists profession was selfsacrificing too but you did not dine at your dentists though his manipulations enabled you to dine with comfort and confident smiles elsewhere such lines as these she drew with precision but automatic firmness and the apparently strange case of mr turner whom she had induced her husband to propose for election at the club whom with his wife she herself asked to dinner was really no exception for it was not mr turner who had ever been a stationer in riseborough but his father and he himself had been to a public school and a university and had since then purged all taint of stationery away by twenty years impartiality as a police magistrate in london true he had not changed his name when he came back to live in riseborough which would have shown a greater delicacy of mind and the present inscription above the stationers shop burrows late turner was obnoxious but mrs ames was all against the misfortunes of the fathers being visited on the children and riseborough with the exception of mrs altham had quite accepted mr and mrs turner who gave remarkably good dinners which were quite equal to the finest efforts of the scotch chef at the club mrs altham said that the turners had eaten their way into the heart of riseborough society which sounded almost witty until mrs ames pointed out that it was riseborough not the turners who had done the eating on which the wit in mrs althams mot went out like a candle in the wind it may perhaps be open to question whether mrs althams rooted hostility to the turners did not predispose mrs ames to accept them before their quiet amiability disposed her to do so for she was neither disposed nor predisposed to like mrs altham mrs ames way led through queensgate street and she had to hold her black skirt rather high as she crossed the road opposite the club for the dust was thick she felt it wiser also to screw her small face up into a tight knot in order to avoid inhaling the fetid blue smoke from an overlubricated motorcar that very rudely dashed by just in front of her she did not regard motors with any favour since there were financial reasons whose validity was unassailable why she could not keep one indeed partly no doubt owing to her expressed disapproval of them but chiefly owing to similar financial impediments riseborough generally considered that hired flies were a more gentlemanly and certainly more leisurely form of vehicular transport mrs altham as usual raised a dissentient voice and said that she and her husband could not make up their minds between a daimler and a rollesroyce this showed a very reasonable hesitancy since at present they had no data whatever with regard to either mrs ames permitted herself one momentary glance at the bowwindow of the club as she regained the pavement after this dusty passage and then swiftly looked straight in front of her again since it was not quite quite to look in at the window of a mans club but she had seen several things her husband was standing there with face contorted by the imminent approach of a sneeze which showed that his hayfever was not yet over as he hoped it might be there was general fortescue with a large cigar in his mouth and a glass probably of sherry in his hand there was also the top of a bald head peering over the geraniums in the window like a pink full moon that no doubt was mr turner for no one was quite so bald as he enjoying the privilege which she had been instrumental in securing for him then mrs altham passed her driving and mrs ames waved and kissed her blackgloved hand to her thinking how very angular curiosity made people while mrs altham waved back thinking that it was no use trying to look important if you were only five foot two so that honours were about divided finally just before she turned into her own gate she saw coming along the road walking very fast as his custom was the man she respected and even revered more than any one in riseborough she would have liked to wave her hand to him too only the reverend thomas pettit would certainly have thought such a proceeding to be very odd conduct he was county toovery much county although a clergymanbeing the son of that wealthy and distressing peer lord evesham who occasionally came into riseborough on county business on these occasions he lunched at the club instead of going to his sons house but did not eat the club lunch preferring to devour in the smokingroom like an ogre with false teeth sandwiches which seemed to be made of fish in their decline mrs ames who could not be called a religious woman but was certainly very high church was the most notable of mr pettits admirers and indeed had set quite a fashion in going to the services at st barnabas which were copiously embellished by banners vestments and incense indeed she went there in adoration of him as much as for any other reason for he seemed to her to be a perfect apostle he was rich and gave far more than half his goods to feed the poor he was eloquent and she would not have used so common a phrase let them all have it from his pulpit and she was sure he was rapidly wearing himself out with work and how thrilling it would be to address her rather frequent notes to him with the title the reverend the lord evesham she gave a heavy sigh and decided to flutter her podgy hand in his direction for a greeting as she turned into her gate the little dinner which had so agitated riseborough for the last three weeks gave mrs ames no qualms at all whatever happened at her house was right and she never had any reason to wonder like minor dinnergivers if things would go off well since she and no other was responsible for the feast it was mrs ames dinner party it was summoned for a quarter to eight and at halfpast ten somebodys carriage would be announced and she would say i hope nobody is thinking of going away yet in consequence of which everybody would go away at twenty minutes to eleven instead if anybody expected to play cards or smoke in the drawingroom he would be disappointed because these diversions did not form part of the curriculum the gentlemen had one cigarette in the diningroom after their wine and with their coffee then they followed the ladies and indulged in the pleasures of conversation mrs ames always sat in a chair by the window and always as the clock struck ten she resorted her conversationalists that was without disrespect a parlourtrick of the most supreme and unfathomable kind there was always some natural reason why she should get up and quite as naturally two or three people got up too then a sort of involuntary general post took place mrs ames annexed the seat of the risen woman whose partner she intended to talk to and instantly said do tell me because i am so much interested upon which her new partner sat down again the ejected female then wandered disconsolately forward till she found herself talking to some man who had also got up therefore they sat down again together but no one in riseborough could do the trick as mrs ames could do it mrs altham had often tried and her efforts always ended in everybody sitting down again exactly where they had been before after standing for a moment as if an inaudible grace was being said but mrs ames though not socially jealous for being the queen of riseborough society she had nobody to be jealous of was a little prone to spoil this parlourtrick when she was dining at other houses by suddenly developing an earnest conversation with her already existing partner when she saw that her hostess contemplated a copy of her famous manuvre yet after all she was within her rights for the parlourtrick was her own patent and it was quite proper to thwart the attempted infringement of it having waggled her hand in the direction of mr pettit she went straight to the diningroom where the dinnertable was being laid there was to be a company of eight tonight and accordingly she took three little cardboard slips from the top lefthand drawer of her writingtable on each of which was printed please take in to dinner these were presented in the hall to the men before dinner it was unnecessary to write one for her husband each folded with the name of the guest in question being written on the back while the name of the woman he was to take in filled the second line thus there were no separate and hurried communications to be made in the drawingroom as everything was arranged already this was not so original as the other parlourtrick but at present nobody else in riseborough had attempted it then out of the same drawer she tookwhat she took requires a fresh paragraph printed menucards there were a dozen packets of them each packet advertising a different dinner an astounding device requiring enlargement of explanation she discovered them by chance in the military stores in london selected a dozen packets containing fifty copies each and kept the secret to herself the parlourmaids had orders to tweak them away as soon as the last course was served so that no menucollector if there was such retrospective glutton in riseborough could appropriate them and thus perhaps ultimately get a clue which might lead him to the solution for by a portent of illluck it might then conceivably happen that a certain guest would find himself bidden for the third or fourth time to eat precisely the same dinner as his odious collection told him that he had eaten six months before but the tweaking parlourmaids obviated that risk and if the menucards were still absolutely unsoiled mrs ames used them again there was one very sumptuous dinner among the twelve there were nine dinners good enough for anybody there were two dinners that might be described as poor it was one of these probably which mrs altham had in her mind when she was so ruthless in respect to mrs ames food but poor or sumptuous it appeared to the innocent riseborough world that mrs ames had her menucards printed as required that having constructed her dinner she sent round a copy of it to the printers to be set up in type probably she corrected the proofs also she never called attention to these menus and seemed to take them as a matter of course mrs altham had once directly questioned her about them asking if they were not a great expense but mrs ames had only shifted a bracelet on her wrist and said i am accustomed to use them mrs ames took four copies of one of these dinners which were good enough for anybody and propped them up two on each of the long sides of the table naturally she did not want one herself and her husband also naturally sometimes said what are you going to give us tonight amy in which case one of them was passed to him but he had a good retentive memory with regard to food and with a little effort he could remember what the rest of the dinner was going to be when the nature of the soup had given him his cue occasionally he criticized saying in his hearty voice this would be in the autumn or winter what what partridge again perdrix repetita isnt it general if you havent forgotten your latin and amy from the other end of the table replied well lyndhurst we must eat the game our friends are so kind as to send us and yet mrs altham declared that she had seen partridges from the poulterers delivered at mrs ames house but they are getting cheap now she added to her husband particularly the old birds i got a leg henry and the bird must have roosted on it for years before mrs ames friends were so kind as to send it her so mrs ames propped up the printed menucards and spoke a humorous word to her first parlourmaid i have often told you parker to wear gloves when you are putting out the silver i am not a detective i am not wanting to trace you by your fingerprints parker giggled discreetly somehow mrs ames servants adored their rather exacting mistress and stopped with her for years they did not get very high wages and a great deal was required of them but mrs ames treated them like human beings and not like machines it may have been only because they were so far removed from her socially but it may have been that there was some essential and innate kindliness in her that shut up like a parasol when she had to deal with such foolish and trying folk as mrs altham mrs altham indeed had tried to entice parker away with a substantial rise in wages and the prospect of less arduous service but that admirable servingmaid had declined to be tempted also she had reported the occurrence to her mistress it only confirmed what mrs ames already thought of the temptress she did not add any further black mark the table at present was devoid of any floral decoration but that was no part of mrs ames province her husband that premature gardener was responsible for flowers and wine when mrs ames gave a party and always returned home halfanhour earlier to pick such of his treasures as looked as if they would begin to go off tomorrow and make a subterranean excursion with a taper and the wine book to his cellar in the domestic economy of the house he paid the rent the rates and taxes the upkeep of the garden the wine bills and the cost of their annual summer holiday while mrs ames budget was responsible for coal electric light servants wages and catering bills arising out of this arrangement there occasionally arose clouds though no bigger than mrs ames own hand that flecked the brightness of their domestic serenity occasionallynot oftenmrs ames would be pungent about the possibility of putting out the electric light on leaving a room occasionally her husband had sent for his coat at lunchtime to supplement the heat given out on a too parsimonious hearth but such clouds were never seen by other eyes than theirs the presence of guests led major ames to speak of the excellence of his wifes cook and say pon my word i never taste better cooking than what i get at home and suggested to his wife to say to mrs fortescue my husband so much enjoys having the general to dinner for he knows a glass of good wine she might with truth have said that he knew a good many glasses finally the two shared in equal proportions the upkeep of a rather weird youth who was the only offspring of their marriage and was mistakenly called harry for the name was singularly illsuited to him he had lank hair protuberant eyes and a tendency to write poetry just now he was at home from cambridge and had rather agitated his mother that afternoon by approaching her dreamily at the gardenparty and saying mother mrs evans is the most wonderful creature i ever saw that seemed to her so wild an exaggeration as to be quite senseless and to portend poetry harry made his father uncomfortable too by walking about with some quite common rose in his hand and pretending that the scent of it was meat and drink to him also he had queer notions about vegetarianism and said that a hunch of brown bread a plate of beans and a lump of cheese contained more nourishment than quantities of mutton chops but though not much of a hand at victuals he found inspiration in what he called yellow wine and he and a few similarly minded friends belonged to a secret omar khayyam club at cambridge the proceedings of which were carried on behind locked doors not for fear of the jews but of the philistines a large glass saladbowl filled with yellow wine and sprinkled with roseleaves was the inspirer of these mild orgies and each omarite had to write and read a short poem during the course of the evening it was a point of honour among members always to be madly in love with some usually unconscious lady and paroxysms of passion were punctuated by byronic cynicism just now it seemed likely that mrs evans would soon be the fount of aspiration and despair that would create quite a sensation at the next meeting of the omar club nobody before had been quite so daring as to fall in love with a married woman but no doubt that phenomenon has occurred in the history of human passion so why should it not occur to an omarite the wine at mrs ames parties was arranged by her husband on a scale that corresponded with the food at either of the two poor dinners for instance a glass of marsala was accorded with the soup a light though wholesome claret moistened the rest of the meal and a single glass of port was offered at dessert the course of the nine dinners good enough for anybody was enlivened by the substitution of sherry for marsala champagne for claret and liqueurs presented with coffee while on the much rarer occasions of the one sumptuous dinner which always included an ice liqueur made its first appearance with the ice and a glass of hock partnered the fish tonight therefore sherry was on offer and when the dinner being fairly launched mrs ames took her first disengaged look round she observed with some little annoyance justifiable even laudable in a hostess that harry was talking in the wrong direction in fact he was devoting his attention to mrs evans who sat between him and his father instead of entertaining elsie her daughter whom he had taken in and who now sat isolated and silent since general fortescue who was on her other side was naturally conversing with his hostess certainly it was rubbish to call mrs evans a most wonderful creature there was nothing wonderful about her she was fair with pretty yellow hair an enthusiast might have called it golden she had small regular features and that look of distinction which mrs ames drawing herself up a little as she thought of it considered to be inseparable from any in whose veins ran the renowned westbourne blood she had also that slim tall figure which though characteristic of the same race was unfortunately not quite inseparable from its members for no amount of drawing herself up would have conferred it on mrs ames and harry took after her in this respect dr evans had not long been settled in riseboroughindeed it was only last winter that he had bought his practice here and taken the delightful house in which his wife had given so populous a gardenparty that afternoon their coming as advertised by mrs ames had been looked forward to with a high degree of expectancy since a fresh tenant for the red house especially when he was known to be a man of wealth though only a doctor was naturally supposed to connote a new and exclusive entertainer while his wifes relationship to sir james westbourne made a fresh link between the town and the county hitherto mrs ames had been the chief link and though without doubt she was a genuine one her mother being a westbourne she had been a little disappointing in this regard as she barely knew the present head of the family and was apt to talk about old days rather than glorify the present ones by exhibitions of the family to which she belonged but it was hoped that with the advent of mrs evans a more living intimacy would be established mrs evans was the fortunate possessor of that type of looks which wears well and it was difficult to believe that elsie with her eighteen years and elderly manner was her daughter she was possessed of that unemotional temperament which causes the years to leave only the faintest traces of their passage and they had graven on her face but little record of joys and sorrows her mouth still possessed the softness of a girls and her eyes large and blue had something of the shy unconscious wonder of childhood in their azure to judge by appearances which we shall all continue to do until the end of time though we have made proverbs to warn us against the fallibility of such conclusions she must have had the tender and innocent nature of a child and though mrs ames saw nothing wonderful about her it was really remarkable that a woman could look so much and mean so little she did not talk herself with either depth or volume but she had so to speak a deep and voluminous way of listening which was immensely attractive she made the man who was talking to her feel himself to be interesting a thing always pleasant to the vainer sex and in consequence he generally became interested to fire the word flirt at her pointblank would have been a brutality that would have astounded hernor indeed was she accustomed to use the somewhat obvious arts which we associate with those practitioners but it is true that without effort she often established relations of intimacy with other people without any giving of herself in return both men and women were accustomed to take her into their confidence it was so easy to tell her of private affairs and her eyes so wide and eager and sympathetic gave an extraordinary tenderness to her commonplace replies which accurately by themselves reflected her dull and unemotional mind she possessed in fact as unemotional but comely people do the potentiality of making a great deal of mischief without exactly meaning it and it would be safe to predict that the mischief being made she would quite certainly acquit herself of any intention of having made it it would be rash of course to assert that no breeze would ever stir the pearly sleeping sea of her temperament all that can be said is that it had not been stirred yet mrs ames could not permit elsies isolation to continue and she said firmly to harry tell miss evans all about cambridge which straightened conversation out again and allowed mrs evans to direct all her glances and little sentences to major ames as was usual with men who had the privilege of talking to her he soon felt himself a vivid conversationalist yes gardening was always a hobby of mine he was saying and in the regiment they used to call me adam the grand old gardener you know as tennyson says not that there was ever anything grand about me mrs evans mouth quivered into a little smile nor old either major ames she said major ames put down the glass of champagne he had just sipped in order to give his loud hearty laugh well well he said im pretty vigorous yet and can pull the heavy garden roller as well as a couple of gardeners could i never have a gardener more than a couple of days a week i do all the work myself capital exercise rolling the lawn and then i take a rest with a bit of weeding or picking a bunch of flowers for amys table weeding too an hours weeding a day keeps the doctor away i defy you to get lumbago if you do a bit of weeding every morning again a little shy smile quivered on millie evans mouth i shall tell my husband she said i shall say you told me you spend an hour a day in weeding so that you shouldnt ever set eyes on him and then you make poetry about it afterwards again he laughed well now i call that downright wicked of you he said twisting my words about in that way general i want your opinion about that glass of champagne its a wine and wants drinking the general applied his fishlike mouth to his glass wants drinking does it he said well itll get it from me delicious goo dry wine major ames turned to millie evans again beg your pardon mrs evans he said but general fortescue likes to know whats before him yes downright wicked of you im sure i wish amy had asked dr evans tonight but thereyou know what amy is shes got a notion that it will make a pleasanter dinnertable not to ask husband and wife always together she says its done a great deal in london now but they cant put on to their tables in london such sweetpeas as i grow here in my bit of a garden look at those in front of you black michaels they are look at the size of them did you ever see such sweetpeas i wonder what amy is going to give us for dinner tonight bit of lamb next is it and a quail to follow hope youll go nap mrs evans i must say amy has a famous cook and what do you think of us all down at riseborough now youve had time to settle down and look about you i daresay you and your husband say some sharp things about us hey find us very stickinthemud after london she gave him one of those shy little deprecating glances that made him involuntarily feel that he was a most agreeable companion ah you are being wicked now she said every one is delightful so kind so hospitable now major ames do tell me more about your flowers black michaels you said those were i must go in for gardening and will you begin to teach me a little why is it that your flowers are so much more beautiful than anybodys at least i neednt ask it must be because you understand them better than anybody major ames felt that this was an uncommonly agreeable woman and for half a second contrasted her pleasant eagerness to hear about his garden with his wifes complete indifference to it she liked flowers on the table but she scarcely knew a hollyhock from a geranium well well he said i dont say that my flowers which you are so polite as to praise dont owe something to my care rain or fine i dont suppose i spend less than an average of four hours a day among them year in year out and thats better isnt it than sitting at the club listening to all the gossip and tittletattle of the place ah you are like me she said i hate gossip it is so dull gardening is so much more interesting he laughed again well as i tell amy he said if our friends come here expecting to hear all the tittletattle of the place they will be in for a disappointment amy and i like to give our friends a hearty welcome and a good dinner and pleasant conversation about really interesting things i know little about the gossip of the town you would find me strangely ignorant if you wanted to talk about it but politics nowone of those beastly radical members of parliament lunched with us only the week before last and i assure you that amy asked him some questions he found it hard to answer in fact he didnt answer them he begged the question begged the question there was one i remember which just bowled him out she said what is to happen to the parks of the landed gentry if you take them away from the owners well that bowled him out as they say in cricket look at sir jamess place for instance your cousins place amys cousins place will they plant a row of villas along the garden terrace and who is to live in them if they do grant that lloyd georgeshe said thatgrant that lloyd george wants a villa there that will be one villa but the terrace there will hold a dozen villas who will take the rest of them she asked him that they take away all our property and then expect us to build houses on other peoples dont talk to me the concluding sentence was not intended to put a stop on this pleasant conversation it was only the natural ejaculation of one connected with landed proprietors mrs evans understood it in that sense do tell me all about it she said of course i am only a woman and we are supposed to have no brains are we not and to be able to understand nothing about politics but will they really take my cousin jamess place away from him i think radicals must be wicked more fools than knaves i always say said major ames magnanimously they are deluded like the poor suffragettes suffragettes now a womans sphere of influence lies in her home women are the queens of the earth ive often said that and what do queens want with votes would amy have any more influence in riseborough if she had a vote not a bit of it well then why go about smacking the faces of policemen and chaining yourself to a railing if i had my way major ames became of lower voice and greater confidence amy doesnt wholly agree with me he said and its a pleasure to thrash the matter out with somebody like yourself who has sensible views on the subject what use are women in politics none at all as you just said its for women to rock the cradle and rule the world i say and i have always said that to give them a vote would be to wreck their influence god bless them but amy doesnt agree with me i say that i will voteshes a conservative of course and so am ii will vote as she wishes me to but she says its the principle of the thing not the practice but what she calls principle i call want of principle home thats the womans sphere mrs evans gave a little sigh i never heard it so beautifully expressed she said major ames why dont you go in for politics major ames felt himself flattered he felt also that he deserved the flattery hence to him now it ceased to be flattery and became a tribute he became more confidential and vastly more vapid my dear lady he said politics is a dirty business nowadays we can serve our cause best by living a quiet and dignified life without ostentation as you see but by being gentlemen it is the silent protest against these socialistic ideas that will tell in the long run what should i do at westminster upon my soul if i found myself sitting opposite those radical louts it would take me all my time to keep my temper no no let me attend to my garden and give my friends good dinnersbless my soul amy is letting us have an ice tonightstrawberry ice i expect that was why she asked me whether there were plenty of strawberries glace de fraises she likes her menucards printed in french though i am sure strawberry ice would tell us all we wanted to know whats in a name after all conversation had already shifted and major ames turned swiftly to a dryskinned mrs brooks who sat on his left she was a sad highchurch widow who embroidered a great deal her dress was outlined with her own embroideries so too were many altarcloths at the church of st barnabas she and mrs ames had a sort of religious rivalry over its decoration the one arranged the copious white lilies that crowned the cloth made by the other their rivalry was not without silent jealousy and it was already quite well known that mrs brooks had said that lilies of the valley were quite as suitable as madonna lilies which shed a nasty yellow pollen on the altarcloth but madonna lilies were larger a decoration required fewer blooms in other moods also she was slightly acid mrs evans turned slowly to her right where harry was sitting she might almost be supposed to know that she had a lovely neck at least it was hard to think that she had lived with it for thirtyseven years in complete unconsciousness of it if she moved her head very quickly there was just a suspicion of loose skin about it but she did not move her head very quickly and now let us go on talking she said have you told my little girl all about cambridge tell me all about cambridge too what fun you must have a lot of young men together with no stupid women and girls to bother them do you play a great deal of lawntennis harry reconsidered for a moment his verdict concerning the wonderfulness of her it was hardly happy to talk to a member of the omar club about games and the advantages of having no girls about no i dont play games much he said the set i am in dont care for them she tilted her head a little back as if asking pardon for her ignorance i didnt know she said i thought perhaps you liked gamesfootball racquets all that kind of thing i am sure you could play them beautifully if you chose or perhaps you like gardening i had such a nice talk to your father about flowers what a lot he knows about them flowers were better than games anyhow harry put down his spoon without finishing his ice have you ever noticed what a wonderful colour la france roses turn at twilight he asked all the shadows between the petals become blue quite blue do they really you must show me sometime are there some in your garden here yes but father doesnt care about them so much because they are common i think that is so strange of him sunsets are common too arent they there is a sunset every day but the fact that a thing is common doesnt make it less beautiful she gave a little sigh but what a nice idea she said i am sure you thought of it do you talk about these things much at cambridge mrs ames began to collect ladies eyes at this moment and the conversation had to be suspended millie evans though she was rather taller than harry managed as she passed him on the way to the door to convey the impression of looking up at him you must tell me all about it she said and show me those delicious roses turning blue at twilight dinner had been at a quarter to eight and when the men joined the women again in the drawingroom light still lingered in the midsummer sky then harry greatly daring since such a procedure was utterly contrary to all established precedents persuaded mrs evans to come out into the garden and observe for herself the chameleonic properties of the roses then he had ventured on another violation of rule since all rights of flowerpicking were vested in his father and had plucked her halfadozen of them but on their return with the booty and the establishment of the blue theory his father so far from resenting this invasions of his privileges had merely said the rascal might have found you something choicer than that mrs evans but well see what we can find you tomorrow she had again seemed to look up at harry nothing can be lovelier than my beautiful roses she said but it is sweet of you to think of sending me some more cousin amy look at the roses mr harry has given me carriages arrived as usual that night at halfpast ten at which hour too a gaunt grenadierlike maid of certain age rapped loudly on the front door and demanded mrs brooks whom she was to protect on her way home and as usual carriages and the grenadier waited till twenty minutes to eleven but even at a quarter to no conveyance by some mischance had come for mrs evans and despite her protests major ames insisted on escorting her and elsie back to her house occasionally when such mistakes occurred it had been harrys duty to see home the uncarriaged but tonight when it would have been his pleasure the privilege was denied him so instead after saying goodnight to his mother he went swiftly to his room there to write a mysterious letter to a member of the omar club and compose a short poem which should however unworthily commemorate this amorous evening there is nothing in the world more rightly sacred than the first dawnings of love in a young man but on the other hand there is nothing more ludicrous if his emotions are inspired or even tinged by selfconsciousness and the sense of how fine a young spark he is and our unfortunate harry was charged with this absurdity all through the evening it had been present to his mind how dashing and byronic a tale this would prove at the next meeting of the omar khayyam club with what fine frenzy he would throw off in his hour of inspiration after the yellow wine the little heartwail which he was now about to compose as soon as his letter to gerald everett was written and lest it should seem unwarrantable to intrude in the spirit of ridicule on a young mans rapture and despair an extract from his letter should give solid justification of course i cant give names he said because you know how such things get about but my god gerald how wonderful she is i saw her this afternoon for the first time and she dined with us tonight she understands everythingwhatever i said i saw reflected in her eyes as the sky is reflected in still water after dinner i took her out into the garden and showed her how the shadows of the la france roses turn blue at dusk i quoted to her two lines o thou art fairer than the evening air clad in the beauty of a thousand stars and i think she saw that i quoted at her of course she turned it off and said what pretty lines but i think she saw and she carried my roses home lucky roses gerald i am miserable i havent told you yet for she is married she has a great stupid husband years and years older than herself she has too a great stupid daughter theres another marvel for you honestly and soberly she does not look more than twentyfive i will write again and tell you how all goes but i think she likes me there is clearly something in common between us there is no doubt she enjoyed our little walk in the dusk when the roses turned blue have you had any successes lately he finished his letter and before beginning his poem lit the candle on his dressingtable and examined his small commonplace visage in the glass it was difficult to arrange his hair satisfactorily if he brushed it back it revealed an excess of high vacantlooking forehead if he let it drop over his forehead though his resemblance to keats was distinctly strengthened its resemblance to seaweed was increased also the absence of positive eyebrow was regrettable but was there not fire in his rather pale and farapart eyes he rather thought there was his nose certainly turned up a little but what if not that did tiptilted imply a rather long upperlip was at present only lightly fledged with an adolescent moustache but there was decided strength in his chin it stuck out and having practised a frown which he rather fancied he went back to the table in the window again read a few stanzas of dolores in order to get into tune with passion and bitterness for this poem was not going to begin or end happily and wooed the lyric muse major ames meantime had seen mrs evans to her door and retraced his steps as far as the club where he was in halfamind to go in and get a game of billiards which he enjoyed he played in a loud hectoring and unskilful manner and it was noticeable that all the luck unless as occasionally happened he won was invariably on the side of his opponent but after an irresolute pause he went on again and let himself into his own house amy was still sitting in the drawingroom though usually she went to bed as soon as her guests had gone very pleasant evening my dear he said and your plan was a great success uncommonly agreeable woman mrs evans is pretty woman too you would never guess she was the mother of that great girl she was not considered pretty as a girl said his wife no then she must have improved in looks afterwards lonely life rather to be a doctors wife with your husband liable to be called away at any hour of the day or night i have no doubt millie occupies herself very well said mrs ames goodnight lyndhurst are you coming up to bed not just yet i shall sit up a bit and smoke another cigar he sat in the window and every now and then found himself saying half aloud uncommonly agreeable woman just overhead harry was tearing passion to shreds in the style more or less of swinburne chapter iii dr evans was looking out of the window of his diningroom as he waited the next morning for breakfast to be brought in jingling a pleasant mixture of money and keys in his trouser pockets and whistling a tune that sounded vague and de bussylike until you perceived that it was really an air familiar to streets and barrelorgans and owed its elusive quality merely to the fact that the present performer was a little uncertain as to the comparative value of tones and semitones but this slightly discouraging detail was more than compensated for by the evident cheerfulness of the executant his plump highcoloured face his merry eye the singular content of his whole aspect betokened a personality that was on excellent terms with life his surroundings were as well furnished and securely comfortable as himself the table was invitingly laid a sheffieldplate urn dr evans was an amateur in georgian decoration and furniture hissed and steamed with little upliftings of the lid under the pressure within and a number of hot dishes suggested an english interpretation of breakfast fine mezzotints after the great english portraitpainters hung on the walls and a chippendale sideboard was spread with fruit dishes and dessertplates the morning was very hot but the high spacious room with its thick walls was cool and fresh while its potentialities for warmth and cosiness in the winter were sponsored for by the large open fireplace and the stack of hotwater pipes which stood beneath the sideboard outside the windows at which dr evans stood looked out on to the large and secluded lawn which had been the scene of the gardenparty the day before redbrick walls ran along the two sides of it at right angles to the house opposite a row of espaliered fruittrees screened off the homeliness of the kitchengarden beyond and the railway cutting which formed the boundary of this pleasant place wilfred evans had whistled the first dozen bars of the merry widow waltz some six or seven times through before with the retarded consciousness that it was sunday he went on to the churchs one foundation and though with his usual admirable appetite he felt the allure of the hot dishes he waited still whistling for some other member of his household wife or daughter to appear he was one of the most gregarious and clubbable of men and no hecatomb of stalled oxen would have given him content if he had had to eat his beef alone a firm attachment to his domestic circle combined with the not very exacting calls of his practice but truly fervent investigations in the laboratory at the end of the garden of the habits and economy of phagocytes comfortably filled up to the furthest horizon the scenery of his mental territories he had not to wait long for his wife to appear and he hailed her with his wonted cordiality morning little woman he said slept well i hope mrs evans did not practice at home all those arts of pleasing with which she was so lavish in other peoples houses also this morning she felt rather cross a thing which to do her justice was rare with her not very she said i kept waking it was stiflingly hot im sorry my dear said he mrs evans busied herself with teamaking her long slender hands moved with extraordinary deftness and silence among clattering things and her husband whistled the merry widow waltz once or twice more oh wilfred do stop that odious tune she said without the slightest hint of impatience in her voice it is bad enough on your pianola which after all is in tune which is more than can be said for my penny whistle asked he goodhumouredly right you are im dumb tell me about your party last night my dear havent you been to enough riseborough parties to know that there is nothing to tell about any party she asked i sat between major ames and the son i talked gardening on one side with the father and something which i suppose was enlightened cambridge conversation on the other harry ames is rather a dreadful sort of youth he took me into the garden afterwards to show me something about roses and the carriage didnt come major ames saw me home when did you get in not till nearly three very difficult maternity case but well pull them both through millie evans gave a little shudder which was not quite entirely instinctive she emphasized it for her husbands benefit unfortunately he did not notice it will you have your tea now she asked he looked at her with an air mainly conjugal but tinged with professionalism bit upset with the heat little woman he asked you look a trifle off colour we cant have you sleeping badly either show me the man who sleeps his seven hours every night and ill show you who will live to be ninety this prospect did not for the moment allure his wife i think i would sooner sleep less and die earlier she said in her even voice though im sure elsie will live to a hundred at that rate you encourage her to be lazy in the morning wilfred im sure any one can manage to be in time for breakfast at a quarter past nine he shook his head no no little woman he said let a growing girl sleep just as much as she feels inclined i would sooner stint a girls food than her sleep give the red corpuscles a chance eh millie got up from the table and went to the sideboard to get some fruit then suddenly it struck her all this was hardly worth while it seemed a stupid business to come down every morning and eat breakfast to manage the household to go for a walk perhaps or sit in the garden and after completing the round of these daily futilities to go to bed again and sleep just for the recuperation that sleep gave to enable her to do it all over again but the strawberries looked cool and moist and standing by the sideboard she ate a few of them just above it hung the oblong sheraton mirror which her husband had bought so cheaply at a local sale and had brought home so triumphantly that too seemed to tell her a stale story and the reflection of her young face crowned with the shimmer of yellow hair against the dark oak background of the panelling seemed without purpose or significance she was doing nothing with her beauty that stayed so long with her but it would not stay many years longer this morning even there seemed to be a shadow over it making it dim soon nobody would care if she had ever been pretty or not indeed even now elsie seemed by her height and the maturity of her manner to be reminding everybody of the fact that she herself must be approaching the bar which every woman has to cross when she is forty or thereabouts and strange enough it may appear these doubts and questionings which looked at millie darkly from the sheraton glass above the sideboard selfish and elementary as they were resembled thought far more closely than did the generality of those surface impressions that as a rule mirrored her mind they were too rather actively disagreeable and generally speaking nothing disagreeable occurred to her the experiences of every day might be mildly exhilarating or mildly tedious but whatever they were she was not accustomed to think closely about them now for the moment it seemed to her that some shadow some vague presence confronted her and menacingly demanded her attention riseborough is notable for the number of its churches and before long the air was mellow with bells as a rule millie evans went to church on sunday morning with the same regularity as she ate hot roast beef for lunch when it was over but this morning she easily let herself be persuaded to refrain from any act of public worship it seemed quite within the bounds of possibility that she might feel faint during the psalms and on her husbands advice she settled to stop at home leaving him and elsie who was quite unaware what faintness felt like to attend but it was not the fear of faintness that prompted her absence she wanted almost for the first time in her life to be alone and to think even on the occasion of her marriage she had not found it necessary to employ herself with original thought her mother had done the thinking for her and had advised her as she felt quite sure sensibly and well nor had she needed to think when she was expecting her only child for on that occasion she had been perfectly content to do exactly as her husband told her but now at the age of thirtyseven the sight of her own face in the glass had suggested to her certain possibilities certain limitations illhealth had on infrequent sundays prevented her attendance at church and now following merely the dictates of habit she took out with her to a basket chair below the big mulberrytree in the garden a bible and prayerbook out of which she supposed that she would read the psalms and lessons for the day but the bible remained long untouched and when she opened it eventually at random she read but one verse it was at the end of ecclesiastes that the leaves parted and she read when desire shall fail because man goeth to his long home that was enough for it was that here succinctly expressed which had been troubling her this morning though so vaguely that until she saw her symptoms written down shortly and legibly she had scarcely known what they were but certainly this line and a half described them no doubt it was all very elementary by degrees one ceased to care and then one died but her case was rather different from that for she felt that with her desire had not failed simply because she never had had desire she had waked and slept she had eaten and walked she had had a child but all these things had been of about the same value once she had had a tooth out without gas that was a slightly more vivid experience but it was very soon over she had not really cared but though she had not cared for any of those things she had not been bored with the repetition of them it had seemed natural that one thing should follow another that the days should become weeks and the weeks should become months insensibly when the months added themselves into years she took notice of that fact by having a birthday and wilfred as he gave her some little present in a morocco case told her that she looked as young as when they first met which was very nearly true she had a quantity of these morocco cases now he never omitted the punctual presentation of each and the mental vision of all these morocco cases some round some square some oblong and the thought of their contentsa little pearl brooch a sapphire brooch a pair of emerald earrings a jewelled hatpinsuddenly came upon her with their cumulative effect a lot of time had gone by it chiefly lived in her now through the memory of the morocco cases by virtue of her unemotional temperament and serene bodily health she looked very young still and certainly did not feel old but as the bells for church ceased to jangle and clash in the hot still air leaving only for the ear the hum of multitudinous bees in the long flowerbed it dawned on her that whatever she felt and however she looked she would soon be on the other side of that barrier which for women marks the end of their essential and characteristic life there were a few years left her yet out of the years of which she made so little use and with a spasm the keenest perhaps she had ever known even including the extraction of the tooth without gas the horror of middleage fell upon her making her shiver all her life she had felt nothing soon she would be incapable of feeling except in so far as regret that pale echo of what might once have been emotion can be considered an affair of the heart to feel she readily perceived implied the existence of something or somebody to feel about but she did not know where to look for her participant long ago her husband had become as much part of that dead level of life as had her breakfast or her dressing for dinner never had he stirred her from her placid passivity she had never yearned for him in the sense in which a thirsty man desires water she had no love of nature the primrose by the rivers brim might have been a violet for anything that she cared charity in its technical sense was distasteful to her because the curious smell in the houses of the poor made her only long to get away it was hard to know where to turn to find an outlet for that drowsily awakening recognition of life that today so late and as yet so feebly stirred within her yet though it stirred but feebly there was movement there it wanted to be alive for a little before it was indubitably dead her thoughts went back to the topic concerning which she had told her husband that there was nothing to be toldnamely the dinnerparty at the ames last night certainly there was nothing remarkable about it she had conducted herself as usual with the usual result she was accustomed to deal out her little smiles and deferential glances and flattering speeches to those who sat next her at dinner because in herself a mild amiability prompted her to make herself pleasant and because with so little trouble to herself she could make a man behave as agreeably as he was capable of behaving she attracted men very easily cursorily one might say without attaching any importance to the interest she aroused and without looking further than the dinnertable for the fruits of the attraction she exercised but this morning this tardy and drowsy recognition of life beside which so to speak lay the shadow of middleage gave her pause was there some fruition and development of herself before the withered and barren years came to her to be found there it would be quite beyond the mark to say that sitting here she definitely proposed to herself to try to make herself emotionally interested in somebody else in case that might add a zest to life but she considered the effect which she so easily produced in others and wondered what it meant to feel like that certainly major ames had enjoyed escorting her home certainly harry had felt a touch of gauche romance when he showed her the effect of twilight on the complexion of some rose or other he had given her a whole bunch of roses with an attempt at a pretty speech yes that was itthe shadows in them looked paleblue and he had said that they were just the colour of her eyes but the roses were pretty she hoped that somebody had put them in water she was already more than a little interested in her reflections there was something original and exciting to her in them and it was annoying to have them broken in upon by the parlourmaid who came towards her from the house personally she thought it absurd not to keep menservants but wilfred always maintained that a couple of good parlourmaids produced greater comfort with less disturbance and yielding to him as she always yielded to anybody who expressed a definite opinion she had acquiesced in female service but she always called the head parlourmaid watkins whereas her husband called her mary major ames wants to know if you will see him maam said watkins the interest returned yes ask him to come out she said watkins went back to the house and returned with major ames in tow who carried a huge bouquet of sweetpeas there then followed the difficulty of meeting and greeting gracefully and naturally which is usual when the visitor is visible a long way off the major put on a smile far too soon and had to take it off again since mrs evans had not yet decided that it was time to see him then she began to smile while he without his smile was looking abstractedly at the top of the mulberrytree as if he expected to find her there he looked there a moment too long for one of the lower branches suddenly knocked his straw hat off his head and he said god bless my soul and dropped the sweetpeas however this was not an unmixed misfortune for the recognition came quite naturally after that she hoped he was not hurt was he sure that silly branch had not hit his face it must be taken off what lovely flowers and were they for her they were major ames replaced his hat rather hastily after a swift manuvre with regard to his hair which mrs evans did not accurately follow the fact was though he believed the fact not to be generally known that the top of major ames head was entirely destitute of hair and that the smooth crop which covered it was the produce of the side of his headjust above the eargrown long and brushed across the cranium so as to adorn it with seemingly local wealth and sleekness the rough and unexpected removal of his hat by the bough of the mulberrytree had caused a considerable portion of it to fall back nearly to the shoulder of the side on which it actually grew and his hasty manuvre with his gathered tresses was designed to replace them necessarily he put back his hat again quickly in the manner of a boy capturing a butterfly his mind and the condition of it on this sunday morning would repay a brief analysis briefly then a sort of aurora borealis of youth had visited him his heaven was streaked with inexplicable lights he had told himself that a man of fortyseven was young still and that when a most attractive woman had manifested an obvious interest in him it was only reasonable to follow it up he was not a coxcomb he was not a loose liver he was only a very ordinary man well and healthy married to a woman considerably older than himself and living in a town which in spite of his adored garden presented but moderate excitements but indeed this morning call paid with this solid tribute of sweetpeas was something of an adventure and had not been mentioned by him to his wife he had seen her start for st barnabas and then had hastily gathered his bouquet and set out leaving harry wandering dreamily about the cinderpaths in the kitchen garden in the full glory of the discovery that the colour of the scarlet runners was like a clarion major ames had plucked almost his rarest varieties for to pluck the rarest since he wished to save their first bloom for seed would have been on the further side of quixotism and have verged on imbecility but he had brought the best of his secondbest last night too he had hinted at his own remissness in the matter of church attendance on sunday morning and on his way up here had permitted himself to wonder whether millie would prove in consequence perhaps of that to have abstained from worship also expecting or at least considering possible a morning call from him as a matter of fact she had not indulged in any such hopes since it had been a matter of pure indifference to her whether he went to church on sunday or not but when he found on inquiry at the door that she was at home it was scarcely unreasonable on the part of a rather vain and gallantly minded man to connect the fact with the information he had given so he hastily readjusted his hat my own stupidity entirely he said do not blame the tree yes i have brought you just a few flowers and though they are not worthy of your acceptance they are not the worst bunch of sweetpeas i have ever seen not the worst these catherine the great for instance are notwellthey do not grow quite in every garden mrs evans opened her blue eyes a little wider and are they really for me major ames she asked again it is good of you my precious flowers they must be put in water at once watkins bring me one of the big flowerbowls out here i will arrange them myself lucky flowers lucky flowers chuckled major ames its i who am lucky said she acknowledging this subtle compliment with a little smile i stop away from church rather lazily and am rewarded by a pleasant visit and a beautiful nosegay and what a charming party we had last night i could hardly believe it when i came back here and found it was nearly halfpast eleven such hours major ames gave his great loud laugh you are making fun of us mrs evans he said pon my word you are making fun of us and our quiet ways down at riseborough ill be bound that when you were in london halfpast eleven was more the sort of time when you began to go out to your dances i used to go out a good deal when i was quite young she said wilfred used quite to urge me to go out and certainly people were very kind in asking me i remember one night in the season i was asked to two dinnerparties and a ball and an evening party after all it is natural to take pleasure in innocent gaiety when one is young major ames felt very hot after his walk and forgetting the adventure of his hair nearly removed his straw hat but providentially he remembered it again just in time upon my word mrs evans he said jovially you make me feel a hundred years old when you talk like that as if your days of youth and success were over why some one at your gardenparty yesterday afternoon told me for a fact that miss elsie was the daughter of your husbands first wife wouldnt believe me when i said she was your daughter poor sandersit was mr sanders who said ithad to pay ten shillings to me for his positiveness he betted you know he insisted on betting but really any one who didnt happen to know would be right to make such a bet ninetynine times out of a hundred she gave him a little smile with lowered eyelids dear elsie she said she is such a comfort to me she quite manages the house for me and spares me all the trouble she always knows how much asparagus ought to cost and what happens to strawberry ice after a party i never was a good housekeeper wilfred always used to say to me go out and enjoy yourself my dear and ill pay the bills of course it was all his kindness i know but sometimes i wonder if it would not have been truer kindness to have made me think and contrive more elsie does it all now but when my little girl marries it will be my turn again tell me major ames is it you or cousin amy who makes everything go so beautifully at your house i thinkshall i say iti think it must be you when a man manages a house there is always more precision somehow you feel sure that everything has been foreseen and provided for printed menucards for instanceso chic so perfectly commeilfaut watkins had brought out a large dish rather like a spongingtin for the sweetpeas and mrs evans had begun the really herculean labour of putting them in water a grille of wire network fitted over the rim of it each pea was stuck in separately she looked up from her task at him am i right she asked major ames was not really an untruthful man but many men who are not really untruthful get through a wonderful lot of misrepresentation oh you mustnt give me credit for that he said truthfully so far its a dodge we always used to have at mess so why not at ones own house also its better than written cards which take a lot of time to copy out again and again and then you see my dear amy is not very strong at french and doesnt want always to be bothering me to tell her whether theres an accent in one word or two ss in another saves time and trouble mrs evans applauded softly with pink fingertips ah i knew it was you she said now clearly though almost without intention major ames had gone too far to retreat also retreat implied a flat contradiction of what mrs evans said she knew which would have been a rudeness from which his habitual gallantry naturally revolted consequently being unable to retreat he had to make himself as safe as possible to entrench himself perhaps its a little extravagance he said indeed amy thinks it is and i never mention the subject of menucards to her shes apt to turn the subject a bit abruptly on the word menucard dear amy after all it would be a very dull affair our pleasant life down here if we all completely agreed with each other she gave a little sigh shaking her head and smiling at her sweetpeas ah how often i think that too she said at least now you say it i feel i have often thought it it is so true dear wilfred is such an angel to me you see whatever i do he is sure to think right but sometimes you wonder whether the people who know you best really understand you it is likeit is like learning things by heart if you learn a thing by heart you so often cease to think what it means mrs evans it must be confessed did not mean anything very precisely by this her life that is to say was not at all circumstanced in the manner that her speech implied it to be except in so far that she often wished that more amusing things happened to her and that she would not so soon be forty years old but she certainly intended major ames to attach to her words their natural implication she wanted to seem vaguely unappreciated at the same time she desired him to see that she in no way blamed her dear unconscious wilfred if major ames thought that it would spoil a most essential feature of the picture she wished to present of herself why she wished to present it was also quite easy of comprehension she wanted to be interesting and was by nature silly the fact that she was close on thirtyeight largely conduced to her speech major ames made a perfectly satisfactory interpretation of it he saw all the things he was meant to see and nothing else and it was deliciously delivered so affectionately as regarded wilfred so shyly as regarded herself he instantly made the astounding mental discovery that she was somehow not very happy owing to a failure in domestic affinities he felt also that it was intuitive of him to have guessed that since she had not actually said it and he was tremendously conscious of the seduction of her presence as she sat there cool and white on this hot morning putting in the last of the sweetpeas he had brought her she looked enchantingly young and fresh and evidently found something in him which disposed her to confidences in justice to him it may be said that he did not inquire in his own mind as to what that was but it was easy to see she trusted him i think we all must feel that at times my dear lady he said anxious to haul the circumstance of his own home into the discussion i suppose that all of us who are not quite old yet not quite quite old yet let us say in order to include me feel at times that life is not giving us all that it might give that people do not really understand us no doubt many people and i daresay those as you said who know one best do not understand one and then we mustnt mind that but march straight on march straight on according to orders he sat up very straight in his chair as if about to march as he made thrillingly noble remarks and hit himself a couple of sounding blows with his clenched fist on his broad chest then a sudden suspicion seized him that he had displayed an almost too spartan unflinchingness as if soldiers had no hearts and then perhaps we shall meet some one who does understand us he added the critical observer the cynic and that rarest of all products the entirely sincere and straightforward person would have found in this conversation nothing that would move anything beyond his raillery or disgust here sitting under the mulberrytree in this pleasant garden on a sunday morning were two people the man nearly fifty the woman nearly forty both trying with god knows how many little insincerities by the way to draw near to each other both had reached ages that were dangerous to such as had lived even as they had extremely respectable and wellconducted lives without any paramount reason for their morality about major ames mode of life before he married which after all was at the early age of twentyfive nothing need be said because there is really very little to say and in any case the conduct of a young man not yet in his twentyfifth year has almost nothing to do with the character of the same man when he is fortyseven in that very long interval he had conducted himself always as a married man should and those years married as he was to a woman much his senior had not been at all discreditably passed this chronicle does not in the least intend to impute to him any high principled character for he had nothing of galahad in his composition but he was not a satyr consequently for this is part of the ironical composition of a manjust in the years with which we are dealing at a time of life when a man might have been condoned for having sown wild oats and seen the huskiness of them he was in that far more precarious position of not having sown them except so to speak in the smallest of flowerpots nor of having experienced the jejune quality of such a crop but it is not implied that he now regretted the respectability of those twentytwo years he did not do so he had had a happy and contented life but he would soon be old nor did he now at all contemplate adventure merely an odysseus who had never voyaged wondered what voyaging was like he was not in love with this seductive longlashed face that bent over the sweetpeas had brought her but if he had the picking of those sweetpeas over again he would probably have picked the very best regardless of the fact that he wanted the seeds for next years sowing so as regards him the cynics sneers would have been out of place he contemplated nothing that the cynic would have called a conquest the sincere straightforward gentleman would have been equally excessive in his disgust there was nothing except the slight absurdity of major ames nature to justify either laughter or tears he was a moderate man of middleage about as well intentioned as most of us mrs evans perhaps was less laudable and more deserved laughter and tears she had consciously tried to produce a false impression without saying false thingsa lamentable posture she had wanted as was her nature to attract without being correspondingly attracted she was prepared for him to go a little further which is characteristic of the flirt she succeeded as the flirt usually does his last sentence was received in silence and he thought well to repeat it with slight variation the theme was clear we may meet some one who understands us he said who looks into us not at us eh who sees not what we wish only but what we want she put the last sweetpea into the wirenetting oh yes yes she said how beautiful that distinction is he was not aware of its being particularly beautiful until she mentioned it but then it struck him that it was rather fine also the respectability of all his long years tugged at him as with a chain he was quite conscious that he was encouraged and so he was slightly terrified he had not much power of imagination but he could picture to himself a very uncomfortable home providence came to his aidprobably providence church time was spent and two black aberdeen terriers followed by elsie followed by dr evans came out of the drawingroom door on to the lawn they were all in the genial exhilaration that accompanies the sense of duty done the dogs had been let out from the house where they were penned on sunday morning to prevent their unexpected appearance in church the other two had been let out from church wilfred evans had most clearly left church behind him he had also left in the house not only his top hat but his coat as befitted the heat of the morning and appeared stout and strong and brisk elsie was less vigorous she sat down on the grass as soon as she reached the shade of the tree she had the good sense to shake hands with major ames first otherwise her mother would have made remarks to him about her manners but she was markedly less elderly now than she had been at the formal dinnerparty of the night before dr evans arrived last at the mulberrytree jove what jolly flowers he said thats you major ames isnt it how dedo well little woman how goes it you did well not to come to church awfully hot it was and a very long sermon daddy said elsie twentytwo minutes i timed it very interesting though youll stop to lunch major ames wont you we lunch at one always on sunday now major ames knew quite well that there was going to be at his house the lunch that followed parties the resurrection lunch of what was dead last night there would be little bits of salmon slightly greyer than on the evening before peeping out from the fresh salad that covered them there would be some sort of chaudfroid there would be a pink and viscous fluid which was the debilitated descendant of the strawberry ice which amy had given them there would also be several people including mrs altham who had not been bidden to the feast last night but who since they came according to the authorized riseborough version of festivities to the lunch next day would certainly be bidden to dinner on the next occasion also he knew well he would have to say to mrs altham amy has given us cold luncheon today well i dont mind a cold luncheon on as hot a day as it is chaudfroid of chicken mrs altham i think youll find that amys cook understands chaudfroid and all the time he knew that chaudfroid meant a dinnerparty on the night before so did the viscous fluid in the jelly glasses so did everything else and of course mrs altham knew everybody knew all about the lunch that followed a dinnerparty even if the dinnerparty last night had been as secret as george the fourths marriage with mrs fitzherbert the lunch today would have made it as public as any function at st peters eaton square he thought over the unimaginable dislocation in all this routine that his absence would entail i wonder if i ought to he said i fancy amy told me she had a few friends to lunch millie evans looked up at him infinitesimal as was the point as to whether he should lunch here or at home she knew that she definitely entered herself against his wife at this moment ah do stop she said if cousin amy has a few friends why shouldnt we have one he got up he nearly took off his hat again but again remembered i take it as a command he said am i ordered to stop certainly telephone to mrs ames wilfred and say that major ames is lunching with us les ordres de votre majest said he brightly forgetting for the moment that his wife came to him for help with the elusive language of our neighbours but the frenchness of his bearing and sentiment perhaps diverted attention from the curious character of his grammar chapter iv it was of course as inevitable as the return of day that mrs altham should start halfanhour earlier than was necessary to go to church that morning in order to return to mrs brooks who had been dining last night at the ames a couple of books that had been lent her a month or two ago and that mrs brooks should recount to her the unusual incident of harrys taking mrs evans into the garden after dinner and giving her a gradually growing bouquet of roses torn from his fathers trees indeed it was difficult to settle satisfactorily which part of harrys conduct was the most astounding with such completeness had he revolted against both beneficiaries of the fifth commandment they cant have been out in the garden for less than twenty minutes said mrs brooks and i shouldnt wonder if it was more for we had scarcely settled ourselves after the gentlemen came in from the diningroom when they went out and im sure we had hardly got talking again after they came back before my maid was announced to be sure the gentlemen sat a long time after dinner before joining us which i notice is always the case when general fortescue is at a party but it cant have been less than halfanhour that they were in the garden now one comes to add it up mrs brooks surveyed for a moment in silence her piece of embroidery not for a moment must it be supposed that she would have done embroidery for her own dress on sunday morning this was a frontal for the lectern at st barnabas which would make it impossible for mrs ames to decorate the lectern any more with her flowers there was a cross and a crown and some initials and some rays of light and a heart and some passion flowers and a dove worked on it with a profusion of gold thread that was positively american in its opulence hitherto the lectern had always been the field of one of mrs ames most telling embellishments when this embroidery was finished which it soon would be she would be driven from the lectern in disorder and discomfiture a very rich effect said mrs altham sympathetically halfanhour dear me and then i think you said she came back with a dozen roses mrs brooks closed her eyes and made a short calculation more than a dozen she said i daresay there were twenty roses it was very marked very marked indeed and if you ask me what i think of mrs ames plan of asking husband without wife and wife without husband i must say i do not like it at all depend upon it if dr evans had come too there would have been no walking about in the garden with our master harry but far be it from me to say there was any harm in it far i hope i am not one who condemns other peoples actions because i would not commit them myself all i know is that the first time my late dear husband asked me to walk about the garden after dinner with him he proposed to me and the second time he asked me to walk in the garden with him he proposed again and i accepted him but then i was not engaged to anybody else at the time far less married like mrs evans but it is none of my business i am glad to say indeed no it does not concern us said mrs altham with avidity and as you say there may be no harm in it at all but young men are very impressionable even if most unattractive and i call it distinct encouragement to a young man to walk about after dinner in the garden with him and receive a present of roses and im sure mrs evans is old enough to be his mother mrs brooks tacked down a length of gold thread which was to form part of the longest ray of all and made another little calculation it was not completely satisfactory anyhow she is old enough to know better she said but i have noticed that being old enough to know better often makes people behave worse mind i do not blame her there is nothing i detest so much as this censorious attitude and i only say that if i gave so much encouragement to any young man i should blame myself and the dinner asked mrs altham at least i need not ask that since i am going to lunch there so i shall soon know as well as you what there was mrs brooks smiled in a rather superior manner i never know what i am eating she said and she looked as if it disagreed with her too whatever it was this was not particularly thrilling for though it was generally known that harry had an emotional temperament and wrote amorous poems he appeared to mrs altham an improbable lothario in any case the slight interest that this aroused in her was nothing compared to that which awaited her and her husband when they arrived for lunch at mrs ames there had been a longstanding feud between mrs altham and her hostess on the subject of punctuality about two years ago mrs ames had arrived at mrs althams at least ten minutes late for dinner and mrs altham had very properly retorted by arriving a quarter of an hour late when next she was bidden to dinner with mrs ames though that involved sitting in a dark cab for ten minutes at the corner of the next turning so next time that mrs altham hoped to have the pleasure of seeing you and major ames at dinner on thursday at a quarter to eight she asked the rest of her guests at eight with the effect that mrs ames and her husband arrived a few minutes before anybody else and riseborough generally considered that mrs altham had scored since then there had been but a sort of desultory peashooting kept up such as would harm nobody and today mrs altham and her husband arrived certainly within ten minutes of the hour named mr pettit who generally lunched with mrs ames or mrs brooks on sunday was already there with his sister harry was morosely fidgeting in a corner and mrs ames was the only other person present in the small sittingroom where she received her guests instead of troubling them to go up to the drawingroom and instantly to go down again she gave mrs altham her fat little hand and then made this remarkable statement we are not waiting for anybody else i think upon which they went into lunch and harry sat at the head of the table instead of his father mrs ames was in her most conversational mood and it was not until the chaudfroid consisting mainly of the legs of chickens pasted over with a yellow sauce that concealed the long blue hairroots with which nature has adorned their lower extremities was being handed round that mrs altham had opportunity to ask the question that had been effervescing like an antiseptic lozenge on the tip of her tongue ever since she remarked the majors absence and where is major ames she asked i hope he is not ill i thought he looked far from well at mrs evans gardenparty yesterday mrs ames set her mind at rest with regard to the second point and inflamed it on the first oh no she said did you think he looked ill how good of you to ask after him but lyndhurst is quite well mr pettit a little more chicken after your sermon mr pettit had a shrewd ugly delightful face very lean very capable humanly speaking he probably abhorred mrs ames humanely speaking he knew there was a great deal of good in her and a quantity of debateable stuff he smiled showing thick white teeth before and after my sermon he said also before a childrens service and a bible class i cannot help thinking that god forgot his poor clergymen when he defined the seventh day as one of rest mrs ames hid a small portion of her little face with her little hand she always said that mr pettit was not like a clergyman at all how naughty of you she said but i must correct you the seventh day has become the first day now harry gave vent to a designedly audible sigh the omar club were chiefly atheists and he felt bound to uphold their principles that is the sort of thing that confuses me he said mr pettit says sunday was called a day of rest and my mother says that god meant what we call monday or saturday i have been behaving as if it was tuesday or wednesday mr pettit gave him a kindly glance quite right my dear boy he said spend your tuesday or wednesday properly and god wont mind whether it is thursday or friday harry pushed back his lank hair and became omarish do you fast on friday may i ask he said mrs ames looked pained and tried to think of something to say she failed but mrs altham thought without difficulty i suppose major ames is away mr harry she said even then though her intentions might easily be supposed to be amiable she was not allowed the privilege of being replied to for mr pettit cheerfully answered harrys question without a shadow of embarrassment just as if he did not mind what the omar khayyam club thought of course i do my dear fellow he said because our lord and dearest friend died that day he allows us to watch and pray with him an hour or two harry appeared indulgent curious he said mr pettit looked at him for just the space of time any one looks at the speaker with cheerful cordiality of face and then turned to his mother again i want you at church next sunday he said with a fat purse to be made thin i am going to have an offertory to finance a childrens treat i want to send every child in the parish to the seaside for a day harry interrupted in the critical manner why the seaside he asked mr pettit turned to him with unabated cordiality how right to ask he said because the sea is his and he made it also they will build sandcastles and pick up shells you must come too my dear harry and help us to give them a nice day harry felt that this was a philistine here who needed to be put in his place he was not really a very rude youth but one who felt it incumbent on to oppose christianity which he regarded as superstition a bright idea came into his head but his hands prepared the dry land he said on the same supposition certainly and as the dear mites have always seen the dry land said mr pettit with the utmost goodhumour we want to show them that god thought of something they never thought of and then there are the sandcastles harry was tired and did not proceed to crush mr pettit with the atheistical arguments that were but commonplace to the omar khayyam club he was not worth argument you could only really argue with the enlightened people who fundamentally agreed with you and he was sure that mr pettit did not fulfil that requirement so indulgently he turned to mrs altham i saw you at mrs evans gardenparty yesterday he said i think she is the most wonderful person i ever met she was dining here last night and i took her into the garden and showed her the roses said mrs altham unable to restrain herself harry became a parody of himself though that might seem to be a feat of insuperable difficulty i supposed it would get about he said that is the worst of a little place like this whatever you do is instantly known the slightly viscous remains of the strawberry ice were being handed and mr pettit was talking to mrs ames and his sister from a pitiably christian standpoint what did you hear asked harry in a low voice merely that she and you went out into the garden after dinner and that you picked roses for her harry pushed back his lank hair with his bony hand you have heard all he said there was nothing more than that i did not see her home her carriage did not come there was some mistake about it i suppose but it was my father who saw her home not i he laid down the spoon with which he had been consuming the viscous fluid if you hear that i saw her home mrs altham he said tell them it is not true from what you have already told me i gather there is talk going on there is no reason for such talk he paused a moment and then a line or two of the intensely swinburnian effusion which he had written last night fermented in his head making him infinitely more preposterous i assure you that at present there is no reason for such talk he said earnestly now mrs altham with her wide interest in all that concerned anybody else might be expected to feel the intensest curiosity on such a topic but somehow she felt very little since she knew that behind the talk there was really very little topic and the gallant misgivings of poor ugly harry seemed to her destitute of any real thrill on the other hand she wanted very much to know where major ames was and being endowed with the persistence of the household cat which you may turn out of a particular armchair a hundred times without producing the slightest discouragement in its mind she reverted to her own subject again i am sure there is no reason for such talk mr harry she said with strangely unwelcome conviction and i will be sure to contradict it if ever i hear it i am so glad to hear major ames is not ill i was afraid that his absence from lunch today might mean that he was now harry as a matter of fact had no idea where his father was since the telephone message had been received by mrs ames father is quite well he said he was picking sweetpeas half the morning he picked a great bunch mrs altham looked round the table was decorated with the roses of the dinnerparty of the evening before then where are the sweetpeas she asked but harry was not in the least interested in the question i dont know he said perhaps they are in the next room i showed mrs evans last night how the la france roses looked blue when dusk fell she had never noticed it though they turn as blue as her eyes how curious said mrs altham but i didnt see the sweetpeas in the next room surely if there had been a quantity of them i should have noticed them or perhaps they are in the drawingroom at this moment mrs ames voice was heard from the other end of the table then shall we have our coffee outside she said harry if you will ring the bell there was the pushing back of chairs and mrs altham passed along the table to the french windows that opened on to the verandah i hear major ames has been picking the loveliest sweetpeas all the morning she said to her hostess it would be such a pleasure to see them i always admire major ames sweetpeas now this was unfortunate for mrs altham desired information herself but by her speech she had only succeeded in giving information to mrs ames who guessed without the slightest difficulty where the sweetpeas had gone which she had not yet known had been picked she was already considerably annoyed with her husband for his unceremonious desertion of her luncheonparty and was aware that mrs altham would cause the fact to be as well known in riseborough as if it had been inserted in the column of local intelligence in the county paper but she felt she would sooner put it there herself than let mrs altham know where he and his sweetpeas were she had no greater objection or if she had she studiously concealed it from herself even to his going to lunch in this improvising manner with mrs evans than if he had gone to lunch with anybody else what she minded was his nonappearance at an institution so firmly established and so faithfully observed as the lunch that followed the dinnerparty but at the moment her entire mind was set on thwarting mrs altham she looked interested indeed has he been picking sweetpeas she said i must scold him if it was only that which kept him away from church i dont know what he has done with them very likely they are in his dressingroom he often likes to have flowers there but as you admire his sweetpeas so much pray walk down the garden and look at them you will find them in their full beauty this of course was not in the least what mrs altham wanted since she did not care two straws for the rest of the sweetpeas but life was scarcely worth living unless she knew where those particular sweetpeas were as for their being in his dressingroom she felt that mrs ames must have a very poor opinion of her intellectual capacities if she thought that an old wifes tale like that would satisfy it in this she was partly right mrs ames had indeed no opinion at all of her mind on the other hand she did not for a moment suppose that this suggestion about the dressingroom would content that feeble organ it was not designed to the object was to stir it to a wilder and still unsatisfied curiosity it perfectly succeeded and from byways mrs altham emerged fullspeed like a motorcar into the highroad of direct question i am sure they are lovely she said and where is major ames lunching mrs ames raised the pieces of her face where there might have been eyebrows in other days she told one of the truths that bismarck loved he did not tell me before he went out she said perhaps harry knows harry where is your father lunching now this was ludicrous as if it was possible that any wife in riseborough did not know where her husband was lunching harry apparently did not know either and mrs ames tasting the joys of the bullbaiter goaded mrs altham further by pointedly asking parker when she brought the coffee if she knew where the major was lunching of course parker did not and so parker was told to cut mrs altham a nice bunch of sweetpeas to carry away with her this pleasant duty of thwarting undue curiosity being performed mrs ames turned to mr pettit though she had not quite done with mrs altham yet for she had heard on the best authority that mrs altham occasionally indulged in the disgusting and unfeminine habit of cigarette smoking mrs brooks had several times seen her walking about her garden with a cigarette and she had told mrs taverner who had told mrs ames the evidence was overwhelming mr pettit i dont think any of us mind the smell of tobacco she said when it is out of doors so pray have a cigarette harry will give you one ah i forgot perhaps mrs altham does not like it mrs altham hastened to correct that impression at the same time she had a subtle and not quite comfortable sense that mrs ames knew all about her and her cigarettes which was exactly the impression which that lady sought to convey these tactics were all sound enough in their way but a profounder knowledge of human nature would have led mrs ames not to press home her victory with so merciless a hand in her determination to thwart mrs althams odious curiosity she had let it be seen that she was thwarting it she should not for instance have asked parker if she knew of the majors whereabouts for it only served to emphasize the undoubted fact that mrs ames knew that might be taken for granted and that she knew that parker did not for otherwise she would surely not have asked her consequently mrs altham erroneously as far as that went came to the conclusion that the major was lunching alone where his wife did not wish him to lunch alone and in the next quarter of an hour while they all sat on the verandah she devoted the mind which her hostess so despised to a rapid review of all houses of this description instantly almost the wrong scent which she was following led her to the right quarry she argued erroneously the existence of a pretty woman and there was a pretty woman in riseborough it is hardly necessary to state that she made up her mind to call on that pretty woman without delay she would be very much surprised if she did not find there an immense bunch of sweetpeas and perhaps their donor mrs ames guests soon went their ways mr pettit and his sister to the childrens service at three the althams on their detective mission and she was left to herself except in so far as harry asleep in a basket chair in the garden can be considered companionship she was not gifted with any very great acuteness of imagination but this afternoon she found herself capable of conjuring up indeed she was incapable of not doing so a certain amount of vague disquiet indeed she tried to put it away and refresh her mind with the remembrance of her thwarting mrs altham but though her disquiet was but vague and was concerned with things that had at present no real existence at all whereas her victory over that inquisitive lady was fresh and recent the disquiet somehow was of more pungent quality and at last she faced it instead of attempting any longer to poke it away out of sight millie evans was undeniably a goodlooking woman undeniably the major had been considerably attracted last night by her undeniably also he had done a very strange thing in stopping to have his lunch there when he knew perfectly well that there were people lunching with them at home for that important rite of eating up the remains of last nights dinner beyond doubt he had taken her this present of sweetpeas of which mrs altham had so obligingly informed her beyond doubt finally she was herself ten years her husbands senior it has been said that mrs ames was not imaginative but indeed there seemed to be sufficient here when it was all brought together to occupy a very prosaic and literal mind it was not as if these facts were all new to her that disparity of age between herself and her husband had long lain dark and ominous like a distant thundercloud on the horizon of her mind hitherto it had been stationary there not apparently coming any closer and not giving any hint of the potential tempest which might lurk within it but now it seemed to have moved a little up the sky and though this might be mere fancy on her part there came from it some drowsy and distant echo of thunder it must not be supposed that her disquiet expressed itself in mrs ames mind in terms of metaphor like this for she was practically incapable of metaphor she said to herself merely that she was ten years older than her husband that she had known ever since they married indeed she had known it before but till now the fact had never seemed likely to be of any significance to her and yet her grounds for supposing that it might be about to become significant were of the most unsubstantial sort certainly if lyndhurst had not gone out to lunch today she would never have dreamed of finding disquiet in the happenings of the evening before indeed apart from harrys absurd expedition into the garden the party had been a markedly successful one and she had determined to give more of those undomestic entertainments but the principle of them assumed a strangely different aspect when her husband accepted an invitation of the kind instead of lunching at home and that aspect presented itself in vivid colours when she reflected that he was ten years her junior mrs ames was a practical woman and though her imagination had run unreasonably riot so she told herself over these late events so that she already contemplated a contingency that she had no real reason to anticipate she considered what should be her practical conduct if this remote state of affairs should cease to be remote she had altogether passed from being in love with her husband so much so indeed that she could not recall with any sense of reality what that unquiet sensation was like but she had been in love with him years ago and that still gave her a sense of possession over him she had not been in the habit of guarding her possession since there had never been any reason to suppose that anybody wanted to take it away but she remembered with sufficient distinctness the sense that lyndhursts garden was becoming to him the paramount interest in his life at the time that sense had been composed of mixed feelings neglect and relief were its constituents he had ceased to expect from her that indefinable sensitiveness which is one of the prime conditions of love and the growing atrophy of his demands certainly corresponded with her own inclinations at the same time though this cessation on his part of the imperative need of her was a relief she resented it she would have wished him to continue being in love with her on credit so to speak without the settlement of the bill being applied for years had passed since then but today that secondary discontent assumed a primary importance again it was more acute now than it had ever been for her possession was not being quietly absorbed into the culture of impersonal flowers but so it seemed possible was directly threatened there was the situation which her imagination presented her with practically put and she proceeded to consider it from a practical standpoint what was she to do she had the justice to acknowledge that the first clear signals of coolness in their mutual relations now fifteen years ago had been chiefly flown by her she had essentially welcomed his transference of affection to his garden though she had secretly resented it at the least the cooling had been condoned by her probably that had been a mistake on her part and she determined now to rectify it she pathetically enough felt herself young still and to confirm herself in her view she took the trouble to go indoors and look at herself in the glass that hung in the hall it was inevitable that she should see there not what she really saw but what in the main she desired to see her hair always slightly faded in tone was not really grey and even if there were signs of greyness in it there was nothing easier if you could trust the daily advertisements in the papers than to restore the colour not by dyes but by purely natural means there had been an advertisement of one such desirable lotion she remembered in the paper today which she had noticed was supplied by any chemist certainly there was a little grey in her hair that would be easy to remedy that act of mental frankness led on to another there were certain premonitory symptoms of stringiness about her throat and of loose skin round her mouth and eyes but who could keep abreast of the times at all and not know that there were skinfoods which were magical in their effect there was one which had impressed itself on her not long before an actress had written in its praise affirming that her wrinkles had vanished with three nights treatment then there was a little just a little sallowness of complexion but after all she had always been rather sallow it was a fortunate circumstance when she got hot she never got crimson in the face like poor mrs taverner she was going to town next week for a night in order to see her dentist a yearly precaution unproductive of pain for her teeth were really excellent regular in shape white undecayed lyndhurst in his early days had told her they were like pearls and she had told him he talked nonsense they were just as much like pearls still only he did not tell her so he poor fellow had had great trouble in this regard but it might be supposed his trouble was over now since artifice had done its utmost for him she was much younger than him there though his last set fitted beautifully but probably millie had seen they were not real and then he was distinctly gouty which she was not often had she heard his optimistic assertion that an hours employment with the gardenroller rendered all things of rheumatic tendency an impossibility but she though publicly she let these random statements pass and even endorsed them knew the array of bottles that beleaguered the washingstand in his dressingroom where the sweetpeas were not the silent colloquy with the mirror in the hall occupied her some ten minutes but the ten minutes sufficed for the arrival of one conclusionnamely that she did not intend to be an old woman yet subtle art the art of the hairrestorer which was not a dye the art of the skinfeeder must be invoked she no longer felt at all old now that there was a possibility of her husbands feeling young and lipsalve perhaps lipsalve yet that seemed hardly necessary a few little bitings and mumblings of her lips between her excellent teeth seemed to restore to them a very vivid colour she went back to the verandah where her little luncheonparty had had their coffee and pondered the practical manuvres of her campaign of invasion into the territory of youth which had once been hers the lotion for the hair as she verified by a consultation with the sunday paper took but a fortnights application to complete its work the wrinkle treatment was easily comprised in that for it took according to the eminent actress no more than three days it might therefore be wiser not to let the work of rejuvenation take place under lyndhursts eye for there might be critical passages in it but she could go away for a fortnight a fortnight was the utmost time necessary for the wonderful lotion to restore faded colour and return again after correspondence that indicated that she felt much better and younger several times before she had gone to stay alone with a friend of hers on the coast of norfolk there would be nothing in the least remarkable in her doing it again an objection loomed in sight if there was any reality in the supposition that prompted her desire to seem young againnamely a possible attraction of her husband towards millie evans she would but be giving facility and encouragement to that by her absence but then immediately the wisdom of the course stronger than the objection to it presented itself infinitely the wiser plan for her was to act as if unconscious of any such danger to disarm him by her obvious rejection of any armour of her own she must either watch him minutely or not at all mr pettit had alluded in his sermon that morning to the finer of the two attitudes when he reminded them that love thought no evil it seemed to poor mrs ames that if by her conduct she appeared to think no evil it came to the same thing her behaviour towards lyndhurst when he should come back from millies house followed as a corollary she would be completely genial she would hope he had had a pleasant lunch and if he made any apology for his absence assure him that it was quite unnecessary her charity would carry her even further than that she would say that his absence had been deplored by her guests but that she had been so glad that he had done as he felt inclined she would hope that millie was not tired with her party and that she and her husband would come to dine with them again soon it must be while harry was at home for he was immensely attracted by millie so good for a boy to think about a nice woman like that mrs ames carried out her programme with pathetic fidelity her husband did not get home till nearly teatime and she welcomed him with a cordiality that would have been unusual even if he had not gone out to lunch at all and to do him justice it must be confessed that his wifes scheme as already recounted was framed to meet a situation which at present had no real existence except in the mind of a wife wedded to a younger husband there were data for the situation so to speak rather than there was danger of it he on his side was well aware of the irregularity of his conduct and was prepared to accept without retaliation a modicum of blame for it but no blame at all awaited him instead of that a cordiality so genuine that in spite of the fact that a particularly good dinner was provided him the possible parallel of the prodigal son did not so much as suggest itself to his mind harry had retired to his bedroom soon after dinner with a certain wildness of eye which portended poetry rather than repose and after he had gone his father commented in the humorous spirit about this poor old harry he said case of lovely woman eh amy i was just the same at his age until i met you my dear this topic of harrys admiration for mrs evans which his mother had intended to allude to had not yet been touched on and she responded cordially you think harry is very much attracted by millie do you mean she said he chuckled well thats not very difficult to see he said why the rascal tore off a dozen of my best roses for her last night though i hadnt the heart to scold him for it not a bad thing for a young fellow to burn a bit of incense before a charming woman like that keeps him out of mischief makes him see what a nice woman is like as i said i used to do just the same myself tell me about it said she well there was the colonels wife god bless me how i adored her i must have been just about harrys age for i had only lately joined and she was a woman getting on for forty good thing too for me as i say for it kept me out of mischief they used to say she encouraged me but i dont believe it every woman likes to know that shes admired eh she doesnt snub a boy who takes her out in the garden and picks his fathers roses for her but we mustnt have harry boring her with his attentions thatll never do it seemed to mrs ames of singularly little consequence whether harry bored millie evans or not she would much have preferred to be assured that her husband did but the subsequent conversation did not reassure her as to that nice little woman she is he said thoroughly nice little woman and naturally enough my dear since she is your cousin she likes being treated in neighbourly fashion we had a great talk after lunch today and im sorry for her sorry for her i think we ought to do all we can to make life pleasant for her drop in to tea or drop in to lunch as i did today a doctors wife you know she told me that some days she scarcely set eyes on her husband and when she did he could think of nothing but microbes and theres really nobody in riseborough except you and me with whom she feelsdear me whats that french wordyes with whom she feels in her proper milieu i should like us to be on such terms with heryou being her cousinthat we could always telephone to say we were dropping in and that she would feel equally free to drop in dropping in you know thats the real thing not to be obliged to wait till you are asked or to accept weeks ahead as one has got to do for some formal dinnerparty i should like to feel that we mightnt be surprised to find her picking sweetpeas in the garden and that she wouldnt be surprised to find you or me sitting under her mulberrytree waiting for her to come in after all intimacy only begins when formality ceases shall i give you some soda water mrs ames did not want sodawater she wanted to think her husband had completely expressed the attitude she meant to adopt but her own adoption of it had presupposed a certain contrition on his part with regard to his unusual behaviour but he gave her no time for thought and proceeded to propose just the same sort of thing as she in her magnanimity had thought of suggesting dinner now he said up till last night we have always been a bit formal about dinner here in riseborough if you asked general snookes you asked mrs snookes if you asked admiral jones you asked lady jones you led the way my dear about that and what could have been pleasanter than our little party last night let us repeat it let us be less formal if you want to see mr altham ask him to come mrs altham let us say wants to ask me let her ask me or if you meet dr evans in the street and he says it is lunch time go and have lunch with him without bothering about me i shall do very well at home im told that in london it is quite a constant practice to invite like that and it seems to me very sensible all this had seemed very sensible to mrs ames when she had thought of it herself it seemed a little more hazardous now she was well aware that this plan had caused a vast amount of talk in riseborough the knowledge of which she had much enjoyed since it was of the nature of subjects commenting on the movements of their queen without any danger to her of dethronement but she was not so sure that she enjoyed her husbands cordial endorsement of her innovation also in his endorsement there was some little insincerity he had taken as instance the chance of his wishing to dine without his wife at mrs althams and they both knew how preposterous such a contingency would be but did this only prepare the way for a further solitary excursion to mrs evans had mrs evans asked him to dine there she was immediately enlightened of course we talked over your delightful dinnerparty of last night he said and agreed in the agreeableness of it and she asked me to dine there en garon on tuesday next of course i said i must consult you first you might have asked other people here or we might be dining out together i should not dream of upsetting any existing arrangement i told her so she quite understood but if there was nothing going on i promised to dine there en garon that phrase had evidently taken major ames fancy there was a ring of youth about it and he repeated it with gusto his wife too perfectly understood the secret smack of the lips with which he said it she knew precisely how he felt but she was wise enough to keep the consciousness of it completely out of her reply by all means she said we have no engagement for that night and i am thinking of proposing myself for a little visit to mrs bertram next week lyndhurst i know she is at overstrand now and i think ten days on the east coast would do me good he assented with a cordiality that equalled hers very wise i am sure my dear he said i have thought this last day or two that you looked a little run down a sudden misgiving seized her at this for she knew quite well she neither looked nor felt the least run down i thought perhaps you and harry would take some little trip together while i was away she said oh never mind us never mind us said he well rub along en garon you know i daresay some of our friends will take pity on us and ask us to drop in this was not reassuring nor would mrs ames have been reassured if she could have penetrated at that moment unseen into mrs althams drawingroom she and her husband had gone straight from mrs ames house that afternoon to call on mrs evans and had been told she was not at home but mrs altham of the eagleeye had seen through the opened front door an immense bowl of sweetpeas on the hall table and by it a straw hat with a riband of regimental colours round it circumstantial evidence could go no further and now this indefatigable lady was looking out major ames in an old army list ames lyndhurst percy she triumphantly read out born and i daresay he is older than that because if ever there was a man who wanted to be thought younger than his years thats the one so in any case henry he is over fortyseven and theres the frontdoor bell it will be mrs brooks she said she would drop in for a chat after dinner there was plenty to chat about that evening chapter v mrs ames might or might not have been run down when she left riseborough the following week but nothing can be more certain than that she was considerably braced up seven days after that the delicious freshness of winds off the north sea tempering the heat of brilliant summer suns may have had something to do with it and she certainly had more colour in her face than was usual with her which was the legitimate effect of the felicitous weather there was more colour in her hair also and though that no doubt was a perfectly legitimate effect too being produced by purely natural means as the label on the bottle stated the sun and wind were not accountable for this embellishment she had spent an afternoon in londonchiefly in bond streeton her way here and had gone to a couple of addresses which she had secretly snipped out of the daily press the expenditure of a couple of pounds which was already yielding her immense dividends in encouragement and hope had put her into possession of a bottle with a brush a machine that when you turned a handle quivered violently like a motorcar that is prepared to start and a small jar of opaque glass which contained the miraculous skinfood with these was being wrought the desired marvels with these as with a magicians rod she was conjuring so she believed the remote enchantments of youth back to her after quite a few days change became evident and daily that change grew greater as regards her hair the cost both of time and material in this miracleworking was of the smallest possible account morning and evening after brushing it she rubbed in a mere teaspoonful of a thin yellow liquid which as the advertisement stated was quite free from grease or obnoxious smell and did not stain the pillow this was so simple that it really required faith to embark upon the treatment for from the time of hebrew prophets mankind have found it easier to do some great thing than merely to wash in the jordan but mrs ames luckily had shown her faith and by the end of a week the marvellous lotion had shown its works till now though her hair could not be described as grey there was a considerable quantity of grey in it now she examined it with an eye that sought for instead of shutting itself to such blemish and the reward of its search was of the most meagre sort there was really no grey left in it it might have been as far as colour could be taken as a test of age the hair of a young woman it was not very abundant in quantity but the lotion had held out no promises on that score quality not quantity was the sum of its beckoning the application of the skinfood was more expensive she had to use more and it took longer nightly she poured a can of very hot water into her basin and with a towel over her head to concentrate the vapour she steamed her face over it for some twenty minutes emerging red and hot and stifled she wiped off the streams of moisture and with fingertips dipped in this marvellous cream tapped and dabbed at the less happy regions between her eyebrows outside her eyes across her forehead at the corners of her mouth and up and down her neck then came the use of the palpitating machine it whirred and buzzed over her tickling very much for halfanhour she would make a patient piano of her face then gently remove such of the skinfood as still stayed on the surface and had not gone within to do its nurturing work certainly this was a somewhat laborious affair but the results were highly prosperous there was no doubt that to a perfectly candid and even sceptical eye a weeks treatment had produced a change the wrinkles were beginning to be softly erased there was a perceptible plumpness observable in the leaner places between the bouts of tapping and dabbing she sipped the glass of milk which she brought up to bed with her as the deviser of the skinfood recommended she drank another such glass in the middle of the morning and digested them both perfectly as these external signs appeared and grew there went on within her an accompanying and corresponding rejuvenation of spirit she felt very well owing no doubt to the brisk air the milk the many hours spent outofdoors and in consequence she began to feel much younger an unwonted activity and lightness pervaded her limbs she took daily a walk of a couple of hours without fatigue and was the life and soul of the dinnertable whose other occupants were her hosts mrs bertram a cold grim woman with a moustache and her husband milder with whiskers their only passion was for gardening and they seldom left their grounds thus mrs ames took her walks unaccompanied miles of firm sands when the tide was low subtended the cliffs on which mr bertrams house stood and often mrs ames preferred to walk along the margin of the sea rather than pursue more inland routes and today after her large and wholesome lunch the physical stimulus of the east coast combined with this mental stimulus of her object in coming here gave her an appetite of dimensions unknown at riseborough she took a maritime way the tide was far out and the lower sands still shining and firm from the retained moisture of its retreat made uncommonly pleasant walking she had abandoned heeled footgear and had bought at a shop in the village where everything inexpensive from wooden spades to stamps and sticking plaster was sold a pair of canvas coverings technically known as sandshoes they laced up with a piece of white tape and were juvenile light and easily removable they and the great sea and the jetsam of stranded seaweed and the general sense of youth and freshness made most agreeable companions and she felt though neither mr nor mrs bertram was with her charmingly accompanied her small toadlike face expressed a large degree of contentment and piercing her pleasant surroundings as the smell of syringa pierces through the odour of all other flowers was the sense of her brown hair and fastfading wrinkles that gave her an inward happiness which flushed with pleasure and interest all she saw in the lines of pebbles left by the retreating tide was an orangecoloured cornelian which she picked up and put in her pocket she could have bought the same ready polished for a shilling at the cheap and comprehensive shop but to find it herself gave her a pleasure not to be estimated at all in terms of silver coinage further on there was an attractivelooking shell which she also picked up and was about to give as a companion to the cornelian when a sudden scurry of clawlike legs about its aperture showed her that a hermitcrab was domiciled within and she dropped it with a little scream and a sense of danger escaped both by her and the hermitcrab there were attractive pieces of seaweed which reminded her of years when she collected the finer sorts and set them with the aid of a pin on cartridgepaper spreading out their delicate fronds and fernlike foliage there were creamy ripples of the quiet sea longwinged gulls that hovered fishing above all there was the sense of her brown hair and smoothed face she felt years younger and she felt she looked years younger which was scarcely less solid a satisfaction it pleased her but not acutely or viciously to think of mrs althams feelings when she made her rejuvenated appearance in riseborough it was quite certain that mrs altham would suspect that she had been doing something to herself and that mrs altham would burst with envy and curiosity to know what it was she had done although she felt very kindly towards all the world she did not deceive herself to such an extent as to imagine that she would tell mrs altham what she had done mrs altham was ingenious and would like guessing but that lady occupied her mind but little the main point was that in a week from now she would go home again and that lyndhurst would find her young she might or might not have been right in fearing that lyndhurst was becoming sentimentally interested in millie evans and she was quite willing to grant that her grounds for that fear were of the slenderest but all that might be dismissed now she herself in a week from now would have recaptured that more youthful aspect which had been hers while he was still of loverlike inclination towards her what might be called regular good looks had always been denied her but she had once had her share of youth today she felt youthful still and once again she believed looked as if she belonged to the enchanted epoch she had no intention of using this recapture promiscuously she scarcely desired general admiration she only desired that her husband should find her attractive for a little while as she took her quick short steps along these shining sands she felt herself grow bitter towards millie evans a sort of superior pity was mixed with the bitterness for she told herself that poor millie if she had tried to flirt with lyndhurst would speedily find herself flirting all alone very likely millie was guiltless in intention she had only let her pretty face produce an unchecked effect men were attracted by a pretty face but the owners of such faces ought to keep a curb on them so to speak their faces were not their faults but rather their misfortunes a woman with a pretty face would be wise to make herself rather reserved so that her manner would chill anybody who was inclined but the whole subject now was obsolete if there had been any danger there would not be any more and she did not blame millie she must ask millie to dine with them en famille which was much nicer than en garon as soon as she got back it might be gathered from this account of mrs ames selfcommunings that deep down in her nature their lay a strain of almost farcical fatuousness but she was not really fatuous unless it is fatuous to have preserved far out into the plains of middleage some vision of the blue mountains of youth it is true that for years she had been satisfied to dwell on these plains now her fear that her husband so much younger than herself was turning his eyes to blue mountains that did not belong to him made her desire to get out of the plains and ascend her own blue mountains again and wave to him from there and encourage his advance she felt exceedingly well and in consequence told herself that in mind as well as physical constitution she was young still while the effect of the bottles which she used with such regularity made her believe that the outward signs of age were erasible she seemed to have been granted a new lease of life in a tenement that it was easy to repair her whole nature felt itself to be quickened and vivified she had gone far along the sands and the tide was beginning to flow again all round her were great empty spaces a shipless sea a cloudless sky a beach with no living being in sight a sudden unpremeditated impulse seized her and without delay she sat down on the shore and took off her shoes and stockings then pulling up her skirts she hastily ran down to the edge of the water across a little belt of pebbles that tickled and hurt her softsoled feet and waded out into the liquid rims of the sea she was astonished and amazed at herself that the idea of paddling had ever come into her head and more amazed that she had had the temerity to put it into execution for the first minute or two the cold touch of the water on her unaccustomed ankles and calves made her gasp a little but for all the strangeness of these sensations she felt that paddling playing like a child in the shallow waters expressed the tone of her mind just as the melody of a song expresses the words to which it is set if she had had a spade she would certainly have built a sandcastle and dug moats about it and a smile lit up her small face at the thought of purchasing one at the universal shop and furtively conveying it to these unfrequented beaches and the smile almost ended in a blush when she tried to imagine what riseborough society would say if it became known that their queen not only paddled in the sea but seriously contemplated buying a wooden spade in order to conduct building operations on lonely shores the paddling though quite pleasant was not so joyous as the impulse to paddle had been and it was not long before she sat down again on the beach and tried to get the sand out of the small tight places between her toes and to dry her feet and plump little legs with a most exiguous handkerchief but even in the midst of these troublesome operations her mind still ran riot and she planned to secrete about her person one of her smaller bedroom towels when she went for her walk next day and she felt as if this act of paddling must have aided in the elimination of wrinkles for who except the really young could want to paddle to find that she had the impulse of the really young was even better than to cultivate though with success the appropriate appearance all the way home this effervescence of spirit was hers which though it definitely sprang from the effects of the lotion the skinfood and the tonic air produced in her an illusion that was complete she was certainly ascending her remote blue mountains again and through a clarified air she could look over the plains and see how very flat they had been that must all be changed there must be more variety and gaiety introduced into her days for years as she saw now her life had been spent in small joyless hospitalities in keeping her place as accredited leader of riseboroughs socialities in paying her share towards the expenses of the house they did not laugh much at home there had seemed nothing particular to laugh about and certainly they did not paddle she was forming no plan for paddling there now irrespective of the fact that a muddy canal which was the only water in the neighbourhood did not encourage the scheme but there must be introduced into her life and lyndhursts more of the spirit that had today prompted her paddling exactly what form it should take she did not clearly foresee but when she had recaptured the spirit as well as the appearance of youth there was no fear that it would find any difficulty in expressing itself suitably all aglow especially as to her feet which tingled pleasantly she arrived at her hosts house again they were both at work in the garden mrs bertram was killing slugs in the garden beds mr bertram worms on the lawn major ames proved himself during the next week to be a good correspondent if virtue in correspondents is to be measured by the frequency of their communications his letters were not long but they were cheerful since the garden was coming on well in this delightful weather which he hoped embraced cromer also and since he had on two separate occasions made a grand slam when playing bridge at the club he and harry were jogging along quite pleasantly but there had been no gaieties to take them out except a teaparty with ices at mrs brooks unfortunately some disaster had befallen the ices personally he thought it was salt instead of sugar but harry had been unwell afterwards which suggested sour cream but his indisposition had been but short though violent he himself had dropped in to dine en garon with the evans and the doctor was very busy finally this came at the end of every letter as the place was doing her so much good why not stop for another week he was sure the bertrams poor things would be delighted if she would but that suggestion did not commend itself to mrs ames she had come here for a definite purpose and when on the morning before her departure she looked very critically at herself in the glass she felt that her purpose had been accomplished her skin had not so much she admitted the unruffled smoothness of a young womans but she had not been a young woman when she married but search where she might in her hair there was no sign of greyness in it all while the contents of the bottle were not yet half used but she would take back the more than moiety with her since an occasional application when the hair had resumed its usual colour was recommended it appeared to her that it undoubtedly had resumed its original colour the change though slight for grey had never been conspicuous was complete she felt equipped for youth again and psychologically she felt equipped every day since the first secret paddling she had paddled again in secret and from a crevice in a tumble of fallen rock she daily extracted a small wooden spade by aid of which with many glancings around for fear of possible observers she dug in the sand making moats and ramparts the first fine careless rapture of this it must be admitted had evaporated after one architectural afternoon she had dug not because this elementary pursuit expressed what she felt so much as because it expressed what she desired to feel after all she did not propose to rejuvenate herself to the extent of being nine or ten years old again the manner of her return to riseborough demanded consideration it was not sufficient merely to look up in a railway guide the swiftest mode of transit and adopt it for this was not quite an ordinary entry and it would never do to take the edge off it by making a travelsoiled and dusty first appearance so she laid down a plan the bare facts about the trains were these a train starting at a convenient hour would bring her to london a short halfhour before another convenient train from another and distant terminus started for riseborough it was impossible to make certain of catching this so she wrote to her husband saying that she would in all probability get to riseborough by a later train that arrived there at eight she begged him not to meet her at the station but to order dinner for halfpast eight it would be nice to be at home again then came the plan clearly it would never do to burst on him like that to sit down opposite him at the dinnertable beneath the somewhat searching electric light there handicapped by the fatigues of a hot journey only imperfectly repaired by a hasty toilet she must arrive by the early train though not expected till the later thus she would secure a quiet two hours for bathing resting and dressing if lyndhurst did not expect her to arrive till eight it was a practical certainty that he would be at the club till that hour and walk home in time to welcome her arrival he would then learn that she had already come and was dressing she would be careful to let him go downstairs first and a minute later she would follow he should see so in order to catch this earlier train from town she left cromer while morning was yet dewy and had the peculiar pleasure on her arrival at riseborough of seeing her husband from the windows of her cab passing along the street to the club she had a moments qualm that he would see her initialled boxes on the top but by grace of a punctual providence mrs brooks came out of her house at the moment and the major raised a gallant hat and spoke a cheerful word to her certainly he looked very handsome and distinguished and mrs ames felt a little tremor of anticipation in thinking of the chapters of life that were to be reread by them she felt confident also it never entered her head to have any misgivings as to what the last fortnight which had contained so much for her might have contained for him harry had gone back to cambridge for the july term the day before and she found on her arrival that she had the house to herself the afternoon had turned a little chilly and she enjoyed the invigoration of a hot bath and a subsequent hours rest on her sofa then it was time to dress and though the dinner was of the simplest conjugal character she put on a dress she had worn but some halfdozen of times before but which on this one occasion it was meet should descend from the pompous existence that was its destiny for a year or two to come it was of daring rosecolour the most resplendent possible and never failed to create an impression indeed she had on one of its infrequent appearances heard lyndhurst say to his neighbour in an undertone upon my soul amy looks very well tonight and amy meant to look very well again all happened as she had planned shortly after eight lyndhurst tapped at her door on his return from the club but could not be admitted and at halfpast having heard him go downstairs she followed him he had not dressed according to their custom when they were alone major ames was writing a note when she entered and only turned round in his chair not getting up glad to see you home my dear he said excuse me one moment i must just direct this she kissed him and waited while he scrawled an address then he got up and rang the bell just in time to catch the post he said by jove amy youve put on the famous pink gown i would have dressed if i had known youre tired with your journey i expect it was a very hot day here until a couple of hours ago he gave the note to the servant and dinners ready i think he said they sat down opposite each other at ends of the rather long table there were no flowers on it for it had not occurred to him to get the garden to welcome her homecoming and the whole of her resplendency was visible to him he began eating his soup vigorously capital plan in summer to have dinner at halfpast eight he said gives one most of the daylight and not so long an evening afterwards excellent peasoup this fresh peas from my garden the evans dine at eightthirty and how have you been amy some indefinable chill of misgiving against which she struggled had laid cold fingers on her things were not going any longer as she had planned them he had noticed her gown but he had noticed nothing else but then he had scarcely looked up since they had come into the diningroom but now he finished his soup and she challenged his attention i have been very well indeed she said dont i look it he looked her straight in the face saw all that had seemed almost a miracle to herthe softened wrinkles the recovered colour of her hair yes i think you do he said youve got a bit tanned too havent you with the sun the cold fingers closed a little more tightly on her have i she said that is very likely i was outofdoors all day i used to take quite long walks every afternoon he glanced at the menucard i hope youll like the dinner i ordered you he said your cook and i had a great talk over it this morning shell have been in the train all day i said and will feel a little tired appetite will want a bit of tempting eh so we settled on a grilled sole and a chicken and a macdoine of fruit hope that suits you amy so you used to take long walks did you is the country pretty round about bathing too is it a good coast for bathing again he looked at her as he spoke and for the moment her heartbeat quickened for it seemed that he could not but see the change in her then his sole required dissection and he looked at his plate again i believe it is a good coast she said there were a quantity of bathingmachines i did not bathe no very wise i am sure one has to be careful about chills as one gets on i should have been anxious about you amy if i had thought you would be so rash as to bathe some instinct of protest prompted her there would have been nothing to be anxious about she said i seldom catch a chill and i often paddled he laid down his knife and fork and laughed you paddled he asked nonsense nonsense she had not meant to tell him for her reasonable mind had informed her all the time that this was a secret expression of the rejuvenation she was conscious of but it had slipped out a thoughtless assertion of the youthfulness she felt i did indeed she said and i found it very bracing and invigorating then for a moment a certain bitterness welled up within her born from disappointment at his imperceptiveness you see i never suffer from gout or rheumatism like you lyndhurst she said i hope you have been quite free from them since i have been away but his amusement though it had produced this spirit of rancour in her had not been in the least unkindly it was legitimate to find entertainment in the thought of a middleaged woman gravely paddling so long as he had no idea that there was a most pathetic side to it of that he had no inkling he was unaware that this paddling was expressive of her feeling of recaptured youth just as he was unaware that she believed it to be expressed in her face and hair but this remark was distinctly of the nature of an attack she was retaliating for his laughter he could not resist one further answer which might both soothe and smart like a patent ointment before he changed the subject well my dear im sure you are a wonderful woman for your years he said by jove i shall be proud if im as active and healthy as you in ten years time dinner was soon over after this and she left him as usual to have his cigarette and glass of port and went into the drawingroom and stood looking on the last fading splendour of the sunset in the west the momentary bitterness in her mind had quite died down again there was nothing left but a vague dull ache of flatness and disappointment he had noticed nothing of all that had caused her such tremulous and secret joy he had looked on her smoothed and softened face and seen no difference there on her brown unfaded hair and found it unaltered he had only seen that she had put her best gown on and she had almost wished that he had not noticed that since then she might have had the consolation of thinking that he was ill it was not it must be premised that she meant she would find pleasure in his indisposition only that an indisposition would have explained his imperceptiveness which she regretted more than she would have regretted a slight headache for him for a few minutes she was incapable of more than blank and empty contemplation of the utter failure of that from which she had expected so much then like the stars that even now were beginning to be lit in the empty spaces of the sky fresh points in the dreary situation claimed her attention was he preoccupied with other matters that he was blind to her his letters it is true had been uniformly cheerful and chatty but a preoccupied man can easily write a letter without betraying the preoccupation that is only too evident in personal intercourse if this was so what was the nature of his preoccupation that was not a cheerful star there was a green light in it another star claimed her attention was it lyndhurst who was blind or herself who saw too much she had no idea till she came to look into the matter closely how much grey hair was mingled with the brown perhaps he had no idea either its restoration therefore would not be an affair of surprise and admiration but the wrinkles she faced round from the window as he entered and made another call on her courage and conviction though he saw so little she quickened perhaps by the light of the green star saw how goodlooking he was for years she had scarcely noticed it she put up her small face to him in a way that suggested though it did not exactly invite a kiss it is so nice to be home again she said the suggestion that she meant to convey occurred to him but very reasonably he dismissed it as improbable a promiscuous caress was a thing long obsolete between them morning and evening he brushed her cheek with the end of his moustaches well then were all pleased he said goodhumouredly shall i ring for coffee amy she was not discouraged do she said and when we have had coffee will you fetch a shawl for me and we will stroll in the garden you shall show me what new flowers have come out the intention of that was admirable the actual proposal not so happy since a glimmering starlight through the fallen dusk would not conduce to a perception of colour well stroll in the garden by all means he said if you think it will not be risky for you but as to flowers my dear it will be easier to appreciate them when it is not dark again she put up her face towards him this time he might perhaps have taken the suggestion but at the moment parker entered with the coffee how foolish of me she said i forgot it was dark but let us go out anyhow unless you were thinking of going round to the club oh time for that time for that said he i expect you will be going to bed early after your long journey i may step round then and see whats going on without conscious encouragement or welcome on her part a suspicion darted into her mind she felt by some process as inexplicable as that by which certain people are aware of the presence of a cat in the room that he was going round to see mrs evans i suppose you have often gone round to the club in the evening since i have been away she said yes i have looked in now and again he said on other evenings i have dropped in to see our friends lonely old bachelor you know and harry was not always very lively company its a good thing that boy has gone back to cambridge amy he was always mooning round after mrs evans that was a fact it had often been a slightly inconvenient one several times the major had dropped in to see millie and found his son already there but i thought you were rather pleased at that lyndhurst she said you told me you considered it not a bad thing that it would keep harry out of mischief he finished his coffee rather hastily yes within reason within reason he said well if we are to stroll in the garden we had better go out you wanted a shawl didnt you very wise where shall i find one that diverted her again to her own personal efforts there are several in the second tray of my wardrobe she said choose a nice one lyndhurst something that wont look hideous with my pink silk the smile as you might almost say of coquetry which accompanied this speech faded completely as soon as he left the room and her face assumed that businesslike aspect which the softest and youngest faces wear when the object is to attract instead of letting a mutual attraction exercise its inevitable power even though mrs ames object was the legitimate and laudable desire to attract her own husband it was strange how common her respectable little countenance appeared she had adorned herself to attract admiration coquetry and anxiety were pitifully mingled even as you may see them in haunts far less respectable than this detached villa and on faces from which mrs ames would instantly have averted her own she hoped he would bring a certain white silk shawl two nights ago she had worn it on the verandah after dinner at overstrand and the reflected light from it she had noticed as she stood beneath a light opposite a mirror in the hall had made her throat look especially soft and plump she stood underneath the light now waiting for his return fortune was favourable it was that shawl that he brought and she turned round for him to put it on her shoulders then she faced him again in the remembered position underneath the light smiling now i am ready lyndhurst she said he opened the french window for her and stood to let her pass out again she smiled at him and waited for him to join her on the rather narrow gravel path there was actually room for two abreast on it for on the evening of her dinnerparty harry had walked here side by side with mrs evans but there was only just room you go first amy he said or shall i we can scarcely walk abreast here but she took his arm nonsense my dear she said there is there not heaps of room he felt vaguely uncomfortable it was not only the necessity of putting his feet down one strictly in front of the other that made him so anything the matter my dear he asked the question was not cruel it was scarcely even careless he could hardly be expected to guess for his perceptions were not fine also he was thinking about somebody else and wondering how late it was but even if he had had complete knowledge of the situation about which he was completely ignorant he could not have dealt with it in a more peremptory way the dreary flatness to which she had been so impassive a prey directly after dinner the sense of complete failure enveloped her like impenetrable fog out of that fog she hooted so to speak like an undervitalized siren i am only so glad to get back she said pressing his arm a little i hoped you were glad too that i was back tell me what you have been doing all the time i have been away this like banns was for the third time of asking he recalled for her the days one by one leaving out certain parts of them even at the moment he was astonished to find how vivid his recollection of them was on thursday when he had played golf in the morning he had lunched with the evans this he stated for harry had lunched there too and he had culled probably the last dish of asparagus in the afternoon he had dined alone with harry that night and harry had toothache next day consequently harry went to the dentist in the morning and he himself had played golf in the afternoon that he remembered because he had gone to tea with mrs evans afterwards but that he did not mention for he had been alone with her and they had talked about being misunderstood and about affinities on saturday harry had gone back to cambridge but having missed his train he had made a second start after lunch he had met dr evans in the street that day going up to the golf links and since he would otherwise be quite alone in the evening he had dined with them en garon this catalogue of trivial happenings took quite a long time in the recitation but below the trivialities there was a lurking significance he was not really in love with millie evans and his assurance to himself on that point was perfectly honest but this he did not put so distinctly to himself he thought that she was tremendously attracted by him here was an appeal to a sort of deplorable sense of gallantryso terrible a word only can describe his terrible mindand mentally he called her poor little lady she was pretty too and not very happy it seemed to be incumbent on him to interest and amuse her his droppings in amused her when he got ready to drop out again she always asked when he would come to see her next these droppings in were clearly bright spots to her in a drab day they were also bright spots to him for he was more interested in them than in all his sweetpeas there was a situation come into his life something clandestine it would never do for instance to let amy or the estimable doctor get a hint of it probably they would misunderstand it and imagine there was something to conceal he had the secret joys of a bloodless intrigue but considering its absolute bloodlessness he was amazingly wrapped up in it it was no wonder that he did not notice the restored colour of amys hair he or rather mrs evans had made a conditional appointment for tonight if possible the possibility depending on amys fatigue he was going to drop in for a chat primarily the chat was to be concerned with the lighting of the garden by means of chinese lanterns for a nocturnal fte that mrs evans meant to give on her birthday the whole garden was to be lit and since the entertainment of an illuminated garden with hot soup quails and ices under the mulberrytree was obviously new to riseborough it would be sufficiently amusing to the guests to walk about the garden till suppertime but there would be supererogatory diversions beyond that bridgetables in the verandah a small band at the end of the garden to intervene its strains between the guests and the shrieks of southeastern expresses and already there was an idea of fancy dress major ames favoured the idea of fancy dress for he had a red velvet garment sartorially known as a venetian cloak locked away upstairs which was a dazzling affair if white tights peeped out from below it he knew he had a leg and only lamented the scanty opportunities of convincing others of the fact but the lighting of the garden had to be planned first there was no use in having a leg in a garden if the garden was not properly lit but the whole affair was as yet a pledged secret he could not as a man of honour tell amy about it short notice for a fte of this sort was of no consequence for it was to be a postprandial entertainment and the only postprandial entertainment at present existent in riseborough was going to bed thus everybody would be able to be happy to accept a rapid rsum of this made an undercurrent in his mind as he went through in speaking voice the history of the last days up and down the narrow path they passed she still with her hand in his arm questioning showing an inconceivable interest in the passage of the days from which he had left out all real points of interest his patience came to an end before hers upon my word my dear he said its getting a little chilly shall we go in do you think im sure you are tired with your journey there was nothing more coming she knew that but even in the midst of her disappointment she found consolation daylight would show the reestablishment of her youthfulness more clearly than electric light had done every one looked about the same by electric light and though in some secret manner she distrusted his visit to the club she knew how impolitic it would be to hint however remotely at such distrust it was much better this evening to acquiesce in the imputation of fatigue nor was the imputation groundless for failure fatigues any one when under the same conditions success would only stimulate and in the consciousness of that her bitterness rose once more to her lips you mustnt catch cold she said let us go in it was still only halfpast ten all this flatness and failure had lasted but a couple of hours and major ames as soon as his wife had gone upstairs let himself out of the house his way lay past the doors of the club but he did not enter merely observing through its lit windows that there were a good many men in the smokingroom on arrival at the doctors he found that elsie and her father were playing chess in the drawingroom and that mrs evans was out in the garden he chose to go straight into the garden and found her sitting under the mulberry dressed in white and looking rather like the milky way she did not get up but held out her hand to him that is nice of you she said how is cousin amy amy is very well said he but shes gone to bed early a little tired with the journey and how is cousin amys cousin he sat down on the basket chair close beside her which creaked with his weight i must have a special chair made for you she said you are so big and strong have you seen cousin amys cousins husband no i heard you were out here so i came straight out she got up i think it will be better then if we go in and tell him you are here she said he might think it strange major ames jumped up with alacrity with his alacrity was mingled a pleasing sense of adventure by all means he said then we can come out again she smiled at him surely he is playing chess with elsie i do not suppose he will interrupt his game apparently dr evans did not think anything in the least strange on the whole this was not to be wondered at since he knew quite well that major ames was coming to talk over garden illumination with his wife good evening major he said kind of you to come you and my little woman are going to make a pauper of me im told there elsie what do you say to my putting my knight there check pig said elsie then shall we go out major ames said millie are you coming out wilfred no little woman im going to defeat your daughter indoors come and have a glass of whisky and soda with me before you go major they went out again accordingly into the cool starlight wilfred is so fond of chess she said he plays every night with elsie when he is at home of course he is often out this produced exactly the effect that she meant she did not comment or complain she merely made a statement which arose naturally from what was going on in the drawingroom but major ames drew the inference that he was expected to draw glad i could come round he said now for the lanterns we must have them all down the garden wall and not too far apart either six feet apart eh now ill step the wall and we can calculate how many we shall want there i think i step a full yard still not cramped in the joints yet it took some half hour to settle the whole scheme of lighting which since major ames was not going to pay for it he recommended being done in a somewhat lavish manner with so large a number of lanterns it would be easily possible to see his leg and he was strong on the subject of fancy dress therell be some queer turnouts i shouldnt wonder he said but i expect there will be some creditable costumes too by jove it will be quite the event of the year amy and i with our little dinners will have to take a back seat as they say i hope cousin amy wont think it forward of me said millie major ames said that which is written pshaw forward he cried why you are bringing a bit of life among us upon my word we wanted rousing up a bit why you are a public benefactor they had sat down to rest again after their labour of stepping out the brick walls under the mulberrytree where the grass was dry and only a faint shimmer of starlight came through the leaves at the bottom of the garden a train shrieked by and the noise died away in decrescent thunder she leaned forward a little towards him putting up her face much as amy had done ah if only i thought i was making things a little pleasant she said suddenly it struck major ames that he was expected to kiss her he leaned forward too i think you know that he said i wish i could thank you for it she did not move but in the dusk he could see she was smiling at him it looked as if she was waiting he made an awkward forward movement and kissed her there was silence a moment she neither responded to him nor repelled him i suppose people would say i ought not to have let you she said but there is no harm is there after all you are aa sort of cousin and you have been so kind about the lanterns major ames was thinking almost entirely about himself hardly at all about her an adventure an intrigue had begun he had kissed somebody elses wife and felt the devil of a fellow but with the wine of this emotion was mingled a touch of alarm it would be wise to call a halt take his whisky and soda with her husband and get home to amy chapter vi mrs altham waited with considerable impatience next day for the return of her husband from the club where he went on most afternoons to sit in an armchair from teatime to dinner and casually to learn what had happened while he had been playing golf she had been to call on mrs ames in the afternoon and in consequence had matter of considerable importance to communicate she could have supported that retarded spate of information though she wanted to burst as soon as possible but she had also a question to ask henry on which a tremendous deal depended at length she heard the rattle of his deposited hat and stick in the hall and she went out to meet him how late you are henry she said but you neednt dress mrs brooks if she does come in afterwards will excuse you dinner is ready let us come in at once now you were at the club last night after dinner you told me who was there but i want to be quite sure mr altham closed his eyes for a moment as he sat down it looked as if he was saying a silent grace but appearances were deceptive he was only thinking for he knew his wife would not ask such a question unless something depended on it and he desired to be accurate then he opened them again and helped the soup with a name to each spoonful general fortescue he said young morton mr taverner turner young turner that was five spoonfulsthree for his wife two for himself he was not very fond of soup and you were there all the time between ten and eleven asked his wife till halfpast eleven and there was no one else mr altham looked up brightly the club waiter he said and the page the page has been dismissed for stealing sugar the sugar bill was preposterous that was how we found out did you mean to ask about that no my dear nor do i want to know at the moment the parlourmaid left the room and she spoke in an eager undertone mrs ames told me that major ames went up to the club last night when she went to bed at halfpast ten she said you told me at breakfast whom you found there but i wanted to be sure call them mr and mrs smith and then we can go on talking the parlourmaid came back into the room yes mr smith apparently went up to the club at halfpast ten she said but he cant have gone to the club for in that case you would have seen him it has occurred to me that he didnt feel well and went to the doctors it seems possible said mr altham not without enthusiasm understanding that doctor meant doctor and which doctor we have all noticed how many visits he has been paying toto dr jones said mrs altham during the time mrs smith was away but to pay another one on the very evening of her return looks as ifas if something serious was the matter my dear theres nothing whatever to show that major ames went to the doctors last night he said mrs altham gave him an awful glance for the parlourmaid was in the room and this thoughtless remark rendered all the diplomatic substitution of another nomenclature entirely void and useless mrs smith i should say added mr altham in some confusion proceeding to make it all quite clear to jane in case she had any doubts about it suggest to me any other reasonable theory as to where he was then said mrs altham i cant suggest where he was my dear said mr altham finding his legal training supported him considering that there is no evidence of any kind that bears upon the matter but to know that a man was not in one given place does not show with any positiveness that he was at any other given place no doubt then he went shopping at halfpast ten last night said mrs altham with deep sarcasm there are so many shops open then the high street is a perfect blaze of light mr altham could be sarcastic too though he seldom exercised this gift it quite dazzles one he observed mrs altham no doubt was vexed at her husbands sceptical attitude and she punished him by refraining from discussing the point any further and from giving him the rest of her news but this severity punished herself also for she was bursting to tell him when jane had finally withdrawn the internal pressure became irresistible mrs ames has done something to her hair henry she said and she has done something to her face i had a good mind to ask her what she had used i assure you there was not a grey hair left anywhere and a fortnight ago she was as grey as a coot coots are bald not grey remarked her husband that is mere carping henry she is brown now is this another fashion she is going to set us at riseborough what does it all mean shall we all have to plaster our faces with cold cream and dye our hair blue mr altham was in a painfully literal mood this evening and could not disentangle information from rhetoric has she dyed her hair blue he asked in a slightly awestricken voice no my dear how can you be so stupid and i told you just now she was brown but at her age as if anybody cared what colour her hair was her face too i dont deny that the wrinkles are less marked but who cares whether she is wrinkled or not these pleasant considerations were discontinued by the sound of the postmans tap on the front door and since the postman took precedence of everybody and everything mr altham hurried out to see what excitements he had piloted into port unfortunately there was nothing for him but there was a large promisinglooking envelope for his wife it was stiff too and looked like the receptacle of an invitation card one for you my dear he said mrs altham tore it open and gave a great gasp you would not guess in a hundred tries she said then be so kind as to tell me remarked her husband mrs altham read it out all in one breath without stops mrs evans at home thursday july pm shakespeare fancy dress well i never for a while little the silence of stupefaction reigned then mr altham gave a great sigh i have never been to a fancy dress ball he said i think i should feel very queer and uncomfortable what are we meant to do when we get there julia just stand about and look at each other it will seem very strange what would you recommend me to be i suppose we ought to be a pair mrs altham to do her justice had not thought seriously about her personal appearance for years but as she got up from the table and consciously faced the lookingglass over the chimneypiece it is idle to deny that she considered it now she was not within ten years of mrs ames age and it struck her as she carefully regarded herself in a perfectly honest glass that even taking into full consideration all that mrs ames had been doing to her hair and her face she herself still kept the proper measure of their difference of years between them but it was yet too early to consider the question of her impersonation there were other things suggested by the contemplation of a fancydress ball to be considered first there was so much in fact that she hardly knew where to begin so she whisked everything up together in the manner of a seapie in which all that is possibly edible is put in the oven and baked there will be time enough to talk over that my dear she said for if mrs evans thinks we are all going to lash out into no end of expense in getting dresses for her party she is wrong as far as i for one am concerned for that matter you can put on your oldest clothes and i can borrow janes apron and cap and we can go as darby and joan indeed i do not know if i shall go at allthough of course one wouldnt like to hurt mrs evans feelings by refusing do you know henry i shouldnt in the least wonder if we have seen the last of mrs ames and all her airs of superiority and leadership you may depend upon it that mrs evans did not consult her before she settled to give a fancy dress party it is far more likely that she and major ames contrived it all between them while mrs ames was away and settled what they should go as and i daresay it will be romeo and juliet i should not be in the least surprised if mrs ames did not go to the party at all but tried to get something up on her own account that very night it would be like her i am sure but whether she goes or not it seems to me that we have seen the last of her queening it over us all if she does not go i should think she would be the only absentee and if she does she goes as mrs evans guest all these years she has never thought of a fancy dress party mrs altham broke off in the middle of her address stung by the splendour of a sudden thought or does all this staying away on her part she said and dyeing her hair and painting her face mean that she knew about it all along and was going to be the showfigure of it all i should not wonder if that was it as likely as not she and major ames will come as hamlet and ophelia or something equally ridiculous though i am sure as far as the too too solid flesh goes major ames would make an admirable hamlet for i never saw a man put on weight in the manner he does in spite of all the garden rolling which i expect the gardener does for him really but whatever is the truth of it all and im sure every one is so secretive here in riseborough nowadays that you never know how many dined at such a place on such a night unless you actually go to the poulterers and find out whether one chicken or two was sentwhat was i saying she had been saying a good deal mr altham correctly guessed the train of thought which she desired to recall in spite of the secretiveness he suggested that served the purpose no my dear henry said his wife rapidly i accuse no one of secretiveness if i did you misunderstood me all i meant was that when we have settled what we are to go as we will tell nobody there is very little sense in a fancy dress entertainment if you know exactly what you may expect and as soon as you see a romeo can say for certain that it is major ames for instance and im sure if he is to go as romeo it would be vastly suitable if mrs ames went as juliets nurse i am not sure that i shall like so much finery said mr altham who was thinking entirely about his own dress and did not care two straws about major or mrs ames it will seem very strange nonsense my dear we will dine in our fancy dresses for an evening or two before and you will get quite used to it whatever it is henry do you remember my white satin gown which i scarcely wore a dozen times because it seemed too grand for riseborough it was too i am sure you were quite right it has been in camphor ever since i used to wear my roman pearls with it there are three rows and the clasp is of real pearls the very thing for cleopatra i recollect perfectly said mr altham his mind instantly darted off again to the undoubted fact that whereas major ames was stout he himself was very thin if he had been obliged to describe his figure at that moment he would have said it was boyish the expense of a wig seemed of no account well my dear white dress and pearls said his wife you are not very encouraging with that book of egyptian antiquities i can easily remodel the dress and i remember reading in a roman history that cleopatra was well over thirty when julius csar was so devoted to her and by the busts he must have been much balder than you it is no use denying that this was a rather heavy blow ever since the mention of the word cleopatra he had seen himself complete with a wig in another character but julius csar was sixty he observed with pardonable asperity i do not see how i could make up as a man of sixty and for that matter my dear though i am sure no one would think you were within five years of your actual age i do not see how you could make up as a mere girl of thirty why should we not go as antony and cleopatra ten years later it would be better than to go as julius csar and cleopatra ten years before mrs altham considered this it was true that she would find it difficult to look thirty however many roman pearls she wore i do not know that it is such a bad idea of yours henry she said certainly there is no one in the world who cares about her age or wants to conceal it less than i and there is something original about your suggestionantony and cleopatra ten years laterah there is the bell that will be mrs brooks coming in and there is the telephone also upon my word we never have a moment to ourselves i should not wonder if half riseborough came to see us tonight will you go to the telephone and tell it we are at home and not a word to anybody henry as to what we are thinking of going as there will be our surprise at any rate however much other people go talking about their dresses if you are being rung up to ask about your costume say that you havent given it a thought yet for the next week mrs altham was thoroughly in her element she had something to conceal and was in a delicious state of tension with the superficial desire to disclose her own impersonation and the deeprooted satisfaction of not doing so to complete her happiness the famous white satin still fitted her and she was nearly insane with curiosity to know what major and mrs ames were going to be and what the whole history of the projected festivity was in various other respects her natural interest in the affairs of other people was satiated mrs turner was to be mistress page which was very suitable as she was elderly and stout and did not really in the least resemble miss ellen terry mr turner had selected falstaff and could be recognized anywhere young morton with unwonted modesty had chosen the part of the apothecary in romeo and juliet mrs taverner was to be queen catherine andalmost more joyous than allshe had persuaded mrs brooks not to attempt to impersonate cleopatra what mrs brooks feelings would be when it dawned on her as it not inconceivably might that mrs altham had seen in her a striking likeness to her conception of hermione because she did not want there to be two cleopatras did not particularly concern her she had asked mrs brooks to dinner the day after the entertainment and her acceptance would bury the hatchet if indeed there was such a thing as a hatchet about finally she had called on mrs evans who had vaguely talked about midsummer nights dream mrs altham had taken that to be equivalent to the fact that she would appear as titania and mrs evans had distinctly intended that she should so take it indeed the idea had occurred to her but not very vividly her husband was going to be timon of athens that again was quite satisfactory nobody knew at all distinctly who timon of athens was and nobody knew much about dr evans except that he was usually sent for in the middle of something probably the same thing happened to timon of athens indeed within a couple of hours of the reception of mrs evans invitations which all arrived simultaneously by the local evening post a spirit of demoniacal gaiety not less fierce than that which inspired mrs altham possessed the whole of those invited though it was gay it was certainly demoniacal for a quite prodigious amount of illfeeling was mingled with it which from time to time threatened to wreck the proceedings altogether for instance only two days after all the invitations had been accepted mrs evans had issued a further intimation that there was to be dancing and that the evening would open at a quarter past ten precisely with a quadrille in which it was requested that everybody would take part it is easy to picture the private consternation that presided over that evening how in one house mrs brooks having pushed her central drawingroom table to one side all alone and humming to herself stepped in perplexed and forgotten measures and how next door mrs and mr altham violently wrangled over the order of the figures and hummed different tunes to show each other or pranced in different directions for here was the bitter affair these pains had to be suffered in loneliness for it was clearly impossible to confess that the practice of quadrilles was so long past that the memory of them had vanished altogether but luckily though at the moment the suggestion caused a great deal of asperity in mrs althams mind mrs ames came to the rescue with the suggestion that as many of them no doubt had forgotten the precise manner of quadrilles she proposed to hold a class at halfpast four tomorrow afternoon when they would all run through a quadrille together there i thought as much said mrs altham that means that neither major nor mrs ames can remember how the quadrille goes and we forsooth must go and teach them and she puts it that she is going to teach us i am sure she will never teach me i shall not go near the house i do not require to be taught quadrilles by anybody still less by mrs ames there is no answer she added to jane mr altham fidgeted in his chair last night he had been quite sure he was right in points where he and his wife differed and that the particular setting partners which they had shown each other so often did not come in the quadrille at all but occurred in lancers just before the ladies chain but she had insisted that both the setting to partners and ladies chain came in quadrilles this morning however he did not feel quite so certain about it you might send a note to mrs ames he observed and tell her you are not coming no answer was asked for said his wife excitedly she just said there was to be a quadrille practice at halfpast four let there be i am sure i have no objection though i do think you might have thought of doing it first henry but she will like to know how many to expect said henry if it is to be at halfpast four she must be prepared for tea it is equivalent to a teaparty unless you suppose that the class will be over before five during the night mrs altham had pondered her view about the ladies chain it would be an awful thing if henry happened to be right and if on the evening of the dance itself she presented her hand for the ladies chain and no chain of any sort followed she decided on a magnanimous course upon my word i am not sure that i shall not go she said just to see what mrs ames idea of a quadrille is i should not wonder if she mixed it up with something quite different which would be laughable and after all we ought not to be so unkind and if poor mrs ames feels she will get into difficulties over the quadrille i am sure i shall be happy to help her out no doubt she has summoned us like this so that she need not show that she feels she wants to be helped we will go henry and i daresay i shall get out of her what she means to dress up as but pray remember to say that we at any rate have not given a thought to our costumes yet and on our way we may as well call in at mr rolands for if i am to wear my three rows of pearls he must get me a few more since i find there is a good deal of string showing i daresay that ordinary pearl beads would answer the purpose perfectly i have no intention of buying more of the real roman pearls they belonged to my mother and i should not like to add to them and if you will insist on having some red stone in your cap to make a buckle for the feather i am sure you could not do better than get a piece of what he called german ruby that is in his shop now i do not suppose anybody in riseborough could tell it from real and after all this is over i would wear it as a pendant for my pearls if you wish i will pay half of it and it is but a couple of pounds altogether it did not seem a really handsome offer but henry had the sense to accept it he wanted a stone to buckle the feather in a rather coquettish cap that they had decided to be suitable for mark antony and did not really care what happened to it after he had worn it on this occasion since it was unlikely that another similar occasion would arise deep in his mind had been an idea of turning it into a solitaire but he knew he would not have the practical courage of this daring conception it would want another setting also in other houses there were no fewer anticipatory triumphs and past perplexities there was also in some cases wild and secret intrigue for instance a few evenings after mrs brooks next door sorting out garments in her wardrobe from which she might devise a costume that should remind the beholder of hermione looked from her bedroom window where her quest was in progress and saw a strange sight in the next garden there was a lady in white satin with pearls there was a gentleman in roman toga with a feathered cap the roman gentleman was a dubious figure the lady indubitable if ever there was an elderly cleopatra this was she mrs brooks sat heavily down after observing this sight it certainly was cleopatra in the next garden as certainly it was a snake in the grass in a moment her mind was made up she saw why she had been discouraged from being cleopatra the false mrs altham had wanted to be cleopatra herself without rival but she would be cleopatra too riseborough should judge between the effectiveness of the two representations of course every one knew that mrs altham had three rows of roman pearls which were nothing but some sort of vitreous enamel but mrs brooks as riseborough also knew had five or six rows of real seedpearls it was impossible to denigrer seedpearls they were pearls though small and did not pretend to be anything different to what they were but the roman prefix to any fairminded person invalidated the word pearls besides even as cleopatra without pearls she would have been willing to back herself against mrs altham cleopatra ought to be tall which she was also cleopatra ought to be beautiful which neither was and mrs altham had urged her to go as hermione of course she had to revise her toilet but luckily it had progressed no further than the sewing of white rosettes on to a pair of slightly worn satin shoes which were equally suitable for any of shakespeares heroines the week which had passed for mr and mrs altham in a succession of so pleasing excitements and anxieties had not been without incident to mrs ames when by the same post that bore their invitations to the other guests the announcement of the fancy dress ball reached her and she read it out to her husband even as mrs altham had done towards the end of dinner he expressed his feelings with a good deal of poohing and the opinion that he at any rate was past the years of dressingup this attitude for it had been settled that the invitation was to come as a surprise to him he somewhat overdid and found to his dismay that his wife quite agreed with him and was prepared as soon as dinner was over to write regrets the reason was not far to seek i hope i am not whatwhat the servants call touchy she said and indeed it was difficult to see what else the servants could call it but i must say that considering the length of time we have been in riseborough and the number of entertainments we have provided for the people here i think dear millie might have consulted meor you of course lyndhurst in my absenceas to any such novelty as a fancy dress ball i have no wish to interfere in any way with any little party that dear millie may choose to give but i suppose since she can plan it without me she can also enjoy it without me i am aware i am by no means necessary to the success of any party and since you think that you are a little beyond the age of dressing up lyndhurstthough i do not say i agree with youi think we shall be happier at home that night i will write quite kindly to dear millie and say we are engaged no doubt the althams would dine with us as i do not imagine that she would care to get up in fancy dress major ames was not a quick thinker but he saw several things without a pause one was that he at any rate must certainly go but that he did not much care whether amy went or not a second was that having expressed surprise at the announcement of the party it was too late now to say that he knew about it from the first and was going to impersonate antony while mrs evans was to be cleopatra a third was that something had to be done a fourth that he did not know what i will leave you to your cigarette lyndhurst said his wife rising and will write to dear millie let us stroll in the garden again tonight she passed out of the diningroom he closed the door behind her and she went straight to her writingtable in the drawingroom above it hung a lookingglass and still not in the frame of mind which servants call touchy she sat down to write the kind note a considerable degree of sunset still lingered in the western sky and there would be no need to light a candle to write by there was light enough also for her to see a rosytinted image of herself in the glass and she paused she saw there what she was aware mrs altham had seen this afternoonnamely the absence of grey in her hair and the softened and liquated wrinkles of her face true not even yet had her husband observed or at any rate commented on those refurbished signals of her youth but mrs ames had by no means yet despaired and daily as directed tapped in the emollient cream this rosy light of sunset gave her face a flush of delicate colour and she unconsciously claimed for her own the borrowed enchantment of the light then that which was not touchiness underwent a similar softening to that of her wrinkles she knew she had been guilty of sarcastic intention when she said she was aware that her presence was not necessary to the success of any party it would be unkind to dear millie if she refused to go for a dinnerparty at home was no excuse at all she could perfectly well go on there when carriages came at twenty minutes to eleven also it was absurd for lyndhurst to say that he was past the age when dressing up is seemly in spite of his hair which he managed very well he was still young enough in face to excuse the yielding to the temptation of embellishing himself and a venetian mantle would naturally conceal his tendency to corpulence no doubt dear millie had not meant to put herself forward in any way no doubt she had not yet really grasped the fact that mrs ames was acknowledged autocrat in all that concerned festivity all this train of thought needed but a few seconds for passage and as she still regarded herself the name of the heroines of enchantment sounded delicately in her brain juliet and ophelia she passed over without a pang for she was not so unfocussed of imagination as to see her reflection capable of recapturing the budding spring of those or the slim youthfulness of rosalind she wanted no girlish rle nor did she read into herself the precocious dignity of portia but was there not one who came down the green nile to the sound of flutes in a gilded bargeno girl but a woman in the charm of her full maturity the idea detailed itself in plan and manuvre she wanted to burst on lyndhurst like that to let him see in a flash of revelation how bravely she could support the rle of that sorceress at the moment the drawingroom door opened and simultaneously they both began a sentence in identical words do you know my dear ive been thinking they both stopped and he gave his genial laugh upon my soul my dear amy he said i believe we always have the same thoughts ill tell you what you were going to say you were going to say ive been thinking it wouldnt be very kind to dear milliethat is what you would say of coursenot very kind to mrs evans if we declined and i agree with you my dear no doubt she should have consulted you first or if you were away she might even as you suggested have mentioned it to me but you can afford to be indulgent my dearafter all she is your cousinand you wouldnt like to spoil her party poor thing by refusing to go and if you go why of course i shall put on one side my natural feelings about an old fogey like myself making a guy of himself and i shall dress up somehow i think i have an old costume with a venetian cloak laid aside somewhere though i daresay its motheaten and rusty now and ill dress myself up somehow and come with you i suppose there are some old stagers in shakespearei must have a look at the fellows plays againwhich even a retired old soldier can impersonate falstaff for instancesome stout old man of that sort some of this speech to say the least of it was not it is to be feared quite absolutely ingenuous but then major ames was not naturally quite ingenuous he had already satisfied himself that the old costume in question had been perfectly preserved by the naphthaline balls which he was careful to renew from time to time and was not in the least motheaten or rusty again since he had settled to go as antony it was not perfectly straightforward to make allusion to falstaff but after all the speech expressed all he meant to say and it is only our most fortunate utterances that can do as much indeed perhaps it leaned over a little to the further side of expression for it struck mrs ames at that moment struck her as violently and inexplicably as a cocoanut falling on her head that the question of the venetian cloak had not come into her husbands mind for the first time that evening she felt without being able to explain her feeling that the idea of the fancy dress ball was not new to him but it was impossible to tax him with so profound a duplicity indeed when she gave a moments consideration to the question she dismissed her suspicion but the suspicion had been there she met him quite halfway you have guessed quite right lyndhurst she said i think it would be unkind to dear millie if you and i did not go i dare say she will have difficulty enough as it is to make a gathering i will write at once this was soon done and even as she wrote poor mrs ames vision of herself grew more roseate in her mind but she must burst upon her husband she must burst upon him supposing her preposterous suspicion of a moment before was true there was all the more need for bursting upon him for cleopatraizing herself he meantime was wondering how on earth to keep the secret of his costume and his hostesss should amy proceed to discuss costumes or suggest the king and queen of denmark as suitable for themselves it might even be better to accept the situation as such and tell mrs evans that his wife wanted to go as a pair so mrs altham expressed it and that it was more prudent to abandon the idea of a stray antony and a stray cleopatra meeting on the evening itself unpremeditatedly but her next words caused all these difficulties to disappear they vanished as completely as a watch or a rabbit under the wave of the conjurers wand mrs ames never licked envelopes she applied water on a camelshair brush from a little receptacle like a tearbottle what nonsense my dear lyndhurst she said fancy you going as falstaff you must think of something better than that dear me it is a very bold idea of millies but really it seems to me that we might have great fun i do hope that all riseborough will not talk their costumes over together so that we shall know exactly what to expect there is little point in a fancy dress ball unless there are some surprises i must think over my costume too i am not so fortunate as to have one ready she got up from the table still with the roseate image of herself in her mind i think i shall not tell you who i am going to be she said even when i have thought of something suitable i shall keep myself as a surprise for you and keep yourself as a surprise for me lyndhurst let us meet for the first time in our costumes when the carriage is at the door ready to take us to the party do you not think that would be fun but you must promise me my dear that you will not make yourself up as falstaff or any old guy else i shall be quite ashamed of you he rang the bell effusively the heartiness of the action was typical of the welcome he gave to his wifes suggestion and ordered the note to be sent by jove amy he said what a one you always are for thinking of things and if you wish it ill try to make a presentable figure of myself though im sure i should be more in place at home waiting for your return to hear all about it but ill do my best ill do my best and i dare say the venetian cloak isnt so shabby after all i have always been careful to keep a bit of naphthaline in the box with it flirtation may not be incorrectly defined as making the pretence of being in love and yet it is almost too solid a word to apply to major ames relations with mrs evans during the week or two before the ball and it would be more accurate to say that he was making the pretence of having a flirtation even as when he kissed her on that daring evening already described he was thinking entirely about himself and the dashingness of this proceeding so in the days that succeeded this same inept futility and selfsatisfaction possessed him he made many secret visits to the house entering like a burglar in the middle of the afternoon by an unfrequented passage from the railway cutting at hours when she told him that her husband and daughter would certainly be out and the secrecy of those meetings added spice to them he feltso deplorable a frame of mind almost defies descriptionhe felt a pleasing sense of wickedness which was endorsed so to speak by the certificate which attested to his complete innocence as far as he was concerned it was a mere farce of a flirtation but the farce filled him with a kind of childish glee he persuaded himself that his share in it was real and that by a tragic fate he and the woman who were made for each other were forbidden to find the fruition of their affinity it was an adventure without danger a mine without gunpowder for even on two occasions when he was paying one of these clandestine visits dr evans had unexpectedly returned and found them together the poor blind man it seemed suspected nothing indeed his welcome had been extremely cordial good of you to come and help my wife over her party he said what youd do without major ames little woman i dont know wont you stop for dinner major then after a suitable reply and a digression to other matters the majors foolish eye would steal a look at millie and for a moment her eyes would meet his and flutter and fall and considering that there was not in all the world probably a worse judge of human nature than major ames it is a strange thing that his mental comment was approximately true dear little woman he said to himself shes deuced fond of me chapter vii jupiter pluvius or mr j pluvius by which name major ames was facetiously wont to allude to the weather seemed amiably inclined to cooperate with mrs evans scheme for the evening of her party promised to be ideal for the purpose the few days previous had been very hot and no particle of moisture lurked in the baked lawns so that her guests would be able to wander at will without risk of contracting catarrh or stains on such shoes as should prove to be white satin moreover by a special kindness of providence there was no moon so that the illumination of fairylights and chinese lanterns would suffer no dispiriting comparison with a more potent brightness over a large portion of the lawn mrs evans at major ames suggestion not having to pay for these paraphernalia he was singularly fruitful in suggestions had caused a planked floor to be laid here the opening procession and quadrille and the subsequent dances would take place while conveniently adjacent was the mulberrytree under shade of which were spread the more material hospitalities tree and dancingfloor were copiously outlined with lanterns and straight rows of fairylights led to them from the garden door of the house similarly outlined was the garden wall and the hedge by the railwaycutting while the band piano two strings and a cornet of amazingly piercing quality was to be concealed in the small culdesac which led to the potting shed and garden roller the shrubbery was less vividly lit here hamlets and rosalinds could stray in sequestered couples unharassed by too searching an illumination major ames had paid his last clandestine visit this afternoon and had expressed himself as perfectly pleased with the arrangements both elsie and the doctor had been there the party had been announced to begin at halfpast ten and it was scarcely that hour when mrs ames came downstairs from her bedroom where she had so long been busy since the end of the early dinner her arms were bare from fingertip to her little round shoulders over which were clasped with handsome cairngorm brooches the straps of her long tunic but there was no effect of an excessive display of human flesh since her arms were very short and in addition they were plentifully bedecked on one arm a metallic snake writhed from wrist to elbow on the other there was clasped above the elbow a plain circlet of some very bright and shining metal a net of blue beads altogether too magnificent to be turquoises was pinned over her unfaded hair and from the front of it there depended on her forehead a large pearshaped pearl suggestive of the one which the extravagant queen subsequently dissolved in vinegar any pearl so scientists tell us which is capable of solution in vinegar must be a curious pearl that which mrs ames wore in the middle of her forehead was curious also art had been specially invoked over and above the normal skinfood tonight in the matter of mrs ames face and a formal egyptian eyebrow as indicated in the illustration to rameses in the encyclopdia decorated in charcoal the place where her own eyebrow once was below her eye a touch of the same charcoal added brilliancy to the eye itself several touches of rouge contributed their appropriate splendour to her cheeks the long tunic which was held up over her shoulders by the cairngorm brooches reached to her knee it was a little tight perhaps but when you have only one arab shawl shot with copious gold thread you have to make it go as far as it can and after all it went to her knees a small fold of it was looped up and fell over her yellow girdle it was parted at the sides below the hips and disclosed a skirt made of two arab shawls shot with silver which stitched together descended to her ankle she did not mean to dance anything except the opening quadrille below this silverstreaked skirt appeared as was natural her pretty plump little feet on them she wore sandals which exhibited their plumpness and prettiness and smallness to the fullest extent a correct strap lay between the great toe and the next and the straps were covered with silver paper for years riseborough had known how small were her shoes tonight riseborough should see that those shoes had been amply large enough for what they contained round her neck finally were four rows of magnificent pearl beads no wonder cleopatra thought nothing of dissolving one pearl when its dissolution would leave intact so populous a company of similar treasures as she came downstairs she heard a sudden noise in the drawingroom as if a heavy man had suddenly stumbled it required no more ingenuity than was normally hers to conjecture that lyndhurst was already there and had tripped himself up in some novel accoutrement and at that a sudden flush of excitement and anticipation invaded her and she wondered what he would be like as regards herself she felt the profoundest confidence in the success of her garniture he could scarcely help being amazed delighted and an emotion never keenly felt by her but as such long outworn shook her and made her knees tremulous she felt so young so daring she wished that at this moment he would come out for as she descended the stairs he could not but see how small and soft were her feet almost before her wish was formed it was granted a wellsmothered oath succeeded the stumbling noise and major ames in white roman toga and tights came out into the hall there was no vestige of venetian cloak about him he was altogether different from what she had expected a profuse wig covered his head the toga completely masked what the exercise with the garden roller had not completely removed and below his big calves rose majestic over his classical laced shoes if ever there was a mark antony with a military moustache he was not in egypt nor in rome but here by a divine chance without consultation he had chosen for himself the character complementary to hers he looked up and saw her she looked down and saw him bless my soul he said amy cleopatra she gave him a happy little smile bless my soul she said lyndhurst mark antony there was a long and an awful pause it was quite clear to her that something had occurred totally unexpected she had wanted to be unexpected but there was something wrong about the quality of his surprise then such manliness as there was in him came to his aid upon my word he said you have got yourself up splendidly amy cleopatra now pearls and all and sandals why youll take the shine out of them all here we go eh antony and cleopatra who would have thought of it the cabs round dear we had better be starting if were to take part in the procession not want a cloak or anything antony and cleopatra god bless my soul that was sufficient to allay the immediate embarrassment true he had not been knocked over by this apparition of her in the way she had meant and the astonished pause she was afraid was not one of surrendering admiration and yet perhaps he was feeling shy even as she was standing here in all this splendour of shining pantomime he might well feel her to be as strange to him as she felt him to be to her moreover she had not only to look cleopatra but to be cleopatra to behave herself with the gaiety and youth which her appearance gave him the right to expect in the meantime he also had earned her compliments for no man who thinks it worth while to assume a fancy dress has a soul so unhuman as to be unappreciative of applause she fell back a step or two to regard him comprehensively my dear she said you are splendid that toga suits you to admiration and your arms look so well coming out of the folds of it what great strong arms lyndhurst you could pick up your little cleopatra and carry her backback to egypt so easily something of their irresponsibility which as by a special providence broods over the audacity of assuming strange guises descended on her she could no more have made such a speech to him in her ordinary morningclothes nor yet in the famous rosecoloured silk than she could have flown but now her costume unloosed her tongue and despite the dreadful embarrassment that he knew would await him when they got to the party and a second cleopatra welcomed them this intoxication of costume liable unfortunately to manifest itself not only in vin gai mounted to his head also ma reine he said feeling that french brought them somehow closer to the appropriate oriental atmosphere she held up her skirt with one hand and gave him the other we must be off my antony she said they got into the cab a somewhat jadedlooking horse was lashed into a slow and mournful trot and they rattled away down the hard dry road a queue of carriages was already waiting to disembark its cargoes when they drew near the house and leaning furtively and feverishly from the window mrs ames saw a hamlet or two and some titanias swiftly and shyly cross the pavement between two rows of the astonished proletariat beside her in the cab her husband grunted and fidgeted she guessed that to him this entrance was of the nature of bathing on a cold day however invigorating might be the subsequent swim the plunge was chilly but she little knew the true cause of his embarrassment and apprehension had his military career ever entailed which it had not the facing of fire it was probable though his courage was of no conspicuous a kind that he would have met the guns with greater blitheness than he awaited the moment that now inevitably faced him then came their turn there was a pause and then their carriage door was flung open and they descended from the innocent vehicle that to him was as portentous as a tumbril in a moment cleopatra would meet cleopatra and he could form no idea how either cleopatra would take it the cleopatrahostess as he knew was going to wear sandals also snakes were to writhe up her long white arms mrs ames adjusted the pearshaped pearl on her forehead i think if we say halfpast one it will be late enough lyndhurst she said if we are not ready he can wait it seemed to lyndhurst that halfpast one would probably be quite late enough the assemblage of guests took place in the drawingroom which opened into the garden a waiter from the crown inn with a chin beard and dressed in a sort of white surplice and carrying a lantern in his hand who might with equal reasonableness be supposed to be the man in the moon out of the midsummer nights dream or a gravedigger out of hamlet said character names please maam and preceded them to the door of this chamber he bawled out cleopatra and mark antony another cleopatra a different conception of this part as the kent chronicle said in its next issue a cleopatra dim and white and willowy advanced to them she looked vexed but as she ran her eyes up and down mrs ames figure like a practised pianist playing a chromatic scale her vexation seemed completely to clear dear cousin amy she said how perfectly lovely i never sawwilfred make your bow to cleopatra and antony oh major ames again she made the chromatic scale starting at the top so to speak his face with a long note and dwelling there again when she returned to it other arrivals followed and this particular antony and cleopatra mingled with such guests as were already assembled the greater part had gathered and mrs ames habitual manner and bearing suited excellently with her regal rle the turner family at any rate who were standing a little apart from the others not being quite completely in riseborough society and feeling rather hot and feverish in the thick brocaded stuffs suitable to falstaff mistress page and king theseus felt neither more nor less uncomfortable when she made a few complimentary remarks to them than they did when with her fat prayerbook in her hand she spoke to them after church on sunday elsewhere young morton with a white face and a red nose was the traditional apothecary and mrs taverner was so copiously apparalled as queen catherine that she was looking forward very much indeed to the moment when the procession should go forth into the greater coolness of the night air then a stentorian announcement from the waiter at the crown made every one turn again to the door antony and cleopatra ten years later he shouted there was a slight pause then entered mr and mrs altham with highheld hands clasped at fingertips they both stepped rather high she holding her skirt away from her feet and both pointing their toes as if performing a pavanne this entry had been much rehearsed and it was arresting to the point of producing a sort of stupefaction mrs evans ran her eye up and down the pair and was apparently satisfied dear mrs altham she said how perfectly lovely and mr altham but ten years later you must not ask us to believe that she turned to her husband and spoke quickly with a look on her face less amiable than she usually wore in public wilfred she said tell the band to begin the opening march at once for the procession in case there are any more but he interrupted heres another millie he said cheerfully yes wed better begin his speech was drowned by the voice of the brazenlunged waiter cleopatra he shouted mrs brooks entered with all the rows of seedpearls riseborough if the census papers were consulted might perhaps not prove to have an abnormally large percentage of inhabitants who had reached middleage but certainly in the festivities of its upper circles maturity held an overwhelming majority over youth it was so tonight and of the halfhundred folk who thus masqueraded there were few who were not numerically speaking of thoroughly discreet years the diffused knowledge of this undoubtedly gave confidence to their gaiety for there was no unconscious standard of sterling youth by which their slightly mature exhilaration could be judged and found deficient in genuine and natural effervescence thus despite the somewhat untoward conjunction of four matronly cleopatras a spirit of extraordinary gaiety soon possessed the entire party odious comparisons might conceivably spring up mushroomlike tomorrow and unmushroomlike continue to wax and flourish through many days and dinners but tonight so large an environment of elderly people gave to every one of those elderly people a pleasant sense of not suffering but rather shining in comparison with the others even the cleopatras themselves were content mrs ames for instance saw how sensible it was that mrs altham should announce herself as a cleopatra of ten years later while mrs altham observing mrs ames saw how supererogatory her titular modesty had been and wondered that mrs ames cared to show her feet like that while mrs brooks knew that everybody was mentally contrasting her queenliness of height with mrs ames paucity of inches and her abundance of beautiful hair with mrs althams obvious wig while all the time mrs evans whom the appearance of a fourth cleopatra had considerably upset for the moment felt that at this rate she could easily continue being cleopatra for more years than the ten after so properly assumed by mrs altham in the same way major ames with his six feet of solid english bone and muscle and his fifth decade of years still but halfconsumed felt that mr altham had but provided a scale of comparison uncommonly flattering to himself simultaneously mr altham with a laurelwreath round his head reflected how uncomfortable he would have felt if his laurelwreath was anchored on no sounder a foundation than a wig and wondered if gardening on the principle that all flesh is grass invariably resulted in so great a growth of tissue but all these pleasant selfcommunings were indeed but a minor tributary to the real river of enjoyment that danced and chattered through the starlit hours of this july night somehow the whole assembly seemed to have shifted off themselves the natural and inevitable burden of their years they danced and mildly flirted they sat out in the dim shrubbery and played on the seashore of life again finding the sandcastles had become real once more mrs ames for instance had intended to dance nothing but the opening quadrille but before the second dance which was a waltz had come to a close she had accepted mr althams offer and was slowly capering round with him a little care was necessary in order not to put too unjust a strain on the sandal straps but she exercised this precaution and was sorry though hot when the dance came to an end then major ames who had been piloting mrs altham joined them at the mosellecup table pon my word altham he said i dont know what to say to you youve taken my cleopatra but then ive taken yours exchange no robbery hey his wife tapped him on the arm with her palmette fan lyndhurst go along with you she said employing an expression the mental equivalent of which she did not know ever existed in her mind ill go along he said but which is my cleopatra at the moment mrs evans approached my two cleopatras must excuse me said this amazing man i am engaged for this next dance to the cleopatra of us all ha ha he offered his arm to mrs evans and they went out of the cave of the mulberrytree again the band had not yet struck up for the next dance the majority of the guests were flocking under the mulberrytree at the conclusion of the last and for the moment they had the cool starlit dusk to themselves and then all at once the majors sense of boisterous enjoyment deserted him he felt embarrassed with a secret knowledge that he was expected to say something in tune with this privacy how that expectation was conveyed he hardly knew the slight pressure on his arm seemed to announce it unmistakably it reminded him that he was a man and yet with all that gaiety and gallantry that were so conspicuous a feature in his behaviour to women in public he felt awkward and ill at ease he embarked on a course of desperate and fulsome eulogy longing in his private soul for the band to begin pon my soul you are an enchantress millie he said you come to our staid respectable old riseborough and before you have been here six months you take us all into fairyland positively fairyland andand ive never seen you looking so lovely as tonight let us stroll all round the garden she said i want you to see it all now it is lit up and the shrubbery is pretty too withwith the filter of starlight coming through the trees do tell me truthfully like a friend is it going all right are they enjoying themselves kicking up their heels like twoyearolds said major ames how wicked of you to say that but really i had one bad moment whenwhen the last cleopatra came in she paused a moment then in her clear silky voice dear old things she said now mrs evans was not in any way a clever woman but had she had the brains and the wit of cleopatra herself she could not have spoken three more consummately chosen words all the cool instinctive confidence of a younger woman and a pretty woman speaking of the more elderly and plain was there there too was the deliberate challenge of the coquette and major ames was quite helpless against the simplicity of such art mere manners the ordinary code of politeness demanded that he should agree with his hostess besides though he was not in any way in love with her he could not resist the assumption that her words implied and after all she was a pretty woman whom he had kissed and he was alone in the starhung dusk with her poor dear amy he said millie evans gave a soft little sigh as of a contented child he had expressed with the most ruthless accuracy exactly what she wished him to feel then in the manner of a woman whose nature is warped throughout by a slight but ingrained falsity she spoke as if it was not she who had prompted the three words which she had almost made him say she is enjoying herself so she said i have never seen cousin amy look so thoroughly pleased and contented i thought she looked so charming too and what dear plump little feet she has but my dear it was rather a surprise when you and she were announced it looked as if this poor cleopatra was going to be antonyless dear me what a word here was a more direct appeal and again major ames was powerless in her soft clutch hers was not exactly an iron hand in a velvet glove but a hand made of flycatching paper she had taken her glove off now and he was beginning to stick to her pshaw he said that again had a perfectly satisfactory sound to her ears the very abruptness and bluffness of it pleased her more than any protestation could have done he was so direct so shy so manly she laughed softly hush you mustnt say those things she said ah there is the band beginning and it is our dance but let us just walk through the shrubbery before we go back the dusk and quiet are such a relief after the glare lyndhurstah dear me cousin lyndhurst i ought to sayyou really must not go home till my little dance is quite finished you make things go so well dear wilfred is quite useless to me does he not look an old darling as timon of athens a sort of mixture between george the fourth in tights and a liontamer mrs evans was feeling more actively alive tonight than she had felt for years her tongue which was generally a rather halting adjutant to her glances and little sinuous movements was almost vivified to wit certainly her description of her husband had acuteness and a sense of the ludicrous to inspire it through the boughs of laburnums in the shrubbery they could see him now escorting the tallest and oldest cleopatra who was mrs brooks to the end of the garden dimly through the curtain of intervening gloom they saw the populous wooden floor that had been laid down on the grass mrs amesthe dance was a polkawas frankly pirouetting in the arms of a redoubtable falstaff mrs altham was wrestling with the apothecary and elsie evans one of the few young people present was vainly trying to galvanize general fortescue thinly disguised as henry vii into some semblance of activity mrs evans gave another sigh a sigh of curious calibre it all seems so distant she said all the lights and dancing are less real than the shadows and the stillness that was not quite extemporaneous she had thought over something of the sort it had the effect of making major ames feel suddenly hot with an anxious kind of heat he was beginning to perceive the truth of that which he had foppishly imagined in his own selfcommunings namely that this poor little lady was very very much attached to him he had often dwelt on the thought before with odious selfcentred satisfaction now the thought was less satisfactory it was disquieting and mildly alarming like the fly on the flypaper with one leg already englued he put down a second to get leverage with which to free the first and found that it was adhering also mrs evans spoke again i took such pleasure in all the preparations she said you were so much interested in it all tell me cousin lyndhurst that you are not disappointed it was hardly possible for him to do less than what he did what he did was little enough he pressed the arm that lay in his rather close to his white toga and an unwonted romanticism of speech rose to his lips you have enchanted me he said me us all of us she gave a little laugh in the dusk it sounded no louder than a breeze stirring you neednt have added that she said where she stood a diaper of light and shadow played over her a little spray of laburnum between her face and the lights on the lawn outside swaying gently in a breeze that had gone astray in this calm night cast wavering shadows over her now her arms shone white under freckles of shadow now it was her face that was a moon to him or again both would be in shade and a diamond star on her bright yellow hair concentrated all the light into itself all the elusive mysterious charm of her womanhood was there made more real by the fantastic setting he was kindled to a greater warmth than he had yet known but all the time some dreadful creature in his semipuritanical semiimmoral brain told him that this was all devilish naughty he was as unused to such scruples as he was unused to such temptations and in some curious fashion he felt as ashamed of the one as he felt afraid of the other at length he summed up the whole of these despicable conclusions will you give me just one kiss millie he said just one cousinkiss before we go and dance such early worms next morning in major ames garden as had escaped the early bird must certainly have all been caught and laid out flat by the garden roller so swift and incessant were its journeyings for though the dawn had overspread the sky with the hueless tints of approaching day when antony and cleopatra were charioteered home again by a somnolent cabman though major ames repose had been of the most fragmentary kind and though breakfast in anticipation of late hours had been ordered the night before at an unusual halfpast nine he found his bed an intolerable abode by seven oclock and had hoped to expatriate somewhat disquieting thoughts from his mind by the application of his limbs to severe bodily exertion he and his wife had been the last guests to leave indeed after the others had gone they lingered a little smoking a final cigarette even mrs ames had been persuaded to light one but a convulsive paroxysm of coughing which made the pearshaped pearl to quiver and shake like an aspenleaf led her to throw it away saying she enjoyed it very much he had danced with mrs evans three or four times three or four times they had sat in the cool darkness of the shrubbery and he had said to her several things which at the moment it seemed imperative to say but which he did not really mean but as the evening went on he had meant them more she had a helpless childlike charm about her that began to stir his senses and yet below that childlike confiding manner he was dimly aware that there was an eager womans soul that sought him her charm was a weapon a very efficient will wielded it all the same he reflected as the honest dews of toil poured from his forehead this morning in the hot early sunlight he had not said very much he had said that riseborough was a different place since sheor had he said they had come there that her eyes looked black in the starlight thathonestly he could not remember anything more intimate than this but that which had made his bed intolerable was the sense that the situation had not terminated last night that his boat so to speak had not been drawn up safely ashore but was still in the midst of accelerating waters and yet it was in his own power to draw the boat ashore at any moment he had but to take a decisive stroke to land to step out and beach it to returnsurely it was not difficultto his normal thoughts and activities for years his garden his club his domestic concerns his daily paper had provided him with a sufficiency of pursuits he had but to step back into their safe if monotonous circle and look upon these disturbances as episodic but already he had ceased to think of mrs evans as dear little woman or poor little woman somehow it seemed as if she had got her fingerto use a prosaic metaphorinto his works she was prodding about among the internal wheels and springs of his mechanism yet that was stating his case too strongly it was that of contingency that he was afraid but with the curious irresponsibility of a rather selfish and unimaginative man the fact that he had allowed himself to prod about in her internal mechanism represented itself to him as an unimportant and negligible detail it was only when she began prodding about in him producing as it were extraordinary little whirrings and racings of wheels that had long gone slow and steady that he began to think that anything significant was occurring but after all there was nothing like a pull at the garden roller for giving a fellow an appetite for breakfast and for squashing worms and unprofitable reflections though halfpast nine had seemed late enough for anybody as mrs ames had said the evening before it was not till nearly ten that she put an extra spoonful of tea into her silver teapot for she felt that she needed a more than usually fortifying beverage to nullify her disinclination for the days routine the sight of her cleopatra costume also laid upon the sofa in her bedroom and shone upon by a cheerful and uncompromising summer sun had awakened in her mind a certain discontent a certain sense of disappointment of age of grievance the gilt paper had moulted off one of the sandalstraps a spilt dropping of strawberryice made a disfiguring spot on the tunic of arab shawl and she herself felt vaguely ungilded and disfigured the cigarette tooshe had so often said in the most liberal manner that she did not think it wicked of women to smoke but only horrid certainly she did not feel wicked this morning but as certainly she felt disposed to consider anybody else horrid andand possibly wicked decidedly a cup of strong tea was indicated major ames had gone upstairs again to have his bath and to dress after his exercise in the garden and came down a few minutes later smelling of soap with a jovial boisterousness of demeanour that smelt of unreality goodmorning my dear amy he said and how do you feel after the party ive been up a couple of hours nothing like a spell of exercise to buck one up after late hours will you have your tea now lyndhurst she asked have it now or wait till i get it eh ill have it now delicious i always say that nobody makes tea like you now boisterous spirits at breakfast were not usual with major ames and as has been said his wife easily detected a false air about them her vague sense of disappointment and grievance began to take more solid outlines it is delightful to see you in such good spirits lyndhurst she observed with a faint undertone of acidity sitting up late does not usually agree with you there was enough here to provoke repartee also his superficial boisterousness was rapidly disappearing before his wifes acidity like stains at the touch of ammonia it does not in this instance seem to have agreed with you my dear he said i hope you have not got a headache it was unwise of you to stop so late however no doubt we shall feel better after breakfast shall i give you some bacon or will you try something that appears to be fish a little kedjeree please said mrs ames pointedly ignoring this innuendo on her cook kedjeree is it well well live and learn if you have any complaint to make about jephson said she pray do so no not at all one does not expect a cordon bleu but i dare say mrs evans pays no more for her cook than we do and look at the supper last night i thought the quails were peculiarly tasteless said mrs ames and if you are to be grand and have pches la melba i should prefer to offer my guests real peaches and proper icecream instead of tinned peaches and custard i say nothing about the champagne because i scarcely tasted it well then my dear im sure you are quite right not to criticize it all i can say is that i never want to eat a better supper suddenly mrs ames became aware that another piece of solid outline had appeared round her vague discontent and reaction no doubt you think that all millies arrangements are perfect in every way she observed i dont know what you mean by that said he rather hotly but i do know that when a woman has been putting herself to all that trouble and expense to entertain her friends her friends would show a nicer spirit if they refrained from carping and depreciating her no amount of appreciation would make tinned peaches fresh or turn custard into icecream said mrs ames laying down the fork with which she had dallied with the kedjeree which indeed was but a sordid sort of creation it is foolish to pretend that a thing is perfect when it is not nor do i consider her manners as a hostess by any means perfect she looked as cross as two sticks when poor mrs brooks appeared i suppose she thought that nobody had a right to be cleopatra besides herself to be sure poor mrs brooks looked very silly but if everybody who looked silly last night should have stayed away there would not have been much dancing done she took several more sips of the strong tea while he unfolded and appeared engrossed in the morning paper and under their stimulating influence saw suddenly and distinctly how illadvised was her attack she had yielded to temporary illtemper which is always a mistake it was true that in her mind she was feeling that lyndhurst last night had spent far too much with his hostess in a word she felt jealous it was therefore abominably stupid from a merely worldly point of view to criticize and belittle millie to him if there was absolutely no ground for her jealousywhich at present was but a humble little green budsuch an attack was uncalled for if there was ground it was most foolish at this stage at any rate to give him the least cause for suspecting that it existed but she was wise enough now not to hasten to repair her mistake but to repair it slowly and deliberately as if no repair was going on at all but i must say the garden looked charming she said after a pause did she tell you lyndhurst whether it was she or her husband who saw to the lighting the scheme was so comprehensive it took in the whole of the lawn there was nothing patchy about it i suspect dr evans planned it it looked somehow more like a mans work a look of furtive guilt passed over the majors face luckily it was concealed by the daily mail no evans told me himself that he had nothing to do with it he said it was pretty i thought very pretty if the nights continue hot said she it would be nice to have the garden illuminated one night if dear millie did not think we were appropriating her ideas i do not think she would she is above that sort of thing well dear i must go and order dinner have you any wishes clearly it was wiser from the majors point of view to accept this bouquet of olive branches after all amy was far too sensible to imagine that there could be anything to rouse the conjugal watchdog nor was there hastily he told himself that a cousinly kiss which at the moment he would willingly have foregone certainly last night he had been a little superstimulated there was the irresponsibility of fancy dress there was the knowledge that millie was not insensitive to him there was the sense of his own big shapely legs in tights there was dancing and lanterns and all had been potent intoxicants to riseborough which for so long had practised teetotalism with regard to such excitements amy herself had been so far carried away by this effervescence of gaiety as to smoke a cigarette and heaven knew how far removed from her ordinary code of conduct was such an adventure generously he had forborne to brandish that cigarette as a weapon against her during this acrimonious episode at breakfast and he had no conscious intention of hanging it like damocles sword over her head in case she pursued her critical and carping course against millie but whatever he had said last night she had done that without meaning to make use of his knowledge he knew it was in his power to do so what would not mrs altham for instance give to be informed by an eyewitness that mrs ames had blownit was no more than thaton the abhorred weed so conscious of a position that he could make offensive at will he accepted the olive branch and suggested a cold curry for lunch breakfast at mrs althams reflected less complicated conditions of mind both she and her husband were extremely pleased with themselves and in a state of passion with regard to everybody else since their attitude was typical of the view that riseborough generally took of last nights festivity it may be given compendiously in a rhetorical flight of mrs althams with which her husband was in complete accord in palliation it may be mentioned that they had both partaken of large quantities of food at an unusual hour it is through the body that the entry is made by the subtle gateways of the soul and vitriolic comments in the morning are often the precise equivalent of unusual indulgence the night before well im sure if i had known said mrs altham i should not have taken the trouble i did of course everybody said how lovely your dress is simply to make one say the same to them and i never want to hear the word cleopatra again henry so pray dont repeat it fancy mrs ames appearing as cleopatra and us taking the trouble to say we were antony and cleopatra ten years later twenty years before would have been more the date if we had known perhaps i am wrong but when a woman arrives at mrs ames time of life whether she dyes her hair or not she is wiser to keep her feet concealed not to mention what she must have looked like in the face of half the tradesmen of riseborough who were lining the pavements when she stepped out of her cab i thought i heard a great roar of laughter as we were driving up the high street i should not wonder if it was the noise of them all laughing as she got out of her carriage of course it was all very prettily done as far as poor mrs evans was concerned but i wonder that dr evans likes her to spend money like that for however unsuitable the supper was i feel sure it was very expensive for it was all truffles and aspic there must have been a sirloin of beef in the cup of soup i took between two of the dances and strong soup like that at dead of night fills one up dreadfully and mrs brooks appearing as another cleopatra after all i had said about hermione well im sure if she chooses to make a silly of herself like that it is nobodys concern but hers she looked like nothing so much as a great white mare with the staggers if you are going up to the club henry i should not wonder if i came out with you it seems to me a very stuffy morning and a little fresh air would do me good as for the big german ruby in your cap i dont believe a soul noticed it they were all looking at mrs evans long white arms poor thing she is probably very anmic i never saw such pallor i saw little of her the whole evening she seemed to be popping in and out of the shrubbery like a rabbit all the time with major ames i should not wonder if mrs ames was giving him a good talkingto at this moment then like all the rest of riseborough and unlike the scorpion there was a blessing instead of a sting in her tail but certainly it was all very pretty she said though it all seemed very strange at the time i can hardly believe this morning that we were all dressed up like that hopping about out of doors fancy dress balls are very interesting you see so much of human nature and though i looked the procession up and down henry i saw nobody so well dressed as you but i suppose there is a lot of jealousy everywhere and anyhow mrs evans has quite ousted mrs ames now nobody will talk about anything but last night for the next fortnight and im sure that when mrs ames had the conjurer who turned the omelette into the watch we had all forgotten about it three days afterwards and after all mrs evans is a very pleasant and hospitable woman and i wouldnt have missed that party for anything if you hear anything at the club about her wanting to sell her chinese lanterns and fairylights secondhand henry or if you find any reason to believe that she had hired them out for the night from the mercantile stores you might ask the price and if it is reasonable get a couple of dozen if the weather continues as hot as this we might illuminate the garden when we give our august dinnerparty at least i suppose mrs evans does not consider that she has a monopoly of lighting up gardens henry found himself quite in accord with the spirit of this address i will remember my dear he said if i hear anything said at the club i shall go up there soon for i should not be surprised if most of the members spent their morning there i think i will have another cup of tea you have had two already said his wife he was feeling a little irritable then this will make three he observed mrs evans finally had breakfast in her room when she came downstairs she found that her husband had already left the house on his visits which was a relief she felt that if she had seen his cheerful smiling face this morning she would almost have hated it she ordered dinner and then went out into the garden workmen were already there removing the dancingfloor and her gardener was collecting the fairylights in trays and carrying them indoors here and there were charred burnt places on the grass and below the mulberrytree the dbris of supper had not yet been removed but the shrubbery as last night was sequestered and cool and she sat for an hour there on the garden bench overlooking the lawn little flakes of golden sunlight filtered down through the foliage and a laburnum delicatesprayed oscillated in the light breeze she scarcely knew whether she was happy or not and she gave no thought to that but she felt more consciously alive than ever before chapter viii discussion about the fancy dress ball as mrs altham had said was paramount over all other topics for at least a fortnight after the event and the great question which annually became of such absorbing interest during julynamely as to where to spend august was dwarfed and never attained to its ordinary proportions till quite late on in the month these discussions did not as a rule bear fruit of any kind since almost without exception everybody spent august exactly where august had been spent by him for the last dozen years or so but it was clearly wise to consider the problem afresh every year and be prepared in case some fresh resort suggested itself to change the habit of years or at least to consider doing so the lists of hotels at the end of bradshaw and little handbooks published by the southeastern railway were as a rule almost the only form of literature indulged in during these evenings of july and mr altham whose imagination was always fired by pictures of ships often studied the sailings of river plate steamers and considered that the fares were very reasonable especially steerage the fact that he was an appallingly bad sailor in no way diminished the zest with which he studied their sailings and the prices thereof subsequently he and mrs altham always spent august at littlestoneonsea in a completely detached villa called blenheim where a capable scotchwoman who to add colour to the illusion maintained that her name really was churchill boarded and lodged them on solid food and feather beds during july it may be remarked mrs altham usually contrived to quarrel with her cook who gave notice thus there was one mouth less to feed while they were away and yearly on their return they had the excitement of new and surprising confections from the kitchen mrs ames it may be remembered had already enjoyed a fortnights holiday at overstrand this year and the last week of july saw her still disinclined to make holiday plans they had taken a sort of bungalow near deal for the last year or two which among other advantages was built in such a manner that any remark made in any part of the house could be heard in any other part of the house it was enough almost for her to say as she finished dressing we are ready for breakfast to hear parker replying from the kitchen the kettles just on the boil maam this year however she had been late in inquiring whether it was vacant for august and she found when her belated letter was answered that it was already engaged this fact she broke to her husband and harry who had returned from cambridge with hair unusually wild and lank with tempered indignation considering how many years we have taken it she said i must say that i think they should have told us before letting it over our heads like this but i always thought that mrs mackenzie was a most grasping sort of person who would be likely to take the first offer that turned up and im sure the house was never very comfortable i have no doubt we can easily find a better without much bother my bedroom ceiling always leaked said harry and there was nowhere to write at mrs ames had finished her breakfast and got up she felt faintly in her mind that after the fancy dress ball it was time for her to do something original yet the whole idea was so novel riseborough would be sure to say that they had not been able to afford a holiday but after all that mattered very little i really dont know why we always take the trouble to go away to an uncomfortable lodging during august she said and leave our own comfortable house standing vacant major ames had he been a horse would have pricked up his ears at this but the human ear being unadapted to such movements he contented himself with listening avidly he had seen little of millie this last fortnight and was beginning to realize how much he missed her presence between them it is true they had come near to an intimacy which had its dangers which he really feared more than he desired but he felt with that selfdeception that comes so easily to those who know nothing about themselves that he was on his guard now meantime he missed her and guessed quite truly that she missed him and poor prig he told himself that he had no right to cut off that which gave her pleasure he could be spartan over his own affairs if so minded but he must not play lycurgus to others and an idea that had privately occurred to him which at the time seemed incapable of realization suddenly leaped into the possible horizons and you always complain of the dampness of strange houses lyndhurst she added and as harry says he has no place for writing and study why should we go away at all i am sure after the excitement of the last month it would be a complete rest to remain here when everybody else is gone i have not had a moment to myself this last month and i should not be at all sorry to stop quietly here major ames knew with sufficient accuracy the influence he had over his wife he realized that is to say as far as regarded the present instance that slight opposition on his part usually produced a corresponding firmness on hers accentuated opposition produced various results sometimes he won sometimes she but mild remonstrance always confirmed her views in opposition to his he had a plan of his own on this occasion and her determination to remain in riseborough would prove to be in alliance with it therefore he mildly remonstrated you would regret it before the month was out he said for me im an old campaigner and i hope i can make myself comfortable anywhere but you would get bored before the end of august amy and when you get bored your digestion is invariably affected i should like to stop in riseborough said harry i hate the sea you will go wherever your mother settles to go my boy said major ames still pursuing his plan if she wishes to go to sheffield for august you and i will go too andand no doubt learn something useful about cutlery but dont try stopping in riseborough my dear amy at least if you take my advice you wont major ames was not very intelligent but the highest intelligence could not have done better he had learned the trick of slight opposition just as a stupid dog with a conservative master can learn to growl for asquith by incessant repetition when it has learned it it does it right the major had done it right on this occasion i do not see why harry should not have a voice in the question of where we spend his vacation she said certainly your room at the bungalow lyndhurst was comfortable enough but that was the only decent room in the house in any case we cannot get the bungalow for this august have you any other plans as to where we should go there was room for a little more of his policy of opposition well now brighton he said why not brighton theres a club there i dare say i should get a little bridge in the evening and no doubt you would pick up some acquaintances amy i think the westbournes went there last year this remarkable reason for going to brighton made mrs ames almost epigrammatic and then we could go on to margate she remarked and curry favour there by all means my dear said he i dare say the curry would be quite inexpensive mrs ames opened the door on to the verandah pray let me know lyndhurst she said if you have any serious proposition to make it was major ames custom to start work in the garden immediately after breakfast but this morning he got out one of his largesized cheroots instead these conduced to meditation and established himself in a chair on the verandah his mental development was not in most regards of a very high or complex order but he possessed that rather rare attainment of being able to sit down and think about one thing to the exclusion of others with most of us to sit down and think about one thing soon resolves itself into a confused survey of most other things major ames could do better than that for he could and on this occasion did exclude all other topics from his mind and at the end return so to speak bringing his sheaves with him he had made a definite and reasonable plan harry had communicated the interesting fact of his passion for mrs evans to the omar khayyam club and was of course bound to prosecute his nefarious intrigue he had already written several galloping lyrics a little loose in grammar and rhyme to his enchantress which he had copied into a small green morocco notebook the titlepage of which he had inscribed as dedicated to m e this looked a narcissuslike proceeding to any one who did not remember what mrs evans initials were this afternoon feeling the poetic afflatus blowing a gale within him but having nothing definite to say he decided to call on the inspirer of his muse in order to gather fresh fuel for his fire arrayed in a very low collar which showed the full extent of his rather scraggy neck and adorned with a red tie for socialism was no less an orthodoxy in the club than atheistic principles and illicit love he set secretly out and had the good fortune to find the goddess alone and was welcomed with that rather timid childlike deference that he had found so adorable before but how good of you to come and see me she said when im sure you must have so many friends wanting you i think it is so kind clearly she was timid she did not know her power her eyes were bluer than ever her hair was of palest gold as i remembered her of old he thought to himself referring to the evening at the end of june indeed there was a poem dated june rather a daring one the kindness is entirely on your side he said in letting me come andhe longed to sayworship but did not quite dareand have tea with you dear me that is a selfish sort of kindness she said let us go into the garden i think it was very unkind of you mr harry not to come to my dance last week but of course you cambridge men have more serious things to think about than little country parties i thought about nothing else but your dance for days said he but my tutor simply refused to let me come down for it a narrow pedantic fellow who i dont suppose ever danced tell me about your dress i like to picture you in a fancy dress she could not help appearing to wish to attract it was as much the fault of the way her head was set on to her neck of the colour of her eyes as of her mind oh quite a simple white frock she said and a few pearls theythey wanted me to go as cleopatra so sillyme with a grownup daughter but my husband insisted the fancy dress ball had not been talked about at mrs ames lately and he had heard nothing about it in the two days he had been at home both his parents had reason for letting it pass into the region of things that are done with did mother and father go he asked i suppose they felt too old to dress up oh no they came as antony and cleopatra have they not told you cousin amy looked soso interesting and your father was splendid as mark antony then was dr evans mark antony too asked harry no he was timon of athens then who was your mark antony he asked mrs evans felt herself flushing and her annoyance at herself made her awkward in the pouring out of tea she felt that harrys narrow gimletlike eyes were fixed on her see how stupid i am she said i have spilled your tea in the saucer dear mr harry we had heaps of cleopatras mrs altham was one mrs brooks was another we danced with hamlets andand anybody but this crude ridiculous youth she felt had some idea in his head and did father and mother dance together all the evening he asked she felt herself growing impatient of course not everybody danced with everybody we had quadrilles all sorts of things then with the mistaken instinct that makes us cautious in the wrong place she determined to say a little more but your father was so kind to me she said he helped me with all the arrangements i could never have managed it except for him we had tremendous days of talking and planning about it now tell me all about cambridge but harry was scenting a sonnet of the most remarkable character it might be called the rivals and would deal with a situation which the omar khayyam club would certainly feel to be immensely parful i suppose mother helped you too he said this was byronic lacerating she had to suffer as well as he there was a pungent line already complete but who had suffered as much as me was the refrain there were thrills in store for the omar khayyam club after a sufficiency of yellow wine cousin amy was away said mrs evans she was staying at cromer till just before my little dance that is not far from cambridge is it i suppose she came over to see you harry spared her and did not press these questions but enough had been said to show that she had broken faith with him rivals could suitably become quite incoherent towards the close incoherency was sometimes a great convenience for exclamatory rhymes were not rare he smoothed the lank hair off his forehead and tactfully changed the subject and i suppose you are soon going away now he said i am lucky to have seen you at all we are going to stop here all august i think my mother does not want to go away nor do i not that they either of them care about that mrs evans slight annoyance with him was suddenly merged in interest how wise she said it is so absurd to go to stay somewhere uncomfortably instead of remaining comfortably i wish we were doing the same but my husband always has to go to harrogate for a few weeks and he likes me to be with him i shall think of you all and envy you stopping here in this charming riseborough you like it asked harry how should i not with so many delightful people being friendly to me relations too cousin amy for instance and major ames and let me see if mrs ames is my cousin surely you are cousin harry harry became peculiarly fascinating and craned his long neck forward oh leave out the cousin he said how sweet of youharry she said that so to speak extracted the poisonfangs from the projected rivals and six mysterious postcards were placed by the authors hand in the pillarbox that evening each consisted of one mystic sentence she calls me by my christian name by a most convenient circumstance too apt to be considered accidental there had here come to birth an octosyllabic line of honeyed sweetness and simplicity he was not slow to take advantage of it and the moon setting not long before daybreak saw another completed gem of the m e series mrs evans that afternoon like major ames that morning sat and thought after harry had left her independently of the fact that all admirers even the weirdest always found welcome in her pale blue eyes she felt really grateful to harry for he had given her the information on which she based a plan which was quite as sound and simple as major ames and was designed to secure the same object since the night of the fancy dress ball she had only seen him once or twice and never privately and the greater vitality which by the wondrous processes of affinity he had stirred in her hungered for its sustenance it cannot be said that she was even now really conscious in herself of disloyalty to her husband or that she actually contemplated any breach of faith she had not at present sufficient force of feeling to imagine a decisive situation but she could at most lash her helm so to speak so that the action of the wind would take her boat in the direction in which she wished to go and then sit idly on deck saying that she was not responsible for the course she was pursuing the wind the tide the currents were irresistibly impelling her she had nothing to do with the rudder having tied it she did not touch it like the majority in this world of miserable sinners she did not actively court the danger she desired but she hung about expectant of it at the same time she kept an anxious eye on the shore towards which she was driving was it really coming closer if so why did she seem to have made no way lately today her plan betokened a more active hand in what she thought of as fate but unfortunately though it was as sound in itself as major ames it was made independently and ignorantly of that which had prompted his slight opposition this morning so that while each plan was admirable enough in itself the two taken in conjunction would if successful result in a fiasco almost sublime in its completeness the manner of which was as follows elsie it so happened was not at home that evening and she and her husband dined alone and strolled out in the garden afterwards you will miss your chess this evening dear she said or would it amuse you to give me a queen and a few bishops and knights and see how long it takes you to defeat me or shall we spend a little cosy chatty evening together i hope no horrid people will be taken ill and send for you so do i little woman he said she was getting to detest appellation and as if i shouldnt enjoy a quiet evening of talk with you more than fifty games of chess but dear me i shall be glad to get away to harrogate this year i need a month of it badly i shall positively enjoy the foul old rottenegg smell she gave a little shudder oh dont talk of it she said it is bad enough without thinking of it beforehand poor little woman almost a pity you are not gouty too then we should both look forward to it she sat down on one of the shrubbery seats and drew aside her skirts making room for him to sit beside her yes but as i am not gouty wilfred she said it is no use wishing i was and i do hate harrogate so i wonder she gave a little sigh and put her arm within his well whats the little woman wondering now he asked i hardly like to tell you you are always so kind to me that i dont know why i am afraid wilfred would you think it dreadful of me if i suggested not going with you this year im sure it makes me ill to be there you will have elsie you will play chess as usual with her all evening you see all morning you are at your baths and you usually are out bicycling all afternoon with her i dont think you know how i hate it she had begun in her shy tentative manner but her voice grew more cold and decided she put forward her arguments like a woman who has thought it all carefully over as indeed she had but what will you do with yourself my dear he said it seems a funny plan you cant stop here alone she sat up taking her hand from his arm indeed i should not be as lonely here as i am at harrogate she said we dont know anybody there and if you think of it i am really alone most of the time it is different for you because it is doing you good and as i say you are bicycling with elsie all the afternoon and you play chess together in the evening a shade of trouble and perplexity came over the doctors face the indictment for it was hardly less than that was as wellordered and digested as if it had been prepared for a forensic argument and the calm passionless voice went on think of my day there she said going into orderly detail after breakfast you go off to your baths and i have to sit in that dreadful sittingroom while they clear the things away even a hotel would be more amusing than those furnished lodgings one could look at the people going in and out or if i go for a stroll in the morning i get tired and must rest in the afternoon you come in to lunch and go off with elsie afterwards that is quite right the exercise is good for you but what is the use of my being there there is nobody for me to go to see nobody comes to see me then we have dinner and i have the excitement of learning where you and elsie have been bicycling you two play chess after dinner and i have the excitement of being told who has won here at any rate i can sit in a room that doesnt smell of dinner or i can sit in the garden i have my own books and things about me and there are people i know whom i can see and talk to he got up and began walking up and down the path in front of the bench where they had been sitting his kindly soul in some perplexity nothing wrong little woman he asked certainly not why should you think that i imagine there is reason enough in what i have told you i do get so bored there wilfred and i hate being bored i am sure it is not good for me either try to picture my life there and see how utterly different it is from yours besides as i say it is doing you good all the time and as you yourself said you welcome the thought of that horrible smelling water he still shuffled up and down in the dusk that too got on her nerves pray sit down wilfred she said your walking about like that confuses me and surely you can say yes or no to me if you insist on my going with you i shall go but i shall think it very unreasonable of you but i cant say yes or no like that little woman he said i dont imagine you have thought how dull riseborough will be during august everybody goes away i believe for a moment she thought of telling him that the ames were going to stop here then with entirely misplaced caution she thought wiser to keep that to herself she guilty in the real reason for wishing to remain here though coherent and logical enough in the account she had given him of her reason thought grossly wronging him that some seed of suspicion might hereby enter her husbands mind there is sure to be some one here she said the althams for instance do not go away till the middle of august you do not particularly care for them said he no but they are better than nobody all day at harrogate i have nobody it is not companionship to sit in the room with you and elsie playing chess besides the westbournes will be at home i shall go over there a great deal i dare say also i shall be in my own house which is comfortable and which i am fond of our lodgings at harrogate disgust me they are all oilcloth and plush there is nowhere to sit when they are clearing away his face was still clouded but it is so odd for a married woman to stop alone like that he said i think it is far odder for her husband to want her to spend a month of loneliness and boredom in lodgings she said because i have never complained wilfred you think i havent detested it but on thinking it over it seems to me more sensible to tell you how i detest it and ask you that i shouldnt go he was silent a moment very well little woman he said at length you shall do as you please instantly the cold precision of her speech changed she gave that little sigh of conscious content with which she often woke in the morning and linked her arm into his again ah that is dear of you she said you are always such a darling to me he was not a man to give grudging consents or spoil a gift by offering it except with the utmost cordiality i only hope youll make a great success of it little woman he said and it must be dull for you at harrogate so thats settled and were all satisfied let us see if elsie has come in yet she laughed softly you are a dear she said again wilfred evans was neither analytical regarding himself nor curious about analysis that might account for the action of others just as in his professional work he was rather oldfashioned but eminently safe and sensible so in the ordinary conduct of his life he did not seek for abstruse causes and subtle motives it was quite enough for him that his wife felt that she would be excruciatingly bored at harrogate and less acutely desolate here on the other hand it implied violation of one of the simplest customs of life that a wife should be in one place and her husband in another that was vaguely disquieting to him disquieting also was the cold precise manner with which she had conducted her case a dozen times only perhaps in all their married life had she assumed this frozen rigidity of demeanour each time he had succumbed before it in the ordinary way if their inclinations were at variance she would coax and wheedle him into yielding or though quietly adhering to her own opinion she would let him have his way but with her calm rigidity rarely assumed he had never successfully combated there was a steeliness about it that he knew to be stronger than any opposition he could bring to it nothing seemed to affect it neither argument nor conjugal command she would go on saying i do not agree with you in the manner of cool water dripping on a stone or with the same inexorable quietness she would repeat i feel very strongly about it i think it very unkind of you and a sufficiency of that always had rendered his opposition impotent her will when once really aroused seemed to paralyse his once or twice her line had turned out conspicuously ill that seemed to make no difference the cold precise manner was on higher plane than the material failure which had resulted therefrom she would merely repeat but it was the best thing to do under the circumstances in this instance he wondered a little that she had used this manner over a matter that seemed so little vital as the question of harrogate but by next morning he had ceased to concern himself further with it she was completely her usual self again and soon after breakfast set off to accomplish some little errands in the town looking in on him in his laboratory to know if there were any commissions she could do for him his eye at the moment was glued to his microscope a culture of staphylococcus absorbed him and without looking up he said nothing thanks little woman he heard her pause then she came across the room to him and laid her cool hand on his shoulder wilfred you are such a dear to me she said youre not vexed with me he interrupted his observations and put his arm round her vexed he said ill tell you when im vexed she smiled at him dewily timidly thats all right then she said so her plan was accomplished the affair of the staphylococcus did not long detain the doctor and presently after major ames was announced he had come to consult dr evans with regard to certain gouty symptoms into which the doctor inquired and examined theres nothing whatever to worry about he said after a very short investigation i should recommend you to cut off alcohol entirely and not eat meat more than once a day a fortnights dieting will probably cure you and take plenty of exercise i wont give you any medicine there is no use in taking drugs when you can produce the same effect by not taking other things major ames fidgeted and frowned a little i was thinking he said at length of taking myself more thoroughly in hand than that ive never approved of halfmeasures and i cant begin now if a tooth aches have it out and be done with it no fiddling about for me now my wife does not want to go away this august and it seemed to me that it would be a very good opportunity for me to go as you do i think and take a course of waters get rid of the tendency dont you know eradicate it what do you say to that harrogate now i was thinking of harrogate if you approved harrogate does wonders for gout does it not the doctor laughed i am certainly hoping that harrogate will do wonders for me he said i go there every year and no doubt many of us who are getting on in years would be benefited by it but your symptoms are very slight i think you will soon get rid of them if you follow the course i suggest but major ames showed a strange desire for harrogate well i like to do things thoroughly he said i like getting rid of a thing root and branch you know you see i may not get another opportunity amy likes me to go with her on her holiday in august but there is no reason why i should stop in riseborough i havent spoken to her yet but if i could say that you recommended harrogate im sure she would wish me to go indeed she would insist on my going she is often anxious about my gouty tendencies more anxious as i often tell her than she has any need to be but an aunt of hers had an attack which went to her heart quite unexpectedly and killed her poor thing i think indeed it would be a weight off amys mind if she knew i was going to take myself thoroughly in hand not tinker and peddle about with diet only so would you be able to recommend me to go to harrogate a course of harrogate wouldnt be bad for any of us who eat a good dinner every night said dr evans but i think that if you tried major ames got up waving all further discussion aside thats enough doctor he said if it would do me good i know amy would wish me to go you know what wives are now im pressed for time this morning and so i am sure are you by the way you neednt mention my plan till ive talked it over with amy but about lodgings now do you recommend lodgings or an hotel dr evans did not mention that his wife was not going to be with him this year for having obtained permission to say that harrogate would do him good major ames had developed a prodigious hurry and a few moments after was going jauntily home with the address of dr evans lodgings in his pocket he trusted to his own powers of exaggeration to remove all possible opposition on his wifes part and felt himself the devil of a diplomatist so his plan was arranged the third factor in this network of misconceived plots occurred the same morning mrs ames visiting the high street on account of an advanced melon met cousin millie on some similar errand to the butchers on account of advanced cutlets for the weather was trying it was natural that she announced her intention of remaining in riseborough with her family during august it was natural also that cousin millie signified the remission from harrogate cousin amy was cordial on the subject and returned home probably she would have mentioned this fact to her husband if he had given her time to do it but he was bursting with a more immediate communication i didnt like to tell you before amy he said because i didnt want to make you unnecessarily anxious and theres no need for anxiety now mrs ames was not very imaginative but it occurred to her that the newlyplanted magnolia had not been prospering no real cause for anxiety he said but the fact is that i went to see dr evans this morningdont be frightened my dearand got thoroughly overhauled by him thoroughly overhauled he said there was no reason for anxiety assured me of it but im gouty my dear theres no doubt of it and of course you remember about your poor aunt harriet well there it is and he says harrogate a bore of course but harrogate but no cause for anxiety he told me so twice mrs ames gave one moment to calm clear oysterlike reflection unhurried unalarmed there was no shadow of reason why she should tell him what mrs evans plans were but it was odd that she should suddenly decide to stop in riseborough instead of going to harrogate having heard from harry that the ames were to remain at home and lyndhurst as suddenly be impelled to go to harrogate instead of stopping in riseborough a curious coincidence everybody seemed to be making plans at any rate she would not add to their number but only acquiesce in those which were made my dear lyndhurst what an upset she said of course if you tell me there is no cause for anxiety i will not be anxious does dr evans recommend you to go to harrogate now you must tell me all he said they always go in august do they not that will be pleasant for you but i am afraid you will find the waters far from palatable major ames felt that he had not made a sufficiently important impression of course i told dr evans i could decide nothing till i had consulted you he said it seems a great breakup to leave you and harry here and go away like this it was that i was thinking of not whether waters a palatable or not i have more than half a mind not to go i daresay i shall worry through all right without again mrs ames made a little pause you must do as dr evans tells you to do she said i am sure he is not faddy or fussy major ames experience of him this morning fully endorsed this certainly he had been neither whatever the difference between the two might be well my dear if both you and dr evans are agreed he said i mustnt set myself up against you now did he tell you where to go he gave me the address of his own lodgings what a convenient arrangement now my dear i beg you to waste no time send off a telegram and pay the reply and well pack you off tomorrow i am sure it is the right thing to do a sudden conviction painfully real that he was behaving currishly descended on major ames the feeling was so entirely new to him that he would have liked to put it down to an obsession of gout in a new placethe conscience for instance for he could hardly believe that he should be selfaccused of paltry conduct he felt as if there must be some mistake about it he almost wished that amy had made difficulties then there would have been the compensatory idea that she was behaving badly too but she could not have conducted herself in a more guilelessly sympathetic manner she seemed to find no inherent improbability in dr evans having counselled harrogate no question as to the advisability of following his advice it was almost unpleasant to him to have things made so pleasant but then this salutary impression was effaced for anything that savoured of selfreproach could not long find harbourage in his mind instead he pictured himself at harrogate station welcoming the evans she would probably be looking rather tired and fragile after the journey but he would have a cab ready for her and tea would be awaiting them when they reached the lodgings chapter ix a week later mrs ames was sitting at breakfast with harry opposite her expecting the early post and among the gifts of the early post a letter from her husband he had written one very soon after his arrival at harrogate saying that he felt better already the waters as amy had conjectured could not be described as agreeable since their composition chiefly consisted of those particular ingredients which gave to rotten eggs their characteristic savour but what so said the valiant did a bad taste in the mouth matter if you knew it was doing you good an excellent band encouraged the swallowing of this disagreeable fluid and by lunchtime baths and drinking were over for the day he was looking forward to the evans arrival it would be pleasant to see somebody he knew he would write again before many days the post arrived there was a letter for her in the majors large sprawling handwriting and she opened it but it scarcely a letter a blister of expletives covered the smoking pages and the evanstwo of themhad arrived mrs ames little toadlike face seldom expressed much more than a ladylike composure but had harry been watching his mother he might have thought that a shade of amusement hovered there a letter from your father she said rather a worried letter the cure is lowering i believe and makes you feel out of sorts harry was looking rather yellow and dishevelled he had sat up very late the night before and the chase for rhymes had been peculiarly fatiguing and ineffectual i dont feel at all well either he said and i dont think cousin millie is well why asked mrs ames composedly i went to see her yesterday and she didnt attend she seemed frightfully surprised to hear that father had gone to harrogate i suppose dr evans had not told her remarked mrs ames please telephone to her after breakfast harry and ask her to dine with us this evening yes how curious women are one day they seem so glad to see you another you are no more to them than foam on a broken wave this was one of the fragments of last night on a broken what asked mrs ames the rustling of the turning leaf of the morning post had caused her not to hear there was no sarcastic intention in her inquiry it does not matter said harry his mother looked up at him i should take a little dose dear she said if you feel like that the heat upsets us all at times will you please telephone now harry then i shall know what to order for dinner mrs ames nature was undeniably a simple one she had no misty profundities or curious dimlit clefts on the round smooth surface of her life but on occasion simple natures are capable of curious complexities of feeling the more elusive because they themselves are unable to register exactly what they do feel certainly she saw a connection between the nonarrival of dear millie at harrogate and the inflamed letter from her husband she had suspected also a connection between dear millies decision to spend august at riseborough and her belief that major ames was going to do so too but the completeness of the fiasco sucked the sting out of the resentment she might otherwise have felt it was impossible to be angry with such sorry conspirators at the same time with regard to her husband she felt the liveliest internal satisfaction at his blistering communication and read it through again the thought of her own slighted or rather unperceived rejuvenescence added point to this she felt that he had been served out not for a moment did she suspect him of anything but the most innocent of flirtations and she was disposed to credit dear millie with having provoked such flirtation as there was by this time also it must have been quite clear to both the thwarted parties that she was in full cognizance of their futile designs clearly therefore her own beau rle was to appear utterly unconscious of it all and unconsciously to administer nasty little jabs to each of them with a smiling face they have been making sillies of themselves expressed her indulgent verdict on the whole affair then in some strange feminine way she felt a sort of secret pride in her husband for having had the manhood to flirt however mildly with somebody elses wife but immediately there followed the resentment that he had not shown any tendency to flirt with his own when she had encouraged him but anyhow he had chosen the prettiest woman in riseborough and he was the handsomest man but her mood changed the thought at any rate of administering some nasty little jabs presented itself in a growingly attractive light the two sillies had been wanting to dance to their own tune they should dance to hers instead and by way of striking up her own tune at once she wrote as follows to her husband my dearest lyndhurst i cant tell you how glad i was to get your two letters and to know how much good harrogate is doing you what an excellent thing that you went to dr evans please remember me to him and that he insisted so strongly on your taking yourself thoroughly in hand she paused a moment wondering exactly how strong this insistence had been it was possible that it was not very strong so much the more reason for letting the sentence stand she now underlined the words so strongly of course the waters are disgusting to take and i declare i can almost smell them when i read your vivid description but as you said in your first letter what is a bad taste in the mouth when you know it is doing you good and your second letter convinces me how right you were to go and when things like gout begin to come out it naturally makes you feel a little low and worried i want you to stop there the whole of august and get thoroughly rid of it here we are getting along very happily and i am so glad i did not go to the sea millie is here as you will know and we see a great deal of her she is constantly dropping in en fille i suppose you would call it and is in excellent spirits and looks so pretty but i am not quite at ease about harry this is private he is very much attracted by her and she seems to me not very wise in the way she deals with him for she seems to be encouraging him in his silliness perhaps i will speak to her about it and yet i hardly like to again mrs ames paused she had no idea she had such a brilliant touch in the administration of these jabs what she said might not be strictly accurate but it was full of point i remember too what you said that it was so good for a boy to be taken up with a thoroughly nice woman and that it prevented his getting into mischief i am sure harry is writing all sorts of poems to her because he sighs a great deal and has a most inky forefinger for which i give him pumicestone but if she were not so nice a woman and so far from anything like flirtatiousness i should feel myself obliged to speak to harry and warn him she seems very happy and cheerful i daresay she feels like me and is rejoiced to think that harrogate is doing her husband good write to me soon again my dear and give me another excellent account of yourself was it not queer that you settled to go to harrogate just when millie settled not to if you were not such good friends one would think you wanted to avoid each other well i must stop millie is dining with us and i must order dinner she read through what she had written with considerable content that will be nastier than the harrogate waters she thought to herself and quite as good for him and then with a certain largeness which lurked behind all her littlenesses she practically dismissed the whole silly business from her mind but she continued the use of the purely natural means for restoring the colour of the hair and tapped and dabbed the corners of her eyes with the miraculous skinfood that was a prophylactic measure she did not want to appear a fright when lyndhurst came back from harrogate mrs ames was well aware that the famous fancy dress ball had caused her a certain loss of prestige in her capacity of queen of society in riseborough it had followed close on the heels of her innovation of asking husbands and wives separately to dinner and had somewhat taken the shine out of her achievement and indeed this latter had not been as epochmaking as she had expected for the last week or two she had felt that something new was required of her but as is often the case she found that the recognition of such a truth does not necessarily lead to the discovery of the novelty perhaps the paltriness of lyndhursts conduct leading to reflections on her own superior wisdom put her on the path for about this time she began to take a renewed interest in the suffragette movement which from what she saw in the papers was productive of such adventurous alarums in london for herself she was essentially lawabiding by nature and though in opposition to lyndhurst sympathetically inclined to women who wanted the vote she had once said that to throw stones at prime ministers was unladylike in itself and only drew on the perpetrators the attention of the police to themselves rather than the attention of the public to the problem but a recrudescence of similar acts during the last summer had caused her to wonder whether she had said quite the last word on the subject or thought the last thought certainly the sensational interest in such violent acts had led her to marvel at the strength of feeling that prompted them ladies apparently whose breedingalways a word of potency with mrs amesshe could not question were behaving like hooligans the matter interested her in itself apart from its possible value as a novelty for the autumn also an election was probably to take place in november hitherto that section of riseborough in which she lived had not suffered its tranquillity to be interrupted by political excitements but like a man in his sleep drowsily approved a conservative member but what if she took the lead in some political agitation and what if she introduced a suffragette element into the election that was a solider affair than that a quantity of cleopatras should skip about in a back garden she had always felt a certain interest in the movement but it was the desire to make a novelty for the autumn peppered so to speak by an impatience at the futile treachery of her husbands harrogate plans and an ambition to take a line of her own in opposition to him presented their crusade in a serious light to her the militant crusaders she had hitherto regarded as affected by a strange lunacy and her husbands masculine comment they ought to be well smacked by jove had the ring of commonsense especially since he added for the benefit of such crusaders as were of higher social rank theyre probably mad poor things but during this tranquil month of august her more serious interest was aroused and she bought though furtively such literature in the form of little tracts and addresses as was accessible on the subject and slowly though still the desire for an autumn novelty that would eclipse the memory of the congregations of cleopatras was a moving force in her mind something of the real ferment began to be yeasty within her and she learned by private inquiry what the suffragette colours were naturally the introduction of an abstract idea into her mind was a laborious process since her life had for years consisted of an endless chain of small concrete events and had been lived among people who had never seen an abstract idea wild any more than they had seen an elephant in a real jungle it was always tamed and eating buns as in the zoo just as other ideas reached them peptonized by the columns of daily papers but a wild thing lurked behind the obedient trunk a wild thing lurked behind the reports of ludicrous performances in the palace yard at westminster august was still sultry and major ames was still at harrogate when one evening she and harry dined with millie since nothing of any description happened in riseborough during this deserted month the introductory discussion of what events had occurred since they last met in the high street that morning was not possible of great expansion none of them had seen the aeroplane which was believed to have passed over the town in the afternoon and nobody had heard from mrs altham then mrs ames fired the shot which was destined to involve riseborough in smoke and brimstone lyndhurst and i she said have never agreed about the suffragettes and now that i know something about them i disagree more than ever millie looked slightly shocked she thought of suffragettes as she thought of the persons who figure in police news indeed they often did she knew they wanted to vote about something but that was practically all she knew except that they expressed their desire to vote by hitting people i know nothing about them she said but are they not very unladylike they are a disgrace to their sex said harry we soon made them get out of cambridge they tried to hold a meeting in the backs but i and a few others went down there andwell there wasnt much more heard of them i dont call them women at all i call them females mrs ames had excellent reasons for suspecting romance in her sons account of his exploits tell me exactly what happened in the backs at cambridge harry she said harry slightly retracted there is nothing much to tell he said our club felt bound to make a protest and we went down there as i said it seemed to cow them a bit and then did the proctors come and cow you asked his inexorable mother i believe a proctor did come i did not wait for that they made a perfect fiasco anyhow they told me it was all a dead failure and we heard no more about it so that was all said mrs ames and quite enough i agree with father they disgrace their sex my dear you know as little about it as your father she said but surely a mans judgment said millie making weak eyes at harry dear millie a mans judgment is not of any value if he does not know anything about what he is judging we have all read accounts in the papers and heard that they are very violent and chain themselves up to inconvenient places like railings and are taken away by policemen sometimes they slap the policemen but surely there must be something behind that makes them like that i am finding out what it is it is all most interesting they say that they have to pay their rates and taxes but get no privileges if a man pays rates and taxes he gets a vote and why shouldnt a woman it is all very well expressed they seem to me to reason just as well as a man i mean to find out much more about it all personally i dont pay rates and taxes because that is lyndhursts affair but if we had arranged differently and i paid for the house and the rates and taxes why shouldnt i have a vote instead of him and from what i can learn the gardener has a vote just the same as lyndhurst although lyndhurst does all the gardenrolling and wont let parkins touch the flowers mrs evans sighed it all seems very confused and upside down she said do smoke harry if you feel inclined will you have a cigarette cousin amy i am afraid i have none i never smoke harry was a little sore from his mothers handling and was not unwilling to hit back i never knew mother smoked he said do you smoke mother how delightful how eastern i never knew you were eastern i always thought you said it was not wicked for women to smoke but only horrid do be horrid i am sure suffragettes smoke mrs ames turned a swift appealing eye on millie entreating confidence then she lied dear millie what are you thinking of she said of course i never smoke harry but the appeal of the eyes had not taken effect but on the night of my little dance cousin amy she said surely you had a cigarette it made you cough and you said how nice it was mrs ames wished she had not been so ruthless about the suffragettes at cambridge there is a great difference between doing a thing once she said and making a habit of it i think i did want to see what it was like but i never said it was nice and as for its being eastern i am sure i am glad to belong to the west i always thought it unfeminine and then i knew it i did not feel myself again till i had brushed my teeth and rinsed my mouth now dear millie i am really interested in the suffragettes their demands are reasonable and if we are unreasonable about granting them they must be unreasonable too for years they have been reasonable and nobody has paid any attention to them what are they to do but be violent and call attention to themselves it is all so well expressed you cannot fail to be interested wilfred would never let me hit a policeman said milly and i dont think i could do it even if he wanted me to but it is not the aim of the movement to hit policemen said mrs ames they are very sorry to have to they are sorrier afterwards said harry mrs ames turned a small withering eye upon her offspring if you had waited to hear what they had to say instead of running away before the proctor came she said you might have learnt a little about them dear they are not at all sorry afterwards they go to prison quite cheerfully in the second division too which is terribly uncomfortable and many of them have been brought up as luxuriously as any of us i could not go to prison said mrs evans faintly but firmly and even if i could it would be very wrong of me for i am sure it would injure wilfreds practice people would not like to go to a doctor whose wife had been in prison she might have caught something and elsie would be so ashamed of me mrs ames gave the suppressed kind of sigh which was habitual with her when lyndhurst complained that the water for his bath was not hot although aware that the kitchen boiler was being cleaned but you need not go to prison in order to be a suffragette dear millie she said prison life is not one of the objects of the movement mrs evans looked timidly apologetic i didnt know she said it is so interesting to be told i thought all the brave sort went to prison and had breakfast together when they were let out i am sure i have read about their having breakfast together a faint smile quivered on her mouth she was aware that cousin amy thought her very stupid and there was a delicate pleasure in appearing quite idiotic like this it made cousin amy dance with irritation in her inside and explain more carefully yet yes dear millie she said but their having breakfast together has not much to do with their objects i dont know about that said harry there is a club at cambridge to which i belong whose object is to dine together then it is very greedy of you dear said mrs ames and the suffragettes are not like that they go to prison and do all sorts of unladylike things for the sake of their convictions they want to be treated justly for years they have asked for justice and nobody has paid the least attention to them now they are making people attend i assure you that until i began reading about them i had very little sympathy with them but now i feel that all women ought to know about them certainly what i have read has opened my eyes very much and there are a quantity of women of very good family indeed who belong to them harry pulled his handkerchief out of the sleeve of his dresscoat he habitually kept it there just now the omar khayyam club was rather great on class distinctions i do not see what that matters he said because a mans greatgrandmother was created a duchess for being a kings mistress mrs evans and mrs ames got up simultaneously if anything mrs ames got up a shade first i do not think we need go into that harry said mrs ames millie tempered the wind will you join us soon harry she said if you are too long i shall come and fetch you we have been political tonight will it be too cold for you in the garden cousin amy left to himself harry devoted several minutes pitiful reflection to his mothers state of mind in spite of her awakened interest in the suffragette movement she seemed to him deplorably oldfashioned but with his second glass of port his thoughts assumed a rosier tone and he determined to wait till cousin millie came to fetch him surely she meant him to do that no doubt she wanted to have just one private word with him she had often caught his eye during dinner with a deprecating look as if to say this tiresome rigmarole about suffragettes was not her fault he felt they understood each other there was a large chippendale lookingglass above the sideboard and he got up from the table and observed the upper part of his person which was reflected in it a wisp of hair fell over his forehead it might more rightly be called a plume he appeared to himself to have a most interesting face uncommon arresting he was interestingly and characteristically dressed too with a collar byronically low a soft frilled shirt and in place of a waistcoat a black cummerbund then hastily he mounted on a chair in order to see the whole of his lean figure that seemed so slender it was annoying that at this moment of critical appreciation a parlourmaid should look in to see if she could clear away there is nothing that so confirms individualism in any character as periods of comparative solitude in men such confirmation is liable to be checked by the boredom to which their sex is subject but women less frequently the prey of this paralysing emotion when the demands made upon them by household duties and domestic companionship are removed enter very swiftly into the kingdoms of themselves this process was very strongly at work just now with millie evans superficially her composure and meaningless smoothness were unaltered so that mrs ames at any rate almost wondered whether she had been right in crediting her with any hand in the harrogate plans so unruffled was her insipid and deferential cordiality but down below she was exploring herself and discovering a capacity for feeling that astonished her by its intensity all her life she had been content to arouse emotion without sharing it liking to see men attentive to her liking to see them attracted by her and disposed towards tenderness they were more interesting like that and she gently basked in the warmth of their glow like a lizard on the wall she had not wanted more than that she was lizard not vampire and to sun herself on the wall and then glide gently into a crevice again seemed quite sufficient exercise for her emotions luckily or unluckily those who hold that calm and complete respectability is the aim of existence would prefer the former adverb those who think that development of individuality is worth the risk of a little scorching the latter she had married a man who required little or nothing more than she was disposed to give he had not expected unquiet rapture but a comfortable home with a little woman always there goodtempered as millie was and cheerful and pliable as with a dozen exceptions when the calm precision came into play she had always been temperamentally he was nearly as undeveloped as she and the marriage had been what is called a very sensible one but such sensible marriages ignore the fact that human beings like the shores of the bay of naples are periodically volcanic and the settlers there assume that their little property because no sulphurous signs have appeared on the surface is essentially quiescent neglecting the fact that at one time or another emotional disturbances are to be expected but because many quiet years have passed undisturbed they get to believe that the human and natural fires have ceased to smoulder and are no longer alive down below the roots of their pleasant vines and olive trees all her life up till now millie evans had been like one of these quiescent estates now when middleage was upon her she began to feel the stir of vital forces the surface of her life was still undisturbed she went about the diminished business of the household with her usual care and in the weeks of this solitary august knitted a couple of ties for her husband and read a couple of novels from the circulating library with an interest not more markedly tepid than usual but subterranean stir was going on though no firebreathing clefts appeared on the surface subconsciously she wove images and dreams scarcely yet knowing that it is out of such dreams that the events and deeds of life inevitably spring she had scarcely admitted even to herself that her projects for august had gone crookedly the conviction that lyndhurst ames had found himself gouty and in need of harrogate punctually at the date when he knew that she might be expected there sufficiently straightened them the intention more than compensated the miscarriage of events tonight when her two guests had gone the inevitable step happened her unchecked impulses grew stronger and more definite and out of the misty subconsciousness of her mind the disturbance flared upwards into the light of her everyday consciousness with genuine flame it mounted it was no solitary imagining of her own that had kindled it he she knew was a conscious partner and she had as sign the memory that he had kissed her somehow deep in her awakening heart that meant something stupendous to her it had been unrealized at the time but it had been like the touch of some corrosive sweet and acid burrowing down eating her and yet feeding her up till now it seemed to have signified little now it invested itself with a tremendous significance probably to him it meant little men did such things easily but it was that which had burrowed within her making so insignificant an entry but penetrating so far it was not a proof that he loved her but it had become a token that she loved him otherwise it could not have happened there was something final in the beginning of it all then he had kissed her a second time on the night of the fancy dress ball he had called that a cousinly kiss and she smiled at the thought of that for it showed that it required to be accounted for excused she felt a sort of tenderness for that fluttering brokenwinged subterfuge so transparent so undeceptive if cousins kissed they did not recollect their relationship afterwards especially if there was no relationship he had not kissed her because she was some sort of cousin to his wife yet it hardly stating the case correctly to say that he had kissed her doubtless on that first occasion below the mulberrytree it was his head that had bent down to hers while she but remained passive waiting but it was she who had made him do it and she gloried in the soft compulsion she had put on him even as she thought of it this evening her eye sparkled he could not help it she said to herself he could not help it out of the sequestered cloistral twilight of her soul there had stepped something that had slumbered there all her life something pagan something incapable of scruples or regrets as void of morals as a nymph or bacchanal on a greek frieze it did not trouble so it seemed to challenge or defy the traditions and principles in which she had lived all these years it appeared to be ignorant of their existence or at the most they were but shadows that lay in unsubstantial bars across a sunlit pavement at present it stood there trembling and quiescent like a moth lately broken out from its sheathed chrysalis but momently now that it had come forth it would grow stronger and its crumpled wings expand into pinions feathered with silver and gold but she made no plans she scarcely even turned her eyes towards the future for the future would surely be as inevitable as the past had been one by one the hot august days dropped off like the petals of peach blossom which must fall before the fruit begins to swell she neither wanted to delay or hurry their withering there were but few days left few petals left to fall for within a week so her husband had written he would be back vastly better for his cure and major ames was coming with him i shall be so glad to see my little woman again he had said elsie and i have missed her occasionally she tried to think about her husband but she could not concentrate her mind on him she was too much accustomed to him to be able to fix her thoughts on him emotionally she was equally well accustomed to elsie or rather equally well accustomed to her complete ignorance about elsie she could no more have drawn a chart of the girls mind than she could have drawn a picture of the branches of the mulberrytree under which she so often sat beholding the interlacement of its boughs but never really seeing them never had she known the psychical bond of motherhood even the physical had meant little to her she was elsies mother by accident so to speak and she was but as a tree from which a gardener has made a cutting planting it near so that sapling and parent stem grow up in sight of each other but quite independently without sense of their original unity even when her baby had lain at her breast helpless and still deriving all from her the sweet intimate mystery of the life that was common to them both had been but a whispered riddle to her and that was long ago its memory had become a faded photograph that might really have represented not herself and her baby but any mother and child it was very possible that before long elsie would be transplanted by marriage and she herself would have to learn a little more about chess in order to play with her husband in the evening such hitherto had been her emotional life this summary of it and its meagre total is all that can justly be put to credit she liked her husband she knew he was kind to her and so in its inanimate manner was the food which she ate kind to her in that it nourished and supported her but her gratitude to it was untinged with emotion she was not sentimental over her breakfast for it was the mission of food to give support and the mission of her husband had not been to her much more than that neither wifehood nor motherhood had awakened her womanhood yet in that she was a woman she was that most dangerous of all created or manufactured things an unexploded shell liable to blow to bits both itself and any who handled her the shell was alive still its case uncorroded and its contents still potentially violent that violence at present lay dark and quiet within it its sheath was smooth and faintly bright it seemed but a plaything a parlourornament it could stand on any table in any drawingroom but the heart of it had never been penetrated by the love that could transform its violence into strength now its cap was screwed and its fuse fixed until the damp and decay of age robbed it of its power it would always be liable to wreck itself and its surroundings these same days that for her were kindling dangerous stuff passed for mrs ames in a crescendo of awakening interest all her life she had been wrapped round like the kernel of a nut in the hard dry husk of conventionalities her life had been encased in a succession of minute happenings and literally speaking she had never breathed the outer air of ideas as has been noticed she gave regular patronage to st barnabas church and spent a solid hour or two every week in decorating it with the produce of her husbands garden from earliest spring when the faint shy snowdrops were available to late autumn when october and november frosts finally blackened the salvias and chrysanthemums but all that had been of the nature of routine a certain admiration for the vicar a passionless appreciation of his nobly ascetic life his strong lean face and the fire of his utterances had made her attendance regular and her contributions to his charities quite creditably profuse in proportion to her not very ample means but she had never denied herself anything in order to increase them while the time she spent over the flowers was amply compensated for when she saw the eclipse they made of mrs brooks embroideries or when the lilies dropped their orangestaining pollen on to the altarcloth stranger perhaps from the emotional point of view had been her recently attempted rejuvenescence but even that had been a calculated and materialistic effort it had not been a manifestation of her love for her husband or of a desire to awaken his love for her it was merely a decorative effort to attract his attention and prevent it wandering elsewhere but now with her kindled sympathy for the suffragette movement there was springing up in her the consciousness of a kinship with her sex whom hitherto she had regarded as a set of people to whom in the matter of dinnergiving and entirely correct social behaviour she must be an example and a law while even her hospitalities had not been dictated by the spirit of hospitality but rather by a sort of pompous and genteel competition now she was beginning to see that behind the mere events of life if they were to be worth anything must lie an idea and here behind this womans crusade with all its hooliganism its hysteria its apish fanaticism lay an idea of justice and sisterhood they seemed simple words and she would have said offhand that she knew what they meant but as she began faintly to understand them she knew that she had been as ignorant of them as of what australia really was to her as it was a geographical expression only so justice was an abstract expression but the meaning of justice was known to those who gave up the comforts and amenities of life for its sake and for its sake cheerfully suffered ridicule and prison life and misunderstanding and the fumes of an idea to one who had practically never tasted one intoxicated her as new wine mounts to the head of a teetotaler ideas are dangerous things and should be kept behind a fireguard for fear that the children of whom this world largely consists should burn their fingers thinking that these bright sparkling toys are to be played with mrs ames in spite of her unfamiliarity with them did not fall into this error she realized that if she was to warm herself to get the glow of the fire in her cramped and frozen limbs she must treat it with respect and learn to handle it that at any rate was her intention and she had a certain capacity for thoroughness it was in the last week of august that major ames was expected back after three weeks of treatment at first as reflected in his letters his experiences had been horrifying the waters nauseated him and the irritating miscarriage of the plan which was the real reason for his going to harrogate caused him fits of feeble rage which were the more maddening because they had to be borne secretly and silently also the lodgings he had procured seemed to him needlessly expensive and all this efflux of bullion was being poured out on treatment which dr evans had told him was really quite unnecessary regular and sparkling letters from his wife in praise of august spent at riseborough continued to arrive and filled him with impotent envy he too might be spending august at riseborough if he had not been quite so precipitate as it was his mornings were spent in absorbing horrible draughts and gently stewing in the fetid waters of the starbeck spring his meals were plain to the point of grotesqueness his evenings were spent in playing inane games of patience while elsie and the doctor pored silently over their chessboard saying check to each other at intervals but through the days and their tedious uniformity there ran a certain unquietness and desire it was clear that millie no less than he had planned that they should be together in august but his desire did not absorb him rather it made him restless and anxious about the future he did not even know if he was in love with her he did not even know if he wanted to be the thought of her kindled his imagination and he could picture himself in love with her at the same time he was not certain whether if the last two months could be lived over again he would let himself drift into the position where he now found himself there was neither ardour nor anything imperative in his heart something it is true was heated but it only smouldered and smoked it was of the nature of such fire as bursts out in haystacks it was born of stuffiness and packed confinement and was as different as two things of the same nature can be from the swift lambency and laudable flame of sunkindled and breezefed flame it disquieted and upset him he could not soberly believe in the pictures his imagination drew of his being irresistibly in love with her their colour quickly faded their outlines were wavering and uncertain and the background was even more difficult to fill in how was the composition to be arranged where would amy stand what aspect would riseborough wear and then after a long silence elsie said check major ames was due to arrive at riseborough soon after four in the afternoon and mrs ames was at pains to be at home by that hour to welcome him and give him tea and had persuaded harry to go up to the station to meet him she had gathered a charming decoration of flowers to make the room bright and had put a couple more vases of them in his dressingroom before long a cab arrived from the station bearing his luggage but neither he nor harry occupied it so it was natural to conclude that they were walking down and she made tea since they would not be many minutes behind the leisurely fourwheeler she wanted very particularly to give him an auspicious and comfortable return he must not think that because this suffragette movement occupied her thoughts so much she was going to become remiss in care for him but still the minutes went on and she took a cup of tea herself and found it already growing astringent what could have detained him she could not guess but certainly he should have another brew of tea made for him for he hated what in moments of irritation he called tincture of tannin five oclock struck and the two quarters that duly followed it before that a conjecture had formed itself in her mind then came the rattle of his deposited hat and stick in the hall and the rattle of the doorhandle for his entry well amy he said and heres your returned prodigal train late as usual and i walked down how are you she got up and kissed him very well indeed lyndhurst she said and there is no need to ask you how you are she paused a moment your luggage arrived nearly an hour ago she said he had forgotten that detail an hour ago surely not he said she gave him one more pause in which he could say more but nothing came you have had tea i suppose she said yes evans insisted on my dropping in to his house and taking a cup there that rogue harry has stopped on well well we were all young once you remember the old story i told you about the colonels wife when i was a lad she remembered it perfectly she felt sure also that he had not meant to tell her where he had been since his arrival at the station chapter x the day was of early october and dr evans who was driving his swift steady cob harnessed to the light dogcart along the flat road towards norton had leisure to observe the beauty of the flaming season he had but a couple of visits to make and neither of the cases caused him any professional anxiety but it was with conscious effort that he commanded his obedient mind to cease worrying and drink in the beneficent influence of this genial morning that followed on a night that had given them the first frost of the year the road after leaving riseborough ran through a couple of level miles of delectable woodland ditches filled and choked with the fullgrown grass and herbage of the summer bordered it on each side on the left the sun had turned the frozen nightdews into a liquid heraldry on the right where the roadside foliage was still in shadow the faceted jewels of the frost that hinted of the coming winter still stiffened the herbage and was white on the grey beards of the sprawling clematis in the hedges but high above these lowgrowing tangles of vegetation an ample glory flamed and the great beech forest was all ablaze with orange and red flame tremulous in the breeze here and there a yewtree tawnytrunked and greenvelveted with undeciduous leaf seemed like a black spot of unconsumed fuel in the fire of the autumn here a company of sturdy oaks seemed like a group of squareshouldered young men amid the maidens of the woodland it had its fairies too the sylphlike birches whose little leaves seemed shed about their white shapeliness like a shower of confetti then in the more open glades short and rabbitcropped turf sparkled emeraldlike amid the sober greys and browns of the withering heather and the russet antlers of the bracken now and then a rabbit with white scutt giving a dotanddash signal of danger to his family would scamper into shelter at the rattle of the approaching dogcart now and then a pheasant whose plumage seemed to reproduce in metal the tints of the golden autumn strode with lowered head and tail away from the dangerous vicinity of man below the beeches the ground was uncarpeted by any vegetation but already the fallen glories of the leaf were beginning to lie there and occasionally a squirrel ran rustling across them and having gained the security of his lofty ways among the trees scolded pucklike at the interruption that had made him leave his breakfast of the burst beechnuts to the right below the highswung level road the ground declined sharply and gave glimpses of the distant sunburnished sea above small companies of feathery clouds assembled together as if migrating for the winter fluttered against the summer azure of the sky dr evans alert and merry eye dwelt on those delectable things and in obedience to his brain noted and appreciated the manifold festivity of the morning but it did so not as ordinarily by instinct and eager impulses but because he consciously bade it it needed the spur its alertness and its merriness were pressed on it and by degrees the spur failed to stimulate it and he fell to regarding the wellgroomed quarters of his longstepping cob which usually afforded him so pleasant a contemplation of strong and harmonious muscularity but this morning even they failed to delight him and the rhythm of its firm trot made no music in his mind there came a crease which deepened into a decided frown between his eyes and he communed with the trouble in his mind there were various lesser worries not of sufficient importance to disturb seriously the equanimity of a busy and wellbalanced man and though each was trivial enough in itself and distinctly had a humorous side to a mind otherwise content the cumulative effect of them was not amusing in the first place there was the affair of harry ames who in a manner sufficiently ludicrous and calfish had been making love to his wife as any other sensible man would have done wilfred evans had seen almost immediately on his return to riseborough that harry was disposed to make himself ridiculous and had given a word of kindly warning to his wife snub him a bit little woman he had said were having a little too much of him its fairer on the boy too youre too kind to him a woman like you so easily turns a boys head and youve often said he is rather a dreadful sort of youth but for some reason she took the words in ill part becoming rather precise i dont know what you mean she said will you explain please easy enough my dear hes here too much hes dangling after you laugh at him a little or yawn a little you mean that hes in love with me well thats too big a word little woman though im sure you see what i mean i think i do i think your suggestion is rather coarse wilfred and quite illfounded is every one who is polite and attentive supposed to be in love with me i only ask for information i think your own good sense will supply you with all necessary information he said but her good sense apparently had done nothing of the kind and eventually dr evans had spoken to harrys father on the subject the visits had ceased with amazing abruptness after that and dr evans had found himself treated to a stare of blank unrecognition when he passed harry in the street and a curl of the lip which he felt must have been practised in private but the omar khayyam club would be the gainers for they owed to it those stricken and embittered stanzas called parted here comedy verged on farce but the farce did not amuse him he knew that his own interpretation of harrys assiduous presence was correct so why should his wife have so precisely denied that those absurd attentions meant nothing there was nothing to resent in the sensible warning that a man was greatly attracted by her nor was there warrant for colonel ames horror and dismay at the suggestion when the doctor spoke to him about it infamous young libertine was surely a hyperbolical expression dr evans unconsciously flicked the cob rather sharply with his whiplash to that excellent animals surprise for he was covering his miles in five minutes apiece and the doctor conveyed his apologies for his unintentional hint with a soothing remark then his thoughts drifted back again that was not all the trouble with the ames family for his wife had had a quarrel with mrs ames this kindly man hated to quarrel with anybody and for his part successfully refused to do so and that his wife should find herself in such a predicament was equally distressing to him no doubt it was all a storm in a teacup but if you happen to be living in the teacup too a storm there is just as upsetting as a gale on the high seas it is worse indeed for on the high seas a ship can run into fairer weather but there is no escape from these teacup disturbances the entire teacup was involved all riseborough which a year ago had seemed to him so suitable a place in which to pursue an unexacting practice to conduct mild original work in the peace and quiet of a small society and domestic comfort was become a tempest of conflicting winds and all arising from such a pack of nonsense as the doctor thought impatiently to himself only just checking the whiplash from falling again on the industrious cob the interest of mrs ames in the suffragette movement had given rise to all this she had announced a drawingroom meeting to be held in her house now a fortnight ago and the drawingroom meeting had exploded in midcareer like a squib scattering sparks and combustible material over all riseborough it appeared that mrs ames finding that the comprehension of suffragette aims extended to the middleclass circles in riseborough had asked the wives and daughters of tradesmen to take part in it it wanted but little after that to make mrs altham remark quite audibly that she had not known that she was to have the privilege of meeting so many ladies with whom she was not previously acquainted and the sarcastic intention of her words was not lost upon her new friends tea seemed but to increase the initial inflammation and the interest mrs ames had intended to awake on the subject of votes for women was changed into an interest in ascertaining who could be most offensively polite a very pretty game it is not to be wondered at that before twentyfour hours had passed mrs altham had started an antisuffragette league and millie still strong in the conviction that under no circumstances could she go to prison had allowed herself to be drawn into it next night at dinner she softly made a terrible announcement i passed cousin amy in the street just now she said she did not seem to see me perhaps she didnt see you little woman said her husband so i did not seem to see her added millie who had not finished her sentence but if she cares to come to see me and explain i shall behave quite as usual to her come come little woman said dr evans in a conciliating spirit and i do not see what is the good of saying come come she said with considerable precision all this was sufficient to cause very sensible disquiet to a man who attached so proper an importance to peaceful and harmonious conditions of life yet it was but a small thing compared to a far deeper anxiety that brooded over him till now he had not let himself directly contemplate it but today as he returned from his two visits he made himself face this last secret trouble he felt it was necessary for him to ascertain for the sake of others no less than himself what part if any of his disquiet was grounded on certainty what part if any might be the figment of an overanxious imagination but he knew he was not anxious by temperament nor given to imagine troubles if anything he was more prone in his desire for a pleasant and studious life to shut his eyes to the apparent approach of storm trusting that it would blow by he was anxious about millie not without cause a hundred symptoms justified his anxiety she who for so long had been of such imperturbable serenity of temper that a man who did not feel her charm might have called her jellyfish was the prey of fifty moods a day she had strange little fits of tenderness to him with squalls of peevishness quite as strange she was restless and filled with an energy that flamed and flickered and vanished leaving her indolent and inert she would settle herself for a morning of letter writing and after tearing up a couple of notes put on her gardening gloves and get as far as the herbaceous bed then she would find an imperative reason for going into the town and so sit down at her piano to practise her appetite usually of the steady reliable order failed her and she passed broken and tossing nights had she been a girl he would have said those symptoms all pointed one way and it would probably not have been difficult to guess who was the young man in question yet he could scarcely face the conclusion applied to his wife it was a hideous thing that a husband should harbour such a suspicion more hideous that the husband should be himself and perhaps more hideous of all that he should guessagain without difficultywho was the man in question he had no conception what to do or whether to do nothing it seemed that action and inaction might alike end in disaster and again the whole of his explanation of millies symptoms might be erroneous there might be other explanationsindeed there were others possible as to that time would show at present the best course perhaps the only right course was to be watchful yet not suspicious observant not prying rather than pry or be suspicious he would go to millie herself and without reservation tell her all that had been in his mind he was well aware what the heroic attitude the attitude of the virile impetuous englishman dear to melodrama would have been it was quite easy for him to tax major ames with baseness to grind his teeth at his wife and then burst into manly tears each sob of which seemed to rend him but to his quiet sensible nature it seemed difficult to see what was supposed to happen next in melodrama the curtain went down and you started ten years later in queensland with regenerated natures distributed broadcast but in actual life it was impossible to start again ten years later or ten minutes later you had to go on all the time willingly would he on this divine october morning have started again indefinitely later the difficulty was how to go on now his cases had not long detained him and it was still not long after noon when the cob still pleased and alert with motion but with smoking flanks drew up at his door the clear chill of the morning had altogether passed and the air in the basin or teacup of a town was still and sultry there was a familiar hat on the table in the hall a bunch of longstemmed tawny chrysanthemums lay by it and at that sight some distant echo of barbaric and simple man deplorable to the smoothness of civilization and altogether obsolete was resonant in him he pitched the chrysanthemums into the street where they flew like a shooting star close by the head of general fortescue who was tottering down to the club and slammed the door it was melodramatic and foolish enough but the desire that prompted it was quite sincere and irresistible and if at the moment major ames had been in that cool oakpanelled hall there is little doubt that dr evans would have done his best to pitch him out after his flowers the doctor gave himself a moment to recover from his superficial violence and then went out into the garden they were sitting together on the bench under the mulberrytree and major ames got up with his usual briskness as he approached somehow dr evans felt as if he was being welcomed and made to feel at home good morning said major ames glorious day isnt it i just stepped over with a handful of flowers and weve been having a bit of a chat a bit of a chat cousin lyndhurst has very kindly come to talk over all these little disturbances said millie she looked at him shall i explain she asked dr evans took the seat that major ames had vacated leaving him free to sit down in a garden chair opposite or to stand just as he pleased it is like this wilfred she said cousin amy did not like my joining the antisuffragette league which mrs altham started and i have told lyndhurst that i did not care a straw one way or the other except that i could not go to prison to please cousin amy or any one else but it looked like taking sides she thought so lyndhurst thought it would make everything easy if i didnt join any league at all i think it very clever and tactful of him to think of that and i will certainly tell mrs altham i find i am too busy of course there is no quarrel between cousin amy and me and lyndhurst wants to assure us that he isnt mixed up in it though there isnt anyand of course if cousin amy didnt see me the other day when i thought she pretended not to it makes a difference millie delivered herself of these lucid statements with her usual deferential air i think it is very kind of cousin lyndhurst to take so much trouble she added he is stopping to lunch major ames made a noble little gesture that disclaimed any credit its nothing a mere nothing he said quite truly but im sure you hate little domestic jars as much as i do as amy once said my profession was to be a man of war but my instinct was to be a man of peace ha ha im only delighted my little olive branch hashas met with success he added rather feebly being unable to think of any botanical metaphor the doctor got up it is to be feared that in his present state of mind he felt not the smallest admiration or gratitude for the work of lyndhurst the peacemaker but only saw in it a purely personal desire to secure an uninterrupted va et vient between the two houses im sure i havent the slightest intention of quarrelling with anybody he said it seems to me the most deplorable waste of time and energy besides being very uncomfortable let us go in to lunch millie i have to go out again at two oclock millie wrote an amiable and insincere little note to mrs altham which major ames undertook to deliver on his way home explaining how since elsie had gone to dresden to perfect herself in the german language she herself had become so busy that she did not know which way to turn besides missing elsie very much she felt therefore that since she would not be able to give as much time as she wished to this very interesting antisuffragette movement it would be better not to give to it any time at all this she wrote directly after her husband had gone out again and brought to major ames who was waiting for it he too had said he would have to be off at once she gave him the note there it is she said and so many thanks for leaving it but you are not hurrying away at once are you am i not keeping you in he asked she pulled down the lace blinds over the window that looked into the street the october sun it is true beat rather hotly into the room but the instinct that dictated her action was rather a desire for privacy as if i would not sooner sit and talk to you she said than go out i have no one to go out with i am rather lonely since elsie has gone and i daresay i shall not see wilfred again till dinnertime it is rather amusing that i have just written to mrs altham to say how busy i am he came and sat a little closer to her upon my word he said i am in the same boat as you i havent set eyes on amy all morning and this afternoon i know she has a couple of meetings its extraordinary how this idea of votes for women has taken hold of her not a bad thing though as long as she doesnt go making a fool of herself in public and as long as she doesnt have any more quarrels with you what would you have done if she had really wished to quarrel with me over mrs althams league she asked just what i told her i said i would be no partner to it and as long as you would receive me here en garon i should always come that was dear of you she said softly she paused a moment sometimes i think we made a mistake in coming to settle here she said but you know how obstinate wilfred is and how little influence i have with him but then again i think of our friendship i have not had many friends i think perhaps i am too shy and timid with people when i like them very much i find it difficult to express myself it is rather sad not to be able to show what you feel quite frankly it prevents your being understood by the people whom you most want to understand you but beneath this profession of incompetence it seemed to major ames that there lurked a very efficient strength he felt himself being gradually overpowered by a superior force a force that did not strike and disable and overbear but cramped and paralysed the power of its adversary enfolding him clinging to him there was still something in him some part of his will which was hostile and opposed to her it was just that which she assailed and in alliance with that paralysing force was her attraction and charmsoft yielding feminine the two advanced side by side terrible twins he did not answer for a moment and it flashed across his mind that this cool room shaded from the street glare by the lace curtains and suffused with the greenish glow of the sunlight reflected from the lawn outside was like a trap she gave a little laugh see how badly i express myself she said you are puzzling frowning dont frown you look best when you are laughing i get so tired of frowning faces wilfred so often frowns all dinnertime when he is thinking over something connected with microbes and he frowns over his chess when he cannot make up his mind whether to exchange bishops we play chess every evening instinctively she had drawn back a little when she saw he did not advance to meet her and spoke as if chess and the pathos of her dumbness to express friendship were things of equal moment there was no calculation about it it was the expression of one type the eternal feminine attracted and wishing to attract her descent to these commonplaces restored his confidence the room was a trap no longer but the pleasant drawingroom he knew so well with its charming mistress seated by him it was almost inevitable that he should contrast the hot plushes and saddlebag cushions of his own its angular chairs and axminster carpets with the cool chintzes here the laceshrouded windows the persian rugs more marked was the contrast between the mistresses of the two houses amy had been writing at her davenport a good deal lately and her short stiff back had been the current picture of her here was a woman dim in the half light wanting to talk to him to make timid confidences to make him realize how much his friendship meant to her his confidence returned with disarming completeness well im sure i should find it dismal enough at home he said if i hadnt somewhere to go to knowing i should find a welcome mind you i dont blame amy for years now when weve been alone in the evening she has done her work and i have read the paper and i daresay we havent said a dozen words till parker brought in the bedroom candles or sometimes we play picquetfor love but now evenings spent like that seem to me very prosy and dismal perhaps its harrogate that has made me a bit more supple and youthful though im sure its ridiculous enough that a tough old campaigner like me should feel such things mrs evans put forward her chin raising her face towards him but why ridiculous she asked you must be so much younger than dear cousin amy i wonderi wonder if she feels that too there was there a very devilish suggestion the more so because in proportion to the suggestion so very little was stated it succeeded admirably poor dear amy said he he had said that once before when cleopatraamy was contrasted with cleopatramillie but there was a significance in the repetition of it once the assumed identity of character had suggested the comment now there was no assumed character it concerned millie and amy themselves mrs evans put back her chin i am sure cousin amy ought to be very happy she said softly you are so devoted to her and all i almost think you spoil her lyndhurst it is all so romantic fancy being a woman and as old as cousin amy and yet having a young man so devoted harry too again a billow of confidence tinged with selfappreciation surged over major ames after all his wife was much older than him for he was still a young man and his youth was being expanded on sweetpeas and the garden roller and he was stirred into a high flight of philosophical conjecture my god what a puzzle life is he observed she rose to this highwater mark and it might be so simple she said it should be so easy to be happy then major ames knew where he was in one sense he was worthy of the occasion in another he did not feel up to all that it implied he rose hastily i had better go he said rather hoarsely but he had smoked five cigarettes since lunch the hoarseness might easily have been the result of this indulgence she did not attempt to keep him nor did she make it incumbent on him to give her a kiss however cousinly she did not even rise but only looked up at him from her low chair as she gave him her hand smiling a little secretly as monna lisa smiles but she felt quite satisfied with their talk he would think over it and find fresh signals and private beckonings in it come and see me again she said there was a touch of imperativeness in her tone she looked through the lace curtain and saw him go out into the street there was something in the gutter of the roadway which he inquired into with the end of his stick it looked like a withered bunch of dusty chrysanthemums mrs ames meantime had lunched at home and gone off immediately afterwards as her husband had conjectured to a meeting in the last month the membership of her league had largely increased and it was no longer possible to convene its meetings in her own drawingroom for it numbered some fifty persons including a dozen men of enlightened principles even at first as has been seen she had welcomed thereby incurring mrs althams disapproval several ladies with whom she did not usually associate and now the gathering was entirely independent of all class distinctions the wife of the stationmaster for instance was one of the most active members and walked up and down the platform with a large rosette of suffragette colours selling current copies of the clarion and no less remarkable than this growth of the league was the growth of mrs ames she was neither pompous nor condescending to those persons whom a couple of months ago she would have looked upon as being barely existent except if they were all in church when she would very probably have shared a hymnbook with any of them the idea for which they had assembled galvanizing them though strictly temporarily into the class of existent people now the idea which brought them together in the commodious warehouse kindly lent and sufficiently furnished by mr turner had given them a permanent existence and they were not automatically blotted out of her book of life the moment these meetings were over as they would have been so short a time ago in church when the last amen was said the bonds of her barren and barbaric conventionality were bursting indeed it was not so much that others not even those of her class were becoming women to her as that she was becoming a woman herself she had scarcely been one hitherto she had been a piece of perfect propriety and how far she had travelled from her original conception of the suffragette movement as suitable to supply a novelty for the autumn that would eclipse the memory of the shakespearean ball may be gathered from the fact that she no longer took the chair at these meetings but was an ordinary member mr turner had far more experience in the duties of a chairman she had herself proposed him and would have seconded him as well had such a step been in order today the meeting was assembled to discuss the part which the league should take in the forthcoming elections the tory government was at present in power and likely to remain in office while riseborough itself was a fairly safe seat for the tory member who was sir james westbourne before polemical or obstructive measures could be decided on it had clearly been necessary to ascertain sir james views on the subject of votes for women and today his answer had been received and was read to the meeting it was as unsatisfactory as it was brief and their obedient servant had no sympathy with and so declined to promise any support to their cause mr turner read this out and laid it down on his desk will ladies or gentlemen give us their views on the course we are to adopt he said a dozen simultaneously rose and simultaneously sat down again the chairman asked mrs brooks to address the meeting another and another succeeded her and there was complete unanimity of purpose in their suggestions sir james meetings and his speeches to his constituents must not be allowed to proceed without interruption if he had no sympathy with the cause the cause would show a marked lack of sympathy with him thereafter the league resolved itself into a committee of ways and means the president of the board of trade was coming to support sir james candidature at a meeting the date of which was already fixed for a fortnight hence and it was decided to make a demonstration in force and as the discussion went on and real practical plans were made that strange fascination and excitement at the thought of shouting and interrupting at a public meeting of becoming for the first time of some consequence began to seethe and ferment most of the members were women whose lives had been passed in continuous selfrepression who had been frozen over by the narcotic ice of a completely conventional and humdrum existence many of them were unmarried and already of middleage their natural human instincts had never known the blossoming and honey which the fulfilment of their natures would have brought to the eagerness and sincerity with which they welcomed a work that demanded justice for their sex there was added this excitement of doing something at last there was an opportunity of expansion of stepping out under the stimulus of an idea into an experience that was real in kind this was akin to martyrs who rejoiced and sang when the prospects of prosecution came near as martyrs for the sake of their faith thought almost with glee of the rack and the burning so minutely the very prospect of discomfort and rough handling seemed attractive if by such means the cause was infinitesimally advanced to this a sincere and wholly laudable desire was added the more personal stimulus they would be doing something instead of suffering the tedium of passivity acting instead of being acted on for it is only through centuries of custom that the woman physically weak and liable to be knocked down has become the servant of the other sex she is fiercer at heart more courageous more scornful of consequences than he it is only muscular inferiority of strength that has subdued her into the place that she occupies that and the periods when for the continuance of the race she must submit to months of tender and strong inaction there she finds fruition of her nature and there awakes in her a sweet indulgence for the strange childish lust of being master of parading in making of laws and conventions his adventitious power of the semblance of sovereignty that has been claimed by man at heart she knows that he has but put a tinsel crown on his head and robed himself in spangles that but parody real gold she lays a womans hand on his childhead and to please him says how wise you are how strong how clever and the child is pleased and loves her for it and there is her weakness for the most dominant thing in her nature is the need of being loved from the beginning it must have been so when adams rib was taken from him in sleep he lost more than was left him and woke to find all his finer self gone from him he was left a blundering bumblebee to the rib that was taken from him clung the courage of the lioness the wisdom of the serpent the gentleness of the dove the cunning of the spider and the mysterious charm of the firefly that dances in the dusk but to that rib also clung the desire to be loved otherwise in the human race the male would be slain yearly like the drone of the hive but the strange thing that grew from the rib like flowers from buried carrion desired love there was its strength and its weakness it desired love and in its desire it suffered all degradation to obtain it and no leanness of soul entered into the gratification of its desire only when its desire was pinched and rationed or when by the operation of civilized law all fruit of desire was denied it so that the blossom of sex was made into one unfruitful bud did revolt come long generations produced the germ long generations made it active at length it swam up to sight from subaqueous dimnesses feeble and violent conscious of the justice of its cause and demanding justice but what helped to make the desire for justice so attractive was the violence the escape from selfrepression that the demand gave opportunity for to many who all their lives had been corked or wired down in comfort which no woman cares about or sealed up in spinsterhood and decorous emptiness of days there was justice in the demand and hysterical excitement in demanding to others and in this little league of riseborough there were many such the prospect of making those demands was primarily appalling and to none more than to poor mrs ames when the plan of campaign was discussed decided on and entrusted to the members of the league it required almost more courage than the idea was capable of inspiring to face even in anticipation the thought of shouting votes for women when goodhumoured cousin james rose and said ladies and gentlemen very possibly as had often happened in cousin james previous candidatures lyndhurst would wish his wife to ask him and the president of the board of trade to dinner before the meeting an occasion which would warrant the materialization of the most sumptuous of all the dinners tabulated on the printed menucards while sherry would be given with soup hock with fish and a constant flow of champagne be kept up afterwards until port time in that case cousin james would certainly ask them to sit on the platform and they would roll richly to the town hall in his motor all blazing with conservative colours while she in a small bag would be surreptitiously conveying there her great suffragette rosette and a small steel chain with a padlock she would be sitting probably next the mayor who would introduce the speakers and no doubt refer to the presence of the fair sex who graced the platform during this she would have to pin her colours on her dress chain herself up like andromeda snap the patent springlock of the padlock and when sir james rose her imagination could not grapple with the picture it turned sickly away refusing to contemplate and this to a cousin and a guest who had just eaten the best salt so to speak of her table from one who all her life had been so perfect a piece of propriety she felt far too old a bottle for such new wine sitting surrounded by fellowcrusaders and infected by the proximity of their undiluted enthusiasm it would be difficult enough but that she should chain herself perhaps to the very leg of the table which cousin james would soon thump in the fervour of his oratory as he announced all those tory platitudes in which she so firmly believed and which she must so shrilly interrupt while sitting solitary in the desert of his sleek and staid supporters was not only an impossible but an unthinkable achievement whatever horrors fate that gruesome weaver of nightmares might have in store for her she felt that here was something that transcended imagination she could not sit on the platform with lyndhurst and cousin james and the mayor and lady westbourne and do what was required of her for the sake of any crusade curfew so to speak would have to ring that night she and lyndhurst were dining alone the evening after this meeting of ways and means he in that state of mind which she not inaptly described as worried when she felt kind and cross when she felt otherwise he had come home hot from his walk and having sat in his room where there was no fire when evening fell chilly had had a smart touch of lumbago thus there were clearly two causes for complaint against amy and a third disturbing topic for there was no shadow of doubt that it was his bouquet of chrysanthemums that he had found in the road outside dr evans house and even before the lumbago had produced its characteristic pessimism he had been unable to find any encouraging explanation of this floral castaway im sure i dont know what was the good of my spending all august he said in that filthy hole of a harrogate at no end of expense too if im to be crippled all winter but you urged me to so strongly should never have thought of going there otherwise my dear you have only been crippled for halfanhour at present she observed it is a great bore but if only you will take a good hot bath tonight and have a very light dinner i expect you will be much better in the morning parker tell them to see that there is plenty of hot water in the kitchen boiler itll be the only warm thing in the house if there is said he my room was like an icehouse when i came in positively like an icehouse enough to give a man pneumonia let alone lumbago soup cold too my dear you should take more care of yourself said mrs ames placidly why did you not light the fire instead of being cold im sure it was laid and have it just burning up at dinnertime said he when i no longer wanted it it was still early in the course of dinner light the fire in the drawingroom parker said mrs ames let there be a good fire when we come out of dinner get roasted alive said major ames half to himself but intending to be heard but mrs ames mind had been feasting for weeks past on things which had a solider existence than her husbands unreasonable strictures since this new diet had been hers his snaps and growls had produced no effect they often annoyed her into repartee and as likely as not a few months ago she would have said that his claret seemed a very poor kind of beverage but tonight she felt not the smallest desire to retort she was very sorry for his lumbago but felt no inclination to carry the war into his territories or to tell him that if people perspiring freely and of gouty habit choose to sit down without changing and get chilly they must expect reprisal for their imprudence then we will open the window dear she said if we find we are frizzling but i dont think it will be too hot evenings are chilly in october did you have a pleasant lunch lyndhurst indeed i dont know where you lunched i ordered curry for you i sat down at a quarter to two as you did not come in it was all so infinitesimal yet it was the mental diet which had supported her for years perhaps after dinner they would play picquet the garden the kitchen for years except for gossip infinitely less real these had been the topics there had been no joy for him in the beauty of the garden only a pleased sense of proprietorship if a rare plant flowered or if there were more roses than usual for her she had been vaguely pleased if lyndhurst had taken two helpings of a dish and both of them had been vaguely disquieted if harry quoted swinburne i lunched with the evans he said by the way i met your cousin james westbourne this afternoon when i was on my walk extraordinarily cordial he gets when theres business ahead that brings him into riseborough and he wants to cadge a dinner or two its little notice he takes of us the rest of the year and im sure its a couple of years since he so much as sent us a brace of pheasants and more than that since he asked me to shoot there but as i say when he wants to pick up a dinner or two in riseborough hes all heartiness and saying he doesnt see half enough of us he doesnt seem to strain himself in trying to see more and theres seldom a weekend when he and that great guy of a wife of his dont have the house packed with people i suppose were not smart enough for them except when its convenient to dine in riseborough then hes not above drinking a bottle of my champagne mrs ames was eager in support of her husband im sure theres no call for you to open any more bottles for him my dear she said if cousin james wants to see us he can take his turn in asking us and harriet is a great guy as you say with her big fiddlehead major ames shrugged his shoulders rather magnificently im sure i dont grudge him his dinner he said and in point of fact i told him he could come and dine with us before his first meeting hes got some cabinet minister with him and i said he could bring him too you might get up a little party thats to say if im not in bed with this infernal lumbago and cousin james will return our hospitality by giving us seats on the platform to hear him stamp and stammer and rant an infernal bad speaker never heard a worse wretched delivery nothing to say and says it all fifty times over enough to make a man turn radical however hell have made himself at home with my mumm and perhaps hell go to sleep himself before he sends us off this of course represented the lumbagoview major ames had been fulsomely cordial to cousin james and had himself urged the dinner that he represented now as being forced on him have you actually asked him lyndhurst said mrs ames rather faintly did he say he would come did you ever know your cousin james refuse a decent dinner asked lyndhurst and he was kind enough to say he would like it at a quarter past seven cool upon my word i wish i had asked him if hed have thick soup or clear and if he preferred a wing to a leg thats the sort of thing one never thinks of till afterwards mrs ames was not attending closely there was that below the surface which claimed all her mind consequently she missed the pungency of this irony hearing only the words cousin james never takes soup at all she said he told me it always disagreed major ames sighed his lumbago felt less acute his illtemper had found relief in words and he had long ago discovered that women had no sense of humour on the whole it was gratifying to find the truth of this so amply endorsed for the moment it put him into quite a good temper im afraid ive been grumbling all dinner he said shall we go into the other room theres little sense in my looking at the decanters if i maynt take my glass of port eh that was a twinge chapter xi it is no use henry said mrs altham on that same evening telling me it is all stuff and nonsense when ive seen with my own eyes the parcel of suffragette riband being actually directed to mrs brooks for pen and ink is pen and ink when all is said and done tapworth measured off six yards of it on the countermeasure that gives two feet for he gave nine lengths of it and put it in paper and directed it of course if nine lengths of two feet doesnt make eighteen feet which is six yards i am wrong and you are right and twice two no longer makes four and there were two other parcels already done up of exactly the same shape you will see if i am not right or do you suppose that mrs brooks is ordering it just to trim her nightgown with it i never said anything about mrs brooks nightgown said henry who to do him justice had been goaded into slightly rabelaisian mood i never thought about mrs brooks nightgown i didnt know she wore onei mean mrs altham made what children would call a face her eyes grew suddenly fixed and boiled and her mouth assumed an acidulated expression as if with a plethora of lemonjuice the face was due to the entry of the parlourmaid with the pudding it was jelly and was served in silence mrs altham waited till the door was quietly closed again it is not a question of mrs brooks nightgown she said since we both agree that she would not order six yards of suffragette riband to trim it i spoke sarcastically henry and you interpreted me literally as you often do it was the same at littlestone in august when the bacon was so salt one day that i said to mrs churchill that a little bacon in the bath would be equivalent to seabathing upon which you must needs tell her next morning to send your bacon to the bathroom which she did and there was a plate of bacon on the spongetray so extraordinary but all that is beside the point though what she can have thought of you i cant imagine after all your gift of being literal may help you now why does mrs brooks want six yards of suffragette riband and why are there two similar parcels on tapworths counter if i had had a moment alone i would certainly have looked at the other addresses and seen where they were being sent but young tapworth was there all the timethat one with the pincenez and the ridiculous chinand he put them into the errandboys basket and told him to be sharp about it so i had no chance of seeing you might have strolled along behind the boy to see where he went suggested mr altham he went on a bicycle said mrs altham and it is impossible to stroll behind a boy on a bicycle and hope to get there in time but he went up the high street i should not in the least wonder if mrs evans had turned suffragette after that note to me about her not having time to attend the antisuffragette meetings especially since there was only one said henry in the literal mood that had been forced on him and nobody came to that it would not have sacrificed very much of her time not that i ever heard it was valuable what she can do with her day i cant imagine said mrs altham her mind completely diverted by this new topic her cook told griffiths that as often as not she doesnt go down to the kitchen at all in the morning and shes hardly ever to be seen shopping in the high street before lunch and what with elsie gone to dresden and her husband away on his rounds all day she must be glad when its bedtime and shes a small sleeper too for she told me herself that she considers six hours a good night though i expect she sleeps more than she knows and i daresay has a nap after lunch as well dear me what were we talking about ah yes i was saying i should not wonder if she had turned suffragette though i cant recall what made me think so because tapworths boy went up the high street on a bicycle said mr altham who had a great gift of picking out single threads from the tangle of his wifes conversation though after all the high street leads to other houses besides mrs evans the station for instance you seem to want to find fault with everything i say tonight henry i dont know what makes you so contrary but there it is i saw eighteen yards of suffragette riband being sent out when i happened to be in tapworths this morning and i daresay thats but a tithe of what has been ordered though i cant say as to that unless you expect me to stand in the high street all day and watch and as to what it all means ill let you conjecture for yourself since if i told you what i thought you would probably contradict me again it was no wonder that mrs altham was annoyed she had been thrilled to the marrow by the parcels of suffragette riband and when she communicated her discovery henry who usually was so sympathetic had seen nothing to be thrilled about but he had not meant to be unsympathetic and repaired his error im sure my dear that you will have formed a very good guess as to what it means he said tell me what you think well if you care to know said she i think it all points to there being some demonstration planned and i for one should not be surprised if i looked out of the window some morning and saw mrs ames and mrs brooks and the rest of them marching down the high street with ribands and banners theyve been keeping very quiet about it all at least not a word of what theyve been doing has come to my ears and i consider thats a proof that something is going on and that they want to keep it secret mr althams legal mind cried out to him to put in the plea that a complete absence of news does not necessarily constitute a proof that exciting events are occurring but he rightly considered that such logic might be taken to be a sign of continued contrariness so he gave an illogical assent to his wifes theory certainly it is odd that nothing more has been heard of it all he said i wonder what they are planning the election coming on so soon too can they be planning anything in connection with that mrs altham got up letting her napkin fall on the floor henry i believe you have hit it she said now what can it be let us go into the drawingroom and thresh it out but the best threshingmachines in the world cannot successfully fulfil their function unless there is some material to work upon they can but show by their whirling wheels and rattling gear that they are capable of threshing should anything be provided for them the poor althams were somewhat in this position for their rations of gossip were sadly reduced their two chief sources being cut off from them for ever since the mendacious mrs brooks had appeared as cleopatra when she had as good as promised to be hermione chill politeness had taken the place of intimacy between the two houses since there was no telling what trick she might not play next while the very decided line which mrs altham had taken when she found she was expected to meet people like tradesmens wives had caused a complete rupture in relations with the ames that suffragette meetings were going on was certain else what sane mind could account for the fact that only today a perfect stream of people some of them not even known by sight to mrs altham and therefore probably of the very lowest origin with mrs ames and the wife of the stationmaster among them had been seen coming out of mr turners warehouse it was ridiculous to tell me that they had been all making purchases nobody had told her and such a supposition was thoroughly negatived by the subsequent discovery that the warehouse in question contained only a quantity of chairs all this however had been threshed out at teatime and the flywheels buzzed emptily against the probability of an electiondemonstration was the fact that the unionist member to whom these attentions would naturally be directed was mrs ames cousin though cousin was a vague word and mrs altham would not wonder if he was a very distant sort of cousin indeed still it would be worth while to get tickets anyhow for the first of sir james meetings when the president of the board of trade was going to speak so as to be certain of a good place he was not mrs ames cousin so far as mrs altham knew though she did not pretend to follow the ramifications of mrs ames family the flywheels were allowed to run on in silence for some little while after this meagre material had been thoroughly sifted in case anything further offered itself then mr altham proposed another topic you were saying that you wondered how mrs evans got through her time he began but there was no need for him to say another word not any opportunity mrs altham stooped like a hawk on the quarry you mean major ames she said im sure i never pass the house but what hes either going in or coming out and he does a good deal more of the going in than of the other in my opinion henry penetrated into the meaning of what sounded a rather curious achievement and corroborated he was there this morning he said on the doorstep at eleven oclock or it might have been a quarterpast with a bouquet of chrysanthemums big enough to do all mrs ames decorations at st barnabas what is the matter my dear for mrs altham had literally bounced out of her chair and was pointing at him a forefinger that trembled with a nameless emotion at a quarterpast one or a few minutes later she said that bouquet was lying in the middle of the road let us say twenty minutes past one because i came straight home took off my hat and was ready for lunch it was more like a haystack than a bouquet im sure if i hadnt stepped over it i should have tripped and fallen and to think that i never mentioned it to you henry how things piece themselves together if you give them a chance now did you actually see major ames carry it into the house the door was opened to him just as i came opposite said henry firmly and in he went bouquet and all then somebody must have thrown it out again said mrs altham she held up one hand and ticked off names on its fingers who was then in the house she said mrs evans dr evans major ames otherwise the servantshow they can find work for six servants in that house i cant understandand servants would never have thrown chrysanthemums into the street so we neednt count the servants now can you imagine mrs evans throwing away a bouquet that major ames had brought her if so i envy you your power of imagination or she paused a moment or can there have been a quarrel and did she tell him she had too much of him and his bouquets or dr evans said henry she nodded portentously turned out of the house he and his bouquet she said dr evans is a powerful man and major ames for all his size is mostly fat i should not wonder if dr evans knocked him down henry i have a good mind to treat mrs ames as if she had not been so insulting to me that day and after all that is only christian conduct and to take round to her after lunch tomorrow the book she said she wanted to see last july i am sure i have forgotten what it was but any book will do since she only wants it to be thought that she reads after all i should be sorry to let mrs ames suppose that anything she can do should have the power of putting me out and i should like to see if she still dyes her hair after the chrysanthemums in the road i should not be the least surprised to be told that major ames is ill then we shall know all dear me it is eleven oclock already and i never felt less inclined to sleep henry stepped downstairs to drink a mild whisky and soda after all this conversation and excitement but while it was still half drunk he felt compelled to run upstairs and tap at his wifes door i am not coming in dear he said in answer to her impassioned negative but if you find major ames is not ill no one will be more rejoiced than myself henry said she in a disappointed voice henry went gently downstairs again mrs ames was at home when the forgiving mrs altham arrived on the following afternoon bearing a copy of a book of which there were already two examples in the house but she clearly remembered having wanted to see some book of which they had spoken together last july and it was very kind of mrs altham to have attempted to supply her with it beyond doubt she had ceased to dye her hair for the usual grey streaks were apparent in it a proof if mrs altham wanted a proof which she did not that artificial means had been resorted to and even as mrs altham with her powerful observation noticed the difference in mrs ames hair so also she noticed a difference in mrs ames she no longer seemed pompous there was a kindliness about her which was utterly unlike her usual condescension though it manifested itself only in the trivial happenings of an afternoon call such as putting a cushion in her chair and asking if she found the room with its prospering fire too hot this also led to interesting information it is scarcely cold enough for a fire today she said but my husband is laid up with a little attack of lumbago i am so sorry to hear that said mrs altham feverishly when did he catch it he felt it first last night before dinner it is disappointing for he expected harrogate to cure him of such tendencies but it is not very severe i have no doubt he will be in here presently for tea mrs altham felt quite convinced he would not and hastened to glean further enlightenment you must be very busy thinking of the election she said i suppose sir james is safe to get in i got tickets for the first of his meetings this morning that will be the one at which the president of the board of trade speaks said mrs ames my cousin and he dine with us first mrs altham determined on more direct questions really it must require courage to be a politician nowadays she said especially if you are in the cabinet mr chilcot has been hardly able to open his mouth lately without being interrupted by some suffragette dear me i hope i have not said the wrong thing i quite forgot your sympathies it is certainly a subject that interests me said mrs ames though as for saying the wrong thing dear mrs altham why the world would be a very dull place if we all agreed with each other but i think it requires just as much courage for a woman to get up at a meeting and interrupt i cannot imagine myself being bold enough i feel i should be unable to get on my feet or utter a word they must be very much in earnest and have a great deal of conviction to nerve them this was not very satisfactory if anything was to be learned from it it was that mrs ames was but a tepid supporter of the cause but what followed was still more vexing for the parlourmaid announced mrs evans so sorry to hear about major ames dear cousin amy she said wilfred told me he had been to see him mrs ames made a kissingpad so to speak of her small toads face and millie dabbed her cheek on it dear millie how nice of you to call parker tell the major that tea is ready and that mrs evans and mrs altham are here but by the time major ames arrived mrs altham was there no longer she was thoroughly disgusted with the transformation into chaff of all the beautiful grain that they had taken the trouble to thresh out the night before she summed it up succinctly to her husband when he came back from his golf i dont believe the suffragettes are going to do anything at all henry she said and i shouldnt wonder if these chrysanthemums had nothing to do with anybody the only thing is that her hair is dyed because it was all speckled with grey again as thickly as yours and i declare i left the safety of the race behind me instead of bringing it back again as i meant to do henry who had won his match at golf was naturally optimistic then you didnt actually see major ames he asked no but there was no longer any doubt about it all she said i do not think i am unduly credulous but it was clear there was nothing the matter with him except a touch of lumbago and all this suffragette business means nothing at all in spite of the yards of riband you may take my word for it then there will be no point in going to sir james meeting said henry though the president of the board of trade is going to speak not unless you want to hear the biggest windbag in the country buttering up the greatest prig in the county i should be sorry to waste my time over it and he is dining with the ames and so i suppose all there will be to look at will be the row of them on the platform all swollen with one of mrs ames biggest dinners we might have gone to bed at our usual time last night for all the use that there has been in our talk and it was you saw the chrysanthemums from which you expected so much and thought it worth while to tell me about them and henry felt too much depressed at the utter flatness of all that had made so fair a promise to enter any protest against the palpable injustice of these conclusions major ames lumbago was of the laodicean sort neither hot nor cold it hung about occasionally stabbing him shrewdly at times retreating in the parthian mode so that he was encouraged to drink a glass of port upon which it shot at him again and he had to get back to his stew of sloppy diet and depressing reflections most of all the relations into which he had allowed himself to drift with regard to millie filled him with a timorous yet exultant agitation but he almost if not quite exaggerated his indisposition in order to escape from the responsibility of deciding what should come of it damp and boisterous weather made it prudent for him to keep to the house and she came to see him daily behind her demure quietness he divined a mind that was expectant and sure there was no doubt as to her view of the situation that had arisen between them she had played with the emotions of others once too often and was caught in the agitation which she had so often excited without sharing in it mrs ames was generally present at these visits but when it was quite certain that she was not looking millie often raised her eyes to his and this disconcerting conviction lurked behind them her speech was equally disconcerting for she would say it will be nice when you are well again in a manner that quite belied the commonplace words and this force that lay behind strangely controlled him involuntarily almost he answered her signals gave himself the loverlike privilege of seeming to understand all that was not said all the time too he perfectly appreciated the bad taste of the affairnamely that a woman who was in love with him and to whom he had given indications of the most unmistakable kind that he was on her plane of emotion should play these unacted scenes in his wifes house coming there to make pass his invalid hours and that he should take his part in them it was common and he could not but contrast that commonness with the unconsciousness of his wife occasionally he was inclined to think poor amy how little she sees but as often it occurred to him that she was too big to be aware of such smallnesses as he and milly were guilty of and in reality the truth lay between these extreme views she was not too big to be aware of it she was quite aware of it but she was big enough to appear too big to be aware of it she watched and scorned herself for her watching she fed herself with suspicions but was robust enough to spew them forth again also and this allowed the robuster attitude to flourish she was concerned with a nightmare of her own which daily grew more vivid and unescapable a decade of streaming october days passed in this trying atmosphere of suspicion and uncertainty and apprehension of the three of them it was major ames who was most thoroughly ill at ease for he had no inspiration which enabled him to bear this sordid martyrdom he divined that millie was evolving some situation in which he would be expected to play a very prominent part and such ardour as was his he felt not to be of the adequate temperature and he looked back over the peaceful days when his garden supplied him not only with flowers but with the most poignant emotions known to his nature almost with regret it had all been so peaceful and pleasant in that landlocked harbour and now she like a steamtug was slowly towing him out past the pierhead into a waste of breakers strictly speaking it was possible for him at any moment to cast the towingrope off and return to his quiet anchorage but he was afraid he lacked the moral power to do so he had let her throw the rope aboard him he had helped to attach it to the bollard thinking so to speak that he was the tug and she the frail little craft but that frail little craft had developed into an engined apparatus and it was his turn to be towed helpless and at least unwilling and wholly uninspired the others at any rate had inspiration to warm their discomfort mrs ames the sense of justice and sisterhood which was leavening her dumpy existence mrs evans the fire which however strange and illicit are its burnings however common and trivial the material from which it springs must still be called love it was the evening of sir james first meeting and mrs ames at six oclock was satisfying herself that nothing had been omitted in the preparations for dinner the printed menu cards were in place announcing all that was most sumptuous the requisite relays of knives spoons and forks were on the sideboard the plates of opalescent glass for ice were to hand and there was no longer anything connected with this terrible feast that to her had the horror of a murderers breakfast on the last morning of his life which could serve to distract her mind any more millie was to dine with them and with them come to the meeting but just now it did not seem to matter in the slightest what millie did all day mrs ames had been catching at problematic straws that might save her it was possible that mr chilcot would be seized with sudden indisposition and the meeting be postponed but she herself had seen him drive by in cousin james motor looking particularly hearty or cousin james might catch influenza lady westbourne already had it and it was pleasantly infectious or lyndhurst might get an attack of really acute lumbago but instead he felt absolutely well again today and had even done a little gardenrolling one by one these bright possibilities had been extinguishednow no reasonable anchor remained except that dinner would acutely disagree with her and that was hardly likely since she felt incapable of eating anything or that the motor which was to take them to the town hall would break down at halfpast six she went upstairs to dress she would thus secure a quarter of an hour before the actual operation of decking herself began in which to be alone and really face what was going to happen it was no use trying to face it in one piece taken all together the coming evening had the horror and unreality of nightmare brooding over it she had to take it moment by moment from the time when she would welcome her guests whom so it seemed to her she was then going to betray till the time when perhaps four hours from now she would be back again here in her room and everything that had happened had woven itself into the woolly texture of the past in place of being in the steely imminent future there was dinner to be gone through that was only tolerable to think of because of what was to follow in itself it would please her to entertain her cousin and so notable a man as a cabinet minister clearly then she must separate dinner from the rest and enjoy it independently but when she went down to dinner she must have left here in readiness the little black velvet bag that was not so pleasant to think of yet the little black velvet bag had nothing to do yet then there would follow the drive to the town hall that would not be unpleasant in itself she would rather enjoy the stir and pomp of their arrival sir james would doubtless say to the scrutinizing doorkeeper these ladies are with me and they would pass on amid demonstrations of deference probably there would be a little procession on to the platform the mayor would very likely lead the way with her her and her little black velvet bag and then poor mrs ames suddenly felt that if she thought about it any more she would have a nervous collapse and at that thought her inspiration so to speak reached out a cool firm hand to her at any cost she was going through with this nightmare for the sake of that which inspired it it was no use saying it was pleasant nor was it pleasant to have a tooth out but any woman with the slightest selfrespect when once convinced that it was better to have the tooth out went to the dentist at the appointed hour declined gas mrs ames had very decided opinions about those who made a fuss over a little pain opened her mouth and held the arms of the chair very firmly one wanted something to hold on to at these moments she wondered what she would find to hold on to this evening perhaps the holding on would be done by somebody elsea policeman for instance there was one more detail to attend to before dressing and she opened the little black velvet bag in it were two chainslight but of steel they had been sold her with the gratifying recommendation that either of them alone would hold a mastiff which was more than was required one was of such length as to go tightly round her waist a spring lock with hasp passing through the last link of it closing with an internal snap obviated the necessity of a key this she proposed to put on below the light cloak she wore before they started the second chain was rather longer but otherwise similar it was to be passed through the one already in place on her waist and round the object to which she desired to attach herself another snap lock made the necessary connection she saw that all was in order and putting the big suffragette rosette on top of the other apparatus closed the bag it was useless to try to accustom herself to it by looking she might as well inspect the dentists forceps hoping thus to mollify their grip cloak and little velvet bag she would leave here and come up for them after dinner and already the quarter of an hour was over and it was time to dress the daring rosecoloured silk was to be worn on this occasion and she hoped that it would not experience any rough treatment yet it hardly mattered after tonight she would very likely never care to set eyes on it again and emphatically lyndhurst would find it full of disagreeable associations and then she felt suddenly and acutely sorry for him and for the amazement and chagrin that he was about to feel he could not fail to be burningly ashamed of her to choke with rage and mortification perhaps it would bring on another attack of lumbago which she would intensely regret but she did not anticipate feeling in the least degree ashamed of herself but she intensely wished it had not got to be and now she was ready the rosecoloured silk glowed softly in the electric light the pink satin shoes which went with it were on her plump pretty little feet the row of garnets was clasped round her neck there was a good deal of colour in her face and she was pleased to see she looked so well the last time she had worn all these fine feathers was on the evening she returned home with brown hair and softened wrinkles from overstrand that was not a successful evening it seemed that the rosecoloured silk was destined to shine on inauspicious scenes but now she was ready this was her last moment alone and she plumped down on her knees by the bedside in a sudden access of despair at what lay before her and found her lips involuntarily repeating the words that were used in the hugest and most holy agony that mans spirit has ever known when for one moment he felt that even he could not face the sacrifice of himself or to drink of the cup but next moment she sprang from her knees again her face all aflame with the shame at her paltriness you wretched little coward she said to herself how dare you dinner that long expensive dinner brought with it trouble unanticipated by mrs ames mr chilcot it appeared was a teetotaler at all times and never ate anything but a couple of poached eggs before he made a speech he was also owing to recent experiences a little nervous about suffragettes and required reiterated assurances that unaccountable females had not been seen about its true that a week or two ago i received a letter asking me my views said sir james but i wrote a fairly curt reply and have heard nothing more about it my agents pretty wide awake he would have known if there was likely to be any disturbance no thanks major one glass of champagne is all i allow myself before making a speech capital wine i know i always say you give one the best glass of wine to be had in kent hows time by the way ah weve got plenty of time yet i like to have five minutes quiet before going on to the platform said mr chilcot yes that will be all right perhaps we might have the motor five minutes earlier cousin amy no no sweetbread thanks dear me what a great dinner you are giving us an awful and dismal atmosphere descended mr chilcot thinking of his speech frowned at his poached eggs and when they were finished at the tablecloth cousin james refused dish after dish mrs ames felt herself incapable of eating and major ames and mrs evans who was practically a vegetarian were left to do the carousing wines went round untouched silences grew longer and an interminable succession of dishes failed to tempt anybody except major ames at this rate not one but a whole series of luncheonparties would be necessary to finish up the untouched dainties of this illstarred dinner outside a brisk tattoo of rain beat on the windows and the wind having got up the fire began to smoke and mr chilcot to cough a readjustment of door and window mended this matter but sluiced cousin james in a chilly draught mr chilcot brightened up a little as coffee came round but the coffee was the only weak spot in an admirable repast being but moderately warm he put it down mrs ames tried to repair this error im afraid it is not hot enough she said parker tell them to heat it up at once cousin james looked at his watch really i think we ought to be off he said im sure they can get a cup of coffee for mr chilcot from the hotel we might all go together unless you have ordered something cousin amy the motor holds five easily a smart chill october rain was falling and they drove through blurred and disconsolate streets a few figures under umbrellas went swiftly along the cheerless pavements a crowd of the very smallest dimensions scarce two deep across the pavement opposite the town hall watched the arrival of those who were attending the meeting there was an insignificant queue of halfadozen carriages awaiting their disembarkments but as the hands of the town hall clock indicated that the meeting was not timed to begin for twenty minutes yet even mr chilcot could not get agitated about the possibility of a cup of coffee before his effort through the rainstreaked windows mrs ames could see how meagre owing no doubt to the inclement night was the assembly of the ticketholders it was possible of course that crowds might soon begin to arrive but riseborough generally made a point of being in its place in plenty of time and she anticipated a sparsely attended room mrs brooks hurried by in mackintosh and goloshes the cheerful turner family who were just behind them in a cab dived into the wet night and emerged again under the awning mrs currie wife of the stationmaster with her suffragette rosette in a paper parcel had a friendly word with a policeman at the door and at these sights since they indicated a forcible assemblage of the league she felt a little encouraged then the car moved on and stopped again opposite the awning and their party dismounted a bustling official demanded their tickets and was summarily thrust aside by another just as bustling but more enlightened who had recognized sir james and conducted them all to the mayors parlour where that dignitary received them there was coffee already provided and all anxiety on that score was removed mr chilcot effaced himself in a corner with his cup and his notes while the others notably sir james behaved with that mixture of social condescension and official deference which appears to be the right attitude in dealing with mayors then the mayoress said george dear it has gone the halfhour will you escort mrs ames george asked mrs ames if he might have the honour and observed we shall have but a thin meeting i am afraid most inclement for october mrs ames pulled her cloak a little closer round her in order to hide a chain that was more significant than the mayors and felt the little black velvet bag beating time to her steps against her knee they walked through the stark bare passages with stone floors that exuded cold moisture in sympathy with the wetness of the evening and came out into a sudden blaze of light a faint applause from nearly empty benches heralded their appearance and they disposed themselves on a row of plush armchairs behind a long oak table the mayor sat in the centre to right and left of him sir james and mr chilcot just opposite mrs ames was a large tableleg which had for her the significance of the executionshed she put her bag conveniently on her knees and quietly unloosed the latch that fastened it there were no more preparations to be made just yet since the chain was quite ready and in a curious irresponsible calm she took further note of her surroundings scarcely a hundred people were there all told and face after face as she passed her eyes down the seats was friendly and familiar mrs currie bowed and the turner family in a state of the pleasantest excitement beamed mrs brooks gave her an excited handwave they were all sitting in encouraging vicinity to each other but she was alone as on the inexorable seas while they were on the pier then the mayor cleared his throat it had been arranged that the mayor was to be given an uninterrupted hearing for he was the local grocer and it had perhaps been tacitly felt that he might adopt retaliatory measures in the inferior quality of the subsequent supplies of sugar he involved himself in sentences that had no end and would probably have gone on for ever had he not with commendable valour chopped off their tails when their coils threatened to strangle him and begun again the point of it all was that they had the honour to welcome the president of the board of trade and sir james westbourne luckily the posters with which the town had been placarded for the last fortnight corroborated the information and no reasonable person could any longer doubt it he was rejoiced to see so crowded an assembly met togetherthis was not very happy but the sentence had been carefully thought out and it was a pity not to reproduce itand was convinced that they would all spend a most interesting and enjoyable evening which would certainly prove to be epochmaking politics were taken seriously in riseborough and it was pleasant to see the gathering graced by so many members of the fair sex he felt he had detained them all quite long enough no and he would detain them no longer yes but call on the right honourable mr chilcot cheers as mr chilcot rose mr turner rose also and said in a clear cheerful voice votes for women he had a rosette pinned a little crookedly depending from his shoulder immediately his wife and daughter rose too and in a sort of gregorian chant said womens rights and a rattle of chains made a pleasant light accompaniment from beneath her seat mrs currie produced a banner trimmed with the appropriate colours on which was embroidered votes for women but the folds clung dispiritingly together there was never a more dejected banner two stalwart porters whom she had brought with her also got up wiped their mouths with the backs of their hands and said in low hoarse tones votes for women this lasted but a few seconds and there was silence again it was impossible to imagine a less impressive demonstration it seemed the incarnation of ineffectiveness mr chilcot had instantly sat down when it began and though he had cause to be shy of suffragettes seemed quite undisturbed he was smiling goodnaturedly and for a moment consulted his notes again and then suddenly mrs ames realized that she had taken no share in it it had begun so quickly and so quickly ended that for the time she had merely watched but then her blood and her courage came back to her it should not be her fault in any case if the proceedings lacked fire the idea all that had meant so much to her during these last months seemed to stand by her asking her aid she opened the little black velvet bag pinned on her rosette passed the second chain strong enough to hold a mastiff through the first and round the leg of the table in front of her heard the spring lock click and rose to her feet waving her hand votes for women she cried votes for women hurrah instantly every one on the platform turned to her she saw lyndhursts inflamed and astonished face with mouth fallen open in incredulous surprise like a fish in an aquarium she saw cousin james frown of distinguished horror mrs evans looked as if about to laugh and the mayoress said lor mr chilcot turned round in his seat and his goodhumored smile faded leaving an angry fighting face but all this hostility and amazement so far from cowing or silencing her seemed like a draught of wine votes for women she cried again at that the cry was taken up in earnest by a desperate effort mrs currie unfurled her banner so that it floated free her porters roared out their message with the conviction they put into their announcements to a stopping train that this was riseborough the turner family gleefully shouted together mrs brooks unable to adjust her rosette madly waved it and a solid group of enthusiasts just below the platform emitted loud and militant cries all that had been flat and lifeless a moment before was inspired and vital and mrs ames had done it for a moment she had nothing but glory in her heart mr chilcot leaned over the table to her i had no idea he said when i had the honour of dining with you that you proposed immediately afterwards to treat me with such gross discourtesy votes for women shouted mrs ames again this time the cry was less vehemently taken up for there was nothing to interrupt mr chilcot conferred a moment quietly with sir james and mrs ames saw that lyndhurst and mrs evans were talking together the former was spluttering with rage and mrs evans had laid her slim whitegloved hand on his knee in the attempt it appeared to soothe him at present the endeavour did not seem to be meeting with any notable measure of success even in the midst of her excitement mrs ames thought how ludicrous lyndhursts face was she also felt sorry for him as well she had the sense of this being tremendous fun never in her life had she been so effective never had she even for a moment paralysed the plans of other people but she was doing that now mr chilcot had come here to speak and she was not permitting him to and again she cried votes for women an inspector of police had come on to the platform and after a few words with sir james he vaulted down into the body of the hall next moment some dozen policemen tramped in from outside and immediately afterwards the turner family still beaming were being trundled down the gangway and firmly ejected sundry high notes and muffled shoutings came from outside but after a few seconds they were dumb as if a tap had been turned off there was a little more trouble with mrs currie but a few smart tugs brought away the somewhat flimsy wooden rail to which she had attached herself and she was taken along in a sort of tripping step like a cheerful dancing bear with her chains jingling round her after the turners and quietly put out into the night then sir james came across to mrs ames cousin amy he said you must please give us your word to cause no more disturbance or i shall tell a couple of men to take you away votes for women shouted mrs ames again but the excitement which possessed her was rapidly dying and from the hall there came no response except very audible laughter i am very sorry said cousin james and then with a sudden overwhelming wave the futility of the whole thing struck her what had she done she had merely been extremely rude to her two guests had seriously annoyed her husband and had aroused perfectly justifiable laughter general fortescue was sitting a few rows off he was looking at her through his pincenez and his red goodhumoured face was all achink with smiles then two policemen one of whom had his beat in st barnabas road vaulted up on to the platform and several people left their places to look on from a more advantageous position beg your pardon maam said the st barnabas policeman touching his helmet with imperturbable politeness shes chained up too bill bill was a slow large fatherlylooking man and examined mrs ames fetters then a broad grin broke out over his amiable face its only just passed around the tableleg he said hitch up the tableleg mate and slip it off it was too true patent lock and mastiffholding chain were slipped down the tableleg and mrs ames with the fatherlylooking policeman politely carrying her chains and the little velvet bag was gently and inevitably propelled through the door which a quarter of an hour ago she had entered escorted by the mayor and down the stone passage and out into the dripping street the rain fell heavily on to the rosecoloured silk dress and the fatherly policeman put her cloak which had half fallen off more shelteringly round her better have a cab maam and go home quietly he said youll catch cold if you stay here and we cant let you in again begging your pardon maam mrs ames looked round mrs currie was just crossing the road apparently on her way home and a carriage drove off containing the turner family a sense of utter failure and futility possessed her it was cold and wet and a chilly wind flapped the awning blowing a shower of dripping raindrops on to her the excitement and courage that had possessed her just now had all oozed away nothing had been effected unless to make herself ridiculous could be counted as an achievement call a cab for the lady bill said her policeman soothingly this was soon summoned and bill touched his helmet as she got in and before closing the door pulled up the window for her the cabman also knew her and there was no need to give him her address the rain pattered on the windows and on the roof and the horse splashed briskly along through the puddles in the roadway parker opened the door to her surprised at the speediness of her return why maam she exclaimed has anything happened no nothing parker said she feeling that a dreadful truth underlay her words tell the major when he comes in that i have gone to bed she looked for a moment into the diningroom so short a time had passed that the table was not yet cleared the printed menucards had been collected but the coffee which had not been hot enough still stood untasted in the cups and the slices of pineapple cut but not eaten were ruinously piled together the thought of all the luncheons that would be necessary to consume all this expensive food made her feel sick these little things had assumed a ridiculous size to her mind that which had seemed so big was pitifully dwindled she felt desperately tired and cold and lonely chapter xii and whats to be done now said major ames chipping his bacon high into the air above his plate if you didnt hear me i said whats to be done now i dont know how you can look riseborough in the face again and upon my word i dont see how i can theyll point at me in the street and say thats major ames whose wife made a fool of herself thats what you did amy you made a fool of yourself and what was the good of it all are you any nearer getting the vote than before because youve screamed votes for women a dozen times youve only given a proof the more of how utterly unfit you are to have anything at all of your own let alone a vote i passed a sleepless night with thinking of your folly and i feel infernally unwell this morning this clearly constituted a climax and mrs ames took advantage of the rhetorical pause that followed nonsense lyndhurst she said i heard you snoring its enough to make a man snore he said snore indeed why couldnt you even have told me that you were going to behave like a silly lunatic and if i couldnt have persuaded you to behave sanely i could have stopped away instead of looking on at such an exhibition every one will suppose i must have known about it and have countenanced you ive a good mind to write to the kent chronicle and say that i was absolutely ignorant of what you were going to do youve disgraced us thats what youve done he took a gulp of tea imprudently for it was much hotter than he anticipated and now ive burned my mouth he said mrs ames put down her napkin left her seat and came and stood by him i am sorry you are so much vexed she said but i cant and i wont discuss anything with you if you talk like that you are thinking about nothing but yourself whether you are disgraced and whether you have had a bad night certainly you dont seem to have thought about me he said as a matter of fact i did she said i knew you would not like it and i was sorry but do you suppose i liked it but i thought most about the reason for which i did it you did it for notoriety said major ames with conviction you wanted to see your name in the papers as having interrupted a cabinet ministers speech you wont even have that satisfaction i am glad to say your cousin james who is a decent sort of fellow after all spoke to the reporters last night and asked them to leave out all account of the disturbance they consented they are decent fellows too they didnt want to give publicity to your folly they were sorry for you amy and how do you like halfadozen reporters at a pound a week being sorry for you your cousin james was equally generous he bore no malice to me and shook hands with me and said he saw you were unwell when he sat down to dinner but when a man of the world as your cousin james is says he thinks that a woman is unwell i know what he means he thought you were intoxicated drunk in fact thats what he thought he thought you were drunk my wife drunk and it was the kindest interpretation he could have put upon it mad or drunk he chose drunk and he hoped i should be able to come over some day next week and help him to thin out the pheasants very friendly considering all that had happened mrs ames moved slightly away from him do you mean to go she asked of course i mean to go he shows a very generous spirit and i think i can account for the highest of his rocketters he wants to smoothe things over and be generous and all thathold out the olive branch he recognizes that ive got to live down your folly and if its known that ive been shooting with him it will help us forgive and forget hey i shall just go over there en garon and will patch matters up i dare say hell ask you over again some time he doesnt want to be hard on you nor do i i am sure but there are things no man can stand a mans got to put his foot down sometimes even if he puts it down on his wife and if i was a bit rough with you just now you must realize amy you must realize that i felt strongly strongly and rightly weve got to live down what you have done well im by you well live it down together ill make your peace with your cousin you can trust me these magnificent assurances failed to dazzle mrs ames and she made no acknowledgement of them instead she went back rather abruptly and inconveniently to a previous topic you tell me that cousin james believed i was drunk she said now you knew i was not but you seem to have let it pass major ames felt that more magnanimous assurances might be in place there are some things best passed over he said let sleeping dogs lie i think the less we talk about last night the better i hope i am generous enough not to want to rub it in amy not to make you more uncomfortable than you are mrs ames sat down in a chair by the fireplace a huge fire burned there altogether disproportionate to the day and she screened her face from the blaze with the morning paper also she made a mental note to speak to parker about it you are making me very uncomfortable indeed lyndhurst she said by not telling me what i ask you did you let it pass when you saw james thought i was drunk yes he didnt say so in so many words if he had said so well i dare say i should havehave made some sort of answer and mind you it was no accusation he made against you he made an excuse for you mrs ames small insignificant face grew suddenly very firm and fixed we do not need to go into that she said you saw he thought i was drunk and said nothing and after that you mean to go over and shoot his pheasants is that so certainly it is you are making a mountain out of i am making no mountain out of anything personally i dont believe cousin james thought anything of the kind what matters is that you let it pass what matters is that i should have to tell you that you must apologize to me instead of your seeing it for yourself major ames got up pushing his chair violently back well heres a pretty state of things he cried that you should be telling me to apologize for last nights degrading exhibition i wonder what youll be asking next a vote of thanks from the mayor i shouldnt wonder and an illuminated address you teaching me what i ought to do i should have thought a woman would have been only too glad to trust to her husband if he was so kind as i have been as to want to get her out of the consequences of her folly and now its you who must sit there opposite a fire fit to roast an ox and tell me i must apologize apologies be damned there its not my habit to swear as you well know but there are occasions apologies be damned and a moment later the house shook with the thunder of the slammed front door mrs ames sat for a couple of minutes exactly where she was still shielding her face from the fire she felt all the chilling effects of the reaction that follows on excitement whether the excitement is rapturous or as sickening as last nights had been but not for a moment did she regret her share either in the events of the evening before or in the sequel of this morning last night had ended in utter fiasco but she had done her best this mornings talk had ended in a pretty sharp quarrel but again she found it impossible to reconsider her share in it humanly she felt beaten and ridiculed and sick at heart but not ashamed she had passed a sleepless night and was horribly tired with that tiredness that seems to sap all pluck and power of resistance and gradually her eyes grew dim and the difficult meagre tears of middle age which are so bitter began to roll down her cheeks and the hard inelastic sobs to rise in her throat yet it was no use sitting here crying lunch and dinner had to be ordered whether she felt unhappy or not she had to see how extensive was the damage done to her pink satin shoes by the wet pavements last night she had to speak about this oxroasting fire also there was appointed a suffragette meeting at mr turners house for eleven oclock at which past achievements and future plans would be discussed she had barely time to wash her face for it was unthinkable that parker or the cook should see she had been crying and get through her household duties before it was time to start she dried her eyes and went to the window through which streamed the pale saffroncoloured october sunshine all the stormy trouble of the night had passed and the air sparkled with the clear shining after rain but the frost of a few nights before had blackened the autumn flowers and the chill rain had beaten down the glory of her husbands chrysanthemums so that the gardenbeds looked withered and dishevelled like those whose interest in life is finished and who no longer care what appearance they present the interest of others in them seemed to be finished also it was not the gardeners day here for he only came twice in the week and major ames who should have been assiduous in binding up the brokenstemmed encouraging the invalids and clearing away the havoc wrought by the storm had left the house perhaps he had gone to the club perhaps even now he was trying to make light of it all she could almost hear him say women get queer notions into their heads and the notions run away with them bless them youll take a glass of sherry with me general wont you are you by any chance going to sir james shoot next week im shooting there one day or was he talking it over somewhere else perhaps not making light of it she did not know all she knew was that she was alone and wanted somebody who understood even if he disagreed it did not seem to matter that lyndhurst utterly disagreed with her what mattered was that he had misunderstood her motives so entirely that the monstrous implication that she had been intoxicated seemed to him an excuse and he was not sorry what could she do since he was not sorry it was as difficult to answer that as it was easy to know what to do the moment he was sorry indeed then it would be unnecessary to do anything the reconciliation would be automatic and would bring with it something she yearned after an opportunity of making him see that she cared that the woman in her reached out towards him in some different fashion now from that in which she had tried to recapture the semblance of youth and his awakened admiration today she looked back on that episode shamefacedly she had taken so much trouble with so paltry a purpose and yet that innocent and natural coquetry was not quite dead in her no womans heart need be so old that it no longer cares whether she is pleasing in her husbands eyes only today it seemed to mrs ames that her pains had been as disproportionate to her purpose as they had been to its result now she longed to take pains for a purpose that was somewhat deeper than that for which she softened her wrinkles and refreshed the colour of her hair she turned from the window and the empty garden wishing that the rain would be renewed so that there would be an excuse for her to go to mr turners in a shut cab as it was there was no such excuse and she felt that it would require an effort to walk past the club window and to traverse the length of the high street female riseborough on this warm sunny morning she knew would be there in force popping in and out of shops and holding little conversations on the pavement there would be but one topic today and for many days yet it would be long before the autumn novelty lost anything of its freshness she wondered how her appearance in the town would be greeted would people smile and turn aside as she approached and whisper or giggle after she had gone by what of the mayor who like an honest tradesman was often to be seen at the door of his shop or looking at the dressing of his windows a policeman always stood at the bottom of the street controlling the crosstraffic from st barnabas road would he be that one who had helped to further her movements last night she almost felt she ought to thank him and then quite suddenly her pluck returned again or it was that she realized that she did not comparatively speaking care two straws for any individual comment or byplay that might take place in the high street or for its accumulated weight there were other things to care about for them she cared immensely the high street proved to be paved with incident turning quickly round the corner she nearly ran into bill the policeman off duty at this hour and obviously giving a humorous recital of some sort to a small amused circle outside the publichouse it was abruptly discontinued when she appeared and she felt that the interest that his audience developed in the sunny october sky which they contemplated with faint grins would be succeeded by stifled laughter after she had passed a few paces further on controlling the traffic of marketday was her other policeman bill who smiled in a pleasant and familiar manner to her as if there was some capital joke private to them twenty yards further along the street was standing the mayor contemplating his shopwindow he saw her and urgent business appeared to demand his presence inside after that there came general fortescue tottering to the club he crossed the street to meet her and took off his hat and shook hands by jove mrs ames he said i never enjoyed a meeting so much and my wifes wild that she didnt go what a lark made me feel quite young again i wanted to shout too and tell them to give the ladies a vote monstrously amusing just going to the club to have a chat about it all and he went on his way with his fat old body shaking with laughter then feeling rather ill from this encounter she heard rapid steps in pursuit of her and mrs altham joined her oh mrs ames she said i could die of vexation that i was not there is it really true that you threw a glass of water at mr chilcot and hit the policeman fancy that it should have been such a terribly wet night and henry and i just sat at home never thinking that five minutes in a cab would make such a difference we sat and played patience i should have been most impatient if i had known and what is to happen next it was so stupid of me not to join your league i wonder if it is too late this was quite dreadful mrs ames had been prepared for her husbands anger and for pride and aversion from people like mrs altham what was totally unexpected and unwelcome was that she was supposed to have scored a sort of popular success that riseborough considered the dreadful fiasco of last night as an achievement something not only to talk about but a kind of new game more exciting than croquet or criticism she had begun by thinking of the suffragette movement as an autumn novelty but leanness came very near her soul when she found that it now appeared to others as she had first thought of it herself she had travelled since then she had seen the hinterland of it the idea that rose up behind it austere and beautiful and wise all that these others saw was just the hysterical jungle that bounded the coast to her this morning after her experience of it the hysterical jungle seemedan hysterical jungle if it was only by that route that the heights could be attained then that route must be followed she was willing to try it again but was there not somewhere and somehow a better road it was not necessary to be particularly cordial to mrs altham and she held out no certain prospect of an immediate repetition of last nights scenes nor of a desire for additional recruits but further trials awaited her in this short walk dr evans driving the highstepping cob wheeled round and dismounted throwing the reins to the groom i must just congratulate you he said for millie told me about last night ive been telling her that if she had half your pluck she would be the better for it i hope you didnt catch cold beastly night wasnt it do let me know when it will come on again i hate your principles you know but i love your practise i shall come and shout too this was perfectly awful nobody understood they all sympathized with her but cared not two straws for that which had prompted her to do these sensational things they liked the sensational things it was fun to them but it was no fun to those who believed in the principles which prompted them they thought of her as a clown at a pantomime they wanted to see dan leno she was some minutes late when she reached mr turners house depressed and not encouraged by this uncomprehending applause that took as an excellent joke all the manifestations which had been directed by so serious a purpose what to her was tragic and necessary was to them a farce of entertaining quality but now she would meet her coreligionists again those who knew those whose convictions of the same quality as hers were of such weight as to make her feel that even her quarrel with lyndhurst was light in comparison the jovial turner family father mother daughter were in the drawingroom and they hailed her as a heroine if it had not been for her there would have been no scene at all did the policemen hurt mr turner had got a small bruise on his knee but it was quite doubtful whether he got it when he was taken out mrs turner had lost a small pearl ornament but she was not sure whether she had put it on before going to the meeting miss turner had a cold today but it was certain that she had felt it coming on before they were all put out into the rain none of them had seen the end it was supposed that mrs ames had thrown a glass of water at a policeman and had hit mr chilcot they were all quite ready for sir james next meeting or would he be a coward and cause scrutiny to be held on those who desired admittance mrs brooks arrived she had not been turned out last night but she had caught cold and did not think that much had been achieved mr chilcot had made his speech apparently a very clever one about tariff reform and sir james had followed without interruption telling the half empty but sympathetic benches about the house of lords there had been no allusion made to the disturbance or to the motives that prompted it also she had lost her suffragette rosette it must have been torn off her though she did not feel it go mrs currie brought more life into the proceedings she could get four porters to come to the next meeting and could make another banner as well as ensuring the proper unfurling of the first which had stuck so unaccountably it had waved quite properly when she had tried it an hour before and it had waved quite properly for it had been returned to her after she had been ejected when she tried it again an hour later at home two banners expanding properly would be a vastly different affair from one that did not expand at all her husband had laughed fit to do himself a damage over her account of the proceedings a dozen more only of the league made an appearance for clearly there was a reaction and a cooling after last nights conflagration but all paid their meed of appreciation to mrs ames their little rockets had but fizzed and spluttered until she showed them the way as mrs currie expressed it but to them even it was the ritual so to speak the disturbance the shouting the sense of doing something rather than the belief that lay behind the ritual which stirred their imaginations could the cause be better served by the endurance of an hours solitary toothache than by waving banners in the town hall and being humanely ejected by benevolent policemen there would have been less eagerness to suffer and mrs ames would so willingly have passed many hours of physical pain rather than suffer the heartache which troubled her this morning and nobody seemed to understand mrs currie with her four porters and two banners mrs brooks with her cold in the head and odour of eucalyptus the cheerful turners who thought it would be such a good idea to throw squibs on to the platform were all as far from the point as general fortescue chatting at the club or even as lyndhurst with the highchipped bacon and the slammed front door it was a game to them as it had originally presented itself to her an autumn novelty for say thursday afternoon from five till seven if only the opposite effects had been produced if they all had taken it as poignantly as lyndhurst and he as cheerily as they he meantime after slamming the front door had stormed up st barnabas road in so sincere a passion that he had nearly reached the club before he remembered that he had hardly touched his breakfast or glanced at the paper so as there was no sense in starving himself the starvation consisting in only having half his breakfast he turned in at those hospitable doors and ordered himself an omelette never in his life had he been so angry never in the amazing chronicle of matrimony so it seemed to him had a man received such provocation from his wife she had insulted the guests who had dined with her she made a public and stupendous ass of herself and when next morning he after making such expostulations as he was morally bound to make had been so nobly magnanimous as to assure her that he would patch it all up for her and live it down with her he had been told that it was for him to apologize no wonder he had sworn moses would have sworn it would have been absolutely wrong of him not to swear there were situations in which it was cowardly for a man not to say what he thought even now as he waited for his omelette he emitted little squeaks and explosive exclamations almost incredulous of his wrongs he ate his omelette which seemed but to add fuel to his rage and went into the smokingroom where over a club cigar for he had actually forgotten to bring his own case with him he turned to the consideration of practical details it was not clear how to reenter his house again he had gone out with a bang that made the windows rattle but it was hardly possible to go on banging the door each time he went in and out for no joinery would stand these reiterated shocks and what was to be done even if he could devise an effective reentry unless amy put herself into his hands and unreservedly took back all that she had said it was impossible for him to speak to her somehow he felt that there were few things less likely to happen than this certainly it would be no good to resume storming operations for he had no guns greater than those he had already fired and if they were not of sufficient calibre he must just beleaguer her with silencedignified displeased silence he looked up and saw that mr altham was regarding him through the glass door upon which mr altham rapidly withdrew not long afterwards young morton occupied and retired from the same observatory a moments reflection enabled major ames to construe this singular behaviour they had heard of his wifes conduct and were gluttonously feeding on so unusual a spectacle as himself in the club at this hour and reconstructing in their monkeyminds his domestic disturbances they would probably ascertain that he had breakfasted here it was all exceedingly unpleasant there was no sympathy in their covert glances only curiosity no one who is not a brute and major ames was not that enjoys a quarrel with his wife and no one who is not utterly selfcentred and he was not quite that either fails to desire sympathy when such a quarrel has occurred he wanted sympathy now he wanted to pour out into friendly ears the tale of amys misdeeds of his own magnanimity to hear his own estimation of his conduct confirmed fairly confirmed by a woman who would see the womans point of view as well as his the smokingroom with these peeping toms was untenable but he thought he knew where he could get sympathy millie was in and would see him from habit as he crossed the hall he looked to the peg where dr evans hung his hat and coat and seeing they were not there inferred that the doctor was out that suited him he wanted to confide and be sympathized with and felt that evans breezy optimism and outofdoor habit of mind would not supply the kind of comfort he felt in need of he wanted to be told he was a martyr and a very fine fellow and that amy was unworthy of him millie was in the green cool drawingroom where they had sat one day after lunch she rose as he entered and came towards him with a tremulous smile on her lips and both hands outstretched dear lyndhurst she said i am so glad you have come sit down i think if you had not come i should have telephoned to ask if you would not see me i should have suggested our taking a little walk perhaps for i do not think i could have risked seeing cousin amy i know how you feel oh so well it was abominable disgraceful certainly he had come to the right place millie understood him he had guessed she would she sat down close beside him and for a moment held her hand over her eyes ah i have been so angry this morning she said and it has given me a headache wilfred laughed about it all he said also that what amy did showed a tremendous lot of pluck it was utterly heartless i knew how you must be suffering and i was so angry with him he did not understand oh no my headache is nothing it will soon be gonenow she faintly emphasized the last word stroked it so to speak as if calling attention to it im brokenhearted about it said major ames which sounded better than to say im in a purple rage about it im brokenhearted shes disgraced herself and me no not you yes a woman cant do that sort of thing without the world believing that her husband knew about it and thats not all upon my word im not sure whether what she did this morning isnt worse than what you saw last night millie leaned forward tell me she said if it doesnt hurt you too much he decided it did not hurt him too much well i came down this morning he said willing and eager to make the best of a bad job so were we all james westbourne last night was just as generous and asked the reporters to say nothing about it and invited me to a days shooting next week very decent of him as i say i came down this morning willing to make it as easy as i could of course i knew i had to give amy a good talking to i should utterly have failed in my duty to her as a husband if i did not do that i gave her a blowingup though not half of what she deserved but a blowing up even then when i had said my say i told her we would live it down together which was sufficiently generous i think but for her good i told her that james westbourne said he saw she was unwell and that when a man says that he means that she is drunk perhaps westbourne didnt mean that but thats what it sounded like and would you believe it just because i hadnt knocked him down and stamped on his face she tells me i ought to apologize to her for letting such a suggestion pass well i flared up at that what man of spirit wouldnt have flared up i left the house at once and went and finished my breakfast at the club i should have chokedupon my word i should have choked if i had stopped there or got an apoplexy as it is i feel devilish unwell millie got up and stood for a moment in silence looking out of the window white and willowy i can never forgive cousin amy she said at length never well it is hard said major ames and after all these years it isnt exactly the return one might expect perhaps it is infamous said millie she came and sat down by him again what are you going to do she asked i dont know if she apologizes i shall forgive her and i shall try to forget but i didnt think it of her and if she doesnt apologizei dont know i cant be expected to eat my words that would be countenancing what she has done i couldnt do it it would not be sincere im straight i hope if i say a thing it may be taken for granted that i mean it she looked up at him with her chin raised i think you are wonderful she said to be able even to think of forgiving her if i had behaved like that i should not expect wilfred to forgive me but then you are so big so big she does not understand you she cant understand one thing about you she doesnt knowoh how blind some women are it was little wonder that by this time major ames was beginning to feel an extraordinarily fine fellow nor was it more wonderful that he basked in the warm sense of being understood but from the first millie had understood him he felt that particularly now at this moment when amy had so hideously flouted and wronged him all through this last summer the situation of today had been foreshadowed it had always been in this house rather than in his own that he had been welcomed and appreciated he had been the architect and adviser in the shakespeare ball while at home amy dealt out her absurd printed menucards without consulting him and the garden which he lovedwho had so often said these sweet flowers are they really for me who on the other hand had so often said the sweetpeas are not doing very well are they and then he looked at millies soft youthful face her eyes that sought his in timid sensitive appeal her dim golden hair her mouth childish and mysterious for contrast there was the small strong toads face the rather beady eyes the hairgrey or brown which was it also millie understood she saw him as he wasgenerous perhaps to a fault but big big as she had so properly said she always made him feel so comfortable so contented with himself that was the true substance of a womans mission to make her husband happy to make him devoted to her instead of raising hell in the town hall and insisting on apologies afterwards youve cheered me up millie he said youve made me feel that ive got a friend after all a friend who feels with me im grateful imim more than grateful im a tough old fellow but ive got a heart still i believe whats to happen to us all it was emotion real and genuine emotion that made millie clever at that moment her mind was of no high order she might if she thought about a thing be trusted to exhibit nothing more subtle than a fair grasp of the obvious but now she did not think she was prompted by an instinct that utterly transcended any achievement of which her brain was capable go back to your house she said and be ready for cousin amy to say she is sorry very likely she is waiting for you there now oh lyndhurst he got up at once those few words made him feel completely noble they made her feel noble likewise the atmosphere of nobility was almost suffocating you are right he said you are always all that is right and good and delicious ha there was no question about the cousinly relations between them so natural and spontaneous a caress needed no explanation the house was apparently empty when he got back but he made sufficiently noisy an entry to advise the drawingroom in any case that he was returned and personally ready since he did not enter full of wrath like hyperion to accept apologies eventually he went in there as if to look for a paper in case of its being occupied and with the same pretext strolled into his wifes sittingroom then still casually he went into his dressingroom where he had slept last night and satisfied himself that she was not in her bedroom her penitence therefore which would naturally be manifested by her waiting dimeyed for his return had not been of any peremptory quality he went out into the garden and surveyed the damage of last nights rain there was no need to punish the plants because amy had been guilty of behaviour which her own cousin said was infamous he also wanted something to employ himself with till lunchtime as his hands worked mechanically tying up some clumps of chrysanthemums which had a few days more of flame in their golden hearts removing a dbris of dead leaves and fallen twigs his mind was busy also working not mechanically but eagerly and excitedly how different was the sympathy with which he was welcomed and comforted by millie from the misunderstandings and quarrels which made him feel that he had wasted his years with one who was utterly unappreciative of him yet if amy was sorry he was ready to do his best but he wondered whether he wanted her to be sorry or not at halfpast one the bell for lunch sounded and going into the drawingroom he found that she had returned and was writing a note at her table she did not look up but said to him just as if nothing had happened will you go in and begin lyndhurst i want to finish my note he did not answer but passed into the diningroom in a little while she joined him there seems to have been a good deal of rain in the night she said i am afraid your flowers have suffered certainly this did not look like penitence and he had no reply for her in some strange way this seemed to him the dignified and proper course then mrs ames spoke for the third time i think lyndhurst if we are not going to talk she said i shall see what news there is parker please fetch me the morning paper at that moment he hated her chapter xiii three days later major ames was walking back home in the middle of the afternoon returning from the house in which he had lately spent so considerable a portion of his time but this was the last day on which he would go there nor would he except for this one time more cross the threshold of his own house the climax had come and within an hour or two he and millie were going to leave riseborough together now that their decision had been made it seemed to him that it had been inevitable from the first ever since the summer when from some mixture of genuine liking and false gallantry he had allowed himself to drift into relations with her the force that drew and held him had steadily increased in strength and today it had proved itself irresistible the determining factor no doubt had been his quarrel with his wife that gave the impulse that had been still lacking the final push which upset the equilibrium of that which was tottering and ready to fall over the scene this afternoon had been both short and quiet as such scenes are dr evans had been called up to town on business yesterday morning returning possibly this evening but more probably tomorrow and they had lunched alone afterwards major ames had again spoken of his wife the situation is intolerable he had said i cant stand it if it wasnt for you millie i should go away she had come close to him im not very happy either she said if it wasnt for you i dont think i could stand it and then it was already inevitable its too strong for us she said we cant help it i will face anything with you we will go right away lyndhurst and live instead of being starved like this she took both his hands in hers completely carried away for the first time in her life by something outside herself treacherous and mean as was that course on which she was determined she was perhaps a finer woman at this moment of supreme disloyalty than in all the years of her blameless married life ive never loved before lyndhurst she said quietly nor have i ever known what it meant now i cant consider anything else it doesnt matter what happens to wilfred and elsie nothing matters except you this time it was not he who kissed her it was she who pressed her mouth to his there was but little to settle their plans were perfectly simple and ruthless they would cross over to boulogne that night and as soon as the law set them free marry each other a train to folkestone left riseborough in a little over an hours time running in connection with the boat they could easily catch it but it was wiser not to go to the station together they would meet there as he walked home through the gleaming october afternoon major ames was conscious neither of struggle nor regret the power which millie had had over him all these months so that it was she always who really took the lead and urged him one step forward and then another gripped him and led him on here to the last step of all he still obeyed and followed that slender fragile woman who so soon would be his it was as necessary to do her bidding here as it had been to kiss her when first under the mulberrytree she had put up her face towards his these last days seemed to have killed all sense of loyalty and manhood within him he gave no thought at all to his wife and thought of harry only as amys son besides he was not responsible man though he was he was completely in the hands of this woman all his life he had had no real principles to direct him he had lived a decent life only because no temptation to live otherwise had ever really come near him and even now it was in no way the wickedness of what he purposed that at all dragged him back it was mere timidity at taking an irrevocable step amy he knew was out at breakfast she had announced to him that she did not expect to be in till dinnertime and he had told her that he would be out for dinner such sentences dealing with household arrangements had been the sum of their discourse for the last days and they were spoken not so much to each other as to the air heard by rather than addressed to any one in particular and yet the prospect of the life that should open for him when once this irrevocable step had been taken did not fill him with the resistless longing which though it cannot excuse at any rate accounts for the step itself millie though throughout she had led him on until the climax was reached had at least the authentic goad to drive her life with him seemed to her to be real life it was passionately that she desired it but with him apart from the force with which she dominated him it was the escape from the very uncomfortable circumstances of home that chiefly attracted him in a way he loved her he felt for her a warmth and a tenderness of stronger quality than he could remember having ever experienced before and since it is not given to all men to love violently it may be granted that he was feeling the utmost fire of which his nature was capable but it was of sufficient ardour to burn up in his mind the rubbish of minor considerations and material exigencies cabs were of infrequent occurrence at this far end of st barnabas road and meeting one by hazard just outside his house he told the driver to wait then letting himself in he went straight up to his dressingroom there was not time for him to pack his whole wardrobe and a moderate portmanteau would be all he really needed and here the trivialities began to wax huge and engrossing though the afternoon was warm it would no doubt be fresh if not chilly on the boat and it would certainly be advisable to take his thick overcoat which at present had not left its summer quarters those were in a big cupboard in the passage outside overlooking the garden where it was packed away with prophylactic little balls of naphthaline these had impregnated it somewhat powerfully but it was better to be odorously than insufficiently clad passing the window he saw that the chrysanthemums had responded bravely to his comforting a few mornings ago if there was no more frost they would be gay for another fortnight yet should he take a bouquet of them with him he did not see why he should not have the enjoyment of them yet there was scarcely time to pick them he must hurry on with the packing of his small portmanteau which presented endless problems a panama hat should certainly be included also a pair of white tennis shoes in which he saw himself promenading on the parade a white flannel suit though it was october seemed to complete the costume he need not cumber himself with a dress coat a dinner jacket was all that would be necessary she had told him she had six hundred a year of her own he had another three it was annoying that his sponge was rather ragged he had meant to buy a new one this morning perhaps parker could draw it together with a bit of thread an untidy sponge always vexed him it was unsoldierly and slovenly show me a mans washhandstand he had once said and ill tell you about the owner his own did not invite inspection with its straggly sponge then for a moment all these trivialities stood away from him and for an interval he saw where he stood and what he was doingthe vileness the sordidness the vulgarity of it high principles nobility of life were not subjects with which hitherto he had much concerned himself and it would be useless to expect that they should come to his rescue now but for this moment his kindliness such as it was his affection for his wife such as it was but above all the continuous unbroken smug respectability of his days read him a formidable indictment what could he plead against such an accusation no irresistible or imperative necessity of soul that claimed millie as his by right of love he knew that his desire for her was not of that fiery order for he could see undazzled and unburned the qualities which attracted him he admired her frail beauty the youth that still encompassed her he fed with the finest appetite on the devotion and admiration which she brought him he loved being the god and the hero of this attractive woman and it was this far more than the devotion he brought her that dominated him respectability cried out against him and his foolishness there would be no more strutting and swelling about the club among the mild and honourable men who frequented it and looked up to him as an authority on india and gardening nor any more of those pompous and satisfactory evenings when general fortescue assured him that there was not such a good glass of port in kent as that with which the major supplied his guests to be known as major ames late of the indian army had been to command respect now the less that he was known as major ames late of riseborough the better would be the chance of being held in esteem and to what sort of life would he condemn the woman who for his sake was leaving a respectability no less solid than his own to the companionship of such as herself to the soiled doves of a french wateringplace that of course would be but a temporary habitation but after that what where was the society which would receive them by which there would be any satisfaction in being received neither of them had the faintest touch of bohemianism in their natures both were of the school that is accustomed to silver teapots and life in houses with a garden behind for a moment he hesitated as he folded back the sleeves of his dinnerjacket then the tide of trivialities swept over him again and he noticed that there was a spot of spilled wax on the cuff among other engagements that saturday afternoon mrs ames was occupied with the decoration of st barnabas church for the sunday service next day and she had gone there after lunch with an adornment of foliage tinted red by october for she had not felt disposed to ask lyndhurst if she might pick the remnant of his chrysanthemums she too like him felt the impossibility of the present situation and as she worked she asked herself if it was in any way in her power to end this parody of domestic life every day she had made the attempt to begin the breaking of this ridiculous and most uncomfortable silence which lay between them by the introduction of ordinary topics hoping by degrees to build up again the breach that yawned between them but at present she had got no sense of the slightest answering effort on his side psychically no less than conversationally he had nothing whatever to say to her if in the common courtesies of daily life he had nothing for her it seemed idle to hope to find further receptiveness if she opened discussion of their quarrel besides a certain very natural pride blocked her way he owed her an apology and when she indicated that he had sworn at her it did not seem unreasonable even when decorating a church to expect the initiatory step to be taken by him but what if he did not do so mrs ames gave a little sigh and her mouth and throat worked uncomfortably the quarrel was so childish yet it was serious for it was not a light thing whatever her provocation might have been to pass days like these halfadozen times she went over the circumstances and halfadozen times she felt that it was only just that he should make the advance to her or at any rate behave with ordinary courtesy in answer to her ordinary civilities it was true that the original dissension was due to her but she believed with her whole heart in the cause for which she provoked it all these last months she had felt her nature expand under the influence of this idea she knew herself to be a better and a bigger woman than she had been she believed in the rights of her sex but had they not their duties too it was nearly twentyfive years since she had voluntarily undertaken a certain duty what if that came first before any rights or privileges what if that which she had undertaken then as a duty was in itself a right yet even then what could she do in itself she was very far from being ashamed of the part she had taken yet was it possible to weigh this independently without considering the points at which it conflicted with duties which certainly concerned her no less she could not hope to convince her husband of the justice of the cause nor of the expediency of promoting it in ways like these for herself she knew the justice of it and saw no other expedient for promoting it those who had worked for the cause for years said that all else had been tried that there remained only this violent crusading but was not she personally considering what her husband felt about it debarred from taking part in the crusade she had deeply offended and vexed him could anything but the stringency of moral law justify that nothing that he had done nothing that he could do short of the violation of the essential principles of married life could absolve her from the accomplishment of one tittle of her duty towards him for a moment in spite of her perplexity and the difficulty of her decision mrs ames smiled at herself for the mental use of all these great words like duty and privilege over so small an incident for what had happened she had been a militant suffragette on one occasion only and at breakfast next morning he had in matters arising therefrom allowed himself to swear at her yet it seemed to her that with all the pettiness and insignificance of it great laws were concerned for the law of kindness is broken by the most trumpery exhibition of inconsiderateness the law of generosity by the most minute word of spite or backbiting indeed it is chiefly in little things since most of us are not concerned with great matters that these violations occur and in cups of cold water that they are fulfilled and for once mrs ames did not finish her decoration with tidiness and precision a fact clearly noted by mrs altham next day there was a suffragette meeting at four but she was prepared to be late for that or if necessary to fail in attendance altogether in any case she would call in at home on her way there on the chance that her husband might be in she made no definite plan it was impossible to forecast her share in the interview but she had determined to try to suffer long to be kind to keep the promise of twentyfive years ago there was a cab drawn up at the entrance and it vaguely occurred to her that millie might be here for she had not seen her for some days and it was possible she might have called yet it was hardly likely that she would have waited since the servants would have told her that she herself was not expected home till dinnertime or was lyndhurst giving her tea and mrs ames grew suddenly alert again about matters to which she had scarcely given a thought during these last months she let herself in and went to the drawingroom there was no one there nor in the little room next it where they assembled before dinner on nights when they gave a party but directly overhead she heard steps moving that was in lyndhursts dressingroom she went up there knocked and in answer to his assent went in the portmanteau was nearly packed he stood in shirtsleeves by it in his hand was his spongebaghe had anticipated the entry of parker with the stitched sponge she looked from the portmanteau to him and back and back again you are going away lyndhurst she asked he made a ghastly attempt to devise a reasonable answer and thought he succeeded yes im goinggoing to your cousins to shoot i told you he had asked me you objected to my going but im going all the same i should have left you a note back tomorrow night then she felt she knew all as certainly as if he had told her since when has cousin james been giving shooting parties on sunday she asked please dont lie to me lyndhurst it makes it much worse you are not going to cousin james andyou are not going alone shall i tell you any more she was not guessing all the events of the last month the shakespeare ball harrogate their own quarrel and on the top this foolish lie about a shooting party made a series of data which proclaimed the conclusion and the suddenness of the discovery the magnitude of the issues involved but served to steady her there was an authentic valour in her nature even as she had stood up to interrupt the political meeting without so much as dreaming of shirking her part so now her pause was not timorous but rather the rallying of all her forces that came eager and undismayed to her summons apparently lyndhurst did not want to be told any more he did not at any rate ask for it just then parker came in with the mended sponge she gave it him and he stood with spongebag in one hand sponge in the other shall i bring up tea maam she said to mrs ames yes take it to the drawingroom now and send the cab away the major wont want it lyndhurst crammed the sponge into its bag i shall want the cab parker he said dont send it away mrs ames whisked round on parker with amazing rapidity do as i tell you parker she said and be quick it was a mere conflict of will that for the next five seconds silently raged between them but as definite and as hardhitting as any affair of the prize ring and it was impossible that there should be any but the one end to it for mrs ames devoted her whole strength and will to it while from the first her husbands heart was not in the battle but she was fighting for her all and not only her all but his and not only his but millies three existences were at stake and the ruin of two homes was being hazarded and when he spoke she knew she was winning i must go he said she will be waiting at the station she will wait to no purpose said mrs ames she will beno word seemed adequatebe furious he said a man cannot treat a woman like that any blow would do he had no defence she could strike him as she pleased elsie comes home next week she said a pleasant homecoming and harry will have to leave cambridge but i love her he said nonsense my dear she said men dont ruin the women they love men i mean that stung she meant that it should but men keep their word he said let me pass keep your word to me said she and try to help poor millie to keep hers to her husband it is not a fine thing to steal a mans wife lyndhurst it is much finer to be respectable respectable he said and to what has respectability brought us you and me i mean not to disgrace anyhow she said its too late said he never quite too late thank god she said mrs ames gave a little sigh she knew she had won and quite suddenly all her strength seemed to leave her her little trembling legs refused to uphold her a curious buzzing was in her ears and a crinkled mist swam before her eyes lyndhurst im afraid i am going to make a goose of myself and faint she said just help me to my room and get parker she swayed and tottered and he only just caught her before she fell he laid her down on the floor and opened the door and window wide there was a flask of brandy in his portmanteau laid on the top designed to be easily accessible in case of an inclement crossing of the channel he mixed a tablespoonful of this with a little water and as she moved and opened her eyes again he knelt down on the floor by her supporting her take a sip of this amy he said she obeyed him thank you my dear she said i am better so silly of me another sip then you want to make me drunk lyndhurst she said then she smiled it would be a pity to lose the opportunity for a humorous allusion to what at the time had been so far from humour really drunk this time she said and then you tell cousin james he was right she let herself rest longer than was physically necessary in the encircling crook of his arm and let herself keep her eyes closed though if she had been alone she would most decidedly have opened them but those first few minutes had somehow to be traversed and she felt that silence bridged them over better than speech it was appropriate too that his arm should be round her there i am better she said at length let me get up lyndhurst thank you for looking after me she got on to her feet but then sat down again in his easychair not quite steady yet he said very nearly i shall be quite ready to come downstairs and give you your tea by the time you have unpacked your little portmanteau she did not even look at him but sat turned away from him and the little portmanteau but she heard the rustle of paper the opening and shutting of drawers the sound of metallic articles of toilet being deposited on dressingtable and washingstand after that came the click of a hasp then she got up now let us have tea she said and if millie comes he asked she had been determined that he should mention her name first but when once he had mentioned it she was more than ready to discuss the questions that naturally arose you mean she may come back here to see what has happened to you she asked that is well thought of dear let us see but we will go downstairs she thought intently as they descended the staircase and busied herself with teamaking before she got to her conclusion she will ask for you she said if she comes and it would not be very wise for you to see her on the other hand she must be told what has happened i will see her then it would be best that way major ames got up no i cant have that he said i cant have that my dear you have got to have it you are in a dreadful mess i as your wife am the only person who can get you out of it i will do my best anyhow she rang the bell i am going to tell parker to tell millie that you are at home if she asks for you and to show her in here she said there is no other way that i can see i do not intend to have nothing more to do with her at least i want to avoid that if possible for that is a weak way out of difficulties i shall certainly have to see her some time and there is no use in putting it off i am afraid lyndhurst that you had better finish your tea at once or take it upstairs take another cup upstairs you have had but one and drink it in your dressingroom in the comfortable chair there was an extraordinary wisdom in this minute attention to detail and it was by this that she was able to rise to a big occasion it was necessary that he should feel that her full intention was to forgive him and make the best of the days that lay before them she had no great words and noble sentiment with which to convey this impression but in a measure she could show him her mind by minute arrangements for his comfort but he lingered irresolute you have got to trust me she said do as i tell you my dear she had not long to wait after he had gone upstairs she heard the ring at the bell and next moment millie came into the room her face was flushed her breathing hurried her eyes alight with trouble suspense and resentment lyndhurst she began i waited then she saw mrs ames and turned confusedly about as if to leave the room again but amy got up quickly come and sit down at once millie she said we have got to talk so let us make it as easy as we can for each other millie was holding her muff up to her face and peered at her from above it wildeyed terrified it isnt you i want she said where is lyndhurst ii had an appointment with him he was latewewe were going a drive together what do you know cousin amy she almost shrieked and where is he sit down millie as i tell you said mrs ames very quietly there is nothing to be frightened at i know everything we were going a drive began millie again still looking wildly about he did not come and i was frightened i came to see where he was i asked you if you knewif you knew anything about him did i not why do you say you know everything suddenly mrs ames saw that there was something here infinitely more worthy of pity than she had suspected there was no question as to the agonized earnestness that underlay this futile childish repetition of nonsense and with that there came into her mind a greater measure of understanding with regard to her husband it was not so wonderful that he had been unable to resist the face that had drawn him let us behave like sensible women millie she said you have come down from the station lyndhurst was not there do you want me to tell you anything more millie wavered where she stood then she stumbled into a chair has he given me up she said yes if you care to put it like that it would be truer to say that he has saved you and himself but he is not coming with you you made him she asked i helped to make him said mrs ames millie got up again i want to see him she said you dont understand cousin amy he has got to come i dont care whether it is wicked or not i love him you dont understand him either you dont know how splendid he is he is unhappy at home he has often told me so mrs ames took hold of the wretched woman by both hands you are raving millie she said you must stop being hysterical you hardly know whom you are talking to if you do not pull yourself together i shall send for your husband and say you have been taken ill millie gave a sudden gasp of laughter oh i am not so stupid as you think she said wilfred is away where is lyndhurst mrs ames did not let go of her millie she said if you are not sensible at once i will tell you i shall do i shall call parker and together we will put you into your cab and you shall be driven straight home i am perfectly serious i hope you will not oblige me to do that you will be much wiser to pull yourself together and let us have a talk but understand one thing quite clearly you are not going to see lyndhurst the tension of those wide childish eyes slowly relaxed and her head sank forward and there came the terrible and blessed tears in wild cataract and streaming storm and mrs ames looking at her felt all her righteousness relax she had only pity for this poor destitute soul who was blind to all else by force of that mysterious longing which in itself is so divine that though it desires the disgraceful and the impossible it cannot wholly make itself abominable nor discrown itself of its royalty something of the truth of that though no more than mere fragments and moulted feather came to mrs ames now as she sat waiting till the tempest of tears should have abated the royal eagle had passed over her as sign of his passage there was this feather that had fallen and she understood its significance slowly the tears ceased and the sobs were still and millie raised her dim swollen eyes i had better go home she said i wonder if you would let me wash my face cousin amy i must be a perfect fright yes dear millie said she but there is no hurry see shall i send your cab back to your house it has your luggage on it yes then parker shall go with it and tell them to take it back to your room and unpack it and put everything back in place afterwards when we have talked a little i will walk back with you again the comfort of having little things attended to reached millie that and the sense that she was not quite alone she was like a child that has been naughty and has been punished and she did not much care whether she had been naughty or not what she wanted primarily was to be comforted to be assured that everybody was not going to be angry with her for ever then returning mrs ames made her some fresh tea and that comforted her too but i dont see how i can ever be happy again she said there was something childlike about this as well as childish no millie said the other none of us three see that exactly we shall all have to be very patient very patient and ordinary there was a long silence i must tell you one thing said millie though i daresay that will make you hate me more but it was my fault from the first i led him onii didnt let him kiss me i made him kiss me it was like that all through she felt that mrs ames was waiting for something more and she knew exactly what it was but it required a greater effort to speak of that than she could at once command at last she raised her eyes to those of mrs ames no never she said mrs ames nodded i see she said baldly now as i said we have got to be patient and ordinary we have got you and i to begin again you have your husband so have i men are so easily pleased and made happy it would be a shame if we failed again the helpless puzzled look came over millies face but i dont see how to begin she said tomorrow for instance what am i to do all tomorrow i shall only be thinking of what might have happened mrs ames took up her soft unresisting unresponsive hand yes by all means think what might have happened she said utter ruin utter misery andand all your fault you led him on as you said he didnt care as you did he wouldnt have thought of going away with you if he hadnt been so furious with me think of all that some straggler from that host of sobs shook millie for a moment perhaps wilfred would take me away instead she said i will ask him if he cannot do you think i should feel better if i went away for a fortnight cousin amy mrs ames twisted little smile played about her mouth yes she said i think that is an excellent plan i am quite sure you will feel better in a fortnight if you can look forward like that and want to be better and now would you like to wash your face after that i will walk home with you chapter xiv it was a brisk morning in november and mr and mrs altham who breakfasted at halfpast eight in the summer and nine in the winter were seated at breakfast and mr altham was thinking how excellent was the savour of grilled kidneys but he was not sure if they were really wholesome and he was playing an important match at golf this afternoon perhaps two kidneys approached the limits of wisdom besides his wife was speaking of really absorbing things he ought to be able to distract his mind from the kidneys he was proposing to deny himself under the sting of so powerful a counterinterest and to think that mrs ames isnt going to be a suffragette any more she said i met mrs turner when i took my walk just now and she told me all about it a word of explanation is necessary the fact was that swedish exercises and a short walk on an empty stomach were producing wonderful results in riseborough at the moment especially among its female inhabitants they now instead of meeting in the high street before lunch to stand about on the pavement and exchange news met there before breakfast when on these brisk autumn mornings it was wiser not to stand about they therefore skimmed rapidly up and down the street together in short skirts and walking boots rain and sunny weather in this first glow of enthusiasm were alike to them and they had their baths afterwards these exercises gave a considerable appetite for breakfast and produced a very pleasant and comfortable feeling of fatigue but this fatigue was a legitimate indeed a desirable effect for their systems naturally demanded repose after exertion and an hours rest after breakfast was recommended thus this getting up earlier did not really result in any actual saving of time though it made everybody feel very busy and they all went to bed a little earlier mr altham found he got on very nicely without these gymnastics but then he played golf after lunch it was no use playing tricks with your health if it was already excellent you might as well poke about in the works of a punctual watch he had already had a pretty sharp lesson on this score over the consumption of sour milk it had made him exceedingly unwell and he had sliced his drive for a fortnight afterwards just now he weaned his mind from the thoughts of kidneys and gave it in equitable halves to marmalade and his wifes conversation to enjoy either required silence on his part she went to a meeting yesterday said mrs altham so mrs turner told me and said that though she had the success of the cause so deeply at heart as ever she would not be able to take any active part in it that is a very common form of sympathy i suppose from what one knows of mrs ames we might have expected something of the sort do you remember her foolish scheme of asking wives without husbands and husbands without wives i warned you at the time henry not to take any notice of it because i was sure it would come to nothing and i think i may say i am justified i dont know what you think mr altham by a happy coincidence had finished masticating his last piece of toast at this moment and was at liberty to reply i do not think anything about it at present said he i daresay you are quite right but why mrs altham gave a little shrill laugh the sprightliness at breakfast produced by this early walk and the exercises was very marked i declare she said that i had forgotten to tell you mrs ames wrote to ask us both to dine on saturday i had quite forgotten there is something in the air before breakfast that makes one forgetful of trifles it says so in the pamphlet worries and household cares vanish and it becomes a joy to be alive i dont think we have any engagement pray do not have a third cup of tea henry tannin combines the effects of stimulants and narcotics a cup of hot water nowyou will never regret it let me see yes dinner at the ames on saturday and she isnt a suffragette any longer as i said one might have guessed i daresay her husband gave her a good talkingto after the night when she threw the water at the policeman i should not wonder if there was madness in the family i think i heard that sir james mother was very queer before she died she lived till ninety remarked mr altham that is often the case with deranged people said mrs altham lunatics are notoriously longlived there is no strain on the brain and she wasnt any relation of mrs ames continued henry mrs ames is related to the westbournes she has no more to do with sir james mother than i have to do with yours i will take tea my dear not hot water you want to catch me up henry said she and prove i am wrong somehow i was only saying that very likely there is madness in mrs ames family and i was going to add that i hoped it would not come out in her but you must allow that she has been very flighty you would have thought that an elderly woman like that could make up her mind once and for all about things before she made an exhibition of herself she thinks she is like some royal person who goes and opens a bazaar and then has nothing more to do with it but hurries away to leeds or somewhere to unveil a memorial she thinks it is sufficient for her to help at the beginning and get all the advertisement and then drop it all like cold potatoes hot said henry hot or cold that is just like her she plays hot and cold one day she is a suffragette and the next day she isnt as likely as not she will be a vegetarian on saturday and we shall be served with cabbages major ames went over to sir james to shootshe wasnt asked said henry reverting to a previous topic there you are exclaimed mrs altham that will account for her abandoning this husband and wife theory i am sure she did not like that she being sir james relative and not being asked but i never could quite understand what the relationship is though i daresay mrs ames can make it out there are people who say they are cousins because a grandmothers niece married the other grandmothers nephew we can all be descendants of queen elizabeth or of charles the second at that rate it would be easier to be a descendant of charles the second than of queen elizabeth my dear remarked henry mrs altham pursed her lips up for a moment i do not think we need enter into that she said i was asking you if you wished to accept mrs ames invitation for saturday she says she expects sir james and his wife so perhaps we shall hear some more about this wonderful relationship and dr evans and his wife and one or two others to my mind that looks rather as if the husband and wife plan was not quite what she expected it would be and giving up all active part in the suffragette movement too but i daresay she feels her age though goodness only knows what it is however it is clearly going to be a grand party on saturday and the waiter from the crown will be there to help parker going round and pouring a little foam into everybodys glass i do not know where major ames gets his champagne from but i never get anything but foam but i am sure i do not wish to be unkind and certainly poor major ames does not look well i daresay he has worries we do not know of and of course there is no reason why he should speak of them to us the evans too i never satisfied myself as to why they went away in october they must have been away nearly three weeks for it was only yesterday that i saw them driving down from the station with so much luggage on the top of the cab i wonder it did not fall over it cant have been yesterday my dear said mr altham because you spoke of it to me two days ago you shall have it your own way henry said she i am quite willing that you should think it was a twelvemonth ago if you choose but i suppose you will not dispute that they went away in october which is a very odd time to take for a holiday of course mrs evans stopped here all august or so she says and she might answer that she wanted a little change of air but for my part i think there must have been something more though as i say i cannot guess what it is luckily it is no concern of mine and i need not worry my head about it but i have always thought mrs evans looked far from strong and it seems odd that a doctors wife should not be more robust when she has all his laboratory to choose from henry lit his cigarette and strolled to the window the lawn was still white with the unmelted hoarfrost and the gardener was busy in the beds putting things tidy for the winter this consisted in plucking up anything of vegetable origin and carrying it off in a wheelbarrow thus the beds were ready to receive the first beddedout plants next may i remember my dear said henry that you once thought that there had been somesome understanding between mrs evans and major ames and some misunderstanding between major ames and dr evans mrs altham brought her eyebrows together and put her finger on her forehead i seem to remember some ridiculous story of yours henry about a bunch of chrysanthemums in the road outside dr evans house how you had seen major ames take them in and there they were afterwards in the road i seem to remember your being so much excited about it that i made a point of going round to mrs ames next day withwith a book i think that at the timecorrect me if i am wrongi convinced you that there was nothing whatever in it or have you seen or heard anything since that makes you think differently she added rather more briskly no my dear nothing whatever said he mrs altham got up i am glad very glad she said at any rate we know in riseborough that we are safe from that sort of thing i declare when i went to london last week i hardly slept with thinking of the dreadful things that might be going on round me dear me it is nearly ten oclock i do not know whether the hours or the days go quickest it is always halfanhour later than i expect it to be and here we are in november already i shall rest for an hour henry and i will write to mrs ames before lunch saying we shall be delighted to come on saturday november the twelfth too nearly half november will be gone by then and that leaves us but six weeks to christmas and it will be as much as we shall be able to manage to get through all that has to be done before that but with these swedish exercises i declare i feel younger every day and more able to cope with everything you should take to them henry by eleven oclock they are finished and you have had your rest with a little management you would find time for everything henry sat over the diningroom fire considering this as has been mentioned he did not want to make any change in his excellent health but on the other hand a little rest after breakfast would be pleasant and when that was over it would be almost time to go to the club but it was impossible to settle a question like that offhand after he had read the paper he would think about it mrs altham came hurrying back into the room henry you would never guess what i have seen she said i glanced out of the window in the hall on the way to my room and there was mrs ames wobbling about the road on a bicycle major ames was holding it upright with both hands and it looked to be as much as he could manage yet she has no time for suffragettes i should be sorry if i thought i should ever make such a hollow excuse as that and at her age too i had no time to call you but i dare say she will be back soon if you care to watch the windowseat in the hall is quite comfortable henry took his paper there
