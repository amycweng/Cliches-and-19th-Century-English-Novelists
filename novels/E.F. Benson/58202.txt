lister contents june july august september october november december january february march april may a reaping june of all subjects under or over the sun there is none perhaps even including bimetallism or the lengthy description of golf links which one has never seen so utterly below possible zones of interest as that of health health of course matters quite enormously to the individual but nobody with good health ever gives two thoughts far less one word to the subject nobody in fact begins to think about health until his own begins to be inferior but then as if that was not bad enough he at once clubs and belabours his unhappy friends with its inferiority it becomes to him the one affair of absorbing importance emperors may be assassinated governments may crumble it may even be degrees in the shade but he recks nothing of those colossal things he ate strawberries yesterday and has had a bilious headache almost ever since and the world ceases to revolve round the sun and the moon is turned to blood or ashes i forget which but the real invalid just like the man who enjoys real health never talks about such matters it is only to the amateur in disease that they are of the smallest interest the man who is well never thinks about his health and certainly never mentions it to the man who is really ill some divine sense of irresponsibility is given he brushes it aside just as one brushes aside any innate inability with common courage how lavishly is beautiful gift given to whomever really needs it he makes the best of other things these poignant though obvious reflections are the outcome of what occurred this evening i sat between two friends at dinner both of them people in whom ones heart rejoices but one of them is obsessed just now with this devil of health seeking the other has long ago given up the notion of seeking for health at all for it is not for her she faces incurable with gaiety so i have to record two conversations the worse first oh i always have ten minutes deep breathing every morning it is the only way i can get enough air you have to lie on your back you know and stop one nostril with your finger while you breathe in slowly through the other and you should do it near an open window there is no fear of catching cold or if you do i can send you a wonderful prescription then you breathe out through the other nostril i wish you would try it it makes the whole difference no thanks caviare is poison to me well so is arsenic to me i said but why say so it did not sound quite so brusque as it looks when written down and native modesty prevents my explaining how abjectly patient i had been up till then then there came the reshifting of conversation and we started again with change of partners i do hope you will come to see us again in august said the quiet pleasant voice i shall go up to scotland at the end of the month your beloved river should be in order there has been heaps of rain but i could not help asking another question ah then they let you go there i said she laughed gently no that is just what they dont do she said but i am going what does it matter if one hastens it by a few weeks i am going to shorten it probably by a few weeks but instead of having six tiresome months on board a yacht i am going to have rather fewer months among all the things i love oh dick quite agrees with me do lets talk about something more interesting did you hear tristan the other night no richter conducted he is such a splendid isolde there is no one to approach him there there was the glory of it and how that little tiny joke about richter touched the heart here on one side was a woman dying and she knew it but the wonder and the pleasure of the world was intensely hers there on the other was the excellent mrs armstrong she could not think about the opera or anything else except her absurd deep breathing and her ridiculous liver nobody else did nobody cared even now i could hear her explaining to her left hand neighbour that next to deep breathing the really important thing is to drink a glass of water in the middle of the morning slowly of course in sips and she proceeded to describe what the water did well i suppose i am old fashioned but i could no more think of discussing these intimate matters at the dinner table than i should think of performing my toilet there besides and this is perhaps the most unanswerable objection to doing so besides being slightly disgusting it is so immensely dull however on the other side there was a topic as entrancing as the other was tedious and in two minutes my other neighbour and i were deep in the fascinating inquiry as to how far a conductor a supreme conductor identified himself with the characters of the opera certainly the phrase richter is such a splendid isolde was an alluring theme and by degrees it spread round the corner of the table we were sitting close to it and was taken up opposite when a member of the purcell society gave vent to the highly interesting observation that the conductor had practically nothing to do with the singers and was no more than a sort of visible metronome put there for the guidance of the orchestra it was impossible not to retort that the last performance of the purcell society completely confirmed the truth of that view of the conductor indeed the chorus hardly thought of him even as a metronome or else perhaps they were deaf which would account for their sinking a tone and a half in fact there were flowers of speech on the subject but how extraordinary a thing taking the view that is to say that a conductor conceivably does more than beat time is this transference of emotion so that first of all wagner by means of merely black notes and words on white paper can inspire the conductor with that tragedy of love which years ago he wove out of the sunlight and lagoons of venice that secondly the conductor can enter into that mysterious and mystical union with his band and his singers and reflect his own mood on them so strongly that from throat or strings or wailing of flutes they give us who sit and listen what the conductor bade them read into the music so that all bassoons and double bass flutes and strings trumpets and oboes and horns become the spiritual mirror of his emotion by means of that little baton by the beckoning of his fingers he pulls out from them the music which is in his own soul makes it communicable to them indeed we need not go to the society for psychical research for experiments in thought transference for here is an instance of it unless indeed we take the view of this member of the purcell society far more magical far further uplifted out of the sphere of things which we think we can explain for the mere degrees of loud or soft mere alterations in tempo are of course less than the abc of the conductors office his real work the exercise of his real power lies remote from though doubtless connected with them and of that we can explain nothing whatever he obsesses every member of his orchestra so that by a motion of his hand he gets the same quality of tone from every member of it for apart from the mere loudness and the mere time of any passage there are probably an infinite number of ways of playing each note yet at his bidding every single member of the band plays it the same way it is his thought they all make audible with a hundred instruments which have all one tone else how does that unity reach us sitting in our stalls that is the eternal mystery of music which alone of the arts deals with its materials direct it is not an imitation of sound but sound itself the employment of the actual waves of air that are the whistle of the wind and the crash of breakers and the love song of nightingales all other branches of art deal only second hand they but give us an imitation of what they wish to represent the pictorial artist can do no more than lay a splash of pigment from a leaden tube on to his canvas when he wishes to speak to us of sunlight he can only touch an eye with a reflection in its corner to show grief or take a little from the size of the pupil to produce in us who look the feeling of terror that contracts it similarly too the sculptor has to render the soft swell of a womans bosom in marble as if it was on marble a man would pillow his head it is all a translation a rendering in another material of the image that fills us with love or pity or the open air intoxication of an april morning but the musician works first hand the intangible waves of air not a representation of them are his material it is not with a pigment of sound so to speak that the violins shiver or the trumpets tell us that the gods are entering valhalla music deals with sound itself with the whisper that went round the formless void when god said let there be light with all that makes this delicate orchestra of the world no copy of it no translation of it but it itself and for the time being while the curtain is up the control of these forces their wail and their triumph belongs to the conductor he gives them birth in the strings and the wind he by the movement of a hand makes them express all that sound expressed to the magician who first mapped them on his paper indeed he does more he interprets them through his own personality giving them as it were an extra dip in the bath of life so that their colours are more brilliant more vital of hue or is the member of the purcell society right and is the man who gives us this wonderful isolde only a metronome it is often said that the deaf are far more lonely far more remotely sundered from the world we know than are the blind it is impossible to imagine that this should not be so for it is not only the sounds that we know we hear but the sounds of which for the most part we are unconscious that form the link between us and external things it commonly happens as in the dark that we are cut off from all exercise of the eyes and yet at such moments we have not been very conscious of loneliness but it is rare that we are cut off from all sound and the loneliness of that isolation is indescribable it happened to me once in the golden desert to the west of luxor above the limestone cliffs that rise from the valley where the kings of egypt lie entombed i had sat down on the topmost bluff of these cliffs having tethered my donkey down below for the way was too steep for him and for several minutes observed my surroundings with extreme complacency below me lay the grey limestone cliffs but where i sat a wave of the desert had broken and the immediate foreground was golden sand farther away in all hues of peacock green lay the strip of cultivated land and beyond the steel blue of the ancient and mysterious river it was early yet in the afternoon and the sun still high so that the whole land glittered in this glorious high festival of light and colour and looking at the imperishable monuments of that eternal civilization it seemed that one could not desire a more convincing example of the kindliness of the circling seasons of the beneficence that overlooked the world from generation to generation so that man might well say that this treasure house of the earth was inexhaustible no breeze of any sort was stirring but the air pure hot invigorating was absolutely still but at that moment i suddenly felt as if something was dreadfully wrong though i did not at once guess what it was then came the thought the identification of what was wrong it seemed as if the world was dead then came the reason for it it was because there was no sound for a moment i listened in order to verify this listened with poised breath and immovable limbs yes i was right there was no sound of anything at all for once the ears were deprived of the delicate orchestra that goes up a hymn of praise day and night from the earth it was like a dreadful nightmare i first tried coughing to see if that would be companionable but that did not do i coughed and then silence resumed its reign i lit a cigarette i moved rustled even got up and walked a little kicking the pebbles that lay about in the sand but that was no use and i perceived where the defect was i knew i was alive and could make sounds but what i wanted was some evidence that something else was alive but there was none somehow this fact was so disquieting that i sat down again to think about it in my reasonable mind i knew that absolutely everything was alive only there was at this moment nothing to tell me so not a fly buzzed over the hot sand not a kite was to be seen wheeling slow as if in sleep a black speck against the inviolable blue that stretched from horizon to horizon i was the only thing alive as far as i had evidence or supposing the thought flashed suddenly across me supposing i too was dead and what was this this dome of air and the golden sand was it hell i cannot describe the horror of this momentary as was the sensation it was of a quality a depth of surcharged panic which comes to us only in nightmares i was alone i was not within touch in this utter stillness of any other consciousness and surely that must be hell the outer darkness of absolute loneliness which not even the glorious golden orb swung centre high in the blue could ever so faintly penetrate indeed it and this iridescent panorama at my feet only added some secret bitter irony to the outer darkness all the light the colour the heat which one had so loved was there still but life was arrested and there was nobody then quite suddenly and unexpectedly the farcical happened for from some hundred yards away down below the steep cliff up which i had climbed came a long discordant bray from my donkey who perhaps felt lonely too but i have never heard a sound which was to the spirit so overpoweringly sweet i heard that and gave a long breath and shouted thank you very much for the whole glory of the noon which silence had blackened was instantly restored one of the interesting things to which i have alluded in contrast with the tedium of mrs armstrongs health was occurring to day for the thermometer had indeed been up in the nineties a fact which fills all proper minded people with pride our dear stuffy old london had registered degrees in the shade at messrs negretti and zambras that morning and i with my own eyes had seen it it was impossible not to be proud just as it is impossible not to be proud when one is in a train that is going over seventy miles an hour a thing that may be timed by the small white quarter mile posts that are so conveniently established by the side of the line once i went in a train that did a mile and a half in seventy three seconds i have not got over my elation yet or when an extraordinarily vivid flash of lightning occurs with a congested angry spasm of thunder coming simultaneously with it are you not sorry for the nerveless soul that does not thrill with personal elation at power made manifest or when madame melba sings the last long note of the first act of la bohme or when the organist in kings college chapel pulls out the tubas making the windows to rattle in their leaded panes by the concussion of the astonished air or when a perfectly enormous wave rides in from the atlantic and is transformed suddenly from the illustrious blue giant into a myriad cascades of snowy white as jovially dealing itself its own death as it were it is dashed against the brown steadfast rock of the land or when legs i shall speak of him soon as he did to day sliced his drive very badly at the fourth hole at woking and hit the front of the engine of an up train with extraordinary violence and thereupon collapsed on the tee in speechless laughter for the sheer joy of the gorgeously improbable feat for all these things so i take it are evidence of the splendid energy of things in general in which we each of us have our share so that when our train goes very fast or when thunder cracks very loudly or when blue waves are turned to smoke though we are not actually responsible in any way for these encouraging facts which are dependent on pressure in a boiler electricity in the air and a disturbance in mid atlantic yet as by some wireless telegraphy the energy of them is caught in the receiver of ourselves and we throb back to it feeling the pulse of life which is exactly the same life in boiler and cloud and wave as that pulse in ourselves which beats at the wrist life life life all one all absolutely one and to night too though not in any of these particular ways how it throbs and beats in this hot darkness of june for a moment i wished i was in the country to feel the pulse of the woodland and the garden for the green things of the earth are awake all june they never sleep day or night they hold their breath sometimes in the hour before dawn and they hang their heads sometimes beneath some scurry of summer rain but day and night their eyes shine they are growing and living and are always awake till autumn comes when they doze and winter comes when they sleep sound day and night alike dreaming perhaps of the spring when from deep sleep they will slowly awake again aconites first and soon after daffodils and then the buds of the hawthorn little green squibs of leaf but i had not gone a hundred yards from the doors within which i had dined when the mysterious joy of london summer night smote these thoughts of the country into silence the whole town was awake theatres were pouring out into the streets and boarding the giants of the roadway the snorting smelling motor buses their trotting brothers and the inferior cabs and hansoms where one could be alone and not stop on the way but be taken decorously and dully to ones destination there was news too in the evening papers a horrible murder i think it was but the nature of the incident mattered very little it was incident anyhow something had happened and without wishing to know exactly what it was i felt extraordinarily pleased that something had happened the dip of piccadilly between devonshire house and hyde park was comparatively empty and a sudden shudder of the mind came across me i had been sitting next a dear friend condemned to death how could i have forgotten that for forgotten it i had in this riotous summer of london then i knew why i had forgotten it it was because she had been so superior an odious word but there is no other to it herself that courage that passionate interest in the dear things of the world her contempt for this time there is no need of another word of death had been infectious to her it was a mere incident of life things in general were no less real and delightful to her because this incident was coming close than they were to me who had not yet as far as i knew to look it in the face yet after all to any of the others sitting at that table death so small an incident to her who had steadfastly regarded it might in reality be closer than to her and she exulted in the things of life still they had lost no interest for her i stopped for a moment at the bottom of the hill as one must when something quite new to oneself strikes one that was the ideal she had shown fearless undismayed full of summer and with god be the rest at hyde park corner a coffee stall and an ice cream stall jostled each other each had its following but both at the moment seemed to me to be heretical and instead i turned into the park to walk as far as the alexandra gate whence i had to get into sloane street it was like coming out of the roar of a tunnel into the day again and ones eyes though conversely had to get accustomed to the dark after the glare and noise of the dear streets a little wind whispered overhead in the planes a little odour of moist earth came from rotten row quiet solitary figures passed or figures in pairs closely linked but for the most part silent on benches underneath the trees there were pairs of figures in heavens name why not to flirt to make love to look into eyes is an applauded and rightly applauded pursuit in sequestered corners under palms beneath the eaves of the staircase with the band blaring from the ball room just beyond but it doesnt seem to strike the fastidious who write letters to papers about the state of the parks that it is just possible that there are other people in the world who havent got ball rooms and palms and marble staircases what are they to do then the answer of these letter writers is deplorably futile for they talk about indigent marriages as if you could stop the life of the world by pointing with impious hands towards the savings bank god laughs at it but the people who most call attention to the state of the park are those who have sat in the back drawing room with their gurls while mamma has been grenadier at the door and papa has put a handkerchief over his broad face when he has finished his glass of port after lunch after lunch and smokes his cigar in the dining room it really is so young men and maidens may sit on a plush sofa in the dreadful back drawing room and behave as young men and maidens should and if they shouldnt they will and why in the name of all that is decent should they not sit on a bench in the park and kiss each other yet the person who objects to their doing so and who writes to the papers in consequence is exactly the man who in his semi detached villa at some nameless suburb draws his handkerchief over his face and obscenely snores while jack a respectable bank clerk kisses maria in the back drawing room good luck to them all except to the horrible man who snores and writes to the papers when he is awake he would be better snoring the moon had risen and rode high in a star kirtled heaven making a diaper of light and shifting shadow below the shade of the many elbowed planes even now close on midnight it was extraordinarily hot and for a little the grass and the trees made me long again for the true country where the green things on the earth are native not as here outcasts in the desert island of the streets yet when there is as in london so large a colony of castaways extending you will remember right down from beyond the serpentine bridge to westminster so that except for the crossing at hyde park one may walk on grass for all these solid miles one hopes that the trees and flowers are tolerably cheerful and do not sigh much for the wild places away from houses never was there a town so full of trees as this for walk as you may in it you will i think with three exceptions only never find a street from some point in which you cannot see a tree to remind you of shade at noontide and grassy hollows but the names of those streets shall not here be stated they must however consider themselves warned then the streets again crowded still with moving figures each an entrancing enigma to any passenger whose soul is at all alert and swift with the passage of those glorious motor buses pounding and flashing along on their riotous ways the very incarnation to me of all that town means i cannot imagine now what london was like without them it must have been but half alive half itself it is impossible to be patient with these curious folk who consider them nuisances who say as if anyone denied it that they both smell and clatter that is exactly why they are so typical of london indeed one is disposed to think that they were not made with hands but spontaneously generated out of the spirit of the town and how delightful to observe their elephantine antics if the streets are slippery when they behave exactly like a drunken man with appearance still portentously solemn as if he had heard grave news but afflicted with strange indecision and uncertainty on questions of the direction in which he intends to walk i was on one the other day which did the most entrancing things and had it all to myself as everybody else got down not seeming to see that if a motor bus has been overtaken it is far safer to be on it than anywhere else in the street just as a drunken man may lurch heavily with damage to others but never hurts himself it was in piccadilly too a beautiful theatre for its manuvres trouble began as we descended the hill by the green park it had vin gai and was boisterously cheerful but it was extraordinarily uncertain about direction and slewed violently once or twice so that hansoms started away from our vicinity as rabbits scuttle from you in the brushwood then my bus suddenly pulled itself together and walked quite straight for a lamp post by the kerb it felt tired i suppose and leaned wearily against it snapping it neatly off with as little effort as it takes to pluck a daisy then it hooted moved gravely on again and thinking it was a member of the junior athenum made straight for the door but it forgot to lift its feet up to get on to the pavement and stumbled then it saw a sister bus backed away from the pavement and tried to make friends but the other simply cut it and passed by so it gave a heavy sigh and began to mount the hill towards devonshire house but it had scarcely gone twenty yards when the behaviour of its sister so smote upon its heart that it could not go on and turned slowly round in the street to look back at that respectable but uncharitable relation with pathetic and appealing eyes it might happen to anybody it seemed to say to take a drop too much and you shouldnt judge too severely this sense of being misunderstood gave it vin triste of the most pronounced kind i have seldom seen so despondent a drunkard it moaned and muttered to itself and i longed to console it but beneficent nature came to its aid laid her cool hand upon its throbbing head and it slept i got gently off feeling as mr rossetti i think says if it was not he it was somebody else that i must step softly for i was treading on its dreams and all this for a penny which the conductor very obligingly refunded to me as i had not been taken where i wanted to go sloane street and soon my dear house into which i was towed by my watch chain for my latchkey was on the end of it and having opened the door i could not get the latchkey out and had to step on tiptoe following the door as it opened wild music came from the upstairs and having disentangled my key i ran up to find helen and legs trying with singular ill success to play the overture to the meistersingers from a performance of which they had just returned they took not the slightest notice of my entry no shouted legs one two wait for two oh do get on yes thats it sorry i thought it was a sharp they were nearing the end and several loud and unsimultaneous thumps came ive finished said helen legs had one thump more so have i he said isnt it ripping july helen has gone to church after several scathing remarks about sabbath breakers by whom she means me and probably also legs as i hear the piano being played indoors as a matter of fact i have not the slightest intention of breaking anything though legs seems to have designs on the strings for even here under the trees on the lawn it is far too hot to think of such a thing several slightly disappointed dogs repose round me who hoped that perhaps as i was not going to church i was going for a walk this afternoon i am afraid they will be disappointed again for i propose to go to afternoon service in the cathedral and they will think i am going for a walk but on sunday dogs have to pay for the commissions and omissions of the week the bells have stopped so helen will quite certainly be late and the silence of sunday morning in the country grows a shade deeper fifi just now with an air of grim determination sat up to scratch herself but she could not be bothered and sank down again in collapse on the grass legs too has apparently found the heat too much even for him and has stopped playing and i abandoned myself to that luxury which can only be really enjoyed on sunday morning when other people have gone to church i wish to state again that i am going this afternoon of thinking of all the things i ought to do and not doing them on monday and tuesday and all through the week in fact you can indulge in that same pursuit but it lacks aroma it is without bouquet but give me a chair under a tree on sunday morning and let my wife call me names for sitting in it and then let the church bells stop fifi wants washing legs said so yesterday and we meant to wash her this morning i must carefully avoid the subject if he comes out since i dont intend to do so then i ought to write to the secretary of state having first ascertained who he is to remind him that legs is going up for his foreign office examination in november and that his the secretary of states predecessor in the late government promised him a nomination how tiresome these changes of government are one would have thought the conservatives might have held on till legs examination then i should not have to consult whitaker to find out who the present secretary of state is and write to him and probably find that either i havent got a whitaker or else that it is an old one this will entail expense as well how the silence grew i could not even hear any bees buzz among the flower beds and wondered whether bees do no work on sunday there was not a sound or murmur of them probably this is quite a new fact in natural history which has never struck anybody before it would never have struck me if i had gone to church then fifi pricked one ear sat up and snapped at something it was a winged thing with a brown body rather like a bee how indescribably futile then there came a little puff of wind from the end of the garden and next moment the whole air was redolent with the scent of sweet peas sweet peas how strangely vastly more intimate is the sense of smell than any other how at one whiff of odour the whole romance of life its beautiful joys and scarcely less beautiful sorrows the dust and struggle and the glory of it rises up clad not in the grey robes or standing in the dim light of the past but living moving breathing part of the past perhaps but more truly part of the present like a huge wave from the immortal sea of life cool and green and speaking of the eternal depths yet exulting in sunshine and rainbow hued in spray all the memories entwined about this house held and enveloped me here lived once dick and margery those perfect friends here when they had passed to their triumphant peace came she whom when i first saw her i thought to be margery from this house where still in memory of margery we plant the long avenue of sweet peas because she loved them two years ago we were married and here i sit now drowned in the beautiful past that is all so essential a part of this beautiful present but it would be as well perhaps if this book is to be in the slightest degree intelligible a thing which i maintain is a merit rather than a defect to put together a few simple facts concerning these last two years it was two years ago last april that we were married and took a small house in town though we still spent a good deal of time down here with helens father but before the year was out he died leaving everything to helen who was his only child so as was natural we continued to live in the house which was so dear to both of us legs is my first cousin and he has lived with us for a year past for he has neither father nor mother and since he was cramming for his foreign office work in town it was far the best arrangement that he should make his home with us legs is the only name he is ever known by since he is one of those people who are almost unknown by their real name which in this case is francis horace allenby and are alluded to only by some nickname which is far more suitable if for instance i said to somebody who knew him quite well have you seen francis lately i should probably be favoured with an inquiring stare and then oh legs you mean while to his million acquaintances he has more than anyone i ever knew he is equally legs allenby the name i need scarcely add is a personal and descriptive nickname for legs chiefly consists of them when he sits down he would be guessed to be well on the short side of middle height when he stands up he is seen to be well on the farther shore of it he was legs at school and his family very sensibly and all his friends saw how impossible it was to call him francis any more for the rest he is just over twenty sandy haired freckle faced and green eyed with a front tooth broken across a fact that is continually in evidence since he is nearly always laughing it would be sheer nonsense to call him good looking but it would be as sheer to call him ugly since when you have got a face like legs either epithet has nothing to do with it but i have never seen any boy with nearly so attractive and charming a face and legs whose nature is quite as nice as his face and extremely like it has the most splendid time and that to finish these tedious explanations is our household there is no other inmate of it no little one you understand legs is an enthusiast a fanatic on the subject of life everything including even his foreign languages which he has to cram himself with is the subject of his admiration and he discovers more secrets of life than the rest of the world put together at one time it is a chord which is meat and drink to him at another the romances of pierre loti or again golf is the only thing worth living for while occasionally some girl or as often as not a respectable elderly married woman usurps his heart last week he discovered that there were only two people in town the least worth talking to but yesterday when i asked him who the second one was having forgotten myself i found that he had forgotten too for if the meistersinger overture was not enough for anybody he was a person of no perception why it contains all there is he had said when he finished it the other evening with helen its all there the whole caboodle but this morning from the silence indoors i imagine he must have found another caboodle a book probably or equally possible legs has an attack of acute middle age which occasionally takes him like a bad cold in the head then he wonders whether anything is worth doing and is sorry for helen and me because we are so frivolous six months ago i remember he had such an attack induced by reading a book about three acres and a cow which raised in him the sense of injustice that all of us three had so much more than that during this period he took no sugar in his tea refused wine and began to write a book which was called tramps contrasting the horror of indigence with the even greater horror of extravagance it was really directed against helen and me for we had lately bought a small snuffling motor car these outbursts of socialism are generally coincident with atheism but they do not last long legs soon feels better again i was right it appeared about the conjecture that he had found a book but i was wrong about the attack of middle age legs jumped out of the drawing room window with wild excitement oh i say he cried why did you never tell me i thought swinburne was an awful rotter but just listen and he read when the hounds of spring are in winters traces did you ever hear anything like it he said blossom by blossom the spring begins why its magic oh dont i know it do you remember i suppose you dont when all the daffodils came out together last year oh legs what an ass you are i said because you never noticed them till i showed you them no i believe thats true oh dont argue listen and he began all over again then he lay back on the grass with his hands underneath his head looking up unblinking into the face of the sun that by the way is another peculiarity of his he looks straight at the sun at noonday and is not dazzled his eyes neither blink nor water he cant understand why other people dont look at the sun then if by any chance you care to understand this quiet delightful life we lead it is necessary that you understand legs then his mood suddenly changed oh im wrong about the daffodils he said you showed me them but this chap is a daffodil i suppose hes quite old too i wonder how you can get old if you have ever felt like that what a waste of time it is to do anything if you can feel i hate this foreign office affair why shouldnt i do nothing because you cant i remarked what do you mean i had not been to church and so had heard no sermon therefore i preached one on my own account you will know in about fifteen years i said anyhow you will find that unless you are brainless and absurd you must do something you are quite wrong it isnt nearly enough to feel the moment you feel you want to create you not only want but you have to you cant possibly help yourself you have just read that heavenly poem you now want to write something like it you hear what spring once said to a poet and you want to put down what spring says to you oh youre quite wrong said legs he has said what spring means thats the last word on the subject but summer now this to day so you want to create said i a glorious trait about legs is that he never admits conviction he only changes the subject thus if the subject is changed by him his controversialist is satisfied i dont believe in the highest of the shortest suit if your partner doubles he said what are you to do if you have two spades and two clubs all contemptible lead the less contemptible legs turned slowly over on his side and lay with his face against the short turf of the lawn blossom by blossom he said the spring begins i wonder if he meant more than that did he mean to tell of the time when one is young oneself and it is all blossom lord how priggish that sounds but it is all blossom except for this beastly german i hate german it sounds as if you were gargling damn i have to go up by the early train to morrow too and you and helen will stop here till after lunch grind grind oh i lead the life of a dog and then if i am very successful i shall have the privilege of sitting on a stool in a beastly building in whitehall and writing a prcis from some silly old man in vienna or madrid about nothing at all it isnt worth it legs and i it will be observed deal largely in contradictions yes it is i said everything almost that one does is worth it as long as you are actively doing anything with all your heart you cant be wasting time nor can there be anything better worth doing it is only when you say that a thing isnt worth doing that it becomes so legs sat up again oh i want nine lives at least he said or why cant one buy some of the time that hangs so heavy on other peoples hands i know a man who reads the times all through every morning and the globe every evening yet after all i dare say it is quite as improving as sitting here and talking rot as we are doing i shall go and put in half an hour over that accursed teutonic language before lunch legs had as it seemed to me run over most of the topics of human interest in the few minutes he had been out and since i was still irrevocably determined neither to wash fifi nor to write to the secretary of state nor indeed to open the very large book on the crisis in russia which i had brought out with me to bring out a book on sunday morning and not to open it is strictly in accordance with the spirit of the thing my mind went slowly browsing like a meditative cow over the dazzling display he had spread before me and instinctively and instantaneously i found myself envying him though why i envied him i did not immediately know but it was soon obvious i envied his power of making soul stirring discoveries his rapture over that magical spring song of the man he had thought an awful rotter i envied him his ignorance of the perfectly patent fact that it is only fools who can go on doing nothing and of the fact that it is infinitely better to sit on a stool and do arithmetic for stockbrokers than to do nothing at all but youth does not know that and i think i envied him his youth yet so often does one contradict oneself i knew very soon that i did not envy him any of these things after all i still went on making soul stirring discoveries and propose to do so until the very end of my life when i shall make the most soul stirring discovery of all which is death and to envy the fact of his having just discovered the magic of swinburnes spring song would be exactly the same as envying the appetite of somebody who has just come down to breakfast when you are half way through your eggs and bacon were delicious but the fact that you have eaten them makes it impossible to wish for them again and it should make you only delighted that other people keep coming down to breakfast till the end of your life they will do that unless the world comes to an end first and thank god they will find eggs and bacon delicious too hungry and fresh in the morning of their lives i was becoming slightly too active in mind for the proper observance of sunday morning given of course that you have chosen not to go to church for the real attitude is a state of tranquil bemusedness but it was too late to stop now what in fact did i want did i want to be twenty again and go through the days and hours of those fifteen years once more yes i did if the world could be turned back for fifteen years i would gladly take my place there and go through it all good and bad together just as it has happened i would encore this delightful song in fact and be content that it should be sung again it not another song of course if one could start again at the age of twenty or ten for that matter and live it over again with the knowledge infinitesimal as it is that one has gained now i imagine that the vast majority of the world would put the hands of the clock back on all those thousands of occasions on which one has acted stupidly unkindly evilly and has probably suffered for it without delay for it is mercifully ordained that we have not long to wait before our punishment begins especially if we have been foolish we should now do differently remembering that it did not pay to put things at their lowest to be asses and knaves apart from that we should have the same beautiful flawless days again when so i cannot but think the beneficent power has somehow come very close to us and our surroundings and by its neighbourhood has given us a series again and again repeated of hours in which we have been unable to imagine anything better than what we have got we have wanted with all the eager happiness that wanting gives and we have obtained but before any leanness of the soul has entered we have wanted again we have had happiness not content since that implies the end of wanting but happiness the content that dwells not in the present only but looked forward i have no idea whether on the whole i am happier than the average of other people since there is no thermometer yet invented that can register that but i do know that i would choose to go back and live it all over again as it has been with the little experience the little knowledge that must inevitably come with years whether one is stupid or not i imagine that everybody would choose to go back but i wish to state distinctly that i would go back without that i suppose it was that which made me just now feel i envied legs but i dont do that really for this reason supposing that what i should choose because i really should were given me what then i should arrive again eventually in the mere measure of years at the point where i am now no different no better no worse i should like to go back because it has been such fun but there is better than that ahead of that i am completely convinced there are as many if not more and i think there are more entrancing discoveries from middle age as there have been from youth and i am convinced again that if one happens to live to be old there will be as many more after all to re read life again would be like re reading the first volume of an absorbing book one has revelled in the first volume and naturally wants to revel again but what is going to happen there is nothing that interests me so much as that to day even in this quiet domestic life of ours there are a hundred threads leading out into unknown countries all of which if one lives one will follow up and all big and tiny alike are so stupendous if to take the forward view i could see in a mirror now what and where all those people few of them no doubt but friends those who really matter would be in a years time how i should seize the magic reflector and gaze into it incomparable as has been the romance of life up till now it is known to me but to peep into the second volume the sun in the full blaze of which legs had laid peeped over the top of the elm in shade of which i had seated myself and not being leggish i shifted my chair again to consider this point it is a question of scale that is here concerned though the scale seems to me to be an unreal one if i happened to be the emperor of all the russias and the magic mirror were given me i should look eagerly out for my own figure and see if i still wore a crown i should scrutinize the faces of those around me to see if war and the hell hag of revolution had been shrieking through my illimitable country but my interests are not soul stirring to any but me and anyhow not of european importance so i should look to see who sat on this lawn a year hence i should ask for a short survey of the embassy at paris to see if legs was attached i should visit a dozen houses or so but if i was allowed to put the clock back fifteen years i should have to wait longer for this so i must reconsider my choice and i am afraid i must reverse it but it must be understood that i choose not to be twenty again merely because it will take longer to be forty and fifty i want the second volume so much or here helens voice broke in she had come back from church and had seated herself on the grass and i believe that half of what appeared to be soliloquy was actually spoken to her but she is wonderfully patient it is youth you want she said and you have got it till you cease to want it it is only people who dont care about it that grow old or is there more than that is it wanting to go on learning that keeps one young a dreadful misgiving came over me am i dreaming i said or did you tell me the other day that i showed signs of wishing to teach she laughed no it is quite true but i will tell you when you cease to wish to learn i shall say it quite quite clearly she took off her hat and speared it absently with a pin we had an awful sermon she said all about the grim seriousness of life and the opportunities that will never come back it does seem to me it is most absolute waste of time to give a thought to that i shant go to church next sunday i dont feel fortified by thoughts like that its much better for me to know that you would put the clock back live it all over again but about looking forward oh jack i think i shouldnt look in the magic mirror if i had the chance what if one saw oneself all alone one would live in dread afterwards or what if you saw a cradle in the room said i she looked up at me quickly and then put out her hands for me to pull her up perhaps i should look in the mirror she said poor legs as he had said left by a very early train next morning and helen moved by a sudden violent attack of vague duty went with him the access was quite indeterminate she thought merely that one ought to get back to town early on monday so as to have the whole day there instead of splitting it up personally i followed neither her reasoning nor example and intended to spend the day in dignified inaction in the country and not split it up by going to town till after dinner but to the owner of a motor car the train appears a degraded sort of business and greatly daring i meant to start about nine in the evening and be the monarch of the road for when there is no other traffic any car becomes a chariot of triumph helen i may remark loves our motor when she does not want to go anywhere particular when she does she takes the train i think in fact that it was my proposal that we should drive up together after dinner that was the direct parent of her sense of duty so when i came down at the not unreasonable hour of nine to breakfast i found that i had the house to myself and i am not in the least ashamed of the confession found that the prospect of an absolutely solitary day was quite to my mind i do not believe myself to be unsociable or morose but every now and then i confess that i like a day in which i see nobody it is not that one is busy and wants to get through ones work for on the contrary when i have a great deal to do i hugely desire the presence and the conversation of friends in the intervals of doing but occasionally it is a very good thing to chew and ruminate to be surrounded by the quiet green things of the earth which give you all their best without waking the corresponding instinct to exchange ideas to give something of yours to meet theirs for intercourse with ones fellow men especially with ones friends is like some rapid interchange of presents everybody everybody at least who has the smallest sense of sociability searches in his mind for any little thing that may be there and gives it his friend while the friend accepting it gives something back from all that we cannot call it an effort since it is so completely spontaneous on both sides it is well to be free occasionally to lie so to speak under the pelting rain of life that is ever poured out from the voiceless eloquent bright eyed happiness of nature to make no plan to contemplate no contingency to drop that sort of fencing rapier that we all wield when we are with our fellow men and lie like a log with one eye open it may be and be rained upon by the things that live and are clothed and nourished without toil or spinning i am aware that the great strenuists from mr roosevelt downwards would hold up their toil hardened hands at this exclaiming you mean it is better now and then to be a cow than a man precisely so but cows are not nearly as inactive as man on these occasions ought to be they eat too long and they switch their tails and stamp their feet but the long stupid bovine gaze is moderately correct at least i have never detected a shadow of intelligence in a cows eye if there is any the man who occasionally becomes a cow must be careful to get rid of it nor must he be a cow too often that is fatal if he is a cow for one day in every six weeks i think he will find the proportion is about right so all day literally all day i sat or when sitting became too fatiguing lay on the lawn and nothing happened that did not always happen but all was worth observing in a purely bovine manner without intelligence little brown twigs occasionally fell from the elms and once or twice a withered yellow leaf came spinning on its own axis as if it was the screw of some unseen steamer a stag beetle walked slowly down from the wooden paling and came some ten yards across the lawn it stopped there about an hour i should think doing nothing whatever then it turned and went back on to the paling again a robin took about the same length of time to make up his mind that i was quite harmless and eventually pecked at my bootlace which was undone it took him an enormous time to decide with his head cocked sideways whether it tasted nice or not but eventually he settled it did not for he did not peck it again then a jackdaw sat on one of the poles of the tennis net and said jarck seventeen times after i began to count he began to say it the eighteenth time but stopped in the middle and ate an incautious earwig that was almost too exciting and i transferred not my attention because i had not got any but my bovine gaze to the big flower bed opposite all summer was there dim hot blossoming summer in full luxuriance of growth so that scarcely a square inch of earth was visible i did not even name the dear familiar flowers that grew there one was a spire of blue one was a cluster of orange there was an orchestra of red trumpets a mist of starry grey and bits of sky caught in a web of green and from beyond i could not help naming that the odour of sweet peas i lay and soaked in it to use a simile do you know those mysterious things which are to be found on the chalk downs called dew ponds often of course they are fed with rain but even when for months no rain has fallen you will still find them full they just lie open to the sky and that is all and the mind so it seems to me is something like them often it is fed in the obvious way as the dew pond with rain by conscious thought by active intercourse with others but sometimes it is not a bad thing for it to be like the dew pond just to lie open to the sky and drink in the eternal wine of nature which fills its pond again all that is required of it is to do nothing whatever not to think even but just to be there to be in existence to let go of everything it really is worth the experiment though it is not quite so easy as it sounds for thoughts ideas of some kind keep leaking in they must be firmly excluded the snuffling motor rose like a hero to the occasion and came round throbbing with excitement something in the idea of this drive by night had evidently taken its fancy and it positively burned to exceed the legal limit a wish that i was only too glad to gratify when we started the crimson of the sunset was still aflame in the west but gradually the colour was withdrawn as if some unseen hand was pulling out scarlet threads that ran through some exquisite fabric of dainty embroidery leaving there only the soft transparent ground of it then more gradually so that the eye could not trace the appearance of each but only knew that the number was being multiplied behind the dark velvet of the sky were lit the myriad suns that make a flame of space and sing in their orbits colours faded and disappeared and soon the world was turned to an etching of black and white the roads were empty of traffic and though july was here still from dark coppice and leafy screen there sounded the one eternal song the rapture of nightingales often it seemed to me as if we were standing still while the world in its revolution span by us there was but a space of lamp lit road by which shadow like dream like the trees and open spaces ran for a long piece together as over the hartford bridge flats nothing marked our passage except this whirling of the world it seemed in the darkness that time had ceased and that from its own impetus this globe and the thousand globes above were circling still then in front there began to shine like the reflected light of some comet coming nearer the huge glow worm of london for a while it rested like some remote befogged star on the horizon then its light brightened and its little crawling caterpillars the trains and buses began to creep by us reaching out as it were to the end of the leaf the greenest and most succulent parts then like the opening of a photographers shutter so swift it was we were in the traffic of the town again and all was familiar all was home the country was home too and here was another which was the truer sense the sense that claimed the jackdaw on the tennis net as a brother or the sense that rejoiced in this fierce beating pulse of life perhaps since they are both true there is no question of comparison august something of the primeval savage blood still beats in us we must suppose else why is it that we effete inhabitants of london who love the closeness and proximity of our fellow men so much feel no less keenly the rapture of being miles and miles away from railways and the folk who travel on them how quick too is the transition from one mood to another so that while a week or two ago we rushed insanely it may be but with extraordinary pleasure from party to party jabbering with childlike delight to myriad acquaintances face to face on a blocked staircase or in the drawing room unwillingly silent while somebody sang we now take the same childlike pleasure in long days of solitude but we may take our solitude in pairs in company with a friend who for the time being is no friend at all but a bitter and it is to be hoped disappointed golfer or we may lie out all day in the heather with a silent stalker or as has been my fortunate lot for the last ten days may spend long hours with a sandwich and a fishing rod and a gillie in angling over coffee coloured streams or windswept lochs the oldest inhabitants never remember anything like this summer but they are bad evidence because their memories are probably very defective owing to their age but what is more convincing younger people whose memories are less impaired never remember anything like it so there has been little of the coffee coloured streams for me personally but instead long quiet days by this wonderful loch supposed to hold trout of fabulous dimensions which as far as i can make out nobody has ever caught though every one agrees that they are there then came a wonderful day with more than trout wonder in it i came up here to this remote lodge alone for the trio of us usually go our own ways in holiday time legs in any case had to go to germany to learn that classic and guttural tongue and helen and i always make visiting arrangements independently of each other unless we are both bidden to a house to which we both want to go but it stands to reason so it seemed to us that husband and wife probably do not have the same friends and it is as absurd for her to stay at a house because the host is a great friend of mine as it is for me to stay at a house because the hostess is a great friend of hers coincidences sometimes happen in which we both go together otherwise we make our own arrangements i cannot bear some of her friends she finds it almost impossible to tolerate some of mine and with shouts of laughter we agree to differ then in september or october the trio will come together again and will all talk at once describing simultaneously while nobody listens our delightful adventures i started from the lodge that morning after an early breakfast the gillie having already gone on with lunch and what we hoped would be the apparatus of death for the first time during this last week it was a soft and cloudy morning with a warm wind from the south west sufficient even in this cup of the hills where the lodge stands to set the trees tossing their branches and to strip the red ripe rowanberries from their stalks upon the unsheltered tops then where lay the dark coloured loch with its fabled inhabitants there should be ripple enough for fishing purposes i walked unencumbered but for the field glasses i always carry for nothing during periods of waiting or in the half hour that follows the sandwich is so fascinating as to spy out the busy animal life on these empty moors or find some three or four miles away two or three little human specks moving very gently up the hillside after the deer or sitting there patiently till some untoward affair suspicious hinds or a foul wind are lulled into inactivity but first i had a mile of pine wood to climb up steep slippery needle strewn paths with bracken already yellowing on each side making a sea of russet and green while from overhead in the thick arching boughs there came as it were the noise of an aerial sea the hiss of ripples on a sandy shore as the wind whistled through the stiff springy foliage now and then a rabbit scuttled through the ferns and once i saw quite close at hand a roe deer with flicking ears and startled eyes that as it caught sight of me gave me one shy look of the woodland and then galloped off cutting its way through the tall bracken the path sometimes led by the side of the stream that came out of the loch to which i was bound but the dryness of the summer had hushed its voice and it but trickled down the ways it was wont to prance along in spring here and there a tree of the tamer woodland a beech or stripling elm grew among the primeval firs but it looked as if it had wandered here by mistake had strayed a member of some later civilization into a settlement peopled by those of the older world and as i walked something of the same feeling of strangeness of having gone back to the earlier ages of the world came over me also like the lost beech there were none of my kind here and i felt though in an immeasurably greater degree what one feels when one stands in the valley of the tombs of the egyptian kings but all round me here were things far more ancient than they ons before pharaoh oppressed the children of promise there stood here on this hillside the ancestors in direct line of this woodland the knowledge of the dawn of the world when it was still but a little time since god had bidden the green things to live upon the earth had been transmitted to these citizens of the hillside and to them time had been but a little thing and a thousand ages were but as yesterday as i ascended farther and more remotely into the heart of the wood a sort of eager tremor a desire to see that which i knew was there and which must be so overpowering in its immensity began to grow on me wild silent life bubbled and hummed round me eyes watched me from beneath the fern and looked down on me from the over arching fans of the pines ears were pricked at my footstep strange wild smiles broadened into a laugh at the intruder at this child of immeasurably later ages sometimes it seemed to me as if this ancient consciousness of the woods was scornful and contemptuous so that i quickened my pace and longed to get out of this dark room at other moments and truer ones i knew better knowing that i too was of it all a manifestation of life a piece of the pine woods and brother of the bracken there is no myth that grew so close to the heart of things as the story of pan for it implies the central fact of all the one fact that is so indisputably true that all the perverted ingenuity of man has been unable to split into various creeds about it for pan is all and to see pan or to hear him playing on his pipes means to have the whole truth of the world and the stars and him who as if by a twisting thumb and finger set them endlessly spinning through infinite space suddenly made manifest flesh and blood as the saying is could not stand that and there must be a bursting of the mortal envelope yet that indisputably also is but the cracking of the chrysalis how we shall stand weak eyed still and quivering when transported from the dusk in which we have lived this little life into the full radiance of the eternal day how shall our eyes gain strength and our wings expansion and completeness when the sun of which we have seen but the reflection and image is revealed that is to see pan it killed the mortal body of psyche the soul when she saw him on the hill top by the river and heard the notes of his reed float down to her but she and every soul who has burst the flimsy barrier of death into life joins in his music and every day makes it the more compelling drop by drop the ocean of life made up of the lives that have been rises in the bowl in which god dips his hands he touches every drop the wood in front had grown thin and i was nearly out on the open heather of the hills just here the path crossed the stream bed a great grey cliff of rock was above me in which a pattern of lichens had found crevices for their roots the pine trees waved solemnly overhead the miracle of running water perhaps the greatest miracle of all chuckled and eddied as it slid into the brown pool and quite seriously i waited to see pan the ferns would be pushed aside and the merry face would smile at me for pan though he kills you is kind and he would put his pipes to his lips and the world as i had hitherto seen it would swim away from me and just before he puts his pipes to his mouth i hope i shall say yes begin i am ready or shall i stop my ears and shut my eyes to him i hope not but the fern waved only and the water ran and and i was going a fishing i suppose i had not gone more than a hundred yards after this pause when execrable events occurred it seemed as if some dreadful celestial housemaid suddenly woke up and went on with her work she shut the window that is to say the wind dropped and began to dust she dusted all the clouds away and in ten minutes there was not one left from horizon to horizon there was a sky positively egyptian and an abominable sun shone with hooligan ferocity and i was going a fishing i said what i should not say with such extraordinary distinctness and emphasis that i rapidly took out my field glass and swept the untenanted fields of heather to see that there was no one within a mile or two but i expect the roe deer heard sandy was waiting for me at the near end of the loch when i arrived there a quarter of an hour afterwards scotchmen are never cynical but i should otherwise have suspected him of cynicism when i saw that he had been at pains to set up my rod and was soaking a length of gut the brilliance of the sun from the polished and untarnished field of water was a thing to make the eyes dazzle so i was cynical in turn and from pure cynicism and nothing else at all i put on for the sake of the curious an astonishing fly with a green body bound with silver and a zulu it was a shade too cynical to go out in the boat for i think sandy would have seen through that as it was impossible that any fish should rise at anything in this state of affairs and i fished from the shore fishing at all was an idiotic proceeding and so the incredible happened i wish to call attention to the incredibility of it since it happens to be true here was i then on a still and windless morning with a blazing sun overhead and a looking glass loch in which were supposed to be monstrous fish whose shyness apparently increased in ratio to their weight for nobody had ever seen them before but had only heard about them second hand like ghost stories half a dozen casts carried out a convenient length of line which fell so it appeared to me on the glassy surface of the water like the cane of an angry schoolmaster resonant and cruel then at the end of the cane where the zulu was there came a boil just underneath the looking glass my rod bent and the reel screamed for one moment i knew so i thought for the boil came just as i was preparing to cast again that i had hooked some stalwart weed or perhaps a snag of tree trunk then i knew i had hooked a fish he was clearly insane to have taken a fly at all but what mattered was that he was a large lunatic i thought i knew also that this was but the first act of what would turn out to be a tragedy but the tragedy was not for me again for the sake of the curious i will give his weight he turned the scale at five pounds some six hours later so i imagine he was about five and a half when he came out of the water with the zulu in his mouth he was mad he turned a fierce bedlamite eye on me i dare say i am more impatient than the true fisherman but when i have cast my fly upon the waters for three hours without a hint of a rise i sit down and do not feel it incumbent on me to rise again unless conditions change so when at about two oclock nothing further had broken the surface of the loch except the cane of the schoolmaster i felt after eating my sandwich that i was not unlikely without incurring the contempt of sandy to prolong the interval i wanted also after my mis tryst with pan that morning vaguely also after that day of bovine observance of nature which i had spent a week or two ago in the garden at home to sit up and take notice instead of nirvanic contemplation i wanted to focus all that surrounded me not to see a stag beetle advance ten yards and then go back to the place he advanced from but to see the activity of it all to be alert and to collect not to be lazy and to soak yes it was a wonderful day almost immediately i spied two little human figures on the adjoining forest creeping creeping up a steep brae a mile below i saw their ponies they moved so slowly that it was only possible to see they moved at all because they passed out of the field of my glass the deer i could not find then after watching them for ten minutes more i saw they stopped stealthy movements went on then came the sharp crack of a rifle but before the report reached me they had both jumped up and ran into a hollow of the hills where i lost them it was like being at sea and having news twitched out from the receiver of a marconi apparatus but hardly had that drama been played to its curtain when another started the call of a startled grouse come back come back come back sounded close at hand and it was followed by another and yet another sandy had remained by the edge of the loch when i climbed this hillock for my lunch and since then i had been very quiet so i could not imagine what had caused this commotion on the hill as the stalkers were not on this beat at all to day i could account in fact for the movements of any human being that could have disturbed grouse for a mile or two then i looked up to the enormous sky and saw above me but close so that i could see the outspread feathers of the wing was a golden eagle as i watched i saw he was not vaguely circling looking out for prey but employed in his stalk even as on the other side of the valley ten minutes ago i had watched another stalk he was sweeping wide circles of the moor and driving up towards a gully of the hills behind the fowls of the mountain flying in low and ever narrowing semicircles so that it must seem to the terrified grouse and black game that huge winged danger threatened from every quarter but that yet still i could not guess what his plan was when he had driven them there and then i saw straight down from the grey crag of cliff that rose on the west of this gully into which he had driven the birds there dropped his mate savage and hungry seeking her meat from god aha you grand mistress eagle it is dinner time merrily and well has the old cock grouse lived in the heather lying warm in the sun and filling himself with the good things of the moorland but to day pan sends him to your table and in the swift hissing down rush of your wings he hears his pipes pan will play them for you too some day and the grey film will cover over your fierce yellow eye that was wont undazzled to behold the sun in his strength and the strong hooked beak which gasped for one breath more of the aromatic moorland air will close and be hungry no more and the crooked horny talon will relax and next year maybe i shall find whitened bones on the hillside and perhaps crumpled up under them a feather an eagles feather but i shall not be so foolish as to say i have found you for do i imagine that that is all there is of you that your life your spirit has been blown out like a candle i know better than that for indeed there is no other explanation possible of the incessant war the death the murder the butchery in which natures fair hands are steeped and stained except by this one supposition that the spirit of bird and beast escapes at the moment of death from the splendid sunlit prison of this beautiful world which has the bright eyed hours for its bars otherwise the world becomes a mere intolerable shambles viler than chicago i at any rate cannot believe otherwise but should any sceptical reader at this point ask me to sketch out for him the subsequent movements of the wasp he has just squashed in the tongs or the trout i have just landed i hasten to assure him that i have not the slightest idea about them but that does not invalidate the explanation nor in the least disturb my complete belief in it i do not know what the weather will be this day year but i make no manner of doubt that there will be weather of some kind i only insist that he with his tongs and i with my zulu fly cannot destroy life one cannot even destroy matter how much less then the lord and master of matter i think i have never been in a house where absurd gaiety the gaiety of friends of health of outdoor spirits was so rampant as here and she whose house it was and who was leader of the ludicrous was she as you may have guessed who in june had asked me to come here for the last time that evening when i got home i found her sitting out in the garden enjoying the last half hour of sunset and she beckoned to me across the lawn its true i said i have caught the original trout he had gone mad from old age and riotous living and came to the fly when the sun was brightest and the winds were dead i wish you wouldnt use such beautiful language she said how much does he weigh about a ton he has gone to be weighed now and anything else not a fin no more bites as somebody said last night i chattered with rage you did and what have you been thinking about she asked pan chiefly no to be honest i think i have thought about the fish most but pan next she turned rather slowly on her long wicker couch the tired aching body for the moment usurping the use of her eyes ah dont let us talk i said you are tired and suffering at that she laughed all the more reason for thinking about something less inferior than ones own health she said what cowards we are nowadays why our forebears in elizabeths time used to go smiling to the rack for the sake of some small difference of dogma and we snivel when we have the opportunity of showing by our contempt for pain the truth of things that matter much more if bravery in the abstract and cheerfulness are not worth being brave and cheerful for i dont know what is in any case what conclusion did you come to about pan oddly enough i have been thinking of him too lets compare notes and see if we mean the same person i told her more or less what i have already written down on the subject and at the end she nodded at me with the quick eager gesture that was so characteristic of her hurrah she said i have guessed the same so perhaps our guesses are right but i put it to myself rather more personally and though it sounds conceited so much more vividly than you that is only natural you know pan concerns me much more immediately than he concerns you we hope and another image of him suggested itself to me which appeals to me more than your figure of the ferns being pushed aside and the hand with the pipes in it being raised to the smiling lips listen the sun had dropped behind the big trees to the west of the lawn leaving us in shadow though it still shone on the hills to the east of the house but evening was coming without any chill or whisper of autumn in it and in this northern latitude nights were short in august it was as if she already saw dawn jim and i and our children she said and you and all my friends are shipwrecked or so it would seem to anyone who did not understand on a little rock surrounded by infinite sea every one alive in the world is there too as a matter of fact but our friends somehow are so big to us and strangers and acquaintances so small in comparison that all that really is seen by us is our own immediate circle huge thumping seas surround our rock and for some occult reason we all have to sit exactly where we are while the waves rush up and every moment sweep somebody away we cant move our places and go higher up on the rock and we have to sit and look at the big waves we poor shipwrecked people so a man who does not understand would say and know that this wave or the next will wash us off that is the ignorant view of the situation and the most pessimistic so we will answer it at once even if it was right what then supposing we were shipwrecked and all round us was the howling sea of death would it not be much better until the wave swept us off to make the best of it to talk and laugh and be pleasant with our friends instead of looking with terror stricken eyes at the hungry sea how much nicer even for ourselves to be amused and talk a little while instead of being frightened and how much nicer for our friends when we are swept off as we all certainly shall be to know that before we were swept off we were moderately cheerful and picked up bits of seaweed and played with shells i say nothing of the moral aspect of it all because if you once bring that in there is no question any more about the matter since in one case we are brave and in the other merely cowardly but given that we are shipwrecked that the sea of hungry death surrounds us and will soon pick us off how much better on the lowest possible view of the affair to play about to be kind and gentle even if to morrow there will be an end of us utterly and for ever yes i am using beautiful language too but i am talking of beautiful things well that view is the silliest and most incomprehensible possible how did we get on this absurd rock if only death surrounds us did we come from death into life that is impossible since scientifically you cant produce life out of dead things or did some ship founder on the sea of death and did we swim to shore where we shall live until a wave sweeps us off again that is possible but then what was that ship on which we once were passengers that for a time anyhow until it foundered if it did founder rode over these waves that is a serious question but there is only one answer to it the ship must have been life in some form but the image does not seem convincing does it what is left then only this that the sea which surrounds us on our little rock is not death at all but life just as some day without doubt a wave will sweep us off our rock again so there is no doubt that once a wave of that sea put us on the rock where you and i now are if there is a wreck at all it is a land wreck a wreck that puts us on shore from the great sea of life we have been washed up for a little moment on to our little rock soon we shall be received back into life again in the interval though in a new sense we are wrecked how interesting is our rock and how full of dear people and pink shells and divine things of the sea that life not death casts up round us and nourishes by the spent water of its waves how utterly idiotic it would be not to collect them eagerly these little bits for when we go back into life we shall see the forests from which they come the sapphire caves in which they really dwell a little bit of life that grouse that the eagles ate was cast up close to you to day i shall particularly ask when the wave takes me off again where it came from and i shall go and see the place and certainly i shall see mistress eagle come back courage huge natural courage like this absolutely unassumed absolutely instinctive may have one of two effects on the beholder of it it may make him weep for the admiration of it or it may make him laugh out of joyousness of heart for the same admiration at least i laughed oh be sure to show me the place when i come i said i am certain that mistress eagle will have a nice house they all have she said there are many mansions she looked at me in silence a moment but i was not so certain of all these things when first i knew that i was so soon to see them all she said at first though i was never exactly frightened i was dazed and stunned i saw nothing clearly i must use another image for that and say that days passed as one sees the landscape pass through a railway carriage window which is blurred by rain i could see nothing clearly it was all dim and rain streaked but then without any conscious effort on my part except perhaps a little exercise of patience we passed the train and i out of the scud again and soon the glass cleared and i saw the green valleys and the sunny hillside just as they had always been again she paused i have not told you anything of importance yet she said all i have said is really quite obvious but this now you think of pan as the smiling face that peeps from the fern the presence that assures all suffering things that he is kind when he pipes to them even though the sound means death but surely that is no more than a sort of pagan mythical aspect of him i always think that he suffers too that every pain which he seems to inflict is only the reflection of the pain in his own universal heart although he still smiles it is from the cross that he smiles at us all september the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness has indeed been a close bosom friend of the maturing sun and for the last three days before legs went back to his crammer in town he helen and i spent a prostrated existence heat that in july invigorates is utterly intolerable if it occurs at the end of september just as the crisp winter day which would be so welcome in january descending to the earth as it usually does in june produces merely amazed horror at the weather and probably a cold the superficial view that we suffer because we are improperly clad for these climatic surprises a view that helen put forward the other night is beside the point during these days if i was improperly clad it was only because i has so little on in fact only ten minutes before she had said as much the state of legs affections i am bound to add aggravated the sultriness of the weather and made me feel exactly three hundred and fifty years old to take it at its best he was embarked on a violent flirtation with a dreadful girl to take it at its worst he was falling in love with her she is the daughter of a neighbouring minute squire who owns three turnip fields and calls it shooting legs shot over it the other day and after walking over the whole estate twice got back to the grange in time for lunch this was before i returned from scotland or i should have tried to prevent it probably i should not have succeeded the neighbouring squires name is ampthump i know quite well that it is not his fault but that wedded to what he is and a german wife makes me unable to like him his wife makes incredible quantities of jam which again is an innocent pursuit and charlotte the daughter talks german to legs who i wish was more like goethe the whole family in fact as may have been already perceived appear to me to be simply intolerable the attachment also has already led to equivocation on the part of legs he pretends that he talks to charlotte because it is so good for his german he knows that it is not so and i know it is not so and i think he knows that i know it is not so but it really looks at the moment that unless they marry each other there will be a broken or at any rate a cracked heart i only hope it will not be legs i dont care the least what happens to charlottes heart it may however be only a flirtation in which case there probably will not even be a crack legs will wake up one morning and after handling some precious withered flowers will wonder what on earth they ever meant to him and throw them in the fire or charlotte will do something equally desperate that is my hope my fear is that they are falling in love with each other this narrative it should be understood is the gist of what i have been saying fragmentarily to helen she considers it a cynical view which alarms me since i hold the creed that all cynics are properly and irretrievably damned to night legs went to bed early with dishevelled hair a wakeful eye and a gale of sighs and i came upstairs to talk to helen about it all while she brushed her hair you are quite ridiculous about it she said because you happen not to like the ampses we have agreed on that abbreviation you think that they are unlovable legs has proved the contrary besides what on earth does her name matter if she is going to change it i groaned intentionally and in a graveyard manner do you mean that you think legs is in love with her i asked yes at least i hope so he had a long talk with me to day he said he felt it was time he settled down what a darling just twenty i wish i was most of this was irrelevant i tried to pick out pieces that were not of course her name doesnt matter i said her name might be well you cant do worse than ampthump and it does happen to be exactly that but her face is like a ham that is superficial said helen beside it isnt its oval so is a ham and shes a prig ampthump good lord i am afraid i shouted this because she said hush legs will hear not he or if he does he will think it is only the wind whispering the beloved name yes but you didnt whisper it oh do take the brush you made me send my maid away so you must do it yourself i cant brush from here because my arms are in front now in my heart i pity everybody who has not seen helen with her hair down all such folk in all their millions lead impoverished existences there is a wave in it that is like the big unbroken billows which succeed a storm when the clouds have passed and the sun shines it is lit from within even as they seem to be irradiated from the depths those billows must go over a sandy foreshore for they are yellow and the sun i know not how must be foggy for there is a little red light in them and brushing as i did now i held my hand over them and the hair rose to it with a tiny cracking sound her hair came to my hand lifted towards it that unminted gold that framed her face and covered her ears and for a little while it was no wonder that i forgot about legs and his charlotte i suppose every one knows the sensation of being lost you can be lost all by yourself as i was once as i have said in the western desert of egypt on which occasion the bray of a donkey was to me the trumpet of the seraphin that was a dreadful experience since it implied being out of touch with life but i should be glad to know if there is anything the world holds which is more enraptured than the sense of being lost with one other person to feel the world swim away and be dissolved so that you and the comrade you are with are quite alone to feel that there is no existence except the existence of her who is lost with you it was helens hair thats the worlds side theres the wonder that lover understood everyone saw helens hair but the best is when i glide from out them cross a step or two of dubious moonshine come out on the other side i never could quote correctly the point is that the beloved has another face the face she turns to her lover no one else sees it it is blind to keats him even a moment ago i thought that no one but me must see helens hair now let them all see it the waves of the sunlit sea not breaking unless the break be where i put my hand an inch above them thanks dear she said soon you brush it much better than my maid now shall we talk for five minutes then i must go to bed i had hideous accumulations of various fag ends of work to do and at the end of the five minutes or it might be ten i went downstairs again to begin at any rate this dreadful patchwork of odds and ends it was still i was almost sorry to observe only just eleven and since i had with both eyes open deliberately and firmly wasted all the hours of the day my uneasy conscience told me that i had better if it was to have the ease it craved not think of leaving my chair for a couple of hours at least i argued this point with it and lost some minutes for i told it that it was extremely bad for me to work at night that it took more out of one than work in the day that work done under these circumstances was never good work that doctors recommended one never to work at night but go peacefully to bed before the evening fever whatever that might be set in then there ensued a short spirited dialogue most sensible said conscience give me your word that you will get up at six to morrow then and work for two hours before breakfast and you have my leave to go to bed now but i shant wake at six said i and the servants have gone to bed i will wake you said conscience conscience is quite capable of the odious feat but i cant work before breakfast i said it makes me feel i could not think of the word for the moment oh yes faint well feel faint then said conscience but i would sooner not it implies weakness of the heart not to do your work implies weakness of character shut up said i and let me begin then and i could swear that my conscience gave a self satisfied chuckle for an hour i waded wearily knee deep only so to speak in work like a man who wants to swim but has to trudge out over level sands most people i fancy even the laziest of us like working when we get up to our necks or better even out of our depths in it but the wading is weary work the worst of it was that the fact that i had to wade so far was entirely my own fault for the whole of the last week i had never taken the trouble to finish up any one job and now there waited for me several bills to pay since a few mornings ago i had sat down to pay bills and had paid them all except two or three several letters to write all of which had to begin either falsely ie i have just found your letter of the th or apologetically ie i havent answered your letter before because then there was a half corrected proof of an unfinished article badly written originally and what is more written without conviction it was on a subject that did not particularly interest me and i had only written it because the misguided editor of a magazine had offered me for it and i very much wished to buy a seal top spoon which cost exactly that sum and which i knew perfectly well i had no right to buy so saying to myself that i would write this article which i should not otherwise have done i had bought it and here was the dismal price that i had to pay for it namely that this wretched article was a piece of literary dishonesty i had to fudge and vamp over it trying to conceal the nakedness of the land by ornamental expressions that was brought home to me now it was all bad cheap stuff and though most of us are continually turning out bad cheap stuff not knowing it is bad and cheap such manufactures become criminal when we do know it as long as work is honest from the workmans point of view it is only his misfortune when he does not know its valuelessness but when he does know its valuelessness he sins by intention and is a forger i was one and by my forgery i had bought a seal top that was not i thought that when i tacitly agreed to work for two hours to night my tiresome conscience would put its head under its wing and leave me alone but i found now that it was broad awake again and chirping like a canary what are you going to do it chirped are you going to send out a rotten forgery which everybody who knows anything will detect or are you going to tear it up and be left with a purchase that you know you cant really afford remember that you must get a new dining room carpet too you promised helen you would chirp chirp chirp i am bound to say that this enraged me whats the use of making that row i said its you conscience who has to settle i havent the slightest idea said conscience its your fault you wouldnt listen to me when i told you that you had no right to accept for your dreadful article you didnt say it so loud then said i no but you heard all right said conscience i hardly heard said i you spoke so indistinctly yes but you did hear it chirped with a sort of devilish cheerfulness you knew quite well what i meant now you suffer for it hurrah i wonder if i am cursed in this matter of conscience beyond the majority of mankind often and often i will swear to this in the house of lords if necessary my conscience is hardly audible at all at the time when i do anything which i ought not to do or omit to do anything which i ought to continue the simile of the canary which really fits the case when the actual choice comes it is as if the canary had a thick green baize cover round its cage and only hoarse and muffled notes reach me very often indeed i am sorry to say i dont attend to them or say it is only the cat and in consequence do what i should not then the moment it is done the baize cover is whisked off and the infernal and cheerful chirping or so it sounds succeeds to the wrong choice or the weak omission and the burden of the chirping is always the same i told you so i told you so now you are in a mess what are you going to do now chirp chirp chirp and a hurricane of dry and deafening notes follows i sat there with this column of stupid twaddle in my hands and conscience watched me with its bright bird like eye much as i like birds i hate their eyes because they remind me of conscience they are beady and absolutely unsympathetic frightfully quick to see and without a particle of pity in them conscience never pities one at all it is the foe that is of a mans household it always gloats over ones mistakes and things that are more than mistakes and only says here comes the master with the whip a new lash i see this time and what a thin shirt you have got on nor when the whipping is over does conscience sympathize i told you so i told you so it says no there is no soothing ointment of any kind in the house i ate it all up wasnt that a beautiful new lash well i tore that dreadful nonsense up and wrote another apologetic letter i am getting quite good at them but to morrow this is what makes conscience mad i shall tell helen about it the telling is not pleasant it never is but as soon as helen knows conscience has simply to retire it does not understand why it suddenly becomes so unimportant and that gives it a fit of impotent rage nor do i quite understand though i am nearer to the explanation than conscience is but she understands at least i suppose so or else she would not be able to put the green baize cover on again and then what with apologetic letters and the drawing of two or three cheques and the stupid attempts in this matter of the dishonest article to produce something out of nothing by covering up the nothingness by more ornamental expressions and the eventual destruction of it all i found that the two hours were gone and that i had kept my promise to the idiotic canary it had ceased chirping from experience when i told it i was going to confess to helen the night was intensely hot and through the long open windows of the room in which i had been working no breeze entered though september had but a quarter more of its course to run it was like some sultry july midnight portending storm for when i went out to take the night breath the sky was thickly overcast so that no direct ray either of moonlight or of starshine came earthwards the serrated outline of the elms at the end of the lawn was scarce distinguishable against the scape of the clouds and the low land of the water meadows was blanketed in a mist that was only just visible by its whiteness against the black blot of the hills behind fifi who had very sensibly decided to sleep on the veranda did not stir when i came out though i heard the instinctive thump of her short tail on the tiles the natural politeness of the dear dog though she really could not stand on ceremony with me to the length of getting up so maliciously i am afraid since i thought this slightly cavalier conduct i said puss though there was no puss of any sort as far as i was aware but my malice was again thwarted for fifi just tapped again with her tail in courteous recognition of a stale old joke just to show that she appreciated my intention but she made not the smallest further effort towards activity so she was half asleep and all the world this dear blessed world which is so full of merriness and simple innocent pleasure despite the fulminations of fashionable priests was quite asleep not stirring scarcely breathing just sleeping sleeping it was not yet the hour when just before the hold of the night begins to tremble and be weakened in the sky all living things wake for a moment that mysterious moment when sheep take a bite of grass and cows twitch their grave ears and horses stand up for a minute before they settle down to the light morning sleep which dissolves with day and when even indoors if you sleep with a dog in your room and happen yourself to be awake you will hear a stretching of limbs on your bed or on the carpet and a long sigh breathed into the blankets plants and flowers so i truly believe feel the same thing and though there may be no wind perceptible to you if you are abroad as sometimes i am at that hour you will hear just at the moment when cattle move and sheep take their bite of grass a stir go through the trees and a hushed whisper lisp in the flower beds at that moment too you need not credit this though it is absolutely true though it has rained all night till then and will rain thereafter steadily soakingly till morning the rain ceases as suddenly as if a tap was turned off time and again i have tested that but as i have said that mysterious moment was not due yet it was still two hours short of it and everything was still asleep even in the last minute or two fifi had fallen fast asleep too after i had sat down in a wicker chair on the veranda for when i called her there was no tap of response to night too the sleep of the world seemed to me feeling it as one does by that sixth sense which still exists dormant in us and is most awake at night to be extraordinarily deep it was the sleep of a world that was very tired with this long hot summer there seemed no pulse stirring in it at all as you may find it stir in the light sleep in which nature indulges in june or still more in the dark wet nights of spring when the secret boiling up of life begins again from hidden root to budding tendril so that if you lay your ear to the trunk of a tree it seems that the effervescence of the young year is audible and sings within it even as the telegraph poles are resonant with the wind that hums in the wires nor could i hear when i rose and walked across the lawn even though the dew was heavy on the grass the hiss of startled worms withdrawing from the approaching footfall black too and lifeless was the oblong of the house except where the lights burned in the room in which i had been trying to be honest the long herbaceous hedge was black the lawn was black helens windows and legs were black i went back to the seat i had just left and lit a cigarette meaning to go upstairs to bed when i had smoked it fifi still lay motionless though generally any excursion into the garden at any time of day or night sets her scampering and then quite suddenly quite unexpectedly for nothing was further from my thoughts i became aware that though the physical world was asleep there was some enormous stir and activity going on in the occult world which surrounds and permeates us yet that is perhaps a wrong expression for the same activity and stir always goes on in that unsleeping realm and i must express it more accurately by saying that the part of me which was able to perceive it was suddenly quickened it is possible of course since i confess to being able to go to sleep whenever i choose and often without delay when i do not that at that moment i fell asleep but whether i fell asleep or not does not make the slightest difference for there was clearly some part of my brain awake and it made my eyes think that they saw and my ears think that they heard that which immediately followed as far as i am aware in any case i sat down again in a rather creaky basket chair and lit a cigarette the match with which i lit it i threw on to the gravel path in front of me and since i required it no further it proceeded to burn prosperously by its light i could see fifi with her nose between her paws i saw also that my shoe lace was untied and then i heard my name called from the garden in a voice that was perfectly familiar to me though for the moment i could not say so elusive is the ear whose voice it was that called it was not helens it was not legs it was not and then i remembered whose voice it was it called me by name once only in the voice that had said it is from the cross that he smiles at us all i do not think i was frightened but simply for the purely personal reason that to me there was nothing to be frightened at the match still burned on the gravel path so short had been the measurement of this in the world of time and i could still see fifis nose buried between her paws then she raised it looked out into the garden with terrified scrutinizing eyes focussing them on something invisible to me and gave one long howl but there was no moon it was at something else she howled then i confess as if some bomb had burst within me terror flooded my whole mind submerging it and i sprang up simultaneously i heard a sort of strangled scream from the room above and the scurry of unshod feet overhead next moment the sound of an opening door came to my ears and a quick stumbling tread on the stairs i ran indoors and reached the door leading from my room into the hall just as the handle was seized and shaken by someone on the other side of it and legs burst into the room his hair all tumbled and erect and his face wearing such a mask of terror that for the moment i recognized him only because it must be he who is that in the garden he said someone in white who looked up at my window and fifi howled at her this would never do nerves terror are the most infectious things in the world and unless i took steps there would i knew be standing here two babbling lunatics i was dozing in the veranda i said and fifi woke me by howling she woke you too legs dont be an ass pull yourself together if there had been anything i should have seen it legs was as white as a sheet the whiteness somehow showed through his freckled sun tanned skin he was swaying to and fro on his feet as if he would fall and i put my arm around him and deposited him in a chair then i poured out a wineglassful of neat whisky dont speak another word till you have drunk that i said then i shall count ten slowly and then you may speak fifi had followed me in and sat close to the door whimpering with my heart in my mouth and a perspiring forehead i went across to the window as i counted shut and locked it and pulled down the blind nine ten i said a little colour had begun to come back to legs face he had drunk the whisky a beverage which he detested like water and the frozen fear of his eyes was less biting and then as suddenly as it had come on my terror left me whatever it was that i had heard whatever it was that legs had seen and fifi perceived there was nothing to terrify besides within myself now that the cowardly disorder of my nerves had passed i believed i knew what it was that had made its presence so strangely perceived by us all the mortal suffering of a dear friend was over already i was ashamed of having told legs that i had been asleep and had neither seen nor heard anything legs i lied just now i said i heard my name called from the garden in margarets voice you mean she is dead asked he gently the last accounts had been better i thought im sure she is then for a moment like a sudden squall the white terror passed over legs face again it was not her i saw he said hoarsely it was death i thought she had come for me fifi saw her too i sat down on the arm of his chair yes old boy i said i think that you and fifi both saw some manifestation of what i heard but there is nothing to be frightened at but how was it you were at your window you had gone to bed hours ago i know but i couldnt sleep so i got up and sat by the window we sat there for some time after that and by degrees legs recovered from his collapse and soon instead of terror mere sleepiness invaded his face once or twice he stifled a yawn and at length he got up i am dead sleepy he said i think i shall go to bed you are not frightened any longer are you i asked legs looked at me out of drooping eyelids and he seemed puzzled frightened what about he said good night i was very late down next morning and found that helen and legs had nearly finished breakfast as i came in he jumped up ah here he is he cried now did you sit up very late last night when he asked that i began to have some suspicion of what was coming next yes very why well were you talking to yourself helen and i both woke in the night and heard talking in your room i had had some dream that frightened me and i nearly came downstairs for human companionship why didnt you i was too sleepy but were you talking no you were dreaming so was helen i may have groaned now and then over proofs but not more than that legs nodded at helen i told you it was ghosts he said and you heard voices too i asked helen yes at least i thought so but i was very sleepy i thought also i heard fifi howl so you see there is no corroboration of my story and if i dreamed it at all or made it up there is no one to whom i can appeal for confirmation of its verity but there is just this little bit of evidence namely that though legs had finished breakfast he went on drinking cup after cup of tea when helen left us he explained this to me i woke with a mouth like a lime kiln he said just as if i had been drinking that dreadful whisky of yours i drank most of my jug too and they had to bring me more water to wash in what happened last night then had been wiped clean off legs brain again whatever it was that he had seen that which made him stumble white faced downstairs had gone but an hour or two later while we were out playing croquet in the garden some faint echo of it i think crossed him again a telegram was brought out for me which contained what i knew it would contain and i handed it to him when i had read it then we went quietly indoors just as we got into my room again he said how odd that sensation is of feeling that something has happened before when you handed me the telegram i felt i knew what was in it and during the last week she had been rather better had she not october the business of the dining room carpet a case of conscience makes the whole world kin so i confidently return to this matter was settled more beautifully than i had thought possible i told helen all about it and she said thank goodness you tore the thing up dear you are such a silly ass theres nothing whatever more to be said you are arent you theres nothing more to be said i believe you remarked well you may just say yes said she so i said yes it was a variant of the womans last word spoken by a man instead there now well go and quarrel about the rose garden said she we went and quarrelled she was flushed with triumph over making me say yes and in consequence i got my way about several disputed points which to day the darling thinks she chose herself the rose garden is a design of unparalleled audacity and when it grows up it will be nothing short of stupendous for between us helen and i are territorial magnates and beyond this house and garden which are hers i am owner of two fields and limitless possibilities i bought them a year ago in a sudden flush of extravagance and for six months we maintained there at staggering loss a poultry yard in one corner and a cow over the rest the original design of course was to make a sound investment in land which in addition to the fathomless pleasure of owning it would keep us in butter eggs chickens to eat not to mention as i hasten to do savouries of chicken liver on toast and possibly beef if one considers the question closely it is difficult to see how a cow can give milk and give beef but helen in visionary enthusiasm said we should have oxen as well and why not pigs in the farther corner i did not at once see why not and i bought the two fields with the same unconcern as i should have bought a box of matches which yield so sure an enjoyment in the matter of lighting cigarettes then we both began to learn that though we might be gardeners we were not farmers the poultry yard was mistakenly no doubt erected at the corner of the field nearest the house and morning after morning we were awakened at dead and timeless hours helen said that when a hen made a long clucking noise it meant she had laid an egg and that till the thing became incredible consoled me for if she was right it was clear that hens laid invisible eggs or that they were doing tiresome conjuring tricks and that the long drawn crow meant i have laid an egg but see if you can find it i am the mother of this disappearing egg we usually were not able to do so but sometimes an egg was found in a hedge or in a ditch which when found was totally uneatable except by the chinese personally i believe that by some unhappy mischance we had bought celibate and barren poultry whose customs drove us daily nearer bedlam in fact it the pig that was our hellebore the pig was not a pig but a sow she went mad too or so i must believe jumped the pigsty in the opposite corner made a bee line for the poultry yard went through our beautiful wire fencing as if it had been a paper hoop in a circus and ate two hens the cock beat a masterly retreat and was never heard of again the other four hens followed him and the sow dripping with gore lay down in the hen house and slept almost before she woke she was sold for a song then the cow came i do not wish to libel her but i think i may safely say that she was milkless and excitable and had a wild eye she roamed over my fields mine i had bought them as if they were her own had not legs been so agile and swift she might have tossed him as it was she ran into the brick wall at the lower end of the garden and made her nose bleed as far as i know that was the only liquor that she parted with she was probably mad also for she used to low in the middle of the night when all proper cows are fast asleep asleep or awake however now she makes her fantasias elsewhere i almost hope she is dead for it requires a larger optimism than i possess to believe that she will ever become a proper cow for she was more of a steed for mazeppa perhaps she was a horse after all a horned horse i wish we had thought of that at the time as it was we sold her at outrageous loss as a cow and with her we parted with any idea of keeping farmyard animals for purposes of gain perhaps we were not serious enough about it and the animals saw that through last spring and summer the fields rested after this invasion of outrageous animals and about the middle of may it struck helen and me simultaneously that we were going to have a crop of hay that was delightful and much less harassing than hens hay would not wake one at timeless hours nor would it go mad and have to be sold at a quarter of the price we gave for it since we gave nothing for it at all it was the pound of tea thrown in with the fields we had bought or the times newspaper thrown in with your subscription to that extraordinary library from this there was born the scheme of giving a haymaking party to which we originally planned to ask everybody we knew amended that to asking all the children we knew and afterwards this was helens amendment decided not to ask anybody at all partly because children were so serious but chiefly because there might not be enough hay to go round we neither of us knew how many square yards of hay it was reasonable to supply to each person and it would be dreadful if there was not enough either helen or i or both of us would have to go without and it was safer to give the haymaking party to each other we were in town all may and the first half of june but had left word with the gardener to send us a postcard when the hay was ready the weather throughout these weeks was gloriously sunny and in our minds eye we saw the crop growing taller and thicker with each blazing day then one evening came the memorable postcard a reddy we flew to the a in the middle of the largest field was a small haycock like a penwiper one not quite so large and round at the top more like a pincushion was visible in the next field it was clear after this that the powers that are willed that our fields should not be used for utilitarian purposes hence the inception of the rose garden a brick wall the one against which the insane cow had blooded her nose bounded the garden from there the ground declined steeply away into the middle of the larger field which was cup shaped the ground rising on all sides of it it was at the centre of the cup where the sugar is that the penwiper had been raked together to day a flight of steps made of broken paving stones an entrancing material led down the side of the cup from the garden gate and up the opposite slope standing where the sugar is therefore you saw on every side of you rising ground which had been terraced and walks of broken paving stone communicating with the two staircases lay concentrically round and the herculean labour which had already occupied us so many rapturous afternoons was to plant the whole cup with rose trees so that standing in the centre there was nothing visible except sky and roses that was practically done and to day what occupied us was the consideration of the level remainder of the field of which there was some half acre it was rough coarse grass starred with dandelion which gave the first hint we wanted to get rid of the dandelion and at last i got helen to agree and i mixed together in a wheelbarrow an infinity of bulbs and other delectable roots there were big onion like daffodils neat crocuses with an impatient little yellow horn sticking up fritillary roots bottle shaped tulips the corms of anemones and the orris of the iris then trowel in hand each with a bag of bulbs taken haphazard out of the wheelbarrow and with a bag of sand to make a delectable sprouting place for the roots we started every dandelion encountered was to be dug up with honesty and thoroughness and where the dandelion had been there was to be planted a bulb taken at random out of the bag helen said it would take ten years personally when i looked i thought longer but i did not say so for i practice reticence on discouraging occasions i wonder how many people know the extraordinary delight of doing a thing for oneself starting from the beginning i do not say that it gives me the smallest pleasure to black my boots or brush my clothes since somebody has already made those boots and woven the cloth but there is nothing more entrancing than to deal first hand with nature to make holes in the earth and put in them roots the farthest back that we can go with regard to vegetable life rightly or wrongly it seems to me a pleasure as clean and as elemental as the joy of creation itself whether we write a book or paint a picture or carve a statue we though we do not really create but only arrange what is in existence already are going back as far as we can taking just the root thoughts and translating them to song or shape and though we do not really create at all but only use and arrange as i have said the already existing facts of the world passing them it may be through the crucible of the mind we get quite as near to nature if not nearer when we go a bulb planting the bulbs are our thoughts our pigments what you will and when in spring time we shall see them making a meadow of fra angelico it will be because we have actually planted these things ourselves that the joy of creation will be ours not to do that would be as if an artist laid no brush on the canvas himself but merely dictated to a dependent where such a colour should be spread but given that he had a slave so intelligent and so obedient that he could follow to a hairs breadth the directions given him can you imagine the artist feeling the possessive joy of creation in the result even though it realized the conception to the uttermost not i nor in the garden do i care like that to see what others have done it is not sufficient to direct one has to do it oneself i love too and cannot conceive not loving getting hot and dirty over the wrestling with the clean black earth a great deal of nonsense is talked about the dignity of labour but it is chiefly talked by those whose labour lies indoors who excellent craftsmen as they may be go spudding about in the intangible realms of the mind i doubt indeed whether any market gardener has ever spoken of the dignity of labour we leave that to those who only know it by repute but i long to put down the manner of the transaction i do not in the least think it dignified but it is such fun the green had mostly faded from the grass leaving the meadow as is always the case in october far more grey than green certain plants however were still of varnished brightness and the dandelion leaf was one there was no need to pick and choose and without moving a step i dug the trowel down into the earth loosened it all round the vegetable enemy and lifted it an ominous muffled snap came from inches down in the earth which i tried to pretend i had not heard but one could not cheat the eye also there at the bottom of my excavation was a milky root showing a danger signal of white against the brown loam i had to go deeper yet the whole of the tap root must be exhumed another dig another snap a raw looking worm recoiled from the trowel only just in time and eventually up came the remotest fibre how good the earth smelt how reeking with the life of the world cold clammy rich earth ever drawn upon by the needs of the bank of life ever renewed by that which life paid back to it a thousand years had gone to the formation of my trowelful and a few inches below was the chalk where a million lives a million years ago had spent themselves on the square inch of it slowly by work of the myriad sea beasts this shoulder of chalk was heaved from the sea the myriad lives became a myriad myriad and here i had the little lump of chalk borne up on the end of the trowel which told of the labourers of the unnumbered years then in a spoonful of sand i put the sign the evidence of another decade of millions on the top of them and stuck thereon an onion like daffodil root that was born last year in a fortnights time that child of to day will have reached downwards feeling with delicate pleased touch the sand of a thousand years ago will delve through the time of the pyramids of egypt will draw moisture from the chalk that was old when our computation of time was not yet born and will blossom next april feeding its sap on the primeval years and for what to make helen and legs and me say oh what a beautiful horsfeldii then we shall look at the fritillary that prospers a yard away the eternal romance of it all to the right minded there is nothing that is not a fairy story like children we crowd round the knees of the wonderful teller of it and say is it true is it all true and he cant tell lies sometimes when we have a sort of moral toothache we sit apart and sniff we say that scientifically we have proved there is no god so said the fool in his heart but nowadays the fools write it down in their damned books and correct the proofs of it and choose the bindings of it and read with gusto the thoughtful reviews of it and god forgive them they think they are very clever people if i may be excused for mentioning them at all but fairy stories how surprising and entrancing are even those which people make up and put in books while round us every day a fairy story far more wonderful is being told not only for us to read but enacted for us to see it is only familiarity with it which robs us of the sense of its wonder for imagine if we could make ourselves ignorant again of what happens to bulbs when we put them in the earth how the possibilities of flying machines would grow flat and stale before the opening of the daffodil for a mans capacity for happiness is in great measure the same as his capacity for wonder and interest and considering that there is absolutely nothing round us which does not teem with wonder if only we had the sense to see it it argues very ill for our a wild shriek from the hillside opposite distance forty yards interrupted me i didnt mean to cried helen but i cut a centipede in half they are going in opposite directions dig another hole i shouted then go back when the halves have gone away yes very distressing but you cant avoid everything murderer said helen this was feminine logic i had not cut the centipede in half it was one of those golden october days of which we have now had some half dozen every night there is a little frost so that morning both looks and smells exquisitely clean and it is hardly possible to regret the turn of the year though dahlias are blackened the trees blaze with copper and gold for in this week of windless days scarce a leaf has fallen and the stems are as thick with foliage as they were in the summer and to my mind doubly beautiful and this work of bulb planting seems to bridge over the winter for we are already at work on spring but in november helen and i mean to turn our faces townwards again for it is possible there to be unaware of the transition to winter which is so patently before ones eyes in the country and which with the best will in the world it is impossible not to find rather depressing some people i know label the squalls of february march as execrable and flee the country then but we both love them these are the last despairing efforts of winter his hand is already loosed from the earth he strikes wildly knowing that there are but few blows left in him but in the autumn he is gaining strength every day it is life whose hold is being loosed and that is not exhilarating to watch true it is only a mimic death bed but personally we dont want to sit by the bedside in london there is no bedside the shorter the day the earlier the lamps are lit those avenues of shining eyes which are not shocked whatever they see and the fogs the mysterious fogs i suppose we are cockneys helen gave out first in the matter of bulbs and came and sat by me how very dirty you are she said and have you been planting bulbs with your nose not at present but it tickled and so i rubbed it well lets stop now i want to go for a walk my back aches with bending and though i havent got toothache i feel as if i might have and the kitchen maid has given notice and i dont think anybody loves me and if legs marries that awful girl i will never speak to you again and they are coming to dinner to night i pray heaven that legs may miss his train and not get here till late so do i yes lets go for a real tramp on the downs hadnt i better go and wash my face first oh no what does it matter but are you sure you dont want to go on bulbing quite sure i think we wont go by the road do you know we can strike across the meadows and up the beacon helen gave a little purr a querulous rumble of the throat i have the blues she said with great distinctness i was as happy as possible till ten minutes ago and then they came on like like a thunderstorm everything ached i groaned aloud my mind hurt me like lumbago it hurts still oh do rub something on it that is one of the heavenly things about helen if she feels bad she comes and tells me about it like a child she scolds me for all sorts of things of which i am perfectly innocent because she knows i dont mind one scrap i love it really but i dont tell her that and it makes her feel better she scolded now even when we had passed the water meadow and began a really steep ascent of the flanking hills i knew the kitchen maid wouldnt stop she said because those london girls hate the country so do i and it was all your fault you engaged her i had nothing to do with it and we never had such a kitchen maid she cooks better than the cook and does everybody elses work as well you might have known she wouldnt stand the country go on said i my fault entirely so is the toothache isnt it i havent got one but i might have and thats your fault too i wanted to go to the dentist as i passed through london and you persuaded me to come down here without stopping it did ache just then it did the hill got rather steeper go on said i how slowly you walk yes but i have to do all the talking you have no conversation oh dear what a devil i am arent i yes there i told you nobody loved me oh look we are going to have a real red sunset all the hills are getting molten as if they were red hot and glowing she was feeling a little better not much but a little we had come up the two hundred feet of steep down side as if we had been storming a breach to walk very fast up a hill makes all proper people feel better unless they have heart disease in which case they die and so we hope feel better also but for those who have not heart disease and want to feel better the prescription is confidently recommended and then that awful girl she went on you insisted on being neighbourly as you call it with the ampses and this is the result there has been none at present no but you tell me to ask the family to dinner on the very day that legs comes down oh dear what a heavenly evening i should so enjoy it if everything wasnt wrong look at the sky fifty thousand little pink fluffy angels floating about in it do you want to go right to the top of the hill yes right to the top then i shall begin to answer you back helen laughed oh no dont she said it is no fun plaguing you if you dispute my facts so tell me quickly isnt everything your fault and not mine please pull me if you intend to go that pace so i pulled her she holding the end of my stick and we arrived at the very top of all sunset was below us evening stars were above us and on the huge expanse of down there was no one else it was the loneliness i love the devil has gone she said after a while you are rather nice to me and i dont think i have toothache and well you thought that charlotte was a little ampsy before i did and even if nobody loves me oh how dirty your nose is that was true anyhow an extraordinary phenomenon in country towns is that though nobody has anything to do everyone feels extremely busy whereas in town though you have got an enormous deal to do you never feel busy at all and can without fail find time for anything else i think there must be some microbe which cannot live in london but thrives elsewhere which produces the illusion of being rushed personally i know it well it is not an old enemy of mine nor is it an old friend but it is a pleasant old humbug which i am afraid i rather encourage this evening for instance when i went to my room after tea i encouraged it and argued that one never had a moment to oneself i had two hours in front of me now as a matter of fact in which i should be undisturbed but the old humbug said that it was all very well to think about the future all he knew was that he that is i had been rushed yes rushed all day and all yesterday and ever since we came down to this dear sleepy old town to day was tuesday and people were coming to dinner we had gone out to lunch yesterday and had dined out twice last week also there was the garden to attend to and a little golf almost every day as a matter of fact was necessary for the health and what with letters to write and cigarettes to smoke and the meistersinger overture to learn in order to play it with legs i was a victim of this hurrying bustling mode of life which in a generation or so more would assuredly send everybody off their heads i made myself quite comfortable in my chair and proceeded to think about it seriously because i had two hours in front of me it was all quite true i was encouraging the old humbug you will understand and the modern mode of life was insane london anyhow was insane and in a little while i should probably get to agree with the old humbug that i was rushed and driven in the country also but to encourage credulity i took london first there one certainly was busy all the hours that is to say of a day that began quite early and ended next morning were full and i reconstructed one such as i often spend and hope to spend many times more i do not give it because it seems to me the least edifying and all stern moralists the old humbug is an awfully stern moralist would as indeed they have done shake their heads over it and say to what purpose i will tell you that afterwards i was called let me say at half past seven and after a few incredulous groans got up i shaved washed a little not much for reasons that will appear drank some tea and in a quarter of an hour was wildly bicycling towards the park when things flourished very much and money flowed helen and i rode champing steeds but just now things were what is called fluctuating and i rode a bicycle and she stayed in bed an hour and a half of frantic pedalling on a hot june morning produces excellent physical results and at half past nine i was in the swimming bath at the bath club where i became cool and clean i changed into another suit of flannels there rode sedately home and had breakfast at precisely a quarter past ten by eleven i had eaten breakfast read the daily mail and smoked a cigarette and was about to spend a quiet studious morning until half past one for we were lunching out at two when helen came in do come to lords she said its gentlemen and players and we can sit there till lunch we cant go this afternoon and you are playing golf at woking to morrow i cant not time oh just this once just this once then we went it was too heavenly and we were late for lunch it was one of the rather long lunches and it was nearly four when we left the house then as we had neither of us seen the sargents at the academy we went there since the afternoon was already gone and got home about six and as we had been given a box at the opera for tristan which began at half past seven it was necessary to dine at half past six a terrible hour but true at the opera legs picked helen up to go to a ball and i went home to answer my mornings post which i had not yet read but it will be objected gentlemen and players and the one necessary visit to the academy and tristan does not occur every day quite true but something else always does and the old humbug who had got quite large and important during this short survey said in those canting tones which i knew so well you are wasting your life over this insensate rush and hurry and you do no better down here what have you done to day planted bulbs and written two or three pages of your silly book what will you do to morrow you wont even write your silly book because you are going to play golf with legs in the morning and you say you cant work after lunch and the days will make themselves into months and the months into years here he dropped into poetry and you will ever be a name of scorn at least you would if ten minutes after you were dead anybody remembered what your name was but you will have gone to your account well i join issue with the old humbug over this for my part i assert that it was perfectly right for me to go to the gentlemen and players and to the opera and to plant bulbs and to play golf with legs to morrow morning if fine and as for his objection to what he calls rush why i fling it in his face since i must rush if i set apart a certain time every day for private meditation i should be simply bored i should get i suppose this must be the proposed practical effect of the plan no great and ennobling thoughts out of my solitary meditations and instead of feeling that i had spent the morning to some serious purpose i should feel and i think rightly that i had merely wasted it but if i have planted bulbs all morning i havent wasted it i will assert that on the day of judgment for i have been busy walking along the path i feel sure i was meant to walk on there are a thousand other paths all leading to the central and celestial light and they are for other people to walk on it would of course be a terrible waste of time for one who by nature was a meditative recluse to go to the match between the gentlemen and players or for a deaf man to go to tristan or for a blind one to lie on his back and look at the filtering sunlight between the leaves of beech trees in june but the point for everybody is to get into touch with life as continually as he can and at as many points as he can this is gospel i would i had the palate of a wine taster to get into touch with life there the prehensile toe and sense of balance of a tight rope walker to get into touch there the mathematical head of the astronomer to learn the orbit of a star that has never been seen but only conjectured or i wish very much indeed that i had the missionary spirit indeed then i would go to the nearest cannibal islands and probably a good thing too be cheerfully devoured or again if i had it in a lesser degree i would go and teach in the sunday school and have a class for boys in the evening i did try the sunday school when first i lived here and for four unhallowed sundays i passed a feverish hour surrounded by mystified infants and intolerable lithographs you never saw such a failure as i was i dreaded those hours so much that i thought my reason would be unhinged and the children used to regard me i am sure as they would have regarded some queer though harmless creature of the menagerie i couldnt do that sort of thing i neither made them happy nor could i teach them anything that latter was quite proved when on the sunday succeeding my fourth lesson an archdeacon came round and examined all the classes in turn i think i shall never get over the nightmare horror of that scrutiny when he sat in my arm chair at the desk and i the trembling instructor stood by the side while he asked my idiot flock who adam and eve and cain and abel ware and other really elementary things one child said that eve was gods wife and i wished the earth might open and swallow me up then he came to the catechism and it really seemed as if nobody knew his own name and it was for that nightmare that i had spent four feverish sunday afternoons and a parody of days between for every moment sunday was coming nearer no i give more happiness to legs by being soundly beaten by him at golf or by wasting so says the old humbug a morning in taking helen up to lords to see the gentlemen and players also i hasten to forestall criticism i like it much better myself and though you may if you like call it selfish i hereby state that to like doing anything is a very good and christian reason for doing it behold the gauntlet for we poor folk who really cannot teach in sunday schools and are not employed in making discoveries which will alleviate painful diseases and do not serve our constituency or our king and sneakingly throw pamphlets about the education bill into the fire without reading them because we know we dont actually care one pin what happens and are in every single respect quite unsatisfactory and useless and unornamental have yet somehow there can be no doubt of this to add if we can to the happiness anyhow of those dear folk among whom our lot has been so graciously cast we have no great gifts of any description we are neither wise nor witty and there has been only one talent given us which is the power of enjoyment well that is a very little one you may say and a very selfish one to cultivate but if we have nothing else at all had we not better try to make some use of that for the fact remains that it can be made some use of every one feels better for seeing one of these drones who are neither soldiers nor sailors nor politicians nor teachers enjoy himself enjoyment in the air is like oxygen in the air it quickens everybody and in its way makes them happier the poor drones can neither teach nor fight nor make anybody good but they can in their humdrum way make people a little more cheerful for a few minutes for they have this is what i mean by drones a happy temperament and as they are no good at all in any other direction it is indeed time that they should be done to death by the workers of the hive if they do not exert themselves in the mere exercise of their temperament and just as the drone of the hive lives immersed in the honey of his flowers and in the garnered stuff that the workers have brought home so the drone man must continue to take active and continual pleasure in all the delightful things of this world he must pounce on enjoyment with eager zeal and glut himself on it till he reels with the stupefaction of pleasure he must keep himself keen and alert for the smallest humorous or engrossing detail that is within his horizons it is shameful if he does not go to bed every night tired with his own laughter and enjoyment and woe to him if he invests his pleasures with the serious garb of duty the leader of the delectable life who says that he plays golf because he finds exercise so important for his health or who sits out all afternoon to watch other people playing other games and explains that his doctor his doctor forsooth tells him to have plenty of fresh air or who drinks his delicious wine and says that it is good for his digestion is a mere scampish hypocrite he plays games because they are such fun he watches other people play because it amuses him he drinks wine because it tastes so nice and he must never falter on his primrose path the high gods have given him but one little talent and all that is asked of him is that he should enjoy life enormously he has got to do that then the soldier and sailor may not perhaps enjoy life but they are useful in other ways the drone is only useful in this one he must never remit his efforts and must never want to he must rush as the old humbug said all the time for if he ceases to rush he ceases to justify his existence at all and a heavenly destiny one too beyond all desert of his he does if he is at all a conscientious drone make other people a shade more cheerfully disposed than they would otherwise have been this breathless dissertation on drones requires at this point as printers say paragraphing in other words i began to talk about one thing and without pause talked about another it was really the fault of the old humbug who said that i wasted those days in which i didnt do something for somebody i then justified my position on those days by pleading the desire to be a drone a life which as i have sketched it out seems to me to be wholly admirable i wish to heaven i could be in the least like those adorable people misbegotten industry stands in my way and a deep rooted but equally misbegotten idea that if i am very industrious i shall one day write a good story also i have not the drone temperament necessary for dronage i am not in fact any longer defending myself but extolling other people loafers there are in plenty in this world but personally i have no use for them they lead the same external lives as the lover of life leads but how different is the spirit that animates them the loafer may have been side by side with the life loving drone all day at the same parties at the same games at the same music but the one goes to all these things in order to get through the hours without boredom while the other wishes the hours infinitely multiplied so that he might go to more the one sucks enjoyment of but a stupefied sort from them the other catches the iridescent balls and bubbles of joy that are cast like sea spray over the tides of time only to throw out double of what he has received he is like some joyful juggler a stream of objects pours into the air from his flashing hands he catches them and hurls them into the air again so that the eye cannot follow the procession of flying joys and at the end at the close of each day he stands still for a moment his hands full of them his memory stored with them eager for the next day how different is the loafer have you ever seen the chameleon feed on flies it is just so that the loafer who wants only to get through the hours feeds on the simple silly joys of life in expression the chameleon is like a tired old gentleman with the face ache though the impression of face ache is chiefly produced by cheeks swollen in other ways for he rolls up his tongue in a ball in his mouth when he is going to feed then with an expression of bored senility he moves very cautiously to where a fly is sitting when he is within range he shoots out his tongue and the fly sticks to the adhesive tip of it there is a slight swallowing motion and the chameleon again rolls about his greasy eye looking for the next victim the loafer in a metaphysical sense has got just such an adhesive tongue as the chameleon he puts it out and pleasures stick to it like postage stamps then he swallows them observe too when he has to make occupations for himself how heavily and stupidly he passes the hours he will read the morning paper till midday then totter out into his garden sadly remove one weed from the path and totter back to the house to throw it in the fire then he will re read a page of his paper and write an unnecessary note with unnecessary care probably wiping his pen afterwards it will then be lunch time how different would the drones morning have been even if he had been compelled to spend it on the platform of clapham junction he would have constructed some dome in air out of that depressing suburb the flashing trains would have allured him especially the boat trains and his mind would have gone long journeys to the sunny south he would have built romance round the signals and found a fairy tale in the advertisements and what is the practical side of all this for is it not temperament which makes the magic of these wonderful persons and temperament is a thing which is supposed to be quite outside the power of its possessor to alter or amend broadly speaking i suppose that is true and we who do not possess the magic would bungle terribly if we attempted to rival the flashing hands of the true conjurer i do not suppose at any rate that it is worth while for the meditative recluse to spend his days and nights at festive gatherings since he will never enjoy them himself and what is more important he will in his small way eclipse the gaiety of those parties on which he sheds the gloom of his depressing countenance yet since i believe with my whole heart that joy and simple pleasure so long as they hurt nobody are things wholly and entirely good it behoves every one to look sedulously in the garden of his mind to see whether he cannot find there a few little seedlings of that species of temperament which i have tried to indicate his garden may be the most strenuous and improving plot a regular arboretum of high aspirations and earnest endeavours with the most beautiful gravel paths of cardinal virtues leading by the thickets and shrubberies of spiritual strivings but should he happen to find a few of these seedlings and be able to raise them they will not spoil the effect of the wholly admirable grove of moral purpose to be quite candid i think a little colour sets off as they say the grandeur of high endeavour it well it brightens it up november i remarked helen am the rose of sharon and the lily of the valley she laid great stress on the and which gave a perfectly new significance to the verse the french for lily of the valley is muguet said legs with an intolerably superior air oh dont show off said she the great thing in walking along a rail is to keep your balance through the looking glass said i upon which the white knight fell head foremost into a hole and kept on saying plenty of practice said legs its easier if you wave your arms said she oh theres a train coming wheres the gum legs had the gum a small penny bottle and helen hastily gummed a penny to the rail and we all retired to the side of the line if you merely lay a penny on the rail the chances are that the first wheel that goes over it causes it to jump and it falls off whereas if you gum it there was a wild maniac shriek from the engine suddenly dropping an octave as it passed us and the huge train towering high above us thundered by with rattle of wheels and the throbbing oscillation of very high speed a dozen bits of paper came trundling and dancing after it the rear of the van telescoped itself into a tiny square and the signal just above us which had been down to let the train pass shot up a warning right angled arm oh well over sixty said legs with deep appreciation and theres the penny sitting as tight as as i dont know lord how hot the penny had already been under half the wheels of four trains and was so flattened that it was of knife edge sharpness if you stropped it a little you could shave with it said helen what babies you are legs was already busy on the up line arranging two pins crossways on the gummed rail so that they should be flattened and welded together making an entrancing object closely resembling a pair of scissors the up train will be through in five minutes he said chuck me the penny helen i had another object of interest namely a threepenny piece with a hole in it i had tied a long string to this the far end of which i held in my hand the reason for this was that the coin was beginning to crack but it would stand a wheel or two more though it was already bigger than a sixpence after a wheel or two i could pull it away gum said i we moved to the far side of the up line and waited soon from the tunnel a hundred yards below came a wreath of smoke and the black fronted engine raced towards us everything went right on that divine afternoon and after four wheels had passed i jerked my threepenny piece away the scissors were adorable also and it would be scarcely necessary to strop the penny of course we made a cache of these objects burying them in a small tin box with the addition of a piece of paper recording our names weights and ages legs also wrote a short confession of how he murdered his two infant children and hid the bodies in a bramble bush ten paces from the cache there was no such bramble bush really which would make it more puzzling to the inquiring mind he represented himself as being perfectly impenitent and ready to commit similar crimes should opportunity occur he signed it benjamin yates of a park lane w then we went home to tea legs had been in for his foreign office examination and had come down to spend the next two days with us before we all moved up to town also to our deep felt and secret joy he had shown no desire to visit the ampses or talk any more german with charlotte the process of disillusionment began i think on the evening in october when he was here last and the ampses dined with us for i saw him overhear mrs amps ask helen who was the heir to all our beautiful property at that moment i almost pitied mrs amps she had begun by making jam but i felt that she had gone on to cook charlottes goose legs anyhow stopped in the middle of a sentence and took a couple of seconds to recover himself i am sure i dont wonder you require to recuperate after that sort of remark i felt that i knew all about mrs amps when she asked that simple question i felt as if i had known her parents and grandparents and could prophesy about her children and grandchildren and legs eyes which till that moment had been quite shut began to open just to blink next day however he lunched with them what happened i do not know since he has not told me but he was rather silent in the evening ate little but drank four glasses of port after dinner i think the instinct of the drowning of care was there and he was slightly cynical and byronic afterwards i love legs i hasten to add lest i may appear unfeeling that charlotte has for the last week or two been kind and encouraging to another young man who is the heir to far more beautiful property i saw him at the golf links yesterday in a bunker he was arranging her hands so as to grasp her niblick properly they seemed to want a great deal of arranging by and by they allowed my opponent and me to pass charlotte seemed not to recognize me or else she was really so much employed in making her hat stay on that she did not see me i mentioned however to legs that i had seen her but that she had not seen me it seemed to interest him very little but this morning as legs and i played golf over the grey back of the huge down that rises from our happy valley it seemed a sheer insanity that we should all go up to london the next day so blithe was the air so invigorating to the whole sense the short springy turf seemed to put its own vitality into ones feet they were shot forward automatically without conscious effort and ah the rapture it occurred more frequently to legs than to me of seeing a clean white ball scud for a hundred yards or so low over the ground and then rise swallow like against the ineffable blue golfers i am told reck nothing of their surroundings provided only they drive far approach dead and hole their puts and so i must conclude indeed i conclude it for other reasons that i am no golfer but i am an epicure in my surroundings when i go a golfing and though the grey dunes and sandy hollows of the seaside course are most to my mind i place very near those perfect joys the hugeness of scale which you get only on the uplands to day no whiff of vapour flecked the whole field of the shining heavens and the country grey and green with fire of autumn beech wood here and there stretched map like round us but to the west the view was even more stirring to that desire of the infinite which lies so close to the heart of man there fold after fold of downs the knitted muscles of the huge kind earth lay in unending interlacement and it was all empty there were no trees no lines of hedgerows to break the void and lend a scale to the eye from the immediate green foreground slope after slope melted into grey and from grey to the blue of distance which fused itself into the tender azure of the skys horizon so that the line between earth and air indistinguishable it was as empty us the desert yet one knew that from every inch of it a thousand lives rejoiced in the sun of november yes even the knowledge that there would be but few more of such hours before winter hurled its armoury of squalls on to the earth added perhaps to their joy none could have expected such a november as has been ours we have snatched it from winter it is our possession yet the colour of the grass no less than the underlying keenness of the air savour of the sunless months it is scarcely green it has been bleached by the torrid months and nature is too wise to let it shine forth in a fresh coat of colour when so soon it will sleep waiting for the spring high up in the liquid blue too of the sky there is the sparkle of frost for all the warm strength of the sunlight it is not summer that floats above our heads soon to descend earthwards but the frost and cold yet they bless the lord also but though i feel all this feel it in every bone and fibre of my body i know that i feel it more when i am doing something else as for instance playing golf i think it must be that one pleasure quickens others the fact of attempting to keep ones eye on the ball as one hits it makes the whole of ones perceptions more alert if i was taking a solitary walk here with no occupation except that of walking i know quite well that i should not be conscious of the same rapturous well being as i am now when the object of my walk is to hit a small piece of indiarubber for three or four miles hitting it too as seldom as possible so it is not the mere hitting it that gives rapture else the rapture would be increased by the frequency of the operation oh i have been talking on the stroke this will never do but it was my own stroke and hampshire flew about in fids in consequence this was at the twelfth hole and it made the match square legs i need hardly remark was playing a pitiful game for him but on the moment this is one of the inexplicable things about those foolish people who play games my whole mood changed i cared no more at all for the empty glorious downs i did not mind whether the grass was blue or grey or green or magenta i saw no more flaring beech woods no more mapped counties there was one desire only in the entire contents of my soul and that was to beat legs i did not feel as if i even wanted anything so much as that and if mephistopheles had appeared at that moment to bargain for my salvation as the price of my victory i should have signed in my blood or any other blood that was handy but mephistopheles was probably otherwise engaged at any rate after being still all square at the seventeenth i drove into a silly irrational bunker that ought never to have been there at the eighteenth i took three to get out but we had a heavenly morning if only well well and legs told helen that he only just won because he was completely off his game the tongue is an unruly member mine is had i won i should have certainly told helen that legs played a magnificent game and i had only just won that sounds more generous than his remark but if you think it over you will see that it comes to exactly the same thing yes it seems an insanity to leave the country just now especially since there is no earthly reason for our doing so divine things it is true are going on in town for our matchless isolde is conducting symphony concerts and a perfect constellation of evening stars are singing together at the opera but after all legs and i play the meistersinger overture arranged for four hands on the piano while for the rich soup of sloane street mud and the vapour ridden sky we have here the turf of the downland and the ineffable blue in fact i am sorry to go but should be rather disappointed if i was told that i was not going helen characterizes this state of mind as feeble which it undoubtedly is and says that she is perfectly willing either to go to morrow or to stop on another week if i will only make up my mind which i want to do but there is the whole difficulty i havent the slightest idea which i want to do you might as well say to a dog which is being called from opposite quarters by two beloved voices only make up your mind which of us you like best if it knew the question would be solved well the question was solved by tossing up and then of course doing the opposite to what we had decided the arbitrament of the coin should indicate if it was heads we were to stop in the country and since it was heads that helped us to decide that we would go to town that too may seem a feeble proceeding but i do not think it really is to do anything as irrational as tossing causes the mind to revolt from the absurdity of abiding by the result the consequence is that a weighty factor for doing what the coin did not indicate is supplied for you never toss unless you are quite unable to decide so for the last afternoon the garden claimed me for not only is the garden the symbol and embodiment of the country but to me it is a sort of diary almost since the manual acts of planting and tending have got so interwoven with that which made ones mind busy while the hands were thus occupied that the sight of this plant or that of a new trellis or the stacked sticks of the summers sweet peas are when one looks at them as now retrospectively on the eve of departure retranslated back as are the records of a phonograph into the memories that have been pricked and stamped into them all i see croquet hoops flower beds without ceasing to be themselves have all become a secret cipher by some mysterious alchemy something of oneself has passed into them secret fibres of soul stuff are woven into them through the touch of the hands that tended them something from the being of that which directed those hands has entered into their life so that next year it may be some regret belonging to an autumn day will flower in the daffodils of our planting hope i am sure will flower too and with how vivid a wave of memory do i know what silent resolve went into the cutting back of that gloire de dijon thus when in june its fragrance streams in the air one must trust that some fragrance not its own but of a fruit bearing effort will be spread about the garden there for instance are the croquet hoops still standing though it must be a month since we had played a few withered leaves of the plane have drifted against the wires and the worms have been busy on the neglected lawn that speaks only of november but that corner hoop has a significance beyond paint and wire it is the record of the telegram that came out to me one morning in late september which i showed legs after that we abandoned the game and went to the house it may have more for us yet that corner hoop more i mean than that memory of which i have spoken joy or sorrow may be so keen so poignant on some day yet hid behind the veil of the future when i shall be looking at it that till the day of my death it will never again be seen by my mortal eye without rousing an immortal and imperishable memory it is thus in a manner antimaterialistic so to speak that men material things are woven into the psychical web of life so that almost before the eye has seen them they have sent the message of their secret significance to the brain everywhere wherever i look the tangle of these subtle threads is spread even as on summer dawns the myriad spinning of gossamer makes network on the grass so that each is crossed and intertwined with a woof of others there is the bank where i lay all one hot july day doing nothing thinking nothing just lapped in the tide of living things that has gone home that bank and the hours i passed there are part of me now even as i feel that i am part of it and i have but to look at it now to bask again in the absorbing stupor of the midsummer there in its blades of grass and shadowed turf is written my doing for the day the bank holds it in kind safe keeping so that when god inquires of me what i have done with that day that he gave me the bank will be able to answer for me nor does it tell my secret to the croquet hoop that holds another nor to the clematis that on that day was a heaven full of purple stars spread over the trellis there was nothing in all the treasure of the summer so beautiful so triumphant as that but what to me now is the memory of the clematis the memory of a friendship that is over at least i was looking at it when i know that somebody i had loved and trusted was neither trustworthy nor lovable it was as if a friend had pushed back the carpet from the boards of the room where he and i had so often been merry and intimate together and showed me with a sort of secret hideous glee that a sewer flowed beneath the floor poor clematis it is sick at heart its thin bare stalk shivers mournfully as this golden afternoon begins to turn a little grey with the chill wind of evening ah if only he had said he was sorry if only he had said that he knew it was wrong but that the flesh was weak if only he had even contemplated the step which to some extent undoes the wrong that has been done i do not think the clematis would have shed a single one of its purple stars all of us saints or sinners do dreadful things the memory of which is sufficient to make us long to sink into the earth for shame but he only smiled behind his hand and with whispered gusto told me about it licking the chops of memory it is that which matters that corner of the garden had delayed me long and it was already getting dark when i had gathered up and fingered the gossamer threads that lay so thickly down the border that led to the gate from which descend the steps of the rose garden there were so many messages there the bare stalks of phloxes and campanulas oriental poppies and hollyhocks japanese anemone and iris all had something to say some memories were a little vague faint and dim even as the odour of the phloxes some were tall and resplendent like the hollyhocks some were vivid as the poppies and then i went through the gate of the rose garden and stood there there was nothing there but the rose trees there was no one there but helen so the tale of the garden was told and by the time it was finished dusk had begun to deepen and cheerful beckoning lights were gleaming from the house it was time to go in to take up and with what love and alacrity the pleasant hour of the present again for it is not ever good to linger too long over memories or for however short a time to indulge in regrets unless those regrets are to be built into the fabric of the present making it stronger and more courageous all other regrets all other regarding of the past which says it is past it is irretrievably done is enervating and poisonous and but paralyzes our energies indeed it is better not to be sorry at all for the unwise unkind and mistaken things we have done if our sorrow tends to unfit us for doing better in the future but just as i crossed the lawn going towards the house another memory started up out of the dusk so clearly that i almost thought that i heard my name called from the garden and almost expected when i got indoors to hear again the sound of shuffling unshod feet on the stairs the memory of that mysterious midnight hour though i have not spoken of it again is seldom out of my thoughts it does not sit so to speak in the front row but in the dimness that lies at the back of ones mind out of which come those vague vapours which are if they have body enough eventually condensed into thought just as out of thought is coined speech and action there in that dark kitchen of the mind i know that the thought of that night has ever been simmering on the fire something within me is not content with the fact that even at the moment that the voice cried from the garden at the moment when legs saw the white face smiling at him that dear soul passed to the other side there is more to come yet else here is the vapour taking the shape of thought at last else why did legs who scarcely knew her receive that warning no echo of any memory of that night strangely also has ever come back to him he knows no more about it now than he did the next morning when he asked me if i had been sitting up late talking i have told helen all about it i have told her too for there is nothing so wild and fantastical that i would not tell it her that there is some uneasy guest sitting at my hearth who stays in the shadow so that i cannot see his face and she answered with a serenity that was almost reassuring saying that if something more was coming there was still whatever it was nothing to fear if otherwise the uneasy guest was moonshine of the imagination that seems to cover the whole ground but the fact is that i am afraid of my fear a thing for which it is idle to try to find excuses we are leaving quite early to morrow morning so when i entered the house that evening after the tour of the garden i had definitely finished with the country for some weeks to come so too had helen and legs for tea had already gone into the drawing room and even as i locked the garden door behind me i heard a sudden gust of wind come and shake the panes as if this calm golden day had been sent just for us and that the moment we had finished with it the winds overdue but kindly waiting for us began to drive their cloud flocks out of the south west nor was the coming of the rain long delayed even while we sat at tea a sheet of it was flung with a sudden wild tattoo against the panes and there hissed on to the logs of the open hearth a few stray drops legs paused with his mouth full of crumpet it makes me feel twice as comfortable as i was before he said it must be so beastly out of doors legs had just uttered this thoroughly lucretian sentiment when the door opened and mr holmes was announced i have refrained from mentioning mr holmes before because i expected he would come in about now big with purpose he is a kind little gentleman about forty five years old who lives with his sister and does not do anything whatever he is generally known as the bun hander because no tea party has ever been known to take place for miles round at which mr holmes was not handing refreshments to the ladies that is his strength his forte his weakness is just as amiable though perhaps hardly so useful for his weakness is rank he constantly comes to see helen about once a fortnight that is to say for in the autumn he is very busy going to tea parties for the reason so legs and i believe that she is the daughter of the younger son of a peer helen will have none of this and maintains that he comes to see her for herself personally i can behave beautifully when mr holmes finds helen and me alone but i am rather nervous if legs happens to be in the room for he is quite unable to take his eyes off mr holmes but stares at him in a sort of stupor of wonderment once that is a year ago now he left the room very suddenly choking and muffled sounds were heard from the hall and the stamping of feet helen and i talked very loud to overscore this and i trust mr holmes did not hear but when legs is there i am afraid it is a sort of nightmare that i shall be overtaken too with helpless giggling if i begin helen will go off and i can imagine no way of satisfactorily terminating the interview because if once i began laughing at mr holmes i do not see how i could ever stop his appearance his voice his conversation are all quite inimitable he is small and inclined to stoutness and has a fierce little moustache so much on end that it looks as if it had just seen a ghost not long ago he had no teeth to speak of now they are as dazzling and continuous as mr wordsworth said as the stars that shine he has rather thin brown hair which i will swear used to be streaked with grey but is so no longer and he wears three rings with stones in them one is an emerald so magnificent that it is almost impossible to believe in it he is dressed in the very height and zenith of provincial fashion and would no more be seen in shabby clothes than he would be seen without stays yes i maintain it and even helen who was a perfect st thomas about it for long has admitted that occasional creaks proceed from mr holmess person for which it is difficult to offer any other explanation it was a creak in fact more than usually loud that made legs leave the room on the occasion i have referred to down his trousers he has the most beautiful creases and all his clothes nearly fit perfectly he wears brown boots with cloth tops above which when he sits down you can see socks with clocks on them stranglingly suspended in the winter he wears a hat with a furrow in it and in the summer a panama he wears a knitted tie just now it is rather the fashion here for young men to have ties knitted for them by their friends which helen says is certainly machine made with a pin in it his shirt always has some stripe or colour in it and his links are invariably the same colour as the stripe to day the links were turquoise and the stripe light blue and from top to toe it is all a little wrong though since i do not know how clothes are made i cannot tell you what is wrong the effect however is that though so carefully arrayed mr holmes looks like a rather elderly shop assistant going out on sunday afternoon mr holmes goes out much oftener than that for he may be seen in the window of the club every morning from about half past eleven till one i have often seen him sitting in the window there looking at illustrated papers and smoking a cork tipped cigarette ladies size then he goes home to lunch and after lunch either drives with his sister in a hired fly or else if it is very fine goes round the ladies golf links which are a good deal shorter than the mens he has tea at the club and sits there till dinner then after a blameless day he goes home to dine and sleep i suppose no one in the world has ever done less of any description i have alluded to his weakness rank he has another which is gossip he knows who was dining at the ampses last wednesday and who lunched with the archdeacon on sunday and how the bishops wife is it is he for whom also the fashionable intelligence is written in the daily papers and though he never goes there he knows who is in town and who lunched at princes last sunday or walked in the park and how the marquis of god knows what is after his operation he always refers to a marquis as a marquis to an earl as an earl but best of all perhaps he loves infinitesimal intrigue especially if it concerns rank and here my portentous secret must burst from me for the fact is that for the last three days the town has been convulsed and i have been holding it all back assuming an unnatural calm so that it might all come in a deluge for three days ago a duchess came here to open a window or shut a door in the town hall which had been put up in memory of something and was entertained to luncheon afterwards by the corporation and on this eye opening occasion helen was sent in before the wife of the younger son of a baronet and in consequence the wife of the younger son of the baronet cut her afterwards as with a knife yet knife was no word for it the averted eye was more like a scimitar before the assembled company when helen went to shake hands with her after lunch she cut her and she turned from her revolving on her own axis like the eternal stars upon which very properly after two days heated discussion and a great demand for debrett public opinion sided with the wife of the younger son of the baronet on the ground that helen took her husbands rank which in this case happened to be none at all what made it worse was that the duchess who should have known better being an old friend of helens came to tea with her afterwards in a motor car covered with coronets for all the world to see you may imagine that the fat was in the fire after that helen had no idea why the wife of the baronets younger son had cut her and perhaps might never have known had not mr holmes dropped in only yesterday and told her adding that he was sure he could clear it up i was not at home when this interview took place but when he entered the room this afternoon after having called only yesterday it was certain that he must have come on this subject he had a book in his pocket which made an unusual bulge legs was steeped in wide eyed contemplation as mr holmes had his tea from time to time i glanced at him and saw that the corners of his mouth were faintly twitching his eye travelled from mr holmess face to his jewelled hands it lingered about his clothes but came back loverlike to his face in a few minutes we had learned about everybody how the lord lieutenant of the county had driven through in his motor not the daimler but a new panhard yesterday afternoon stopping only at the fishmongers and taking the london road afterwards how there had been a party at the barracks last night at which there was music but not very good music mr holmes was afraid how the bishop had not influenza at all but only a bad cold how the pines had been taken by the hon alice accrington who had a cork foot so sad a rhinoceros had trodden on the original one i had ceased to be able to look at legs but here i heard him give a little whimper as a dog does when it wants a door to be opened for it helen all the time had been of impeccable behaviour she had asked just the right questions and appeared so genuinely interested that i felt i had never known before of what depth of hypocrisy she was capable then mr holmess wealth of information began to grow thin even as the stars burn thin at daybreak and i knew that he was going to dawn and that the true reason for which he came was going to break forth he put down his cup on the tea table took a cigarette and suddenly creaked if you can imagine a sneeze a cough a spit the strangled wheeze caused by a fish bone in the throat and the noise an empty siphon of soda water makes when you press the handle all combined you will faintly grasp what legs did his effort to swallow the whole of this mixed convulsion was most praiseworthy though i should think dangerous and it came to my ears only as if someone had done it half a mile away mr holmes i am sure heard nothing this time and legs left the room with his handkerchief to his mouth in the manner of mourners in the second coach at a funeral there was no sound outside but soon after a muffled tread overhead where is his bedroom then for a moment i caught helens eye she looked so inexpressibly grave that i nearly asked her who was dead then dawn came mr holmes has a high cackling voice and the bulgy volume in his pocket was whitakers almanack i should have come before he said but i wanted to come to you last and really the afternoon has flown about tuesday now dear lady you only took your right place there is no question about it i have been to the mayor i have been to the archdeacon look he found a page in whitaker and gave helen the volume it was a table of precedence i saw eldest sons of younger sons of peers underlined look at the next column he said the sister takes the rank of her husband or her elder brother now see where younger sons of baronets and their wives come far away below eldest sons of younger sons of peers in an outer darkness below even members of the fifth class of the victorian order i saw that obscure relationship my emotions of various kinds almost suffocated me helen was justified before all the world it was her turn to cut the wife of the younger son of the baronet if she chose so we talked very pleasantly for a quarter of an hour about the movements of the aristocracy and then mr holmes rose to go his cab was waiting and i helped him on with a very magnificent fur coat in the hall which in the somewhat indistinct light seemed to be made of the purest rabbit skin in the dimness of the landing above i thought i could see an obscure shadow leaning over the banisters which resembled legs i hope after this your wife will take her proper place said mr holmes of course everyone knows the duchess came here to tea he lit a cigarette and i heard the banister tremble slightly as if from an infinitesimal earthquake it is so kind of you to have taken so much trouble said i firmly it was nothing i am sure you need have no further anxiety i went back to the drawing room helens face was buried in a sofa cushion and legs came downstairs in three jumps so we laughed till it was time to dress for dinner occasionally we seemed to be recovering but then somebody said creak or baronet and a fresh relapse took place i pity all poor souls who do not know mr holmes it is so sad for them sadder than the lady with the cork foot oh think of it this triumphant vindication of helen which is all wrong by the way will last him a long long time it has been a campaign triumphantly concluded and i should not in the least wonder if he has half a bottle of champagne to night and after a time the excitement will die away fading like a golden sunset and he will settle down to his ordinary life again and read the paper in the morning and go for a little drive in the afternoon and have tea and toast at the club afterwards and in the spring the panama hat will come out and the rich fur coat be put away and he will hand strawberries instead of buns and iced coffee instead of tea and perhaps play a little croquet but this week has been a great week for him it really has if you want to understand the gloriousness of mr holmes you must take my word for it that nothing so engrossing has happened to him for months december this once happy family has suddenly returned to the pit whence it was digged and it is impossible to imagine any more depressing spectacle than we present dawn in faint flickers is beginning to shine on the wreck and occasionally for a moment or two though we may be over sanguine helen and i can dimly imagine being happy again legs cannot do that yet it is still midnight gloom with him the intelligent reader will scarcely need to be told that it is the influenza that has blackened the world like this helen began and legs and i followed within twenty four hours that somehow is a relief to her since she feels she did not give it us as if it mattered where it came from besides personally i would rather catch it from her than anyone else legs has had the worst visitation because after it was quite certain he had got it he persisted in attending the last night of the autumn opera season did not enjoy it at all of course by reason of a splitting headache and was really ill for a day or two i was infinitely wiser as soon as the nymph touched me with her fairy hand i went firmly to bed turned my face to the wall like hezekiah and stopped there till the fever was over after five days i tottered downstairs to find an old old woman sitting by the fire it was helen i think that was the most dreadful day i ever remember she told me again and again how ill i looked until i was goaded into a sort of depressed frenzy and said i couldnt possibly look as ill as she we both had beef tea in the middle of the morning and to my horror when it was brought it was brought not by raikes my man who is as indispensable to this house as is the carburetter to a motor car for it wont run without but by an awful thing that i never saw before in answer to an inquiry i was told that raikes felt very ill and had asked the awful thing to bring us our beef tea instead of him so i sent her back to raikes with a thermometer that he was to be so good as to put under his tongue for one minute and then return it came back recording degrees i gave the awful thing the thermometer to wash and she instantly dropped it on the floor it was of course broken into twenty million fragments but i remembered that though i was a worm i was a christian worm and said never mind please tell raikes that he is to go to bed instantly i then picked up the twenty million fragments and cut myself severely i said damn quite softly helen winced which was merely intended to annoy me and it succeeded admirably so there we sat exactly like that awful picture called les frileux in which an old man and an old woman sit apart under a leafless tree the ground is covered with the dead leaves soon they will die too it is impossible to depict the dreariness of that morning outside a sort of jaundiced day showed the soupy mud that flooded sloane street through which motor buses which once i thought so fine splashed their way a few sordid people under umbrellas bobbed by the windows and as the darkness increased a man with a long stick began to turn up the lamps then it instantly got rather lighter and another man not the same one with another long stick came and turned them down again upon which egyptian darkness settled down over the town and i must suppose that the first man had caught the influenza for he never turned them up any more helen was not reading she was sitting by the fire looking mournfully at the coals this would not do at all and in the intervals of a paroxysm of coughing i asked how is legs this morning worse said helen i took up the daily telegraph and read the list of the people who were dead i knew one of them slightly then my cut finger began to bleed again which reminded me of the awful thing servants are so ridiculous and tiresome i said i should think your maid might have found time to bring up our beef tea instead of that dreadful girl i dont know where you get your servants from barton went to bed yesterday with influenza said helen wheezily she is very feverish worse than legs i cant say why but this news made me feel rather better so i lit a cigarette it tasted exactly as if it had been made of the green weed which grows on stagnant horse ponds i felt much worse again at once and was quite sure my temperature was going up but i could not have the mournful satisfaction of knowing that this was true because the thermometer was broken and my finger continued to bleed the blood was very bright red probably arterial yet whatever was happening it seemed impossible that things were as desperate as i thought them and i made the excellent determination to do something will it disturb you if i play the piano i asked helen not the least i attempted to play the etudes symphoniques beginning with the last variation by reason of the sky scraping spirits of it i dont think i played any correct notes at all and helen again to annoy me made the noise which tiresome people make to show that a wrong note gets on their highly sensitive nerves it consists of a whistling intake of the breath though i had only played a dozen bars the white notes in the treble were spotted with blood as if i was a jew and the piano was the lintel of the door on passover night it was absurd to go on playing on a blood boltered piano even if i could play the right notes which i could not so again with the laudable idea of doing something i staggered upstairs brought down a moistened towel and proceeded to clean the keys i struck notes from time to time and helen kept on wincing is that necessary she asked at length yes because i have bled over the piano besides im cleaning it with the soft pedal down the door was flung open and the awful thing appeared dinner she said and left the door open we went downstairs dinner in raikes indisposition was huddled on to the table there were pieces of moist fish under one cover there was a ginger pudding under another there were large potatoes under a third and under the fourth a rich and red beef steak then despair descended on me is the cook ill too i asked of the awful thing yes sir who cooked this or rather didnt please sir i did then quite suddenly both for helen and me dawn began to break for a little here was three quarters of the establishment incapacitated and the awful thing was calmly doing everybodys work as well as her own which was that of a housemaid helen cheered up at once please give me some fish she said to me it looks quite excellent i helped her largely and sumptuously we both understood each other at this moment and i put a thumping helping on to my own plate helen greatly daring took a greedy mouthful and spoke to the awful thing who was beginning to beam largely on us delicious she said to her i had no idea you could cook so beautifully you neednt wait we will ring and you must have help in at once will you telephone to mrs watkins agency asking for a she paused and i know she was going to say cook a housemaid the awful thing smiled from ear to ear and a moment afterwards we heard the insane ringing of the telephone oh i couldnt send for a cook just this moment said helen when the girl had left the room she was bursting with pride at having cooked this but if i eat it i shall be sick what are we to do the girl in her enthusiasm had built the fire three quarters of the way up the chimney though the day was muggy and warm beyond all telling into the heart of the blaze we stuffed large pieces of fish which burned with a blue and oily flame now ring said helen the girl returned after a long pause please m mrs watkins hasnt a housemaid to send by reason of so much illness but she can send a cook she said and her face fell its such a pity when you can cook so well said helen but we must have somebody you cant do all the work a char and i could manage m she said changing the plates with an awful clatter oh not with mr legs ill said helen we shall have you knocked up next and where should we be then the radiant smile returned to the girls face give me some steak jack said helen and a potato how delicious it smells the awful thing again left the room leaving as it were the fragrance of her smile behind her we made no attempt to eat any of the second course but put two large slices of steak two potatoes and a big spoonful of perspiring cauliflower into the fire pieces of ginger pudding followed it to the burning ghaut and soon the door again opened and coffee was brought in this was an after thought i fancy though ill inspired and gritty but there was a coal scuttle i am afraid we both relapsed again after lunch though for a time the shining example of the housemaid who had done the work of everybody else inspired us to attempt to play piquet bezique and the piano but these were all hopeless it did not seem worth while dealing and in point of fact the attempt at a duet came to a conclusion at the end of the first page for helen only groaned and said i cant turn over but that i am thankful to say was our low water mark sunshine began to shine more strongly on the wreck when legs two days afterwards came downstairs with the cheering remark that he felt so ill that he was sure he couldnt be as ill as he felt soon after he burst into hoarse laughter i shall cheer up when i have counted ten he remarked well on the whole when it was put simply and firmly like that it seemed the best thing to do legs took change of the cheering process and ordered a basin soap and three churchwarden pipes and we blew soap bubbles which though it may not be in itself a work of high endeavour had at least the result of making us do something which is always a good thing so when that was over in order to contribute to the wholesome atmosphere of employment i brought in and read to him and helen what i had written that morning and had designed to appear in the book you i are now reading it was i will not deceive you a string a long one of cheap and gloomy reflections on the mutability of life the reality of suffering and the certainty of death i had taken some trouble with it but the most poignant and searing sentences made legs simply roll in his chair with laughter that was noiseless merely because his throat was in such a state of relaxation that it could not make sounds but with eyes streaming and in a strangled whisper he said oh do stop a moment till i dont hurt so much with laughing and then read it again i looked at helen she had a handkerchief to her face and her shoulders shook with incontrollable laughter its much the funniest thing you ever wrote she said isnt it now begin again at all the pain and sorrow with which we are surrounded oh no before that something about it is when we are racked with suffering ourselves oh legs isnt it heavenly legs had recovered himself a little but still drummed with his feet on the carpet i never knew i could feel so much better so quickly he said i felt a mere worm when i proposed soap bubbles i want it all again from the beginning where what you thought was sunlight was barred with strange shadows o lor so i gave them this intellectual or should i say spiritual treat once more and then threw the manuscript into the fire amid the shrill expostulations of the others legs made heroic attempts to save it but fruitlessly or indeed i would print it here as a warning to those who do not feel very well to postpone their meditations upon life and death until they feel a little better also i do not think that ones reflections on any subject are likely to be of much value unless they are founded on some sort of experience and to be quite honest i had founded my views that morning on the mutability of life and the anguish of the world on the depression which was the result of a feverish cold they were depressing enough but i do not think that they were of sufficiently solid foundations they proved it is true extraordinarily cheering to helen and legs but one cannot be certain that the rest of the world would be equally exhilarated they might be taken seriously though helen says i need not have been afraid of that every man even a pessimist is supposed to have a perfect right to form his own opinions but if i had my way there is not the least likelihood of it i should establish a censorship of the press which should be in the hands of six young and cheerful optimists who should decide whether such opinions were fit for publication quite rightly literature of an indecent nature and work which may be supposed to have a tendency encouraging to criminals is not allowed to be disseminated i should put a similar prohibition on the dissemination of discouraging books books which might be expected to suggest or foster the opinion that the world is a poor sort of place and that god isnt in his heaven at all even if this was proved to be true i would count it criminal to attempt to convince anybody of it it would be a murderous assault on the happiness of private individuals the law does not allow one to poison a mans bread with impunity so how much more stringently should it forbid the poisoning of the inward health of his soul nothing but harm ever came from the dissemination of depressing truths nothing but good from the dissemination of innocent and joyful beliefs even should it be proved that they had no foundation whatever for if the world is a dreary and painful place so much more need is there of courage and a high heart to render it the least tolerable and if we are to be snuffed out like candles when we come to the end of our few and evil years how much more is it the part of wisdom to snatch a little happiness out of the circumambient annihilation and to think that only this morning i had actually tried to commit this crime and was only saved from it by legs unutterable laughter to be truthful i felt a little offended when he first began to laugh and inwardly hoped that he would soon grow depressed and thoughtful as i continued to tell my rosary of discouraging things but i need not have indulged that hope it was forlorn from the beginning instead it made both him and helen feel much better i am so content to leave it at that i had hoped i had indeed when i wrote those depressing pages which i wish to heaven i had not burned that possible readers might see part of the serious side of things under the discouragement of my winged words but now two days later i am far more content that those two darlings should have laughed at what was written with such seriousness than that all those into whose hands the printed record of that manuscript might have fallen should have sighed once over my jaundiced views about life and death and sickness and mutability of course death is an extremely solemn affair but it seems to me now we are all recovering fast and are drinking hypophosphates and beginning to be greedy again that the solemnity of it ought to have been discounted long ago if it is going to be solemn at all everyone of course is at liberty to take life solemnly from the time he begins to think at all but whatever our attitude towards life is the same ought to be our attitude towards death whether we believe that there is a continuance of life afterwards or whether we are so unfortunate as to believe that there is the quenched candle for in the one case death is but the opening of a door into a fuller light a thing it is true that may affect one for the moment since from the weakness of the flesh we cling to what we know while in the other death is just extinction a consummation which no pessimist should fear since while he lived he had held so poor an opinion of life so whether we regard life as a pleasant interlude in something else or whether we regard death a thing unthinkable to me as the extinction of consciousness i cannot believe that he is not a guest who is welcome when he comes personally i do not want him to come for a long time since i am delighted with the world and it would be most annoying to die now when one is just recovering from influenza and hopes to go to the richter concert to morrow but whatever ones belief about the future is i cannot see that there is an essential horror about death i can conjure up horror of some kind about going to the dentist about looking up trains in a bradshaw since the print is so execrable and the connections so unruly but i go my journey or i go to the dentist and get to my destination or am relieved of a troublesome tooth life does not seem to me the least troublesome it is true but let us take it that by death i get to my destination or in any case get nearer it besides how frightfully interesting i did not die but went to the richter concert instead legs wished to go too but that was clearly idiotic and so helen and i tossed up as to which of us should go and which remain at home i won and went there was isolde in his high chair probably an intelligent critic will say that isolde was a woman and i mean tristan but i dont he waved a little wand and the spirit of the meistersingers filled the hall it was not so it struck me a remembrance only of their harmonious joviality a mere picture of them it was they who rollicked and made processions in the great thumping triads of their march there they sat each with his business town clerk and vintner burgomaster and lawyer and best of all the old tender hearted shoemaker on whose kindly face upturned to the sky one feather of the bird of love had fallen though it had never come and nestled in his bosom but it was not with bitterness that so great a loss had filled him it had but refined him to a mellow kindliness that made all young things love him there they all sat so the band told me over their songs and their sober carousing till the others went home and sachs was left alone with music yet unsung echoing in his kind old head and throbbing in his youthful heart but he knew that such divine melody was not to be realized by him some master of music had yet to come and put into notes and audible harmony that which existed but in the temple of his dreams in the garden of things a man may conceive but may not realize then came there the gracious young knight and sachs heard that of which he had dreamed the song taught by the birds and the choirs of nature to the ardent heart of youth the triumph took wings and soared lifting sachs with it him and his yearnings and that fine old music too which was his inextricably mingled they were knit one into each other soaring into the sunrise thereafter we were taken to the bleak mountain where should gather the maidens of storm who did the will of wotan it was high and exposed above the region of the trees and shrill blew the winds over it and the heavens streamed above it fast and thick rode the army of menacing clouds for the tempest in which the valkyries rejoice riding their untamed steeds down the swift roadway of the winds was broken out in mad fury yelling and screaming it drove in mad circles of wrath round the place where the nine maidens should foregather that evening each with the fruit of her days quest slung across her saddle each with a hero who should drink that night of the wine of the gods which should pour into his veins the fire of eternal life in place of the faint mortal blood that had beaten there before yet it was not love the maidens sought it was danger and death and heroic enterprise that bore them so swiftly on their errands and lit in them a fire brighter than love has ever kindled their wine was the buffet of the tempest their meat the strong winds of god then there was heard faint at first the beating of the immortal hoofs in the rush of flying steeds from east and west there shone out remote fires in the bedlam of the clouds increasing getting nearer and more blinding till through the darkness of the tempest could be seen the figures of the maidens gathering to their trysting place some at the gallop some flying and all drunk with adventure and swift deeds each that day had prospered each had a hero at her saddle swooning now in death but soon to be restored to the fuller life so gathered they but as yet one was still missing brnnhilde the swiftest and best of them all the dearest to the heart of wotan for indeed she was none other than his heart and his inviolable will and while yet the others wondered at her tarrying she came but no hero had she she but led a woman into the midst of her sisters for pity had touched her fierce heart with so keen and intimate a pang that she had disobeyed the behest of wotan and saved her of the race which he had doomed to destruction the sorrow and the pain of the world had entered into her henceforth no more there would be for her the starry splendour of valhalla throned on the thunder and rosy with the light of eternal dawn soon for this her deed should another light shine on tower and palace wall the light of the flames that consumed it tempest and love and sorrow and the doom of the immortal gods all made audible in the eternal kingdom of the air how is it that when once one has heard a miracle like this one can ever so far forget it as to go back to the meanness of little miry ways there are so many big things in the world and though one knows that and has according to ones scale seen and understood their size yet we can still be so gross of perception that one can sit down blear eyed of vision to write two penny halfpenny reflections about sorrow and mutability and be rather pleased with them too until legs and helen laughed themselves all out of shape how large a place too in that which makes for size and the breeziness of living does art in some form or other occupy for most of us music and painting literature and drama are great doors flung wide to admit one to the sunshine of god often even to the spiritually minded the avenues of prayer and directer communion seem somehow blocked to others the majority they are never wholly open but to any who have an appreciation at all of what is beautiful it must be a dark hour indeed when that approach is altogether shrouded and black when neither angelo nor velasquez nor shelley nor wagner has a candle to give one to light the way millions of beautiful minds have their approach here to millions all idea of a personal god to be approached directly seems inconceivable but it seems to me to be one of the perfectly certain things in this very uncertain world that the passionate worship of beauty in whatever sort manifested is no less a direct invocation than prayer and the bent knee the study and the love for whatsoever things are lovely is as royal a road perhaps as the other for the passion for what is beautiful is no less than the passion for the only beautiful and by such as feel that all that is filthy is as unerringly condemned as it is by those who call filthy by another name sinful for the perception of anything beautiful has to the perceiver a force of purging while to the gross sense it is a sealed thing o world as god has made it all is beauty and knowing this is love and love is duty what further can be sought for or declared and to that i say amen the kennel as that same magician of words said is a yelp at this artists of whatever sort are supposed to be loose of life where that extraordinary delusion arose i have no idea unless it had its origin in some superficial observer of the manners and ways in the latin quarter of paris that things not technically parochial may have occurred there who would deny but for my part i think it just as un christian to nag and to vex and to be unkind as to be anything else under the sun in fact to put it broadly i would as soon be a drunken and kind man as be a sour and total abstainer sour and total abstainers will turn on me their eyes of smiling pity and horror but perhaps it is only a matter of taste but to be nice to people seems so immensely important you may lecture on the lamentations of jeremiah for hours together with a battery of historical facts to help you and yet do no particular good but if you help a lame dog canine or human over a stile you have been a far better christian i dare say that word offends some people so i will cancel it and say that you have been of far greater service in a world that has fortuitously come into being and will as fortuitously go out of being whatever may be the truth about things seen and unseen happiness is quite certainly better than misery and laughter is better than the most edifying tears the finger of the gloomy moralist is pointed at me i knew it was going to be pointed and in a sepulchral voice he says what about death the fact is that i dont know nor does he and it is not my affair while i am alive i prefer to drink deep of the joy of life than to speculate about what may come next i can conjure up my death bed as often as i choose and make it a scene of moving pathos and dim vexed doubts there is nothing so easy i can without the slightest effort advance really profound problems as to what it all means since there is nothing so easy as asking unanswerable questions what of the death of the wasp which i killed gleefully last august with a tennis racquet i havent the slightest idea all i know is that if next august another ventures to buzz round my head when i am having tea on the lawn after a perspiring set i shall if possible kill it again if only the gloomy moralist could give me a reasonable theory to show why i could not exterminate wasps i would accept it but he cant he only says it puzzles him it puzzles me too but in the interval i kill the wasp the fact is degrading though it may sound that i do not really believe that we are any of us capable of understanding the mind of the infinite god philosophers try to explain little bits of it and in their explanation of the little bit of it bang their heads together like children playing hide and seek in the dark hinc ill lacrim the poor children have terrible headaches i am extremely sorry but it is after all their fault instead of playing hide and seek in the dark they should go out and play in the light then no heads would be hit together it is quite maddening to think of the energy expended over this hide and seek when all the time the garden of the worlds beauty is ready waiting outside the door if you have the instincts of a beast perhaps it is better to grope in the dark but if you have the rudiments of any other condition go and play all the beauty that the world holds is at your command all that really matters in this world is to be enjoyed very cheaply most things worth reading can be bought for a shilling or two and if that is not handy look at a tree instead and absorb the life that shines in each growing twig of it or if you are musically minded hear as i have just heard the glories of the maidens of the storm of course no one thing is the least more wonderful than any other all that happens if we look at it at all closely is a marvellous conjuring trick why dont ducks come out of hens eggs is it not marvellous that chickens invariably issue if you go a step farther back and learn something about the continuance of type it becomes even more wonderful how can be told us but never why and so i am confident in the unanswerableness of my riddle why do sounds like those of the violin and the brass in the ride of the valkyries convey the essence of storm and tempest another conjuring trick of the most delightful kind occurred next morning at twelve oclock last night the streets of london had without asking thereby reversing the sad tale of oliver twist been given a second helping of brown porridge it was ankle deep on the roadway of sloane street thick brown porridge of mud then during the night the temperature went down and it froze the result is that for the copious soup we are given a clean dry roadway there is no mud of any kind not even frozen mud the street is clear and dry as if oliver twist had licked it but where has gone that two inches of obfusc lather has the wood pavement drunk it in has it gone into the air has some celestial housemaid like the awful thing been set to sweep the streets even as she has swept the sky and given us the invigoration of frost in exchange for the wet blanket of chilly cloud coming back from richter last night the streets were swimming eight hours later or it may be nine one might walk barefoot across the road or spread ones dinner there and get no taint how it will be sparkling on the grasses and brave evergreens at home turned to diamond spray by the red sun of frosty mornings o world as god has made it how often involuntarily as if coming from without that line rings in my head and how very little we with all our jealousies and depressions and bickerings and follies are able to spoil or dim the beauty that is cast so broadly there puny as are our efforts for good it really seems to me that our attempts at being evil are even more impotent and microscopic we are often as tiresome and unpleasant as we know how to be yet all the time we are swimming against that huge quiet tide of the beauty of the world as god made it the knowledge of which is love and beyond which there is no further declaration possible sometimes if we are very active indeed and exert ourselves very much we can stand still or even move a little way in opposition to the great tide but soon our efforts must relax and we are swept down again with the current that eternally flows from the heart of the infinite and returns there again in those pulsations that are the life and the light of the world it is impossible indeed unless we say that evil is the vital principle of the world to think otherwise war there is between the two huge forces but it is just satanism and nothing else whatever that makes people say that the world is going from bad to worse if you are so unfortunate as to be a satanist there is nothing more to be said and i hope the devil will give you your due but if otherwise there can be no other conclusion than that good all that is lovely and fine is steadily gaining ground for it does not seem reasonable to suppose that god contemplates some swift heady manuvre which shall suddenly take evil in the rear and in a moment rout the antagonism at any rate as far as we can possibly judge it is by quiet processes that he deals with the sum of the world even as he deals with the units that make it for just as nobody has any right to expect that the evil in his nature will be suddenly expunged even though the moment should be one of blinding revelation so we should acquiesce in the slow progress of the sum total for there are only three possible alternatives the first namely that the progress is from bad to worse which is satanism the second that there is now in the world and will be exactly the same amount of evil and good as there has always been in which case you are confronted with the absurd proposition of two absolutely equal forces having made this scheme of things which will war to all eternity and the third that good is stronger than evil and is quietly gaining ground the objection to the first alternative is that it is satanism a very fatal objection the objection to the second is that it is so stupendously dull there cannot possibly be any point in anything if the two forces are equal there can be no struggle in the mind as to whether one ought or ought not to do certain things if whatever you do or dont does not make any difference there remains the third alternative the objection to that is well i cant see there is any hours ago this house has been asleep the house in which i write on this early morning of the new year the house which is home to me even as my own is for it is the house you will have guessed where lives she who is neither dearer nor less dear than helen and where we always spend the week and a little more that begins before christmas and finishes a little after the new year has been swung from the voices of mellow bells before midnight we sat in the oak panelled room and played the most heavenly games charades and insane gymnastic exercises and table turning with terror when the dreadful table turned in a really unaccountable manner all consecrated by love and laughter and then when the old year was to be numbered by minutes that the fingers could reckon we drew nearer to the log fire and wished each other that which we all wanted for each legs triumphant entry into the foreign office was no longer capable of a wish since it was already accomplished so he was wished a wife and you will understand that we were all very intimate my mother was wished freedom from all anxiety of whatever kind and the old nurse of ninety years who had acted charades with us with astonishing power was wished her century and i was wished the holding of the frost so that i might skate they were flippant again and two cousins were respectively wished a microscope one is of tender years and a motor car and then just as the clock jarred telling us there was but a minute more to the new year it was helens turn to be wished and somebody said your hearts desire and she understood immediately afterwards the clock struck and everybody kissed everybody else and said happy new year and no more for you must not say anything more than that you must not even say good night else the charm is broken so in dead silence we lighted bedroom candles for the ritual was well known and separated and who knows but that all about the house as in the midsummer nights dream the dances of the fairies circled up and down by the light of drowsy fires january a hundred pounds have suddenly and unexpectedly appeared on the horizon people who are very rich have not the slightest idea what that means to us people who are very poor have not the slightest idea either because they would probably buy a public house or goodwill or something of that nature and never have any fun out of it at all but to people who jog along a hundred pounds is a treat which neither rich people nor poor can form any conception of to those who just pay their way as we do it means several weeks somewhere the only question is where at this point in our argument it was impossible to proceed helen and i were both being so unselfish that we couldnt go on she said she longed to have two or three weeks in switzerland i said that what i really wanted was to go to the riviera for a fortnight then as always happens these subterfuges broke down and we both confessed that we neither of us really wanted to go where we said we did she wanted to go to nice i wanted to go to the high altitudes so with the understanding that we were to go where the coin said we should and not otherwise we tossed up it was high altitudes his country put in a claim for legs at the foreign office unfortunately and he should not come with us but we felt when we observed the urbanity of the french customs house officials who obligingly shut their eyes to the presence of large quantities of tobacco and the politeness of the railway officials that legs had probably made himself felt in our foreign relations already and that he was responsible for all this very civil behaviour at ble however where we had to change at the awful hour in the morning which is neither night nor day we found that legs diplomacy had not yet had time to make itself felt for we were subjected to a searching scrutiny luckily i had had experience of the manners and customs house officials of ble before and had transferred my tobacco into my coat pockets thus frustrating the baffled teuton but i am afraid it gave certain secret glee to observe that my travelling companion of the night before a stout white man with a name on his labels so long that i could not read it who had snored all the time was caught and his rich stores of cigarettes taken from him to be sent i suppose to berne for the delectation of the president of the republic switzerland is a land that always arouses curiosity as to how it came about that a country in which the people are so small so toy should in itself be on so gigantic and marvellous a scale is it that the living among these stupendous surroundings has somehow dwarfed the people or has nature by one of her inimitable contrasts made the human part of switzerland so insignificant in order to set off the vastness of peak and snowfield certainly the glib commonplace that national character is influenced and formed by national surroundings is here gloriously contradicted since as far as i am aware no swiss has ever attained to eminence in anything they are a little toy people who live in little toy towns and make excellent chocolate and run innumerable hotels on the most economical principles but even then they do not as one would expect get very rich they are never very anything but the chocolate is excellent said helen to these speculations it requires faith this morning to believe that in a few hours we shall be crunching the dry powdery snow beneath our feet and before sunset be skating or gliding down the white frozen road with puffs of snow coming from the bows of the toboggan for here all down the shore of the lake of thun the country is brown and grey with scarce a streak of white to show that it is winter low overhead are fat masses of dirty looking cloud but between them and this is the door where faith enters are glimpses of the perfect azure which we expect up above now and then the sun strikes some distant hillside or like a flashlight is turned on to the waters of the lake making of them a sudden aquamarine of luminous green but the weather is undoubtedly mild the eaves of the wooden toy stations drip with discouraging moisture and interlaken when we reach it wears a dreadful spring like aspect and people are sitting out of doors at the cafs and appear to find it relaxing then the first of these wonderful winter miracles happened there was the flat alluvial land at the end of the lake across which ran the fussy little light railway which should take us above so we hoped the region of cloudland grey and puddle strewn was it with here and there a patch of dirty snow stained through with the earthy moistness beneath a low lying mist was spread over the nearer distance which melted into the thicker clouds of the sky itself it was just such a view as you shall see anywhere in the english fen land during february we were looking at this with i am bound to say a certain despondency it seemed almost certain that we should find dull weather which means thaw up above when a sudden draught from some funnel of the hills came down making agitation and disturbance both among the low lying mist and the higher clouds the former was vanquished first and torn to ribbons by the wind and scorched up by a sudden divine gleam of sun that smote downwards disclosed in its vanishing the long piney sides of an upward leading gorge the higher clouds being thicker took longer to disperse i suppose for at its farther end the gorge was still full of scudding vapours then suddenly they cleared and high high above a vignette of fairyland the jungfrau herself queen of the snows stood out in glacier and snowfield and peak against a sky of incredible blue there she stood in full blaze of sunshine the silver crystal maiden donned in blue enough to open the eyes of the blind and make the dumb mouth sing then afterwards as the little turkish bath of a train went heavenwards how magical and divine a change happened inside the steamy carriages smelling of railway bags and rugs and forgotten sandwiches it was not possible to see through the condensation on the window panes but the blood that trots through the body knew the change and took a more staccato note then i suppose that travelling stupidity had seized us both it suddenly occurred to helen that we might without fear of prosecution put the windows down though by a printed notice of by laws of the railway it was still defended that we should not agitate ourselves out of it once a ticket puncher exactly like a figure out of noahs ark put them scowlingly up again but with the boldness that this whiff of mountain air supplied we again lowered them after a further consultation of the by laws the ineffable change had begun soon for the moistness of the lowland there was exchanged a hint of frost something that made outlines a little more determinate a little crisper then as we mounted higher there was further change for dripping twigs of the trees there were trees that showed a hard white outline of frost for the sullen muddy stream there was clearer water that went on its way beneath half formed lids of ice and thinner and thinner above our heads grew the grey blanket of cloud then that too was folded away and above is was the sun and the sparkling of the unending firmament below it had been like a london fog when you cannot see the tops of the shrouded houses now we saw the roofs of the world the queen annes mansion of europe all clean all clear just as they were when i saw this land three years ago no tile had slipped no chimney pot required repairs the top of the world was good oh how good the clear dry air the sunset lights on the peaks the liquid twilight keen as snuff to the nostril from which the sun had gone there was the rose tinted wetterhorn black eiger flaming finger of finster aarhorn or on more human plane the hiss of skates over the perfect ice the passage of a toboggan with a little swiss girl holding in front of her a baby sister and steering with her heels and shrilly shouting achtung there was madame who keeps a restaurant i do not know her name standing to see the train passengers come in and shaking hands and saying you shall have wings to morrow no legs alluding to an amiable altercation of three years ago when i drew a kind but firm sort of line about eating chickens legs for lunch on four consecutive days and there was the beerman whose admirable beverage i always drank at am being thirsty with skating and there was a skater i knew who attempted a rather swift back bracket for the admiration of the new arrivals by the train to see and fell down in a particularly complicated manner in the middle of it and there was the barrack of an hotel which always smells of roasting leather because people put their skates and boots on the hot water pipes and right above it was the mettelhorn and to the left was the lady wetterhorn and to the right the smooth steely looking toboggan run down into the valley oh world i beg your pardon i have omitted to mention the magic word on our luggage labels grindelwald three years ago i must tell you among other foolish and futile deeds i made a cache underneath a particular tree on the path leading to the scheidegg consisting as far as i remember of chocolate coins and matches these insignificant facts i published in another place and since then i have received every winter mysterious letters from grindelwald showing that other people are as absurd as myself my cache in fact has been found i gave directions which i hoped would be sufficient and it has been so these letters tell me enriched by other secret and beautiful things there has been placed there on separate occasions by separate passionate pilgrims all manner of store and the very next morning instead of going to skate helen and i skulked off with a toboggan to see what we should find a poem on the wetterhorn so i had been informed was there to form the nucleus of a library there were a tin of potted meat and some caramels for the larder and furniture had been added by a third person in the shape of a lead soldier and an ink bottle while the exchequer i knew also had been enriched by at least half a franc in nickel pieces we had debated earnestly last night as to what to add to the establishment if we found it and eventually decided on a handkerchief which is to be regarded by passionate pilgrims as a tablecloth a reel of cotton and a copy of shirley in the sixpenny edition to swell the library shelves this latter was in a small linen bag to keep it from the wet of course we did not expect to find all the objects that i had been informed had been placed there from time to time for the rule of the cache is that you may use what you find there provided only you replace it with something else the potted meat for instance one could not expect to go undiscussed and i cannot personally conceive leaving caramels uneaten but in place of those if only passionate pilgrims had played the game we should find other objects thus the cache becomes a sort of exchange and mart a reciprocal table laid in the wilderness where you take one dish and replace it with another how it all savours of romance to the childish mind with agitated fingers you scoop away the earth and moss which form the entrance to the cache under a pine tree on the empty frozen hillside and you know you will find treasure of some kind but what it is you cannot possibly tell and inviolable secrecy must surround and embellish your manuvres the cache should not be mentioned at all except discreetly to the elect for it partakes of freemasonry the masons of which are those who delight in idiotic proceedings but just as three years ago i gave the inventory of the cache as it was then so in the minds of the idiotic there may be felt some interest as to its inventory when the founder again revisited it caches of course are socialistic in spirit and anybody may appropriate whatever he chooses but i should be glad if the copy of shirley is left there it is such a pleasant book to read after lunch if you are tobogganing alone a book at any rate is rather a good thing to have in a cache and the wishes of the founder will be satisfied if another book is put there instead but let us have a book i should prefer that it should not be the encyclopdia britannica the morning i think must have been ordered on purpose for i can imagine nothing so exquisite being served up in the ordinary way la carte such weather must have been specially chosen not a single ripple of air stirred an unflecked sky was overhead and the sun as we set off just topped the hills to the south east and sat like a huge golden bandbox on the rim of them the frost had been severe in the night but in this windlessness and entire absence of moisture no feeling of cold reached one there was in the air a briskness of quality more than magical it was as if made of ice and fire and wine and in a sort of intoxication we slid down into the valley then crossing the stream since there was water about it suddenly seemed desperately chill but no sooner had we mounted a dozen yards of ascent again than the same dry kindling of the blood reasserted itself toboggans will not run of their own accord uphill so i put ours under my arm and for a hundred yards we danced a pas de quatre up the trodden snow we both sang all the time different tunes when suddenly we saw a clergyman observing us from a few yards ahead he had a wildish and severe eye and we stopped david before the ark would have stopped if he had unexpectedly come on that man he was sitting in the snow and wore a black hat black coat and black trousers but he had yellow boots he kept his eye on us all the time that we were within sight and seemed to have no other occupation we neither of us dared to look round till we had left him some way behind neither did we dare to dance again eventually i turned my head to look at him from behind a tree he was still sitting in the snow not on a rug you understand nor on a toboggan nor on any of the things upon which you usually sit in the snow he was not breakfasting or lunching or looking at the view he was sitting in the snow and that was all i have no explanation of any kind to offer about this unusual incident helen thinks he was mad that very likely is the case but it is an interesting form of mania perhaps by and by we shall have an asylum for snow sitters or is it a new kind of rest cure it is astonishing how you can argue about things of which you know nothing indeed i think that all proper arguments are based on ignorance if you know anything whatever on the subject of which you are talking you produce a fact of some kind which knocks argument flat it is only possible to reason rightly on those subjects concerning which no fact except the phenomenon itself is ascertainable had we asked the clergyman why he sat in the snow he would probably have told us and the subject would have ceased to interest us conversationally as it was we held heated debate upon him just as if he was the education bill for a long time but the unusualness of it merited attention and conjecture and think how divine an opening for conversation at dinner parties if you know nothing of your neighbour and have not caught her name did you ever see a clergyman sitting in the snow that in fact was the outcome of our argument no theory about him would really hold water he was probably a conversational gambit which might lead to much for instance in answer to your question your interlocutor might reply in five obvious ways i once saw a clergyman but he was not sitting in the snow i have seen snow but i never saw a clergyman sitting in it i once saw a clergyman being snowballed yes what are your views about the best treatment for the insane such strange things happen at grindelwald did you know yes he was probably a conversational opening made manifest to mortal eyes anyhow when we returned he was not sitting there if he had been real he probably would have been at least if you once sit in the snow there is no reason why you should ever get up obviously it is your mtier now everybody who lives in fogs and rainy places will fail to understand anything of these last deplorable pages but if they go to the thin clear air of alps in winter they will know that this sort of thing given you have the luck to see a clergyman sitting in the snow is invested with supreme importance when the hot sun shines on ice it produces some kindly confusion of the brain there is no longer any point in trying to be clever or well informed or witty or any of those things that are supposed to convey distinction down below to their fortunate possessors you go back to mere existence and joy of life it is a trouble to be consecutive or conduct a reasonable argument instead you open your mouth and say anything that happens to come out of it most frequently what issues is laughter but apart from that the only conversation you can indulge in is preposterous and the only behaviour possible is childish that is why i love these roofs of the world the intoxication of interstellar space is in the air everything is so light you your body your mind your tongue your aims and objects the only things that you take seriously are the things that do not matter the snow sitter was one the cache was another but as we got nearer the cache we became even more solemn than on the question of the snow sitter there was no telling what we should find there even if we found the place at all the tree might have been cut down since last year the whole cache might have been rifled by some imperceptive hand there was no end to the list of untoward circumstances that might have despoiled us and so we went through the wood we came to the end of it and there was a tree of many one as mr wordsworth prophetically remarked on its roots were cut my humble initials it was certainly the tree oh quick quick said helen let us know the worst the root had arched a little since i saw it last moss and snow were plastered on it in a manner scarcely natural i plucked the bandage away with hands that trembled we found a pencil something sticky which i believe to have been the caramels an empty potted meat tin with a wisp of paper inside it on which was written i ate it quite excellent a candle end the famous poem on the wetterhorn done up in canvas how laudable a jock scot salmon trout size a paper on which was written whats the point a cigarette very sloppy a five franc piece wrapped up in paper on which was written i took away a little wooden pill box containing a very small moonstone i think we were very moderate in our exchanges which is right since you must always leave the cache richer for your presence and we merely took away the pencil and the poem on the wetterhorn leaving our handkerchief the reel of cotton and the copy of shirley below the question whats the point we wrote none if you cant see it and added the founder and his wife visited the cache on january they saw a clergyman sitting in the snow selah then an awful thing happened even while these treasures were openly and sumptuously spread round us down the path there came a merry swiss peasant about a hundred years old he looked at us and the treasures with curiosity and contempt and then burst into a perfect flood of speech of which neither of us understood one single word when he stopped i said politely ich weiss nicht just like parsifal and he began it or something like it all over again with gesticulations added and in a rather louder tone as if he was talking to a deaf man until this torrent of gibberish was let loose on me i had no idea how much there was in the world that i did not know so with the desire to reduce his opinion of himself also i addressed him in english i said god save the king right through as much as i could remember of to be or not to be from the play called hamlet and had just begun on when the hounds of spring are on winters traces when he suddenly turned pale crossed himself though it was a protestant canton and fairly fled down the path i make no doubt that he thought he had met the devil anyhow he had met his match at unintelligible conversation but it was clearly no use running risks for more of the merry swiss might come down the path who it was conceivable might not be so much impressed by unintelligible sounds and we hurriedly reburied the treasure ate our lunch and turned the bow of the toboggan homewards since we proposed to skate all afternoon it was a year since i had been shod with steel i burned for the frozen surface but it was right to see to the cache first there are some things you cannot wait for we spent three weeks in these divine futilities if anything so utterly enjoyable can be considered futile for my part i do not believe it can since as i have already said to enjoy a thing very much supposing always that it does not injure anybody else is a gilt edged investment of your time for enjoyment is not as is falsely supposed finished with when the thing itself is done and over for it is just then that the high interest of it though gilt edged begins to be paid until one forgets about it and by a merciful dispensation one remembers what is pleasant far longer and far more keenly than what is painful subsequent days and hours are all enriched and therefore made more productive by these pleasurable memories it is here i think that a wonderfully fresh and vivid student of the human mind namely r l stevenson goes all wrong when he says that the past is all of one texture it seems to me one is only responsible for ones own experience to be of two textures one strong and the other weak and the strong one is the memory of things you have enjoyed of happy days the other of times when for some reason or other pain or anxiety or fear the lights have been low and the sound of the grinding not low but loud the human mind in fact is more retentive of its pleasures than of its pain in the moment of the happening either may seem the top note of acuteness but the echoes of the one indisputably live longer than the echoes of the other and though our consciousness if you care to look at it that way is largely a haunted house of the dead hours yet happy ghosts are in preponderance and seem solider than the shadows of its dark places also and this i think too is indubitable the anticipation of happiness is more acute than the anticipation of a corresponding pain in the future there are two textures also as in the past since our return this contrast has been rather markedly brought before me there are many things i much look forward to at the same time there is something ahead which i am dreading what it is i do not know i think i should dread it less if i did but it is though quite certain quite vague i connect it however with that evening in september when i heard my name called and when legs saw something which has since been expunged from his memory and here is the contrast the happiness that lies stored for me in the hive of the future is more potent than the bitterness that is there both are coming of that i am sure and among the many very happy things which i know and expect i feel there is something i do not yet know which is happier than any it is futile to guess at it one might make a hundred guesses and each would seem feasible of accomplishment but there at the back of my mind are these two transparencies so to speak one sunlit the other stormy and it is through them that the events of the day are seen by me they colour both of them all i do but the happy one is the predominant one they do not neutralize each other they are both there to their full but i despair at giving coherently so elusive a picture as they make in my own mind but though elusive it is intensely real and for the first time i neither can nor do i desire to speak to helen about this thing which is so often in my mind it is incommunicable but after these swiss weeks there was not much time for me to think about this as it was imperatively demanded by reasons over which i have no control that i should exercise my mind on the extremely difficult art of the composition of english prose which incidentally implies doing two things at once for not only have you to invent your lively and inspiring tale but you have to tell it in a certain way you may choose at the beginning any way of the hundreds that there are of telling it but in the key in which it is originally pitched in that key it has to remain all the time as a matter of fact it probably does not and goes wandering about in other modes and scales but every book ought to be in the one key in which it opens just as a picture ought to be in one key it is within the writers liberties of course to write other books in other keys and i think he is perfectly justified in largely contradicting in one work what he has unhesitatingly affirmed in another but in each his point of view has to be consistent throughout the thing is not quite so easy as it sounds and it is further complicated by a very real difficulty every story that is worth reading at all is bound to record change in the characters and general attitude of the people with whom it deals the jaded author has to keep his eye on each and see that he behaves after some atrocious battering with which fate has visited him in a different manner than before this visitation took place if he is living in any sense of the word the event will have altered him he will view things differently and therefore behave differently yet all the time he is the same personality it were better for him that he should be as adamant to the blows of circumstance than that the inner essence which is individuality should be uncertainly rendered and like the dexterous mr maskelyne with his spinning plates the scribe has to keep his eye on all his puppets to see that none lapse into stagnation and to poke them up with his industrious pen it is here that the complicated question of consistency comes in which just now is worrying me to bewilderment dreadful and stinging events are happening to a most favourite puppet of mine providence is dealing with her in a cruelly ironical manner in a way that makes the poor distracted lady take quite fresh views of a world she thought so warm and kindly yet it must be the same personality which has to be shown sitting behind these changed feelings and directing them all that is the consistency that has to be observed otherwise it ceases to be one story but becomes a series of really unconnected short stories with the technical absurdity that the heroine in each has the same name yet there is this also it takes all sorts to make a world at least a world otherwise constructed would be an extremely dull one but it it itself life lies somewhere in the middle of us all and is the centre to which we approach we the all sorts which make the world view it very differently though we are all looking at the same object and here a simile a thing usually unconvincing may assist what if in the centre there is something like a great diamond blazing in the rays of the sun i from the south see soft blue lights in it you from the west see a great ruby ray coming out of the heart of it another on the north says this diamond is emerald green while from the east it seems of transcendent orange so far it is quite certain that we are all right for the world so to speak refracts god making him many hued even as white light is refracted by the triangle of a prism and then let us suppose circumstances enter and shift me who have been on the south where i saw blue to the west where i see red the whole colour of the world is changed to me and yet there is no inconsistency the same ego honestly sees a changed colour there would on the other hand when my place was shifted by circumstance be grave inconsistency if i continued to declare that i still saw blue i do not my eyes tell me it is red just now my eyes told me it was blue but i have not changed nor has the great diamond changed it is merely that the refracted light has taken another colour it is just that which one must perceive in the telling of a story a person who sees blue all his life probably sees nothing at all nothing anyhow in the least worth recording he is bound as the wheel of circumstances goes round to see things in other lights but that is not inconsistency it is the truly consistent who wants after all for ever to draw the same conclusion from the same premises only fossils and possibly molluscs but pity the sorrows of the story teller the quality of the red has to be of the same quality as the blue the same fire which strikes to the south will indubitably strike to all other points of the compass and when x is wheeled north he will not see the same green as y sees there he saw it through the alchemy of his own mind it will be green but nobody elses green or if it is he has no individuality to speak of at least he belongs to a type that sees everything through the eyes of others that is generally labelled conventional and there seems no reason to change the name how i laboured during those last ten days of january and how little result there seems to be only i console myself with this the real labour of writing does not chiefly consist in the effort of putting things down but in the moral effort of rejecting them there is nothing easier than to fill pages and pages with improving reflections or inspiring events but having done that it is necessary to sound the tuning fork and see if as i said at first the story is in tune if the key is kept usually it is not on which the fire ought to make to itself a momentary beacon or the waste paper basket be replete but the pile of numbered pages should in any case be starving that as a matter of fact is my sole argument that i have justified my existence during these ten days i have really worked a great deal and the waste paper basket could say how generous has been its diet i have really left out a very great deal and i hasten to forestall the critic who will say that i should in order to act up to this excellent standard have left out the rest i do not agree with him the key of which i have spoken has to be preserved not only in matters of consistency in character drawing but in style as well if you lead off with verbiage from the orient the east must continue i submit to dye your paragraphs till the last page is turned though you may have also at your command pure wells of the most limpid simplicity you will have to reserve them for some other immortal work they will not mix with the incense and heady draughts from the east or should you fancy a mysterious delphic mode of diction delphic you must be to the end but as if all this was not so difficult that like dr johnson we almost wish it was frankly impossible interwoven in your delphic or oriental narrative there must be a totally different woof namely the thread of the spoken word the speeches that you put into the mouths of your various characters and the written word be it remembered is never like the spoken word the two vocabularies to begin with are totally distinct and though i would not go so far as to affirm that the spoken word ought to be ungrammatical it should if it is to recall human speech be colloquial conversational in interchange of ideas by means of the mouth real people do not use fine language especially when their emotions are strongly aroused then instead of becoming high flown and ornate in their speech real people go to the opposite extreme and instinctively use only the very simplest words when this is stated it seems natural enough but you will find it very seldom practised novelists have a tendency to let their puppets employ magnificent high sounding words to express the intensity and splendour of great emotion in fact you may gauge the strength of their emotions as a rule by the sonorous quality of their adjectives i believe the very opposite to be the truth of the matter people in the grip of passion do not use beautiful or highly coloured words above all they do not like mr wegg drop into poetry yet nothing is commoner than to find prose degenerating into blank verse in the spoken records of emotional crises as if blank verse was a sublime form of prose little nell is continually half way between prose and poetry so also is nicholas nickleby when his indignation is roused in fact in some of his scenes with ralph they both forget themselves so much in their passion that torrents of decasyllabic lines flow from their lips but on the other hand the language of narrative should undoubtedly grow more coloured more vivid in such descriptions as are the setting of some very emotional scene yet it should not depart from its original key well as mr tulliver said its puzzling work talking but though the days have been so full i have seen everything everything through the two transparencies that seem drawn between external happenings and me february the seasons according to the literary and artistic view of things have been rather out of joint this year the autumn was not a time of mellow fruitfulness at all because all the green things upon this earth had exhausted themselves in the long hot summer and had no more spirit left to be fruitful with then january in england had been of the usual warm mugginess and mist which poets say are characteristic of autumn but which in reality characterize winter indeed i doubt if winter was ever a time of hard frosts and sparkling snow which is the artistic ideal and i am disposed to believe that that version of it was really brought from germany by the prince consort and popularized by charles dickens then after the mists came the mellow fruitfulness for i myself saw strawberries in flower on february and on february helen came in saying she had found a real strawberry that was strange enough though perhaps the finding of an unreal strawberry would have been stranger still so i said where and she said on the strawberry beds silly therefore i started up leaving a most important and epoch making sentence unfinished and i have never been able to remember what the end of it was going to be because i wanted to see the strawberry and write to the field about it so she said are you going out already and i said yes just to see the strawberry and write to the field saying i have then she pointed to half way down her person since we are so abstemious of words that indicate the anatomy below the throat and said would x rays help being extremely clever that morning of course i understood and reviled her for eating an unnatural phenomenon it was criminal she might as well have found the sea serpent or the north pole and eaten it but as usual she was artful and led the conversation away to daffodils which were behaving in a manner nearly equal to that of the strawberry plant one indeed was in bud a thing incredible but true and i supposed she had eaten that too that led us back to the strawberry again which she was not even sorry about for she said it was far more interesting to be able to write to the field to say she had eaten a strawberry on february than that i should be able to say i had seen it so i very kindly gave her my pen and said write quickly she said oh but i am only a woman i cant they wouldnt put it in i wish you hadnt put the strawberry in said i i think i shall wish that too before long said she i only mention this in order to show the utter unreasonableness of my wife if i want to write to the field and say there was a strawberry in my garden on february she will allow me to say that though i did not see it she ate it she certainly would not have eaten it if i had seen it but she will not write to say she ate it like a true woman she says it does not matter but added with a changed voice that she was afraid it might it did for the fruitfulness of the season was not so mellow as might have been wished yes once again spring has begun to stir in the fiery heart of the world once again the breath of life blows the embers that seemed all winter to be but grey and lifeless cinders and from the centre the glow spreads till that grey surface of ash is alive with flame again and as the flames shoot upwards they are like rockets rising from over the whole face of the world at present they are but going upwards those slender lines of flame which are the sap that is rising through branch and leafless stem until it reaches the very ends of the twigs then these rockets will burst in stars of leaf and opening flower till the vast illumination is again complete but in the warm soft february morning though i feel and know that this is so i cannot help my thoughts going back to the other side of things what of the illumination of last year it is quenched dead and even while the world is getting ready for the next one there still lie broadcast the ashes and fallen sticks of the last rocket shower however many more gladden the world even though to all infinity life was incessantly and beautifully renewed yet i cannot forgive the perishing of a single flower i know well that the material is indestructible that of life and the death of it is born fresh life so that we are quite right to say that life cannot be destroyed but what of the individual rose what of that one purple star of clematis that twinkled on the end of the stem i hold in my hand though it may be transformed and will be transformed into a myriad other things so that by its death it is transfused into a hundred other flowers and courses through the veins of life for ever yet it that individual object will be seen no more its individuality is completely lost it figures in new forms not its own it is quite certain also that the same things happen to our bodies the grass grows thick on the graves of those we have loved and the roots of the roses penetrate deep i saw once on the crumbling sea devoured east coast of england the thing itself under my very eyes which made it real to me in a way that nothing had ever done before for a churchyard stood there on the very edge of the sandy cliff and one night with noise of huge murmurous thunder an acre of it slid down into the sea next morning i visited the place and there sticking out of the cliff were the bones of the dead that had been buried there a ruin of roses that had sprawled and trumpeted over the churchyard gate which had been plucked in half by the fall lay on the ground and i wondered how the trees had not slipped with the rest of the landslide until i saw their roots had lain just where the fracture of the earth occurred and in the exposed face of the new cliff i saw their anchorage one was wrapped round a thigh bone another had made a network among ribs it was all horrible and revolting and that has happened to the million dead who have lived and loved whose limbs have been swift to move who have drawn rapturous long breaths of this keen sea scented air whose eyes have been bright and mouths eager when they met lover and beloved this is all this ruin of red roses on the grass there is nothing in the world more certain than this and one may as well face it helen will die and i shall die and one of us will die first and the other will sometimes see a grave with the grass green over it and roses triumphant thereon for we have settled most things at one time or another she and i and the manner of our funerals and what happens after has passed under discussion we have decided definitely against cremation because it seems such a waste of tissue and we are both of us going to be properly buried the one close to the other so that the same rose may bloom from us both but she will have roses and strawberries on her grave so that the sunday school children may pluck and eat them while i on the other hand am going to be a spring man and have daffodils for i feel no leaning as i have said towards sunday schools here lies the difficulty she wants a rich clayey soil for her roses and strawberries and my daffodils will demand not clay but sand also she is going to plant purple clematis by my head and clematis likes sand too we have not yet perfectly decided where we are going to die but it seems probable that the survivor will stay in the same place as the survived but i want purple clematis since it was when i saw that that i knew somebody whom i had thought to be a friend was false indeed i have done all i could to forgive but i think a clematis that feeds on me may make it surer our funerals will shock the neighbourhood i am afraid i am going to have the a flat fugue and prelude blared on the organ it is time somebody began to learn to play at that distressing moment when my coffin is wheeled out of the church simply to show that i have enjoyed myself enormously great heaven i should as soon think of having a dead march of whatever kind played over me as i should let them play the works of mr mendelssohn i shall have had whatever happens an immensely good time it seems to me much fitter to return thanks for that than to remind people that my poor body is dead which they knew already or why did they come to my funeral service as for requiems i will have none of them whatever happens i my body at least cannot possibly lie quiet in my grave the dear flowers planted there will see to that oh my god my god what unanswerable riddles you set us even this body and what happens to it is so occupying a subject i dont really care what happens to mine it may be set up in an anatomical museum if it will teach anybody anything but helens somehow when i come out of the valley of the shadow something of that must wait for her or if she has gone through that passage first i shall not know myself unless at the end of it when the darkness lifts a little i shall see grey eyes looking at the procession of those passing over and meeting mine and saying somehow i am here she must be there is it not so waiting on the eternal shore for me there she must be i cant help what i believe that is the one thing in oneself which one can never change and dick will be there and margery what a splendid day then the one horrible certainty descended on me again in so few years we shall all our bodies i mean the appearance by which we recognize each other not be our bodies at all but part of the fibre of other living things which are having their day even as we have had ours it is so now with dick and margery so how shall i know them are they to be just voices in the air presences that are felt is that all shall i never see again that quiver on margerys mouth which means that a smile is ready to break from it i dont want incorporeal presences i want dick and his crooked nose and margerys smile then on this warm february morning i must suppose that i went down into hell dead leaves and flowers it was certain were transformed into fresh living forms the bones too and flesh of dead animals and of men and women passed again into the great machine of life and were served up in new transformations so that of the individual body nothing at all was left that is bad enough i shall never see margery and dick again as i used to see them helen will pass too into other forms that is bad enough but this is infinitely worse what of the individual soul the spirit that we love will that too as analogy grimly insists be put back again into the principle of eternal life from which it came so that its identity too is lost and lives but only as the autumn leaves of last year live in the verdure of the next spring with everything else that happens the bodies of those we love even a cruel thing surely but certainly true are used up again to make fresh forms of life why should we suppose that god makes any exception in dealing with the souls of men the individuals every other form of life he uses and re uses the world is but a lump of modelling clay with which he beguiles the leisure of eternity making now one shape then crushing it all up and making another so this is all that the promise of eternal life amounts to that we shall pass back into the crucible and issue forth again as bits of somebody else it seems to me a very mean affair frankly it seems a swindle it is a poor trick to make us puny little creatures love one another and try to be kind and console ourselves for the evil days and the sorrows of the world with thoughts of the everlasting day that shall dawn for us all if that everlasting day is nothing more than the day that is here already if the souls whom we have believed are at rest in some ineffable peace and content or on the other hand through further suffering are getting nearer ever nearer to the perfection and flower of their being have already passed into other forms of life so that dante and beatrice are themselves no longer as we should call themselves but have been infinitely divided into soldiers sailors tinkers and tailors in that sense they may be said to be alive still but it is a very paltry sense they what we mistakenly call they are as dead as if they had never been it is all very well to say that dante is immortal by reason of his deathless verse that is all very well for us but how is it for that fiery soul which is split up into a thousand other bodies when he thought to open his eyes on the mystical rose as the dark waves of death slowly drew back from his emancipated spirit it was all a dismal mistake no beatrice awaited him she too is split into a million other forms of life they were absorbed back into the central fire and a spark of dantes soul went into this man and another into that so that in this sense there is eternal life for him but in no other the dante which we mean was formed out of other lives and into other lives he went the man is there no more and there is no beatrice there will be nothing of us either unless you mean that at some future time i am alive because part of me has become perhaps a murderer and another part a politician and another a housemaid for all i know the february sun was warm you might almost call it hot a little wind pregnant with spring moved through the bushes the snowdrops those pale heralds of the triumphant march of the new year were thick in the grass where we had planted them helen and i last autumn so that they should give us the earliest news of the returning tide of life and to me this morning they brought but bitter news for they spoke not of the returning of life but of the thousand deaths which made them alive they pointed not forwards towards the glory of the many coloured summer but back to the innumerable decay of the autumn and the quiet garden which i loved the tiled mossy roof which i had called home became the place of death even as last autumn death had called to me from it and had been seen by legs and had made the dog howl was it this that was hinted at by those dim forebodings which for months had never been absent from me was the fear that crouched in the shadow ready to spring taking form now it seemed to me that the logic which had turned the world to hell was irrefutable i expected some shattering stroke that should blot out sunshine and sensation from me for ever proving that i and my logic were right i had guessed the horrid secret of the world i was like a spy found with the plans of the enemys fortress on me and must die lest i should communicate them i said that to myself i said enemys fortress meaning the world where i had loved and been loved enemy mark you i knew what i meant the world was the enemys fortress and then thank god oh thank god before that which was impending happened i said to myself that i was wrong i did not at the moment see where i was wrong but i knew that i must have made some gross and awful mistake things could not be as i had imagined them and the moment i said that to myself the darkness lifted a little it was all dark still but the quality of the darkness changed and then unbidden as a tune that suddenly rings in ones head a few words made themselves recollected and they were if i go down into hell thou art there also at that i caught a glimpse again of this dear garden and house as i had seen and known them i do not suppose that this blackness and loneliness of spirit which i have tried to indicate could have lasted more than a few minutes as measured in the world of time but time has nothing to do with the spirit in a second as computed by the unmeaning scale of hours and days the soul may live a thousand lifetimes or die a thousand deaths redemption may be wrought there in an infinitesimal fraction of a moment or in that same fraction a soul may damn itself for it is not the moment which is anything it is the instantaneous choice which therein sums up the infinite series of deeds which one has already done and thoughts which one has harboured and the message that leaps round the world on electric wires is a sluggard to choice my choice at this moment was between the truth of what i had been elaborately thinking out and the truth of the words that rang in my head there was reason on one side there was just it on the other and what was it just that which very faintly but quite audibly said that i had come near to blasphemy there are many names for it we all know its visitation though it is obscured sometimes because we encourage the devil who comes to us all in many forms and can take the most respectable disguises like those of intellect and mind but perhaps the simplest name and the truest for it is the grace of god then in the same moment i am lumbering in words and trying to express what i know cannot be said i saw that helen was already half way across the grass coming towards me she held a telegraphic sheet in her hand and there was in her face a gravity infinitely tender and quite quiet and quite normal i had seen it there once before when the news came of her fathers death which was sudden legs wont come down this afternoon she said gently we have got to go up to him and then she showed me the telegram it was not many hours before we knew all there was to be known legs had started to ride down from town and turning into the kings road from sloane square his motor bicycle had skidded and he had fallen under an omnibus a wheel had passed over him he had a letter or two which identified him in his pockets and he had been taken since it was so near back to the house in sloane street when we got there he was still alive his room was at the back of the house and we were allowed to go in at once he lay there quite unconscious and in no pain for the only thing that could be done for him was to keep him like that the bedclothes were not allowed to touch him and a round wooden frame was under them there was no hope at all his bed ran out into the middle of the room and helen and i sat one on each side of it while a little distance off was the doctor who just watched him sometimes he got up and looked at him sometimes he softly left the room returning as quietly and in those hours of waiting for a long time i was conscious of nothing except the trivial details of the room itself i suppose i had been there before ah yes of course i had when legs had the influenza in the winter but it was not familiar yet it was just like what i should have expected legs room to be and in a moment i found i knew it as well as i knew him there was a pile of letters on the writing table a bag of golf clubs in the corner an enormous sponge on the washing stand and on the dressing table a most elaborate shaving apparatus a metal bowl a little etna for hot water a half dozen razor blades in a neat case with a sort of mowing machine handle he had not packed them since he was only going to be with us for a couple of days and he could never have used all those blades once each on that smooth chin he had been as i remembered now to a fancy dress ball the night before and his wardrobe gaping open showed the hose and ruffles of the elizabethan period while hanging up by them was a small pointed beard and a high head top with long and rather scanty brown hair for the point is legs had said rather shrilly everyone will say shakespeare i presume and i shall say how dare you i am hall caine and if some people are a little cleverer and say the bondman i suppose i shall say you seem to have forgotten william shakespeare perhaps you dont think it funny but then you see you are not going to the ball no we had not thought it very funny and legs had been rather ruffled he told us we had spoiled his pleasure but if so it must have very quickly become unspoiled again for it was only a week ago that he had conceived that idea he spent a boisterously hilarious evening afterwards but how i wish we had not spoiled his pleasure even for that moment as if it mattered whether it was funny or not so long as it amused him helen had said it was rather a cheap sort of joke and just then her eyes too saw the fancy dress hanging up in the wardrobe and the moment afterwards she looked across to me and then she left the room for a little while she too i am sure had thought of that i had a friend once who was killed in a railway accident a year afterwards i was staying with his mother and one evening when we were alone she began crying gently jim took his lunch with him to eat in the train that day she said to me soon and he had asked me to put him up an orange but i forgot that is the pathos of little things yes you dear soul weep a little over the forgotten orange and let helen weep a little because she said legs joke was cheap and then let us think of the bigger things the love and the loving kindness that have been ours that bright boyish spirit that made mirth in the home even now let us try to thank god for what has been you know what legs was to us a sort of son a sort of brother all that afternoon we sat there hearing london rumble distantly around us and little stirrings and creakings came from different parts of the room now the blind flapped now a curtain sighed or as often happens in spring time a board of the flooring gave a little sharp rap some infinitesimal particle of sap still lingering in it perhaps and hearing the heralds of spring blowing their horns outside only from the bed there came no sound at all he was still sunk deep in that sleep which the doctor hoped would join and be one with death if he woke at all there was a chance that he would suffer blinding excruciating pain on the other hand he might come to himself just at the last moment of all when pain would be already passed the doctor was saying this in the hushed whisper with which we speak in the chamber of death though there may be no real reason why we should not speak openly when i heard a little stir from the bed and looking round i saw that legs eyes were open and that he was moving them this way and that as if in search of something helen had seen too and next moment she was by him he recognized her for there was welcome in his eyes and then turning his head a little he saw me the doctor meantime had moved to the head of the bed and looked at legs face very intently then he made a little sign to me that i should come up to the bed and he himself went and stood by the window looking out and i understood then legs spoke in his ordinary voice wasnt it bad luck he said my bicycle skidded and the omnibus what is happening to me he asked quickly is it helen laid her hand on his head yes my darling she said but you are not afraid are you for a moment the pupils of his eyes contracted then they grew quite normal again no he said quickly ive had an awfully good time oh and it was a great success shakespeare you know then a shadow seemed to pass over his face and his eyelids fluttered now is it coming now he said yes my darling said she again and kissed him legs lay quite still for a moment with closed eyes then he quickly opened them again and made as if he would raise his head buck up you two wont you he said from outside there came the dim roar of london and little noises crept about the room but from the bed came no sound at all two days afterwards we went down home again arriving in the evening and the body rested that night in his own room down here to be taken next day to the churchyard which the sun blesses more than any other place i have ever seen and over which the grey norman tower keeps watch his last charge to us had been to buck up and i do not know how it was but it seemed to us both as if he was still liking us to buck up so in so far as we found it possible we did what legs wished us to do but to night he would have been here making the third of a merry table and when the servants had come in for the last time bringing us coffee it was not possible not to remember that and helen rose and when she spoke her voice trembled is it very foolish of me she asked and do you think legs will mind but i feel as if i cant face to morrow unless i go and look at the place where we shall put him it is quite warm outside jack oh let us go out and look at it it will seem more natural then i think i shall buck up better if i see it first so we went across the garden and through the place of roses and through the gate on the far side and through the field which bounded the churchyard there was a great yellow moon just risen and shadows were sharp cut so that there was no doubt when we came to the place that had been so newly dug his uncle helens father lay there the two graves were side by side so we sat there in silence for some time very still for a rat ran on to the mound of earth by the graveside and sat there smartening itself up brushing its face and whiskers with nimble paws the shadow of the tower swung just clear of the place and sharp cut in the light was that oblong hole in the ground there was nothing as yet to be said for helen was crying quietly to herself and i could not stay those loving tears once she said to me oh let us buck up but then she silently wept again you see i know helen i knew that there was nothing of bitterness in her crying tears of that sort were not opposed to the bucking up legs did not mean that he wanted us not to miss his dear companionship he only wanted us to stand up and be cheery not be bitter or broken but since helen felt she could face to morrow better if she faced the scene of it why that was all right it was bucking up then in a few little sentences we talked of the next day there should be the a flat fugue no funeral march and we would have no funeral hymns but just one psalm the lord is my shepherd and one hymn after all that had to be done was over so then we would sing adeste fideles helen thought for it is always christmas since the first christmas day helen just moved as she sat there on the edge of his grave when we had settled this as if to go home again but and then i told her all that i had thought three mornings ago all the doubts that merged into certainty all the logical conclusions whether i then at that moment inclined more to the side of the devil or of god i do not know but in any case i told her all and then she put her arms round me yes dear she said but in hell he is there also and we are all there sometimes and it is but the lowest step of the beautiful stair to heaven the moon had swung behind the tower and we sat in the darkness of its shadow it is all so simple she said it all depends upon what you believe not what you think or what you reason about do you believe that we bury legs to morrow do you believe that he is dead or that he has ceased to be an individual you may reason about it and ask me as you asked yourself how you will recognize him if his body has become grass and flowers i am quite content to say that i have no idea you see one doesnt know all gods plans quite completely and sometimes we are apt to think that if one doesnt know plans about a certain thing he hasnt got one we put our intelligence above his that is a mistake and we sat in silence again then helen spoke asking me an extremely simple question what does faith mean if you are right about it she said it means nothing it is without meaning and are you prepared to abide by that again there was silence she sat a little apart from me so that her questions came from the darkness they were put impersonally so to speak not by helen but just by a voice do you believe that margery and dick are nothing now except grass and flowers and perhaps a little bit of the lives of other people do you really believe it and is legs nothing now it was quite still we had come to a very sequestered corner of the great house of life to talk about these things in front was the shadow of the grave and over it now lay the shadow of the tower once from the graves side a few pebbles detached themselves and fell rattling to the bottom and i had no answer to this three days ago i had asked myself the same questions and what i call my brain answered them but now it gave no answer something i suppose had made it uncertain how can the wheel of an omnibus hurt legs she asked it can do no more than hurt his body then she came closer to me again and what does love mean she said i think legs must have enjoyed his funeral next day because it was so extremely funny and i think by this time that you know enough about him and helen and me to allow us all to be amused at it we had sent a note to our vicar saying that we should like the a flat prelude and the psalm and the hymn which i have mentioned he came in person not to remonstrate but to put on to us the correcter attitude death was a solemn occasion there was none so solemn and the hymns ancient and modern provided some very suitable verses to be sung now the labourers task is oer for instance legs a labourer who was the most gorgeous player at life that has ever been seen besides surely a christmas hymn was out of place when it would be ash wednesday in no time i said feebly that a christmas hymn was surely always in place but dear mr eversley looked pained and helen at once yielded she was sure that the labourers task was most suitable then about the psalm there were two psalms already provided for the burial service and surely the lord is my shepherd struck a different note so said our vicar that was undeniable and when should we sing that psalm then helen was firm and said that we thought we should go back into church at the end of the service and well just sing it it was rather good to end with but mr eversley looked even more pained than before he had never heard of such a thing being done that point was left undecided for the moment for there was clearly something even more crucial to come it came ever since the organist had heard of legs death he had been most diligent at chopins funeral march of which he had of his own initiative bought a copy in order to be able to perform it the organist in question who was also the schoolmaster had had a sort of distant adoration for legs ever since a year ago he had seen him drive a golf ball two hundred and sixty measured yards since then legs had played with him once or twice giving him enormous odds and the distant adoration had ripened into a nearer one he was such a pleasant young gentleman was the upshot of it and the dear man had bought chopins funeral march since he wanted to play something more uncommon than the dead march in saul here helen and i were completely at one there should be no a flat preludes it was to be chopins funeral march there remained the question of the twenty third psalm oh yes it would strike a different note that was quite true so there would be no going back into church but we should have chopins funeral march and now the labourers task is oer the vicar did not exactly beam when these things were settled but he was visibly relieved he shook hands with us both and said terribly sudden terribly sudden at two precisely oh legs how you would have enjoyed that we did too for you told us to buck up and it was so funny after all we had planned the vicars call had been made quite early and it was scarcely twelve when he went away but to us both it seemed as if legs had been waiting somewhere upstairs till he went in order to laugh over it with us it was as if he had been waiting on the landing fresh from his bath with just a dressing gown on so that he could not appear when other people were there but might come down barefooted when they had gone he must have been so amused at it how he would skip into the drawing room afraid of prowling housemaids to find us alone and say sorry i havent got much on but i had to come down after my bath yes after his bath it was so that it seemed to us that wholesome spirit had been washed we thought by what is called death it was fresher more jubilant than ever and on the vicars departure down he came to join us again i have no other words for it there was more to come for hardly had the vicar gone when it was announced to us that mr holmes had called and might he see one of us for a moment only i felt that legs was cornered now he would have to stop here hide behind the piano or something i hoped he would behave himself and not make me laugh so mr holmes came in i never saw anybody so wonderfully attired he was all in black including his gloves and his stick and above his small neat buttoned boots when he sat down i saw a black sock that may only have been accidental but no accident would account for the fact that his cuffs had a neat black border about half an inch wide i wondered if he had blacked himself all over like the enthusiastic impersonator of othello he had ventured to intrude on our grief but only for a moment here helen dropped her handkerchief and they both bent down to pick it up and knocked their heads together and i almost thought i heard a little stifled gasp from behind the piano but mr holmes had received no notice of the funeral which he had understood was to be to day and did not know if we wished it to be quite private if not he would esteem it a privilege to be allowed to pay his last respects and here little mr holmes gave a great gulp and could not get on i did like him so much he said after a moment two thank you i can let myself out and he walked away on tiptoe as if it was most important not to make a noise it was one of those sparkling february days sunny and windless and the air was full of the chirruping of birds there was a moments pause at the gate of the churchyard a moments silence inside the church the organ ceased then came great simple words i am the resurrection and the life march helen and i have a failing though you may not have thought that such a thing was possible it is a foolish weakness for old bits of rubbish we can neither of us without anguish and unutterable rendings bear to throw old and useless things away the weakness has to be got over sometimes but we keep putting the work of destruction off just as one puts off a visit to the dentist with the result that when it comes to pass we find that it would have been far better to have done it long ago however if we did not occasionally tear things up and throw things away the house would become uninhabitable so this morning we vowed to each other to spend the hours till lunch in the work of destruction our rubbish collects chiefly in the room that is called mine where she has a knee hole table with nine drawers she opened these one after the other they were all full and despair seized her i cant she said here are nine drawers all quite full of hearts blood o jack look and she brought across to me a photograph i had taken of legs jumping the lawn tennis net he was sitting in the air apparently in an easy attitude one knee seemed crossed over the other and his mouth was wide open it will be harder than ever this year she said half to herself and there are nine drawers full circumscribe the drops of hearts blood as they come said i dont think there are nine drawers full only keep thinking of the particular thing that has to be kept or thrown away oh but its only the fact that there are nine drawers full that makes it possible to throw anything away at all said she hush woman said i personally i am extremely methodical over the work of destruction i clear a table and dump upon it a pile of hearts blood this i sort into three heaps one of which is for destruction one for preservation and one for further consideration i proceeded to do so now there were many pieces of string throughout the year i keep pieces of string because i know i shall use them as a matter of fact when i want a piece of string i cut it off helens ball and never use any of the bits that i have saved because i dont know where they are and they would prove to be the wrong length if i did so on the day of destruction i consign them to the dust bin and begin to collect again immediately then there was a pill box full of soft yellow powder which legs and i had collected from the little cedar cones at some house where we were staying in the autumn that i put on to the heap of destruction but transferred it to the heap of consideration then there were a dozen little bits of verd antique which i had picked up years ago on the beach at capri and which i had periodically tried to throw away but i never could manage it and this morning knowing it was useless to strive against the irresistible i made no attempt whatever to steel myself to their destruction but put them at once into the pile that was predestined unto life there was a chunk of amber that i had picked up at cromer equally imperishable yards and yards of indiarubber tape that is the filling of a rubber cored golf ball a small bottle with a glass stopper clearly impossible to throw away since it might come in useful any day and how foolish i should feel if this afternoon i wanted a bottle with a glass stopper and had to send into the town for one whereas if i had been less iconoclastic i might have airily produced the exact thing needed out of the left hand top drawer then came a little tin box full of pink powder which i concluded was rouge this was puzzling when did i use rouge i asked helen i dont know was it legs do you think when he acted the red queen last year no i couldnt throw that away the red queen had been a piece of genius and next came the telegram from him to me saying that he had passed into the foreign office then there was a vile caricature of myself at the top of my so called swing at golf quite unrecognizable i assure you but then came a mass of letters receipted bills and accounts rendered accounts rendered always fill me with suspicion and i have to hunt among unpaid bills to find the items of the account rendered as i feel a moral certainty that this is an attempt to defraud me but they are invariably correct but these and the receipted bills which had to be docketed and tied up together in a bundle took time probably however i could tie them up with one of those many pieces of string which i had so diligently collected by a rare and happy chance i found one that would do exactly and tied them up with a beautiful hard knot and put them on the predestination heap a moment afterwards i found several more to join the same packet split my nail over trying to untie my beautiful knot and had to go upstairs for nail scissors to cut it smooth and brought them down to cut the knot no other piece of string in my collection would do and so i cut a piece off helens ball for she had left the room for the moment then i came upon a large quantity of boxes of fusees all partly empty how it happens is this i go to play golf on a windy day and of course have to buy at the club house a box of fusees these on my return or what remains of them i methodically put in a drawer on reaching home by an oversight i forget to take them out again when i play next day and so buy another box which i similarly place in a drawer and if you play golf four or five times a week on these downs where there is almost always a high wind it follows that in the course of a year the amount of partly filled boxes of fusees which you collect about you is nothing short of prodigious i did not know how great a supporter i was of home industries my methodical mind saw at once how these had to be treated of course throwing them all away was out of the question and the right thing to do was to produce out of every dozen of partly filled boxes some eight or nine completely full this plan i began to put into practice at once it was necessary of course to find how many matches a full fusee box contained but they are awkward to pack and some seemed to hold ten and others only seven so when helen came back the table was covered among other things with fusees so i waved my arms violently and said you shall not this was because the female nose and the male nose if it is unaccustomed to tobacco smoke likes positively likes the smell of fusees but to anyone who smokes tobacco the smell of them is for some reason perfectly nauseating and that is why we only use them in the open air then helens mean nature asserted itself she said oh i forgot you dont like the smell and soon after not at once mark you called my attention to some non existent object of horticultural interest out of the window i turned and in a moment she had lit a fusee and positively inhaled the sickening perfume of it i only wished she had inhaled it all the upshot was that we took a turn on the lawn while the room with open door and windows recovered from its degrading odour how were you getting on she asked not very well i decided to destroy some string i nearly destroyed a pill box with some cedar flower dust in it but i reserved that at least i think i did why legs and i collected it and i know legs wouldnt have thrown it away so i cant helen was silent a moment then do you miss legs very much she asked his bodily presence i mean of course of course i do just as you do i miss him all the time oh he is in the room and he laughs at us or with us i know that then what do you miss she asked the young body about the house then helen said oh you darling that sort of remark is always extremely pleasant but i had no notion of her artfulness i am glad to say that she has often said it before so that it was not particularly stupid of me not to guess that it meant anything especial and with her artfulness she changed the subject to that which i happened to be thinking about thus making no transition i gave up she said i found all my things were so connected with legs that i couldnt destroy them it is just what you said we want to keep the young thing in the house since we are getting old yes its no use saying pouf and i cant destroy anything connected with him so shall we move our rubbish straight into legs room and make a sort of young museum then when we feel particularly middle aged we can go up there and sit among the young things if we dont do that we must clear out his room as well and i cant see how we can there are rough copies of letters to that dreadful charlotte there is a letter in his handwriting there on his table beginning beginning youre a damned fool said i but i dont intend to quarrel with you did you mean that one then you have been there too she said why of course every day i go when you attend to household affairs after breakfast you go when you say you are going to bed didnt you know certainly i did but i thought you didnt know that i went there she said ditto said i there was a huge rushing wind out of the south west and we stood a little while inhaling the boisterousness of it all spring was in it all the renewal of life how legs is laughing at us she said i dont care lets have the museum of young things lets put there all the things we cant throw away oh helen there are photographs too there is one of him in his last half at eton there is one of you and me when the canadian canoe sank gently and as we stood dripping on the shore he photographed us and i photographed him and you when you said you would skate a rocking turn together and fell down hearts blood hearts blood there ought to be a law which makes it a penal offence to keep photographs i suppose i had got excited for helen took my arm and said there there but even that did not do oh the pity of it i cried the pity of it why didnt he take a train to come down why didnt that omnibus pull up he was ours and he would have married and still been ours and there would have been young things about the house again i suppose i had torn away from her for now we were apart facing each other at the end of this and she smiled so quietly so serenely do you think that i dont feel that too she asked cant you see that the wife who is mother of nothing must feel it more than the husband who is father of nothing besides you make your books you are father to them what do i do i order dinner and yet it seems to me so strange now i did not see there was bitterness in her words but all i thought was that there was no bitterness in her voice or her face or her smile i did not quite understand that i remember but helen has told me since that she did not mean me to she wanted well her plan evolves itself and then she took my arm again it is nearly a month since dear legs went away she said since we have actually heard and seen him the last we heard was that he wanted us to buck up do you know i think we have bucked up but we have been doing that singly we have somehow lived rather apart dear surely it is better to buck up together i think the idea of a young museum is a very good one let us put all the things we cant throw away into his room we have never used the room before because legs might always rush down and want a bed and so let us keep it like that we might call it the nursery and so the young museum was started helen had all manner of tender trifles for it all connected with legs she had all sorts of things i had known nothing of little baby garments legs bottle some baby socks then there were child things as well alice in wonderland the depressing swiss family called robinson a far better robinson called crusoe and thus the nursery grew treasure island went there a rocking horse which i remembered of old days was brought down from an attic oh how well when i saw him again i remembered him he had a green base nicely curved on which he pranced to and fro and my foot had once been under it when he pranced so that i lost a toenail and was rewarded with sixpence for stopping crying he had a hollow interior the only communication with which were the holes of the pommels and on another dreadful day my sister had dropped a three penny bit into one of them with some idea of making a bank a bank it was but the capital was irrecoverable the coin was still there for now i took up the whole horse with ease that steed which had so often carried me and heard a faint chink from his stomach he had a wild eye too and flaming red nostrils and the paint smelt just the same as ever and helen produced a noahs ark in which the paint was of familiar odour but different and there was ham without a stand and mrs noah in a neat brown ulster and noah with a beard and one good foot but the other was a pin elephants were there with pink trunks i never could understand why and enormous ducks with pink bills which now threw a light on the colour of the elephants trunks since i suppose that a brush full of pink was indiscriminately bestowed and small spotted tigers and nameless beasts which we called lynxes chiefly because we did not know what they were and did not know what lynxes were so they were probably the ones the ark itself had gothic windows and a mean white bird with a piece of asparagus in its mouth painted on the roof probably indicated the dove and the leaf we must have spent two days over the nursery and during those days we concentrated there all the young things of the house and when it was finished it was a motley room there were photographs of legs everywhere all his papers were kept everything that had any connection with legs and with youth was crammed into it and when it was finished we found that we sat there together instead of paying secret visits to the room and we played at noahs ark sitting on the carpet and played at soldiers clearing a low table which had been helens nursery table for you cannot play soldiers on the floor since they stagger on a carpet and peas from pea shooters sent whole rows of grenadiers down like ninepins but we could neither of us ride the rocking horse so instead we tilted him backwards and forwards and pretended he was charging the foe of course all reasonably minded readers will say we were two absurd people we both of us disagree altogether for you have to judge of any proceedings by its effects and the effect in this case was that legs injunction that we should buck up became a habit that inimitable youth which legs gave the home he his bodily presence had gone but somehow the atmosphere was recaptured we played at youth at childhood till it became real again for a household without youth in it is a dead household a puppy or a kitten may supply it or an old man of eighty may supply it but youth of some kind must be part of ones environment else the world withers another thing has happened to me personally i have said that at the beginning of the year i looked forward into the future through two transparencies one sunlit the other dark but now the dark one i can express it in no other way had been withdrawn dear legs death was not quite identical with it for it was not withdrawn then but during the month that followed it gradually melted away i can trace just two causes for it the first was this in ineptitude of spirit i had reasoned to myself that the death of the body logically implied the merging of the life into the one central life but after his death legs became to my spirit more individual than ever and the second cause was this establishment of the nursery though youth might have passed for oneself it still lived one was wrong too at least i was in thinking it had passed from oneself else how did i feel so singularly annoyed when helen shot down with a wet pea a whole regiment of my life guards i was annoyed i am still it was a perfect fluke that the colonel on horseback fell in such a way that he more than decimated his own regiment and i am sure helen shook the table else why should the brigadier general posted in the extreme rear have fallen off the table altogether she won meantime in this first week of march the winds were roaring out of the south west and for a while days together sometimes squalls which the valkyrie maidens might have bridled to make steeds for their swift going came in unbroken procession from the atlantic helen is a lover of the sea and these gales coming out of the waste of waters touch something within her as mysterious as the sixth sense of animals who feel and are excited by things that the five sensed mortal is unaware of to day however was quiet and calm and we stormed the steep ascent of the downs till we stood on the highest point of the beacon which looks down on all other land towards the south west so that the river of wind that flows from the atlantic comes here unbreathed and untamed by traverse of other country and you get it fresh and salt as it was when it left the ocean in that interval of quiet weather there was nothing to be perceived by the ordinary sense but she sniffed the air like a filly at grass wind is coming she said the great wind from the sea i dont care whether your little barometer has gone up or not what does it know of the winds we shall be at home before it comes but i will tell you then as we sit close to the fire what is happening in the big places she was quite right though the silly barometer had gone up we were but half through dinner when the wind which had been no more than a breeze all afternoon struck the house as suddenly as a blow the wood fire on the hearth gave a little puff of smoke into the room and then thinking better suddenly sparkled as if with frost as the passage of the air above the chimney drew it up at that helens eyes were alight she ate no more but sat with her elbows on the table while i who have not the sixth sense went gravely through mutton and anchovies on toast and an orange then they brought in coffee and she shook her head to that meantime that first warning of the wind had been justified a niagara of air poured over us screaming and hooting and making a mad orchestra of sound at times it ceased altogether the long pause of the conductor and then before one heard the wind at all a tattoo of the drums of rain sounded on the window pane then heralded by those drums the whole mad orchestra burst into a great tutti of screaming hooting sobbing so much i could hear but helen was of it somehow something secret and sensitive within her vibrated to the uproar i have seen her in the grip of the wind as she expresses it perhaps half a dozen times and it always makes me vaguely uneasy it is no less than a possession and yet i can think of no one whom i would have imagined less liable to such a thing i can imagine her surrounded by the terrors of fire or shipwreck or any catastrophe that overthrows the reason and makes men mere panic stricken maniacs keeping absolutely calm and infecting others by her self possession but now and then the wind takes possession of her and she becomes like the pythian prophetess oh to be alone with the sea and the gale to night she said jack what splendid things are happening in the great empty places of the world this has been brewing out on the atlantic for a couple of days by now and there are thousands of miles of great white headed waves rising and falling in the darkness and calling to each other and dancing together up above them as in the gallery of the ball room is the great mad band of which we hear a little in our stuffy house and it will play to them all night and all to morrow and the waves will dance without ceasing growing bigger as they dance like some nightmare oh you can imagine nothing but i see so clearly mr and mrs wave and all their family dancing dancing all young though white headed and growing bigger as they dance they are cannibals too and a big wave will eat up a little one which makes it bigger yet the wind loves to see that he gives a great blare of trumpets when he sees a cannibal wave oh it must have happened this moment that scream meant well done wave that was a big one you swallowed sometimes they see a ship coming along and they love playing with ships because all proper ships like being out in the atlantic ball room and the waves crowd towards it seeing which can lift it highest whiz cant you hear the screw racing as the wave that lifted the stern runs away from under it how the masts strike right and left across a thousand stars for the sky is quite clear the winds have turned out the clouds as you turn out the chairs and tables from a room where you dance we had gone up to legs room after dinner and as she talked she went quickly from place to place now pausing for a moment to look at a photograph now putting coal on the fire or drawing aside the curtain to look into the night oh there is the eternal youth of the world she said the song of the winds and the dance of the waves i think all the souls of the little babies that are born come to land in the blowing from the sea it is by that that vitality burns higher and the fruitfulness of the world is renewed millions of blossoms of life are rushing over the land to night ready to drop into lonely homes ah dont dont i said helen come and sit down and be quiet she paused for a moment opposite me looking at me with her wonderful shining eyes not i not i she said she still paused still looking at me still waiting for me to join her as it were and in that pause a sudden faint far away light broke on me she had said words which must have awoke in her even as they awoke in me the most keen and poignant sorrow that can touch those who love each other and yet she was still smiling and her eyes shone i got up something of that huge joy that transfigured her was wrapping me round also the thrill the rapture in which she was enveloped began to encompass us what do you mean i asked it is for you to tell me she said it must be done that way you said ready to drop into lonely homes i said so that they are filled with laughter said she then i knew it is here i said the nursery and at that the excitement the exultation slowly passed from the face of my beloved for there was no room there for more than motherhood though the wind still bugled and trumpeted outside she heard it no more the wildness of the dancing waves grey headed growing waves passed by outside her the blossom ready to drop filled her heart with the tenderness of the infinite deep love of the mother that shall be she sat there on the floor at my feet with her arms round my knees and her head pillowed there i have got to confess too she said though i am not ashamed of my confession but dont allow yourself to be hurt jack just hold on for a minute without being hurt and you will find that you are not now i shall hide my face and speak to you like that i have known it quite a long time before legs died i knew it well i had to hold on for a minute or two and not be hurt if you think it over you will agree it was rather a hard task that i had been set on the other hand about big things about things that really matter you must take my word for it that helen is never wrong but i had not been forbidden to ask a question then why did you not tell me i said her head with the sunlit billows just stirred a moment but she did not look up but spoke with a hidden face because through all these weeks my darling you have been struggling against some bitterness of soul you have made light of it to me but i had to be quite sure it had gone from you before i told you this i know what it was it was the doubts you talked about to me when we sat one night at the edge of dear legs grave when it was dug but empty and i had to be quite sure it had all passed from you before i told you this i have not been sure till now and and i wanted you so much to guess you nearly guessed i felt when we arranged this heavenly nursery then again there was silence and i think i never knew till then how desperately difficult it is to be honest with oneself it is so much easier to be honest with other people at the first glance i told myself i had got over the bitterness and blindness of which she had spoken when we talked together over legs grave but gradually i became aware that i had not somewhere deep down so that while the days passed it concealed itself from me that bitterness had still been there in this book which has tried to be honest you will i dare say find no trace of it since that night but i had not probed deep enough it had been there and i think the days when we arranged the nursery finally expelled it to night at least i believed it was gone and since helen believed so too perhaps we are right about it she the witch the diviner had known me so much better than i had known myself all along all this took time for the processes of honesty with me are slow but there is no difficulty about the matter perhaps if the head you love best in all the world is pillowed on your knee that is a stimulant one must imagine so at last i said yes its done she came closer yet and like mr holmes we talked below our breath in whispers as if afraid of disturbing this great joy that had come floating down on us borne on the sea spray borne on the wind tide borne as you will so that only it came here then very soon after she went to bed and i was left sitting in the nursery with its new significance yet it was not quite new i had as helen said half guessed before and i but wondered now i knew how my imagination had halted half way and had not clearly seen the star on which helens eyes were fixed yet who would have known she had been so full of art in her wording even that master word she had used nursery seemed but to have slipped in and i had thought she meant only as indeed she had said that it was to be the room of young things where she should sit when the shadow of childlessness was chill and with the aid of the memories of youth and play keep the mists of middle age from closing round us and the frosts of old from settling too stiffly on the later years of our travel the room was to be but a palliative or a tonic as you will a consolation for the things that were not to be for us and now it showed another face it was not the past of which it spoke but the future i suppose i sat long over the embers of the fire but these were hours that had escaped from the hand of time and were not to be computed by his scale sometimes i threw a log into the open hearth of the fireplace ah but that open hearth must be altered now it would never do in the nursery and sometimes i plied an industrious pair of bellows but for the most part i sat idle looking into the fiery heart of the blaze for the news that helen had made me guess was at first unrealizable though i knew it to be true i had to absorb digest it since a great joy is as stunning a thing as the stroke of sorrow and gradually as gradually as the workings of the process of beauty i began to feel and not only to know the name of the room where i sat it was the nursery but helen was wrong about one thing she had said that the wind would play to the dancing of the waves all night and all next day but before i went to bed that wild orchestra of the storm had ceased its work was done for us it had blown the bud of the blossom of life into the house that so longed for it it is strange how quickly the events of life become part of one next morning i woke in full possession of the new knowledge there was no question or uncertainty as to what that was which made a rapture of waking and with the same suddenness all real knowledge of what life had been before i knew this had passed from me i could no longer in the least realize what i had felt like before the moment came when helen had made me guess though that moment was so few hours away yet i could no more conceive existence without it than one can form any mental picture of what life would be without the gift of sight or hearing it is not that any huge event destroys all that went before it but it so stains back through the turned pages of the past that they are all coloured and suffused with it how the blackbirds and thrushes sang on that march morning i had awoke before dawn to hear the early tuning up going on in the bushes and before long since i was too happy to sleep i got up dressed quietly and went out the tuning up was just over and the birds were all busy with breakfast for you must know as soon as they wake they get in singing trim for the day before their bright eyed quest listening with head cocked as they scuttle over the lawn for the sound of a worm moving they are so close to the ground themselves that they can localize this to within a fraction of an inch and then in goes the spear like beak and the poor thing is dragged out of the soft dew drenched earth they are not quite tidy eaters these dear minstrels of the garden for the point is to get your breakfast inside you beyond recall with the least possible delay swallow gulp swallow and the thing is done then you give one long flute like note of satisfaction and listen again for the second course but one cannot exactly say that they have bad manners at table for the extreme sensibleness of the plan excludes all other considerations also bad manners at table irresistibly suggest greediness and no bird is ever greedy they have excellent appetites and when they have had enough they stop eating and instantly begin to sing it was just at the end of birds breakfast that i got out that is to say it still wanted some minutes to sunrise the lawn was all gossamer webbed and shimmering with dew as if some thin layer of moonstone or transparent pearl had been veneered over emerald and i felt it almost a vandalism to walk over it removing with my clumsy feet whole patches of thin inimitable jewellery the three hour gale of the night before had vanished to give place to a morning of halcyon calm and i augured one of those rare and exquisite days which march sometimes gives us days of warm windlessness and the promise of spring straight in front of me rose the beacon still submerged in clear dark shadow but high in the heavens above dawn had come for it made a golden fleece one such as never jason handled of the little cirrhus clouds that the gale had forgotten to sweep away dawn would soon strike the beacon too but before that i hoped to stand on its top and see the huge embrace of day and night the melting and absorption of darkness into light even the river with its waving water weeds and aqueous crystal did not detain me and i gave but ten minutes to the ascent for i wanted to welcome the dawn from a high place to stand on the roof of the hills to greet it slowly dawn descended from the sky quivering and palpitating with light the great golden flood came nearer and nearer the earth which as yet caught but the reflection from the radiant heavens it hung a moment hovering the bright winged iridescent bird of dawn just above my head and then the sun leaped up vaulting above the eastern hills the level shafts of light swept across the land a mantle of gold while in the valleys below the clear dusk still lay like tideless waters but down the hill sides strode the day throwing its bright arms about the night enfolding and encompassing it in miraculous embrace and i looked to where home was already the big elms in the garden were pillars of flame then the roof burned and suddenly the windows blazed signal like dawn had come that was not half the miracle light had awoke the hills were gilded with the sun but at the touch of the gilding larks innumerable sprang from the warm tussocks of down grass and aspired a hundred singing specks rose against the sky each infinitesimal so that they seemed but like the little motes that swim across the eyeball but these were living things with open throat that hailed the sunrise perpendicularly they rose wings quivering and throat a tremble with song till the eye lost them against the dazzling azure of day and only enraptured voices from the air made the heavens musical as if the morning stars sang together heaven made holiday its company of sweet singers and the gold of sunrise were one thing the dawn dear god dear god how i thank you for that indestructible minute i knew now what the sunlit curtain that lay between the future and me was and the very morning after i had known you let me see from this high place the birth of day in this physical world there was reproduced that golden sunlit curtain you made visible to me what my heart knew and to me on the top of the beacon the windows of my home flashed a beacon to me and all was of your making the sun and the mounting skylarks and down below the trees of the garden and the beaconing flushing window of my beloved and the fruit of the womb when i come to die i want to remember all that truth and life were there and the way also and what is the sum of those three things yet was i content even then good heavens no there were many beautiful things yet to be and the glory of his gifts just lies in this that there is always something better to come this great bran pie of the earth never gives to our little groping hands its best present there is always something more your hearts desire is given you but at the moment of giving your heart is enlarged and you ask for something better yet and if you want it enough you get it the only difficulty is to want enough for you are not given so i take it things that you have not really desired all sorts of bonuses come in pleasant surprises but the solid dividend is for the man who wills there are fluctuations of course but to look upwards without doubt is a gilt edged affair i correct that the edge is gilt and so is the rest of it and the gilt is laid over gold it was thus that i looked from the top of the beacon with the mist of the song of the invisible skylarks all round and the blazing reflection of the windows of our room in the valley and there among the skylarks it seemed that legs joined me it was of no use to deny he was there simply because it was silly to deny it there is a french word revenant to express his presence but even the solidity of that word failed to do justice he had never gone away and so he could never have come back he was with us all the time and rejoiced in the arrangement of the nursery even as he had been so hopelessly amused at the correctness of mr holmes on the morning of his funeral and at the moment of this i expected the open vision life and death and birth the three great facts were so near realization again i expected to see pan peep over the brow of the beacon and to hear a flute like song that was not of skylarks i was ready dear god i was ready so i thought for the moment but before the next had beaten i knew i was not i wanted more more of this divine world more of what the next few months will bring should all be well when summer comes i think i would choose to die now and the moment i thought that i knew its unreality i want to live through the beautiful years that will come i want to have a son at eton or a daughter who turns the heads of eligible youths i want both and more than both die who talked of that i want to have a full nursery i want to see helen old and grey headed with grandchildren round her and herself the youngest of them all i want to live through the whole of this beautiful life till old age and though that is called the winter of life there is no need that it should be so the last day of a man of eighty should be the most luxuriant of autumn before the touch of winter has blackened the flowers for it is only the thought of death that makes us think of old age and winter together and the thought that does that conceives falsely of death so anyhow it seemed to me on this midsummer morning of march i knew that all that was was kind pan smiled without cruelty and if he smiled from the cross it was from the throne of ineffable light that he smiled also one by one the skylarks sated with song dropped down again to the sunlit down dawn had passed and day had come and oh bathos of bathos i was so hungry if i had given but ten minutes to the ascent i made but five of the reversed journey and designed an early breakfast to make existence possible till helen came down for it was yet not long after seven and a sahara of starvation lay between me and bacon yet though i have said that this was bathos i do not know that i really think so since in this delightful muddle of life everything is so inextricably intertwined that bathos of some kind invariably is the sequel of all high adventure the great scene is played the sublime thing said and then you have tea or take a ticket for somewhere so i confess only to literary bathos and to disarm the critic i may state that these quiet chronicles are not supposed to be literary at all but merely the plain account of quiet things as they happened so i lingered for a moment after the knee shaking descent was over to talk for a little but not for long with the river there was a great trout just below the bridge and i am sure he knew it was still march for he wagged his impudent head at me saying i am perfectly safe i shall eat steadily till april and then observe your silly flies with a contemptuous eye and though he was a three pounder at least i bore him no grudge i dont think i wanted to kill anything that morning then i crossed the further field and came down into the rose garden still meditating on the immediate assuagement of hunger but then i saw who stood there and i meditated on this no more for she was there i got up early she said and found you had already gone oh good morning i forgot i shall never forget the goodness of this morning said i then i saw that her eyes were brimming ought i to have told you before she said forgive me if i ought in that first hour of day we came closer to each other than ever before my beloved was mine and the time of the singing birds had come april i must remind the indulgent reader lest helen and i should appear tediously opulent that our swiss trip in the winter was due to a windfall of a hundred pounds a thing which may conceivably happen to anybody and in this instance happened to us consequently the fact that we went abroad again in april does not if it is considered fairly argue aggressive riches in any case refuse to stoop to degrading justifications we did not go because it was good for our healths which were both excellent nor because foreign travel improves and expands the mind as a matter of fact i do not believe it does for the majority of travellers are always comparing the foreign scenes they visit with spots in their native land vastly to the advantage of the latter and the farther and more frequently they go the more deep rooted becomes their insularity we went merely because we enjoyed it and had formed a careful plan of retrenchment afterwards being about to let the sloane street house for the three summer months that was rather a severe decision to come to since we both hate the idea of strangers using our things and sleeping in our beds but by these means this expedition to greece became possible and when once it was possible it had already become necessary so here we sat this morning on the steps of the little temple of wingless victory wingless as the old sunlit myth said because when the nymph lighted on the sacred rock of the acropolis she stripped off her wings which were henceforward useless to her since she would abide here for ever just below the great house of defence that the athenians had raised to the wisdom of god athene who was born full grown and in panoply of shield and helmet and spear from the head of zeus out of his head she sprang in painless birth with a cry that was heard by echo on hymettus and rang back in echos voice across the plain the shout of the wisdom of god incarnate and then poseidon the lord of the sea who coveted these fair attic plains challenged athene for the ownership thereof each must produce a sign of godhead and the most excellent should win for its manifestor all the plain of attica there high on the rock where the great birth had taken place were the lists set and with his trident poseidon struck the mountain top and from the dent there flowed a stream of the salt sea which was his kingdom and then the grey eyed goddess of wisdom laid aside her spear and from the waving of her white hands there sprang an olive tree the sign of peace and of plenty so poseidon went down to his realm again where no man may gather the harvest for none could question which was the more excellent sign it was after this after the athenians had raised the great house to the wisdom of god that wingless victory came to abide here it was not fit for all her greatness to build her a house on the ground that had been given to athene so just outside the gates they made this platform of stone and raised on it the shrine that looks towards salamis fables so beautiful that they needed no further evidence of their truth sprang from ancient greece as flowers from a fruitful field whether they were true or not whether that peerless womans form that stands now in stone in the louvre alighting with rush of windy draperies on the ships prow ever was seen here by mortal eye or whether the myth but grew from the brain of this wonderful people matters not at all beauty according to their creed was one with truth just as ugliness was falsehood they denied ugliness they would have none of it and it was from the practice of that conviction that there rose the flawless city of art never so we must believe during that wonderful century and a half when from the ground maybe of the lifeless hieratic egyptian art there shot up that transcendent flower of loveliness of which even the fragments that remain to us now battered and disfigured as they are are in another zone of beauty compared to all that went before or has come afterwards was anything ugly produced at all except as deliberate caricature it was no renaissance it was naissance itself the birth of the beautiful on every side shot out the rays of the miraculous many coloured star from the marble of pentelicus flowed that torrent of statues which make all others look coarse and unlovely for the speed of the greek eye was such that they saw attitudes which pass before we of slower vision have perceived them sometimes they saw things that were in themselves ungraceful but how pheidias must have laughed with glee when among the seventy horses of the great procession on the frieze he put in one that cantering stood upon one leg while the other three were bunched underneath it taken by itself it is a grotesque taken with the others it gives to the jubilant procession of youths and horses the one perfect touch more than two thousand years ago a greek saw that two thousand years later we with our focal planes in photography can say he was right in all arts the greeks were right they cut through the onyx of the sardonyx leaving the lucent image in the sard in the less eternal clay they made the statuettes of tanagra those sketches of attitudes so natural and momentary that looking we can scarcely believe that they do not move where a woman has already made up her mind to take a step forward but has just not taken it where she is in act of throwing the knuckle bones but has yet not thrown them where a boy has determined to push back his chiton for the day is hot but has just not made the movement you cannot hope to understand the greek genius unless you realize that our eyes are snails as compared with theirs they saw with the naked eye what our instantaneous photograph now tells us is the case and of their paintings we have none left and theres the pity of it which even reflect the greek master at his best but corresponding to our english paintings on china we have the greek vases of the fourth and fifth centuries they were made by journeymen in potters shops but there is not one that lacks the supremacy of knowledge and observation it is as if a china shop in the seven dials suddenly displayed in its window examples of the nude figure which showed a perfect knowledge not only of anatomy but of the romance of movement the sculptors and painters of greece saw perfectly even our academicians themselves appear to us to be not flawless but in greece we are not dealing with these great lords of colour and drawing we deal only as far as drawing goes with little people in back streets the noble church of st paul in the city of london which so few people visit was lately decorated at this moment i look on a sketch of a fragment of pottery it is by one like whom there were thousands it happens to be perfect in draughtsmanship to think of one day in ancient athens in the morning i went up i feel as if i must have done this to see the new statue of athene promachos which pheidias had just finished we knew little then about his work except that he had been chosen to decorate the parthenon and those who had seen his sketches for the frieze which we can see now in the british museum said that they were not bad so after breakfast my friend and i strolled towards the acropolis talking as athenians talked of some new thing in fact we talked of several new things and being athenians we got quite hot about them since we had being athenians that keenness of soul that never says i dont care about that or i take no interest in this everything was intensely interesting it was a hot morning and the plane trees by the ilyssus looked attractive and there was a company of people there whose talk might be stimulating but to day we were too busy we had to see the athene promachos a bronze statue by pheidias forty feet high and after lunch lunch was going to be rather grand because a new play was coming out and pericles was going to be there and perhaps aspasia we were going to schyluss new tragedy called the agamemnon and my friend who was alcibiades was giving a supper party in the evening socrates was coming and a man who was really very pleasant only he listened and made notes but seldom talked his name was plato alcibiades was rather profane sometimes and spoke of the great gods as if he did not really believe in them i knowing him so well knew that he did and that it was only his puck like spirit which made him in talk make light of what he believed all up the steps of the propyla he was though amusing rather profane and then we came through the central gate which was yet unfinished and straight in front of us was the statue and some jest i know not what died on my friends lips and his great grey eyes suddenly became dim with tears at the sight of beauty and his mouth quivered as he said mighty lady athene my goddess and with that he knelt down on the rock in front of where she stood and prayed to the wisdom of god he refused to go to the grand lunch after this and insisted on our remaining up here till it was time to get to the theatre quoting something that socrates had said about the cleansing power of beauty so we will not soil ourselves just yet quoth he with the intrigues we should hear about at lunch but go straight from here to the theatre so we bought from a peasant some cheese wrapped up in a vine leaf and a bottle of wine and a loaf of bread and some grapes and then went down the rock to the theatre and still that divine vision had possession of alcibiades for he paid no attention to the greeting of his friends and bade them be silent and soon the actors were come and the watchman went up to the tower and looked east and saw the beacons leap across the land to show that the ten year siege was over and that troy had fallen then slowly began to be unfolded the tale of the stupendous tragedy home came agamemnon with his captive the princess cassandra riding behind him in his chariot of triumph clytemnestra his wife met him at the palace door and with feigned obeisance and lying words of love welcomed him in leaving cassandra outside then there descended on the princess the spirit of prophecy and in wild words she shrieked out the doom that was coming quickly it came from within we heard the death cry of the king and the palace doors swung open and out came the queen fondling the axe with which she had slain him the doom of the gods was accomplished then afterwards we went round to the green room and found schylus there and alcibiades in his impulsive way i tell him he has the feelings of a woman must kneel and kiss the hand that wrote this wonderful play socrates was there too putting absurd questions to everybody about the difference between the muse of tragedy and the muse of comedy as if anybody cared so long as schylus wrote plays like that however he got plato to listen to him and soon made him contradict himself which is what socrates chiefly cares about pericles came in too with aspasia to whom he kindly introduced me certainly she is extraordinarily beautiful and has great wit but she called attention to her physical charms too much which is silly since they are quite capable of calling attention to themselves afterwards since only alcibiades and i had seen the wonderful statue we all strolled up to the acropolis again to look at it and the sunset socrates came too and after we had examined and admired the bronze goddess again we went and sat on the steps of the temple of athene he tried his usual game of asking us questions till we contradicted ourselves but before long all of us refused to answer him any more saying that we were aware that we were totally ignorant of everything and that there was no longer any need for him to prove it to us and then exactly how it arose i dont know but i think it was from the questions and answers that had already passed he began to weave us the most wonderful fable showing us how all that we thought beautiful here on earth was but the reflection the pale copy of the beauty which was eternal round the outer rim of the earth and the stars he said ran the living stream of a great river which indeed was heaven and everything that we thought beautiful here had its archetype there and all day and all night the gods drove round and round on this river of beauty in their chariots it was our business then here on earth to look for beauty everywhere and never falter in the quest of it for so we prepared ourselves for the sight of that of which these things were but the shadow so that the greater would be the initiation which would be ours after death more especially we must seek for the beauty of spiritual things which was the real beauty and so order our bodies our words and actions that they were all in tune with it with the beauty of prudence and temperance and kindness and wisdom for it was of these that heaven itself and the living stream was composed and these shone from the eyes of the immortal gods so there is my prayer said he rising and stretching out his hands to the great statue while we all rose with him o athene give me inward beauty of soul and let the inward and the outward man be at one so the sun set but on the violet crown of athens the hills there hymettus pentelicus and parnes the light still lingered and shone like the river of beauty socrates had told us about till it faded also from the tops and above the deep night was starry kirtled helen is the most delightful person in the world to tell stories to however lamely you tell them she is absorbed in them and never asks about the weak points as other children do she might for instance have asked if i was correct about my dates did the agamemnon come out in the year that the promachos was made instead and who was i she asked dont tell me i was aspasia because i dont like what you told me about her no you were not aspasia i said rather hurriedly and i rather think you had had your turn in greece at some other time i didnt know you then except perhaps in the myths for i am not sure that you were not electra was she nice asked helen she was very nice to orestes oh dont who was orestes what a nice name you were his sister thats all about mythology just now the plain quivered under the sunlit haze of blue to the south the dim sea was in tone like two skies poured together and the isles of greece floated in it like swimmers asleep below to the left lay the theatre where i had seen the agamemnon empty but ready as if the play was just going to begin who knew what ghosts of those supreme actors were there what audience of the bright eyed greeks followed the drama and above us stood the presiding genius of athens the beautiful house built for the virgin who sprang from the brain of god a little more and it would be her birthday again and we should hear the sound of horse hoofs coming up the hill and see the procession of the athenian youths and the men with the bulls for sacrifice and the wine carriers and the incense bearer and the priests of the great goddess another company would be there too the hierarchy of olympus come down on athenes birthday to visit her in her beautiful home with zeus would be the mother of the gods and aphrodite would be there the spirit of love that renews the earth and apollo who makes it bright with sunshine and demeter the mother of the cornfields and persephone radiant and returned from the gate of death and hermes the swift messenger whose feet were winged and iris who was rainbow the sign of the beneficent seasons and though we saw them not there was not one missing love was here and below were the ripening cornfields on which the sun shone and beyond was the realm of poseidon and a squall of spring rain that passed like a curtain in front of hymettus showed us iris then it was time to go down townwards again for the morning was passed but helen paused at the doorway at the gate of the acropolis and looked towards the temple best of all i like socrates prayer she said and i must say it to myself spring had been rather late this year and a week ago when we drove out to the foot of pentelicus to have a country ramble the rubbish of last years autumn was still in evidence then the spring began to stir and two days ago when we had gone out again all the anemones except one kind were in full flower they are heralds those mauve and violet and pink and white chalices of blossom to tell us that the great procession of primavera has begun but last of all come the trumpeters the scarlet anemones and if the sun has been warm and no north wind has delayed the procession they blow their blasts over the land just two days after the heralds have appeared so to day after lunch we went out to hear the trumpeters to morrow we shall see primavera herself spring herself the goddess primavera was very near to day for on thicket and brake and over the flank of the hill side her trumpeters were blowing their shrill blasts of scarlet two days before the land was sober coloured now wherever you looked the wonderful anemone last to flower stood high with full blown petals the movement and stir of the new life was hurrying to its climax to morrow instead of the myriad buds of the cistus and the pale stalks of orchid the flowers would be unfurled at the final touch of the spring at the advent of the goddess herself to day a myriad folded bells hung from the great bushes of southern heath like stars still cloaked in mist to morrow with one night more of warm wind and a morning of sun they would blaze and peal together for it is thus in this wonderful southern land that spring comes a few heralds go before and then the army of trumpeters after this she crosses the plain with the ardour of hot blood so that all flowers blossom together and every bud and beast goes suddenly a mating here there is none of our limitative february our pinched hopes of march all is quiet till the heralding of the anemones and the trumpets of their scarlet brethren then in full panoply of blossom primavera and summer too are there together for a week or two the land is aflame with flower and then already the maturing of fruit trees has begun northerners though we are both helen and i claimed some strain of southern blood in the ecstasy of those days that for which we wait and watch for patient weeks in the shy approach of spring in england was here done with a flame and a shout there was no hesitancy or delay no weak snowdrop said that winter was coming to an end weeks before spring came to die before the crocuses endorsed its message here all was asleep together till all woke together ten days ago there was no hint of spring save in the strong sunshine the wilderness of winter still spread its icy hands then faster than the melting of the snow on the top of parnes came the heralds in the wilderness and spring was there it was like the winter of kundrys soul to whom one morning gurnemanz said auf der winter floh und lenz ist da and on that day came parsifal and her redemption and the ransomed of the lord returned with joy and singing i have no skill to tell of those days for the past all that i knew of the history of this wonderful land and the present all that love meant and the future the dear event that was coming closer were so inextricably mingled that no coherence is possible but if you love a place and are there with your beloved and know that she will bear a child to you before many weeks are over you may make a paradise of clapham junction and find the joy of it a thing incommunicable and how much more difficult a material is the magic of this land to work in this little attic plain peopled with the ghosts of that wonderful age which are not dead at all but instinct with life to day at this moment when spring has come so forcibly that even the slow tortoises on the side of pentelicus hurried breathlessly about with deep sighs i assure you till they found a congenial lady then they ran positively ran round her in ever narrowing circles still sighing there were grasshoppers too green gentlemen and brown ladies the brown ladies genteelly ran away but they never ran far the great hawks sought each other in the sublime sky and the young men and maidens of athens as we drove back were taking discreet walks together into the country and from the acropolis the maiden goddess who is the wisdom of god looked down and was well pleased for thank heaven the wisdom of god in no prude to all has it given a soul and to all souls is desire of some sort given to one the perfection of form to another the perfection of wit to another the perfection of colour to another the perfection of truth for each there is a way each has got to follow it and for many there are various ways and these many must follow them all if a thing is lovely and of good report we all have to hunt it home it is no excuse to say you have no time for you have all the time there is search search there is the way everywhere indeed this is no mystical affair it is the plainest sense whatever happens god is somehow revealed but being blind we cannot always see the revelation to night as helen and i sit on deck of the steamer that takes us back again to marseilles we wonder what gives greece its inalienable magic we saw the fading of its shores in the dusk and though the phosphorescence of the sea was a thing to marvel at it was no longer the phosphorescence of greek waters that little fig leaf fingered land has sentiment somehow in its soil it cannot fail to move anybody its history since the great age it is no use to deny it has been tawdry beyond description it yielded to the romans it scarcely resisted the albanians and though some flickering spirit of its old grandeur flamed again when its people rose against the turkish rule in the early part of last century what are we to say of the spirit of the people when twelve years ago they again fought their ancient and ancestral enemy the turks strolled slowly southwards from the north of thessaly and only the intervention of the powers prevented greece again becoming a turkish province the hellenic battle cry went shrilly up to heaven but the hellenic army trotted like a flock of sheep before the foe until the powers said that the war must cease only the year before there had been revival of the olympic games and there had been a race from marathon to athens in memory of pheidippides who bore the news of that stupendous victory and died as he reached athens saying greece has conquered the persians a greek won that peaceful race from marathon the same greek won the peaceful race home and arrived back in attica in the very van and forefront of the retreating army the host of hares was the turkish name for the foes they never had occasion to meet who started from their fortresses like hares from their forms and galloped quietly away meantime the greek fleet cruised in the adriatic and sank a fishing boat when the war was over they came home with the spoils of their victory a hat a fish a net perhaps it is best to say that there was no war at all the turkish armies made peaceful manuvres over thessaly until they came to volo then the powers of europe said we think your manuvres have extended far enough kindly go home yet somehow the tragic futility of all this does not really touch greece or the sentiment that the lovers of the lovely land feel for it supposing a greek army or a regiment of it had met the turk and died in the cause of patriotism that could not have added to the compelling charm of greece and so the fact that none of these patriotic events happened does not diminish it in greece whatever may be done or left undone you are in the country where once beauty shot up like the aloe flower so that all else is inconsiderable beside that since whatever the world has achieved afterwards whether in painting or sculpture or drama or poetry or in that eagerness of life which is the true romance of existence is measured if only it be fine enough by the standard set then that is the haunting imperishable charm of this country and missing that even the phosphorescence of waters by night divided by the swift keel of the lonely ship was for a time a soulless firework the magic of it the magic of it thereafter we staggered across the adriatic over the ridge and furrow of a grey and unquiet sea till we found quiet below the heel of italy soon to the south west the horizon lay in skeins of smoke and it was not for hours afterward that the cone of etna uprearing itself showed whence the trouble came narrower grew the straits till we passed out beside messina and for the pillar of smoke which etna had raised all day we sighted stromboli a pillar of fire by night next morning we were in the narrows between corsica and sardinia and saw the little villages tiny and toy like in the island whence sprang the brain that was to light all europe with the devouring flame of its burning if the dead return i think it is not in elba of st helena nor even in the pomp of paris nor on the battle field that we must guess that napoleon wanders he sees the impotence of his destructive and untiring genius the lines of his new map of europe have been gently defaced again by time and he sits quiet enough by the little house where still the descendants of his old nurse dwell and sees the innocent campaigning of her grandchildren in their childish games and when the time comes for unflinching justice to be done to that unflinching spirit who spared none nor had pity so long as by any sacrifice the realization of his ruthless imaginings came true will not the spirit of his old nurse stand advocate and remind justice that even in the midst of his gigantic schemes he remembered her who had given him suck and provided for her maintenance somewhere in that iron soul was the soft touch of childish days he was kind who was so terrible and that pen so unfacile and so bungling that he hated to write at all put a little paragraph of scarcely decipherable words to his will that showed what would otherwise have been incredible how a certain gentleness of heart underlay the iron though all these sights the chimney of etna the furnace of stromboli the island of napoleon were but milestones passed before to show us now how far we were travelling from the magic land yet each brought us nearer in time and space to the magic of home and of the day yet unnamed which must already like some peak of an unknown range be beginning to rear itself up in the foreground of the future then as the magnet of greece grew more remote the magnet of home gained potentiality until there was no question which was the stronger we had intended that is to say more than half intended to stay a day or two in paris instead we fled through paris as if it had been a spot plague ridden meaning to pass the night in london but even as we scurried from gare de lyon to gare du nord so too we scurried from victoria to waterloo with intention now fully declared to get down to the dear home without pause as far as i remember we sustained life on thick brown tea and a sahara of currant cake but at the end there was the snorting motor waiting at the station and a mile of sleeping streets cheered by the vision of mr holmes going somewhere in a neat inverness cape and buttoned boots a mile of spring scented country road and then the little house discreet behind its shrubbery where was the rose garden among other things and among other things the nursery the night was very warm and lit by the full moon of april so after we had dined and run like two children from room to room in the house first to greet all the precious things of home with fifi like an animated corkscrew performing prodigies of circular locomotion round us we found that there was still a large part of home to greet and so went out into the garden to see what april had brought forth there no sudden riot or conflagration of leaf and flower like that which we had seen blaze over the lower slopes of pentelicus was there but april day by day had done his gentle work so that where we had left a bed still winter naked it was now mapped out into the claims of the plants to morrow there would be disputes to be settled for the day lily had pegged out more than her share and between her and the iris a delphinium would be crowded out of existence but every plant such is our rule may claim all the ground it can get until the end of april then come round the judges of the court of appeal and if any plant distinctly says i have not room to grow because of these encroachers his appeal if he promises at all well is usually upheld and the encroacher is shorn of his unreasonable encroachments even by the moonlight it was quite certain that the court of appeal had a heavy day in front of it there were lawsuits regarding land to settle which would require most careful adjustment for the court hates depriving a rightful possessor of that which his vigor has appropriated on the other hand the slender aristocracy of the bed for the aristocrat grows upwards rather than sideways must not be elbowed out of existence one plant only is allowed to do exactly what it pleases and when it pleases the pansy which is for thoughts that are always sweet and so may roam unchecked and welcome for who would set limits to the wanderings of so kindly and humble a soul it but touches the ground too to be absolutely honest i must confess that this has something to do with the liberties we give it as a moth still hovering and on the wing draws from the flower the sustenance it needs it does not so to speak sit down to make a square meal or burrow with searching roots deep into the earth and drain it of all its treasure but it is ever on the move like some bright eyed beggar girl to whom none but the churlish would grudge the wayside halfpenny she will not linger and settle and sponge on your bounty but be off again elsewhere next moment just turning to you a smiling face and whispering a murmured thanks in the bright language of flowers so she is privileged to wander even in the sacred territory of the roses where i hope she has already wandered wide there however we did not penetrate to night for it and the meadow we kept for the morrow but on the top margin of the field against the sky i saw shapes that were unmistakable to morrow our hearts will go dancing with the daffodils but to night we are content with the thoughts that the pansies have given us and can even forgive milton for speaking of them as freaked with jet freaked with jet when ophelia had said that they were for thoughts but then milton speaks of the well attired woodbine which is almost as bad imagine looking at pansies and finding it incumbent on one to say i perceive they are freaked with jet but as one who had the highest appreciation of milton remarked to appreciate milton is the reward of consummate scholarship which was certainly a very pleasant reflection for himself and perhaps if i were a better scholar i should think with appreciation of the pansy freaked with jet as it is i merely conclude that milton was flower blind a sad affliction helen is absolutely ultra japanese in her observance of the flower festivals of which she marks some dozen of red letter days in the year they cannot of course be celebrated on any fixed day since owing to the vagaries of climate there might not be a single lily to be seen for instance this year on the actual day which was lily day a year ago she waits instead like the japanese until the particular flower is in the zenith of its blossoming and then proclaims the festival other flowers naturally sometimes are at their best on the red letter day of another but this as she observes is canonically correct since st simon and st jude and st philip and st james are celebrated together i was not therefore the least surprised next morning when after a short excursion to the garden she came in to breakfast saying it is daffodil day and the day of its sisters of the spring but we had the sisters of the spring in greece said i yes that is the advantage of going to greece the greek calendar is different to ours we had easter day before we started and another easter day when we got there besides it was anemone day and the day of its sisters of the spring the anemones sisters were not the same as the daffodils this was convincing even if i needed conviction which i did not and daffodil day it was after the early heats of february the year had had a long set back in march and though april was nearly over i doubt whether there had been any more gorgeous decoration in our absence than that which we found waiting this morning in the church of the daffodils and its sisters of the spring it was not in vain that we had dug and delved last autumn with such strenuous patience for that half acre of field beside the rose garden was a thing to make the blind see a rainbow of blossom lay over it all the early tulips had opened their great chalices of gold and damask the blue mist of forget me nots seemed as if a piece of the sky had fallen and lay mutely under the trees brown speckled fritillaries crouched shyly in the grass and their white belled sister nestled beside them narcissus was there all yellow and narcissus with the eye of the pheasant primroses still lingered waiting for helens proclamation to take part in the festival while some bluebells had hurried to be here in time crocuses in the grass were like the dancing of the sun on green waters or purple as the deep sea caves and anemones greedy for more festivals had hurried overland from greece to be here before us and clumps of iris were like banners carried in procession these were the sisters of the spring it was their day but first it was daffodil day slender and single tall and yellow it was as if through the web of them the golden net that they had laid over the field that you perceived their sisters and the sun shone on them and the great blue sky was over them and the warm wind made them dance together after a long time helen spoke oh oh she said that about expressed it my heart with pleasure fills she added may it always seems to me a matter for wonder why the astronomers or julius csar or whoever it was who took the trouble to divide time up into months and years should have made the day of the new year come in the middle of winter probably it has got something to do with the solar eclipse or the lunar theory or movements and motions quite unintelligible to the ordinary mind which would easily have the point of beginning the new year in spring for instance on may day when the season is clearly suitable for beginning again but to make a fresh start by candlelight in a fog on the first of january implies a more vivid effort of the imagination and a sterner resolve of the spirit than most of us able to manage you might as well try to make up for misspent years by selecting blackfriars or baker street station as a place to start afresh in personally though i think the st of may would be a quite reasonable occasion on which to begin a new year i should prefer a rather later date when summer is more certain and it was for this reason that when i formed this i hope harmless little project of putting down the quiet happenings of a year of life i began in june month by month i kept this diary and you will see when you come to the end of this month of may that my plan was endorsed by what happened then and that new year must in the future always begin for helen and me on the first of june even with the early days of may summer descended on us and mr holmess panama hat and a neat new suit of yellowish flannel made their due appearance to confirm the fact soon if this goes on he will be handing ices instead of buns at tea parties and i have often seen him lately on the ladies links playing golf in his little buttoned boots he came to call yesterday and told me of charlottes engagement and announced the fact that my archdeacon i call him mine because of what happened at that dreadful sunday school was giving a garden party on the th and the wife of the younger son of our baronet had not been invited the fact of the garden party on the th was not new to us because we had been invited oh revenge is sweet and we gloated over the discomfiture of the foe her mother had been a governess too that was a new fact that mr holmes had gathered in the last half year just a governess and not in a noble family even but in the employment of a retired tradesman that accounted for the fact that her daughter spoke french so well no wonder since the mother had to teach it her knowledge of that language scraps of which she constantly introduced into her conversation had always puzzled mr holmes now he knew how it had been acquired indeed she had come rightly by it poor thing we none of us grudged it her and it was no wonder now to mr holmes that she looked so thin probably she had never had enough to eat when she was a child and that indescribable air of commonness about her was perfectly accounted for indeed mr holmes became so sardonic that you would have thought that his family was one as i dare say it is compared to which the plantagenets were parvenus and helen changed the subject which i thought was a pity as i wanted to hear ever so much more about the ladys obscure origin we chatted very pleasantly for a long time and learned all that the morning post had said in little paragraphs during the past week and all that the close and the county i recommend that expression and the military were doing here we were going to be very gay indeed there was already an absolute clash of entertainments during a week of cricket next month so that the mayor was forced to give a luncheon party one day instead of a mere tea which he would probably not like at all since if ever there was a mayor who collected candle ends this was the one did i remember that which was called champagne at the famous lunch which has already been spoken of in fact mr holmes shook his head over the general trend of affairs and spoke quite bitterly about the wave of radicalism which was passing over the country the county club so he said which had always prided itself on being a little exclusive was tainted with commonness now and had positively disgraced itself at the last election by letting in those three new members they were nobodies local nobodies one the son of a doctor another the father of a doctor the third nobody at all and would i believe it there had been a veterinary surgeon up for election as well luckily the club had pulled itself together over him and given him a smart shower of black balls no doubt the club was in want of funds but why then have built a new billiard room how much better to poke the butt end of our cues into the chimney piece as we had always done when playing from over the left hand middle pocket than purchase increased cue room at the sacrifice of our standing as a county club if we did not draw the line somewhere where were we to draw the line that was unanswerable we all said what is written tut and looked very proud helen i consider looked prouder than mr holmes but she disagrees with me having seen her own face in the looking glass over the mantelpiece true she had not the natural advantage that mr holmess aquiline nose conferred upon him but the assumed curl of her lip was superb she looked like a duchess in her own right how slowly these beautiful days of may passed for when one is very happy and very expectant time seems to stop exactly the opposite happens when one is spending days that are full of pleasures and living entirely in the moment for then hours and days pass on unregarded so that it is saturday again before you know the week has really begun but happiness i but bungle with words over a thing that is obvious to everybody who knows the difference between happiness and pleasure is a thing quite detached from the present moment just as the sunlight which floods these downs is not of them happiness ever broods on the wing and swings high above the things of the earth like some poised eagle or like the sun itself it illuminates what it looks on turning dew to diamond and striking sapphires into the heart of what has been a grey sea but it is independent of material concerns and were the world to be withdrawn and extinguished it would shine still true it shines on the dewdrop and turns it into wondrous prismatic colours and thus the common surface of life is always iridescent when we are happy but happiness that golden high swung sun does not i think particularly regard the jewels he makes out of common things his own bright shining perhaps weaves a golden haze between him and what he shines upon it was somehow thus i think that things were with us during that first fortnight of may below the golden haze were these entrancing facts which i have just recorded about the archdeacons party the frightful disclosures concerning the mother of the wife of the younger son of the baronet and the growing plebeianism of the county club but neither helen nor i could focus our attention on them for though as i have said time went so slowly yet there was not time enough to regard them they belonged to a different plane to that on which we were living we could penetrate down into it and giggle but then our attention wandered and before we knew it we had swum up again like bubbles through water to the sunlit surface there took place in fact a revision in our list of joyful and dreadful affairs no one could appreciate the humour of mr holmes more than helen did but as i have said she could not attend to him now nor could she attend to the perfectly hideous fact that the greater part of the ceiling in the dining room in sloane street had fallen and that our tenants had quite reasonably demanded to be released from their tenancy of which there was still six weeks to run since the house was uninhabitable nor did i think she would have cared if the ceiling had smothered them as they sat at dinner and the dreadful earthquake in china failed to move her and so did the church crisis in france but for certain other things she cared more than ever though you would have said they were little enough all the growth of the spring time made her eyes brighten and ever grow dim again and she would dream over the tiny buds of the rose garden with smiles that were sped to her mouth from the inmost spring of happiness she spread fat heliogabalian feasts for the birds since they wanted nourishment now that they were so busy over their nests and many dyspeptic bachelors and spinsters i expect reeled daily from their table laid on the lawn to sleep off the results of their excess she loved the sun too more than she had ever loved it and the shade also and day and night and all the firm great forces of the world not less too did she love the little things of little rooms and now we never sat in the drawing room with its reynolds prints but went always to the nursery with its rocking horse and its noahs ark and its lead soldiers and its play table but when there when playing these silly games of soldiers which helen had been wont to play as if eternal salvation depended on the nice adjustment of a small tin cannon which when you pulled a string shot a pea she had a change of mood most disconcerting at first now and again she shot down my generalissimo posted as he should be out of possibility of attack almost in the very rear of my army by some inconceivable ricochet which would a few weeks ago have filled her mouth with laughter but now when these unspeakable flukes occurred and she upset the heaviest soldiers in my brigade instead of being delighted she was sorry and apologized to injury which was bad enough she added insult which was worse and said i am afraid i must win now there is another curious thing helen looks over my shoulder as i write and agrees that though she still loves to play soldiers she wants me to win consider it whoever before wanted to play a game and the more childish the game the less worth while you would have thought to play it if he did not care about winning besides it is so exceedingly unlike her she is looking over my shoulder no more not to play any game as if life and death depended on it but now she applauds my skill and my luck and apologizes for her own and then when the game is over and the duke of wellington on one side and julius csar on the other lie dead she still sits on the ground beside the low play table and looks round the room with wandering happy eyes there are the playthings i have told you of the noahs ark the rocking horse the great dolls house the front of which windows and door and all is unfastened by a neat latch in the wall of the second story and swings open altogether so that you must be careful not to unlatch it early in the morning or late at night else you would see all the ladies and gentlemen at their toilet in an embarrassing state of undress i found helen the other morning playing at dolls all by herself she had laid a banquet in the dining room and had arranged the ladies and gentlemen on the stairs so that one could see at once that they were going down to dinner from their attitudes and a tendency to lean against each other or the wall you might have thought that they were trying to get upstairs after the banquet but that helen told me was foolish since their faces were all turned in the direction of downstairs the answer was that they had indulged even more freely than i had supposed and were trying to get upstairs backwards yes we did all these extremely childish things and so far from being ashamed of them i set them all down here for you to laugh at if you like or merely to be bored with things like these playing at soldiers or at dolls retained their interest just as did the spirit of the blossoming summer when mr holmess discoveries or the fall of the ceiling in sloane street lacked the calibre to interest us and if you come to think of it though i thought an explanation would be difficult nothing in the world could be more simple things about children and birth and growth were clearly the only affairs that could concern us one morning i remember it was found that the foundations of the cathedral were in a dreadful state and that it would probably fall down i told helen this as she was engaged on preparing a gargantuan breakfast for the birds she only said oh what a pity that was all she cared for the historic norman pile with all kinds of kings and queens buried inside it there is nothing more to be recorded of this month since the only things that seemed to us to have any real importance were just the childishnesses of which i have already given you such amplitude of specimens until the morning of the last day of may the rule of the house was that there was no rule of any sort as regards breakfast anybody who came into the dining room at most hours of the morning would find the breakfast perennials bread butter sugar milk the morning paper and marmalade on the table and would on ringing a bell be given the annuals ie fresh tea and a hot dish similarly anybody who did not come into the dining room was supposed to be breakfasting either elsewhere or not at all so on this last morning of may on coming down i rang the bell and read the paper till bacon came an hour before i had just looked into helens room and seen that she was still asleep the bacon was rather long coming that morning i try to reconstruct the day exactly as it happened and i had already skimmed the news and found there was not any and in default of it was reading a superb account of the visit of a member of the royal family to naples who in the afternoon had honoured so said the loyal press the volcano of vesuvius with a visit how gratifying for the immortal principle of fire one hoped it would not become swollen in the head this fortunate volcano whose cone had been blessed at the moment i heard a step outside it was not from the kitchen it was coming from upstairs and it came very quickly then instantaneously terror seized me for time and place were no longer now and here but it was the evening when i heard my name called in the garden and thereafter heard legs running downstairs and quickly as the steps came they seemed to me to go on for ever yet i had only just time to get up when there came a fumbling hand on the door and helens maid came in if you please sir would you send at once she began the nurse there were quicker ways than sending and next minute i was flying up the road on my bicycle my mind as i think must always happen with any mind in such moments seemed curiously inactive though somewhere there was inside me a little bit of tissue so to speak that agonized and hoped and prayed but for the most i only thought of one thing that once before i had gone on just the same errand from this same house up the same road to fetch the doctor for her my dearest friend o margery i go quickly to god and tell him we want him and then the tissue that agonized and prayed sank out of sight again and i was just speeding up the sunny dusty road on which as i got nearer the town the traffic became denser once a butchers cart pulled suddenly out into the middle of the road in front of me and i thought collision was inevitable except that i knew that it was not possible that i should be stopped when going on such an errand as this and several times i passed people i knew yet though i knew them their faces were meaningless they conveyed names but nothing whatever more and then whether very soon or countless ages later i had no idea i was at the doctors door in the quiet decorous street which also was meaningless neither strange nor familiar but purely without significance everything i saw was detached nothing had any relation to life except just one thing his dog cart which was at the door concerned me he had not yet started on his rounds and it was not five minutes before he was ready he had only to pick up a little bag into which he put a case of some kind and something bright that i turned my eyes from and a bottle which he wrapped up it seemed to me very neatly and slowly which clinked against that which was already in the bag then he turned to me now if you take my advice he said you wont come back with me but will go for a ride on this beautiful morning you will not see your wife and for the next hour or so it is not possible that i should have anything to tell you we dont want you in the house we dont want to be bothered with you he got briskly into his dog cart nodded to me over his shoulder and instead of driving himself gave his servant the reins i know i shouted something after him telling him i think to be careful and so found myself on the doorstep looking at a bicycle which was leaning against the pillar of the porch and was evidently not mine but like the dog cart it was not meaningless for it was helens which i must have used by mistake i must take it back it was careless of me then his advice occurred to me but it sounded ridiculous as senseless as some nursery rhyme and at the thought there suddenly started in my head the first two lines of humpty dumpty i could not remember the last two lines but the first went round and round in my brain keeping time to my pedalling soon after i was home again only a moment behind him for he was just getting out when i came to the gate and i waited till he had gone in so that he should not know i had failed to follow his advice at least i believe that was the reason but i am not sure i went round by the back way into the garden and sat down in the veranda outside my own room where fifi was lying in the sun but i had to coax her silently indoors for i could not bear that she should lie there lest suddenly she should again look out into the garden and howl at something she saw there she would not come in at first and once she pricked her ears at something she saw outside and i stopped mine lest i should hear her howl and all the time humpty dumpty the first two lines of it went on and on it was so terribly lonely too just that silly rhyme and i all alone if only legs were here or anybody anybody you see this was not expected to day nor for weeks yet my mother was coming to stay with us next week until then i heard the muffled sound of steps in the room just above my head helens room and at that for a little the babble and confusion of my troubled brain cleared and humpty dumpty ceased and i was not afraid of fifi howling for there was no room for anything except the thought of helen who lay there and of the life yet unborn and i could not help i could not bear any of it for her i could not even be with her birth was as lonely as death outside the garden lay basking in the heat of the early summer and everywhere the expansion of life which had seemed to us so wonderful and glorious a thing through all these weeks of may suddenly became sinister and menacing what travail may not go to the opening of a single flower or the maturing of its casket of seeds it would all be of a piece with the cruelty and the anguish that runs through life like a scarlet bleeding thread beginning as now even before birth and not even ending with death since those who remain have the wound of that yet to be healed right through life goes the scarlet thread knotted on the farther side at each end so that it shall not slip and humpty dumpty sat on a wall ah yes i had it all now the kings horses was what i could not remember and at that the crowd of trivialities again came between my mind and me we had set up the croquet hoops again only last week and had argued over the position of that particular corner one by which my ball had rested when last autumn a telegram had been brought me from the house helen had said it was square with the corresponding corner i knew it was not and from here it was perfectly easy to see that she had been wrong i hate an awry disposition of hoops all the kings horses they really should bring these rhymes up to date it ought to be motor cars instead of horses these things passed very slowly through my mind for it acted as if it was numbed and half paralyzed and the croquet hoop occupied the foreground of it for a considerable time i had let fifi out again and she was racing about the lawn in the attempt to catch swallows a feat of which she never realized the unreasonableness and i had left the doors into my room both from the hall and from here outside open and then with the same rapidity as they had come all these nonsense things passed away again for i heard steps on the stairs and going in saw the doctor standing on the landing above talking in low tones to the nurse he saw me made a little movement of his hand as if to detain me and when he had finished what he had to say to her came downstairs i will have a word with you he said gravely and we went into my room i saw him looking at me rather curiously and was wondering why when he suddenly seemed to lean up against me then i perceived that it was i who was swaying on my feet he put me in a chair i suppose you have not had breakfast he said you are to eat something immediately i will ring the bell and now listen it is going to be difficult and i am afraid dangerous and it is better that you should know it now and then the dear kind man just laid his hand on my arm im awfully sorry he said you cant think how i hate to tell you this i hope it will be all right there is nothing yet that forbids me to hope that please god we shall pull her through but well well he broke off as the door opened and a servant came in just bring a tray in here he said tea yes tea and an egg and a couple of bits of toast thank you remember i still hope it will be all right he said and even if well you are both young still now i shall be back here in an hour at the outside you are not going i said you mustnt yes yes i know what you feel he said but there is nothing for me to do here yet and i have to make arrangements so that i can come back and remain here till all is satisfactory you dont stir from this house i said do you think i should go if there was the slightest possibility of your wife needing me he said quietly no i beg your pardon thats all right now when your breakfast comes eat it and read a book if you can or go and garden i am sure those roses of yours want looking after and i tell you its a hard thing for a man in your position and a thing which we doctors respect to go and occupy himself if you cant you cant but you might have a try the servant brought in a tray before many minutes and with it the morning paper when i had eaten i took it up and looked at it there was no news but the middle page contained an account of a visit to vesuvius by an english prince he honoured the volcano with a visit and then i knew that i had seen the paper before but when years and years ago or this morning what the doctor had said to me needed no time or thought for realizing it i felt as if i had known it all along known it all my life but what happened next if that all happened long ago was the room overhead the chamber of death or the chamber of birth next door to it was the nursery with its noahs ark and its soldiers and its rocking horse who going to ride on that and the dolls house with its tottering inhabitants who next was to play with those and open the wall oh helen helen you and your child will it be or will it be you and i again but after a long time hoping once more or dear god no not that daffodil day and its sisters of the spring and rose day will come next month roses heaped for the beloveds bed dear god not that it does not mean that bed indeed indeed it does not you have so many souls already in your house of many mansions give us a few more years together for they are so sweet and a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday and we should so like a young thing one of our own in the house but thank you very much for the years that have been so sweet they have been they have been and please dont let her suffer or be frightened then i went across the lawn and into the rose garden though we had been very industrious there i never saw yet the rose tree on which there is nothing to be done and for a little my hands made themselves busy then quite suddenly it all became impossible and there was nothing in the world except what the doctor had told me and floating on the top of that humpty dumpty humpty dumpty so it was within the hour that i got back again to the house and the doctor had not yet returned i missed something familiar on the lawn without at once knowing what it was and then i saw that the birds breakfast was not there that took me to the dining room where i found lunch was already laid and with bread crumb and little bits of cheese and cold meat mixed i made a plateful for them though as you know it was the last day of may and i suppose it was but pauperism among the thrushes that i encouraged but helen all these days had done so i knew she would not like them to miss their provision soon after so soon that the news of their belated meal had not yet become public among the birds the doctor returned i heard him go upstairs and after that i crept into the hall and sat down on the lowest step of the seventeen that led to the landing legs used to jump down them in two bounds taking eight steps first and then nine and get up with a run in three two sixes and a five what am i maundering about and before very long i must have been sitting higher up the stairs for i could see out of the window on the staircase the dog cart had drawn away from the door into the shade and the groom had got down and was gently stroking the mares nose then he laid his smooth young cheek against it and she stood quite still liking it i expect he is kind to her the sun had swung round farther to the west and it came in through the window but now i was nearly at the top of the stairs there were but three above where i sat the house was very still below me on the ground floor there had been no step or sign of life and there was nothing from behind the second door to the left just above me then came the sharp tingle of an electric bell there was only one room from which it could have come i tapped very gently though my heart beat so that i thought it must have been a hammer noise to those inside the door opened a chink and a level quiet voice said some hot water please very hot perhaps a minute afterwards i tapped again and a hand took the can of hot water from me i went back again this time to the top step and still waited since i had done something though it was but the handing of a can of hot water into the room that nightmare of incoherent thoughts began to clear more completely and like some remembered sunlight breaking clouds and shining with the serene quietude of eventide helen she herself no intercepted vision no vision even of remembrance only or anxiousness shone out whatever happened she was i and i was she and the will of god whatever it might ordain for us could not alter that she and i i think have never feared anything when we were together and surely of all days that life or death could hold for us we could never be more together than to day so surely of all hours this is the one when fear should be farthest from us for never have we been together like this yet o my god my god since christ was born of a woman let him go in there the second door and the next door you know is the nursery no not the farther one but the one this side yes yes of course you know but you might have forgotten theres the noahs ark there and the dolls house and the lead soldiers we had hoped red light came in through the window on the stairs light of sunset once more the stinging sound of the electric bell came to me once more i took up a can of hot water then it grew dark in the hall below the lamp had been lit and from the window after the last red of sunset had faded there came the distant shining of stars endlessly remote then the door opened again and the nurse came hurrying out forgetting to close it from within came the cry of a child june i overstep the bounds of the year but you may like to know quite early this morning i was allowed to go in and look they were sleeping both of them she and he afterwards i went into the nursery the end established illustration t nelson and sons printers and publishers the nelson library of notable books uniform with this volume and
