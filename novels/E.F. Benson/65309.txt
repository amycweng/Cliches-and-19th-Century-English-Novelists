by the same author colin visible and invisible miss mapp dodo wonders robin linnet queen lucia colin ii a novel by e f benson author of colin visible and invisible third edition london hutchinson co paternoster row published august preface the preface to colin published in informed such readers as peruse prefaces that a further volume would complete the history of his association with the bargain his ancestor struck with satan colin ii therefore must not be regarded as a sequel to colin but as the second half of that romance the interval between the appearance of the two books has been longer than i anticipated for i was not aware of the difficulties that lay ahead e f benson introduction with the declining wheel of the sun to the west the shadow of the great yewhedge began to flow like some tide dark and clear over the paved terrace which since morning had basked in the blaze of the july day it had been planted by colin stanier first earl of yardley when he laid the foundations of his house in the time of elizabeth and the threesided serge rampart now thick and solid as a fortresswall ran out from the corners of the faade and formed a frame for the lawn below the terrace beyond the ground declined in smooth slopes of shortcut turf to the lake this lake also was the creation of the first lord yardley for he had built the broad dam now clothed with rhododendrons across the dip of the valley so that the stream which flowed down it was pent to form this triangular expanse of water at the top end it was shallow but by the sluice in the centre of the dam fifteen feet of dark water reflected the banks of blossom beyond again and below the hillside tumbled rapidly down to the heathazed levels of the romney marsh and over all the great house kept watch stately and steadfast as the hill from which it sprang a presiding presence and symbol of the three centuries of unbroken prosperity which had blessed the fortunes of the staniers whatever uprooting tornado of revolution had swept across england devastating or impoverishing the great families of the past they seemed anchored and protected beyond all power of ruinous vicissitudes they were no fat or brainless race who but battened and dozed in material magnificence but served their country well in public ministries as for their private lives the staniers have always considered that such were their own concern the family rose to the splendour which it still enjoys in the reign of elizabeth its founder was one colin stanier the son of a small local farmer who on the occasion of the queens visit to rye as she toured her cinque ports went into the town to see the pageant pass as her grace rode down the steep cobbled way from the church her horse stumbled and the boy some eighteen years old at the time had the privilege by his quickness to save the queen from a serious fall she looked on his amazing comeliness with an admiring eye and bade him wait on her next day at the manor of brede that night according to the family tradition as he worked and slept in a shepherds hut on the marsh busy with the midwifery of his fathers ewes at lambingtime he was visited by a personage even greater than the queen one no less than satan himself who for the signing away of his soul offered not only to him but to those of his descendants who chose to associate themselves with the bargain health and wealth and honour up to the fulness of their hearts desire a deed was thereupon executed between the two which colin signed with the blood of his pricked arm and which is supposed still to exist let into the frame of the famous portrait of him at the family seat of stanier this curious story has been known from that day to this as the stanier legend the advent of colins good fortune made no long tarrying for early next morning after his interview with his satanic majesty he waited on her susceptible majesty at the place appointed ruddy and fair he was to look upon and even as the lord took david as he followed the ewes great with young and made him king in israel so from the sheepfolds did elizabeth take colin stanier and made him her page and presently her most confidential secretary and conferred on him at the age of twentyfive the monastic lands of tillingham with the earldom of yardley and the knighthood of the garter so whether the student can accept or not as true the stanier legend he is forced to credit colins rise of fortune which is hardly less miraculous for certainly he was a shepherdboy one day and a page of the queen the next and thereafter while still a young man attained a position such as few subjects have ever enjoyed he wrote a voluminous memoir of his life which is preserved in the library at stanier and yet unpublished contains some very curious matter in it he recorded without reticence or shame the manner of his days his ruthless cruelty and relentlessness to those who crossed him his building of the great house at stanier his ceaseless quest for pictures and tapestries for statues and furniture and described with the faithfulness of detail the bargain that he struck with satan and his conviction that he owed to it all the good fortune and prosperity that so unfailingly attended his earthly pilgrimage that belief was confirmed by the characters of his descendants who by his bargain came under the diabolical protection for in all history you will not find a family so consistently prosperous nor one so infamous for more than a century after his death the eldest son of the house made on his twentyfirst birthday his formal choice as to whether he accepted for himself the legendary bargain or dissociated himself from it and during that period one only philip the third earl would have no part in it and he within a month of his accession to his lordship was smitten with a mysterious and terrible disease of which he soon died the rest all claimed their inheritance and mightily prospered but in the eighteenth century their belief in so extravagant a legend faded in the light of more modern materialism the solemn ritual of choice was performed no more but though the formality was given up the subsequent successors to the bargain mostly acted up to the spirit of it and their lives if not their lips acknowledged it for in general their wickednesses have been as notable as their prosperity pity and its greater kinsman love can find no seedcranny in their hearts where they can take root but both alike wither in that iron soil the staniers have always been loveless folk and it is strange that though love is alien to their natures they have often so madly inspired it and with a glance have kindled in others the fire which is powerless to warm them they sate their passions and when that is done toss the outworn minister away or if that minister is wife and mother to their children she freezes in the arctic cold of lovelessness many a bride has come to stanier all ardent and aflame on whom that congealing blight has fallen which has turned her into a figure of ice doing the honours of the house with stately courtesy wearing the great jewels which are the insignia of her servitude and bearing beautiful sons for the perpetuation of the race the love that adorned her advent was frozen maybe into hate and horror of him with whom she was indissolubly one and whose soul was in pawn to satan the staniers have never run to large families two or at the most three children have been born to the lord yardley of the day in the last generation there were three philip the eldest a daughter hester and ronald father of violet stanier now countess of yardley at the time of her birth philip who had quarrelled with his intolerable sire and was still unmarried was living at a villa he had bought on the island of capri with an italian girl whom he had made his mistress she was with child by him and less than a month before her delivery news came to philip that this younger brother of his had begotten a daughter he thereupon married rosina biagi who soon presented him with twin boys philip telegraphed the news of his marriage and their birth to his father and the despatch arrived as he and ronald heavy drinkers both of them sat tipsily over their wine lord yardley had had a stroke some two years before and now he fell forward with a crash among the glasses and died without speech within a few weeks philips wife died also and he came home with his two sons to enter on his inheritance of these the elder by half an hour was raymond a dark and ugly fellow black of temper and between him and his brother colin as they grew up flowered an implacable enmity on colin the gods had lavished the utmost of their gifts he was the beloved of his father and of all who came near him and raymond the uncouth and unpleasing envied and detested him this hatred was hotly returned by the other raymond was an abomination in colins eyes not only for what he was but because thanks to that halfhours seniority he was heir to all that he himself so passionately coveted title and revenues and not least the lordship of the wonderhouse at stanier through all their generations the staniers have adored the place it is said that none of them is completely happy if he is away from it for long that passion was shared by violet who was an exact contemporary of her twincousins and was brought up with them there and it was for the sake of being its mistress that at the age of twenty she promised to marry raymond but her heart was already not her own to give and though as yet she scarcely knew it colin held it then he beckoned to her and discarding the graceless raymond she married him and forthwith as if a lamp had suddenly been lit which showed her his black heart she knew that in loving him she loved one in whom the stanier legend found such fulfilment as none of its inheritors had manifested yet in person he might have been the very incarnation of their elizabethan ancestor who had founded the house for there in life was the matchless beauty of the great portrait the gold hair the beautiful mouth the dancing azure of the eyes in which gleamed the greeting of his enchanting grace in him blossomed the fairest that nature and inheritance could bestow luck favoured him even as it had favoured his ancestor in all he did for shortly after his marriage raymond was miserably doomed as he skated on the lake at christmastime and within a few months his father died also and colin his son reigned in his stead he and violet fair as a spring day numbered but forty years between them they were an april couple with all the splendour of the summer waiting for them but the dawn of love for violet had been the dawn too of a nightmare of unfathomable darkness for colin excelling all of his race who had been merely indifferent to love knew very well what love meant and bitterly hated it he was not content to shrug his shoulders at it and pass on to gratify his pleasures for the sweetest of them to him was loves discomfiture and his joy to strike at it and wound it often violet wished he could have killed her love for him for then would have died withal that eternal struggle within her between love and her horror of him whose soul whether in fulfilment of the legend or from his inherent wickedness was as surely satans as if with his own blood he had signed the fabled bond yet as often as she wished that she cried out on herself at so blasphemous a desire for she knew that by love alone though in some manner inscrutable could redemption come to him that creed was inscribed on her hearts core it was the fabric on which was stitched the embroidery of her days part i colin ii chapter i throughout this hot afternoon of july the terrace had lain empty and soaked in sunshine and it was not till the shadow of the yewhedge had crept halfway along it from the west that violet yardley stepped out of the long window of the gallery which lay along the front of the house colin was in town he had said he might possibly return today but if so he would telephone violet had just asked if any message had come from her husband and it was with a feeling of relief and remission that she had heard that there was none she paused in the doorway with puckered eyelids as she emerged from the cool dimness of the house into that reverberating brightness she was bareheaded and the gold of her hair was so pierced by the sun that it looked as if it shone from some illumination within itself she had the blue eyes of her race its fineness of feature and arrogance of bearing and so like she was to colin that they could still almost have repeated that jest of his schooldays when on the occasion of a fancydress ball the two had changed costumes with each other halfway through the evening and had been undetected till colins sudden spasm of halfcracked laughter when a schoolfriend of his had made a suitable speech to so enchanting a girl had given them away she had changed very little since then her figure had still the adorable slimness of girlhood there was a small encampment of chairs with a table laid for tea at the shady end of the terrace and she seemed to be the first to come out from the coolness of the house aunt hester would be here soon or perhaps violets father still hobbling from a rather sharp attack of gout and presently dennis her fourteen monthold baby would be wheeled up and down the terrace by his nurse for his evening airing and make some more of those intrepid experiments in voluntary locomotion which were meeting with an increasing but still hazardous success he appeared to consider his legs as an impediment more than an aid to movement they got in his way and caused stumbling but he was rapidly teaching them not to interfere colin would be pleased to see the progress his young son had made in his fortnights absence violets eyes wandered from the terrace to the blaze of the flowerborders round the lawn below and beyond to the bright surface of the lake so still was it and unruffled by any breeze that it might have been covered with a sheet of ice that gleamed blue with the reflection from the sky at the thought of ice on the lake there started unbidden into her mind the memory of that terrible morning only eighteen months ago when raymond colins elder twinbrother had taken his skates down there and had never been seen alive again she and his father had followed him not long afterwards and had found his boots on the bank and a great hole in the ice at the deep end by the sluice where the rhododendron bushes hung over the lake it had been terrible and was there something more terrible yet had noone ever seen raymond alive after the moment when he left the house colin had once said something of casual application about a drowning man coming up to the surface not three times as popularly supposed but once only and somehow that had suggested to her that he had seen raymond struggling in the water there was no cause why so ghastly an idea should ever have occurred to her it was more like the unsubstantial remembrance of a nightmare than a waking thought but it had the haunting vividness of dreams there came the brisk tapping of heels along the terrace and aunt hester approached she was small in stature and carried her sixty years with a dainty lightness she had on a gay print dress short in the skirt in true modern fashion which shewed to great advantage her neat slim calves and tiny ankles on her head was a broadbrimmed strawhat a garden of monstrous blue convolvuluses and her face was hidden beneath swathes of pale pink veil her tripping gait suggested a bird scouring the lawn for its breakfast and her speech was the argot of smart young ladies in the midvictorian epoch well thank god this wretched suns got behind the trees at last she said and i can take off my veil sunshines a plague to the complexion my dear how you stand it i dont know give me my cup of tea theres a good girl im as dry as the desert she unpinned her layers of veil as violet poured out her tea disclosing the prettiest little face pink and white of porcelain delicacy girls today aint got one decent skin among a score of them she observed they go playing golf and smoking cigarettes till their faces are like kippers and then they make them twice as bad by smudging themselves with rouge and powder and muck till theyre in such a mess as never was how a young man nowadays can bring himself to kiss one of them without wanting to wash his face afterwards i dont know i like my tea strong my dear hope its been standing violet held out the cup will that do aunt hester she asked or will you wait a little no ill take that said she and the next cup will be a bit stronger then i shall go for my walk and get a good perspiration and have my cold tub and be ready for my dinner thats the way to keep well violet laughed youre a marvel aunt hester she said colin always says hell never be as young as you even if he lives to be a hundred colins a wretch said aunt hester selecting a piece of hot buttered bun hes making fun of me pulling my leg as they call it nowadays anything been heard of him is he coming down tonight he hasnt telephoned to say so well i wish he would stanier aint really stanier when colins not here i shall have to run up to town and see what hes after mischief ill be bound but colins sunshines the only sunshine ive any use for lord how his father used to dote on him and pleased he was my dear when you gave poor raymond the chuck and took colin instead i was thinking about raymond just now said violet well i should have thought you could have found a pleasanter subject than that said lady hester he was a sulky badtempered boy was raymond and i daresay god knew best when he let him drown not but what im sorry for him but as for pretending to like people just because theyre dead i call that bunkum and if i ever die my dear which god forbid i hope you and colin wont talk any trash about me and say i was the model of all the virtues such a pack of nonsense but dont lets talk about that she looked round and her eyes sharp as a terriers noticed what violet had not seen yet at the far end of the terrace had appeared a wheeled chair pushed by a woman in nurses costume why theres my mother said lady hester fancy her coming out this was indeed a most unusual appearance old lady yardley mother of colins father of lady hester and of ronald stanier was now seldom seen until the hour of dinner when she with her bathchair was brought down in the lift from her rooms was wheeled into the long gallery and with the help of her crutchhandled stick transferred herself to the brocaded chair by the fireplace near the diningroom in the grate whatever the weather a couple of logs smouldered into white ash and by it she sat till the rest were assembled so she had done for sixtythree years when first as a bride of eighteen she came to the house waiting till all were ready when according to immemorial usage the majordomo threw open the doors of lord yardleys room at the far end of the gallery and he entered that had been the custom in the days of her fatherinlaw and when her husband reigned and when her son reigned up till now when colin her grandson still kept up the ancestral tradition she seldom spoke but sat through dinner eating in silence what was put before her and in the manner of the very old regarding now one now another of her companions with eyes blank and unwinking but halfveiled with the drooping lids of age after dinner she played a couple of rubbers of whist and when they were done she was conveyed back into the silence and sequestration of her room again there she remained thickly rimed by the stanier frost until the hour came round for her again to put on her jewels and her eveninggown and wait by the fireplace for lord yardley be he fatherinlaw or husband or son or grandson colin alone had always the power to galvanize her into life his presence blew away the white ash that seemed to cover her mind as it covered those smouldering logs in the fireplace and disclosed some mysterious pale fire that still burned within she would nod and smile at him when he kissed her would listen with pleasure to what he said to her would ask him sometimes some question about his doings she might enquire what he had actually done today equally well she might enquire whether he had been out with raymond who had been dead this year and a half or whether his grandfather who had fallen lifeless across the diningroom table on the very day that colin was born would make one of their whisttable that night colin always had some answer that pleased and satisfied her and sometime next day or maybe a week afterwards she would shew she remembered it by some further question or comment but she seemed to have no cognizance of any of the others unless she wanted to know something about colin she ate her dinner in silence and in silence played her whist and waited for the next evening she was wheeled now halfway down the terrace and there her nurse would have turned again but she gesticulated and pointed to where violet and lady hester were sitting i cant make out what she wants my lady said the nurse to violet she told me she wished to come out but its so warm it cant hurt her violet went to the side of the bathchair well granny she said have you come out to have tea with aunt hester and me old lady yardley looked at her in silence then transferred that unwinking gaze to lady hester lady hester particularly disliked this grim silent observation it gave her the creeps ill be going for my walk she said whatever mamma wants my dear she doesnt want us wheres colin asked old lady yardley he hasnt come granny said violet i dont think hes coming today yes hes coming today said lady yardley is he here now is he with raymond i want colin granny dear hes in london said violet well let you know the moment he comes just a fad shes got my lady said the nurse it was impossible to speak of old lady yardley as if she was there there was noone truly there unless colin was there too the nurse turned to her charge youd better let me take you back to your rooms my lady she said and have a nice rest till dinnertime youve seen for yourself that his lordship isnt here old lady yardley paid not the smallest attention to this i shall wait for colin on the terrace she said to violet i shall wait there till colin comes he is coming wheel her up and down then said violet to the nurse to aunt hesters great relief old lady yardley consented to have her chair turned round and be wheeled away again she gives me the creeps my dear said aunt hester though i know shes my own mother but there it is ever since i can remember she was cold and dead the iceberg your uncle philip and i used to call her a beautiful woman she was too its strange that your uncle philip and your father were such plain men you took all her good looks aunt hester said violet aunt hester loved firm little compliments laid on with the full spade well i had my share of them she said but beauty ran to prettiness in me and thats a sad seeding the stanier style skipped my generation and i daresay thats why it came out strong in the next your uncle philip and your father as i say two plain men if ever there was one and yet one was the father of colin and the other of you you two have got it all thats whats happened there was never such a pair of staniers as you and as like as two peas make haste my dear and have a dozen sons and daughters and therell be a dinnertable worth photographing when youve got your family growing up let them all be as wicked as hell and as long as they have the good looks of their mother and father ill forgive em there are enough plain folk in the world already who can be models of piety but when i see a handsome boy i want to see him kissing a pretty girl as im too old for him now aunt hester youre a pagan observed violet i always was my dear said she and its pagans who make the world go round it aint for long that anyones fit to look at so while youth lasts for gods sake let them make the most of it therell be time for them to lead a godly life when noone asks them to do anything else thats what i say with which atrocious sentiments aunt hester walked briskly off to get her good perspiration to prepare her for her cold tub and her dinner the staniers had always been patriarchal folk and indeed in that immense house there was room for the exercise of this family virtue without any inconvenient jostling of the generations it was an asylum and almshouse for the antiquated members of the family four generations indeed were now installed there old lady yardley represented the earliest and next in succession came her two children lady hester and ronald stanier with his wife all of whom inhabited what colin called the dowagerwing if he wished to say something special about violets father he called it the home for inebriates or if her mother had to be characterized the home for decayed gentlewomen old lady yardley was a permanent inmate since her husbands death twentyone years ago she had never left stanier and ronald violets father was scarcely less constant for he only absented himself for a curative month at aix or marienbad every august which should enable him to continue eating and drinking too much for the remainder of the year or passed an occasional fortnight in his much less comfortable flat in town when there he spent most of his time at his club presenting the back of his head to st jamess street and dozing over a succession of morning and evening papers the morning and evening papers were for him the current day when colin and his wife were in london he would still stay on here dining nightly in silence with his mother and sitting with her afterwards nodding and snorting under her steady and malevolent gaze till she was wheeled off by her nurse and he would fuddle the rest of the evening away over a couple of cigars and the whisky bottle ronalds wife margaret also was usually in residence here an eclipsed and negligible presence whom it was difficult to be aware of and impossible to miss there had never been any real parental or filial relationship between her and violet she behaved with controlled propriety on all occasions sad or festive and emotion withered in her immaculate vicinity the stanier frost which falls on those who marry into that family had long ago congealed her there was no telling what if anything lay beneath that cold chalky surface she drank hot water with her meals though it never thawed her always replied if spoken to took a walk every morning in the park if the day was fine and if not sat in her sittingroom in the dowagers wing and played patience her career in life was to write out the menucards for the dinnertable in french with accents where required violet made occasional efforts to get in touch with her but there was nothing to touch her hand merely became numb with the cold mist in which it groped margaret stanier went with her husband to aix for his yearly cure she kept house for him in london but for the greater part of the year they were here not welcome exactly but not unwelcome merely part of the house like staircarpets in unfrequented passages which were sometimes taken up and then laid down again it had always been so at stanier brothers and sons of earlier generations were part of the house if they chose to make themselves so until the day came when they were borne on their short journey to the family vault in the church that stood not two hundred yards away lady hester was the fourth but less chronic inhabitant of the dowagers wing for she had still a lively appreciation of the gaieties and stir of life and chiefly confined her visits to the times when that wretch colin made things go a bit for wheres the use my dear she used to say in my sitting to be stared at by mamma or in watching poor ronald fuddle himself i like a bit more spunk than that but she like violet like colin like her brother had that feeling about stanier just the place itself which for generations all the family have shared to them all it meant something intimate and indefinable something for which violet for instance had been willing to marry the dark uncouth raymond if by that she might become mistress of the house true that had not been required of her she had married hyperion instead of the satyr and had harvested love and that deepset terror that prowled about in the darkness below these magnificent surfaces had she been challenged as to whether she believed in the legend in any literal sense she would perhaps have denied it but she would have given her soul to deny that as regards colin there was no spiritual significance in it whether it was actually true or not did not matter that belonged to the dust of medivalism but there was a darkness deeper than that none of the others not aunt hester with her gay paganism not old lady yardley with her halfclosed eyes and steady gaze knew colin as she knew him they saw the charm of him the beauty the sunshine of his gaiety and just occasionally winced under the quick lash of his tongue but none of them shuddered at what lay below his sunshine there came out of the gallery door that presence which alone had power to scare off these black illomened birds of thought from violets mind here was the fourth of the generations that inhabited the house dennis in his perambulator being wheeled out for his evening airing and for whatever fresh discoveries about the use of legs might reward his daring just as he came out the bathchair with its withdrawn and antique occupant was passing the door and dramatically enough so it seemed to violet the two were face to face across the gulf of eighty years which divided them both attended and conveyed the one owing to the infirmity of faded energies the other from the immaturity of them occasionally old lady yardley seemed to take some notice of dennis the faint dawning of the smile with which she looked on his father would begin to hover on her mouth and the heavy eyelids lifted a little today as violet saw that blink of recognition was there but immediately lady yardleys face clouded again no thats not colin she said to her nurse but hes coming then as the bathchair in its peregrinations came close to the teatable again her eyes were alert to see if he was there but for violet they had no spark of recognition it was always for colin that she searched noone else could reward that silent scrutiny violet got up when the bathchair had turned and gone back for here was the perambulator with dennis in it her baby was the emblem and incarnation of those early days of her marriage before she believed in that spiritual fulfilment of the legend which since had clouded the fair morning of her love with its gross darkness and there lived for her again the hours when colin was her adored lover in southern nights at capri where at his fathers villa they had spent their honeymoon dennis was to her the untainted blossom of those days there he was drumming with his hands on the apron of his perambulator demanding with shrill cheerful crowings to be let out to make fresh discoveries about the laws of motion he saw her coming towards him and the crowings swelled into enraptured squeals take him out nurse said violet now dennis come and walk to me that was precisely what dennis wanted to do if he could but the squeals subsided over the extreme seriousness of the undertaking he stood swaying slightly as his nurses arms released him and regarding with fixed attention the two dimpled sandalled feet which certainly had some share in the proposed excursion though it was still a matter of doubt as to what that share was after having examined them both he decided to put his best foot foremost this was a complete success and he shouted daddy which wasnt quite so clever that effort somehow disturbed his equilibrium and he fell down clumsy said his mother try again dennis dennis had not the slightest intention of trying again just now there was a crack between two pavingstones which was more interesting than the problems of locomotion but destiny in the habiliment of his nurse set him on his feet and violet moved a little nearer in order to make the tremendous gulf of yards that separated them yawn less impossibly then staggering like a ship at sea he launched himself again and after a wild semicircular career he fell against her skirts but exploration is exhausting work taxing to the nerves and imagination as much as to the muscles and presently he was wheeled away again for bath and bed but still up and down the terrace now pausing now moving on again went lady yardleys bathchair as she waited for colin to come and bring her back out of the mists where she moved into the clear twilight which though veiled and dim rendered visible the phantoms that peopled it but when the dressingbell sounded she spoke take me in she said colin will be here for dinner and i must not be late tonight ronald stanier was the first down he had been something of a buck in his earlier years and the habit of impressing the world with his gallant appearance had remained with him though dishevelling age and a remarkable fondness for food and drink had rendered his task more difficult his forehead and crown were completely bald but he grew his hair of a bright suspicious auburn and unflecked by any line of grey very long on one side of his head and espaliered it carefully over the shiny pink skin of his pate he wore clothes that were meant to make him look slim but only succeeded in looking tight themselves a monocle a large solitaire and a carnation were the other salient points of his decorative scheme his face loose and fleshy had a trampled look about it as of a muddy lane over which a flock of sheep had passed he limped a little as he came down the gallery his wife thin and dry followed him shortly after and presently old lady yardley was wheeled in she took no notice whatever of the others and with the help of her stick transferred herself to the brocaded chair by the fireplace where that invariable couple of logs sent up a vacillating thread of blue smoke why on so hot a night a fire should have been there was beyond conjecture but so it always was perhaps a hundred years ago someone when they assembled here for dinner had unexpectedly found the room chilly they all sat silent why should any of them speak and put somebody else to the trouble of a reply nothing had happened since twentyfour hours ago they had last met here no fresh interest had stirred the toneless tranquillity ronalds slight attack of gout was certainly better and he meant to drink his port again tonight his wifes patience had come out twice as for lady yardley was she living in today at all or in times long buried beneath the years then lady hester joined them brisk from her walk and her tub she asked ronald how he was she told them where she had been and then she too succumbed and sat silent violet followed made a general apology for being late and the doors into the diningroom were thrown open will you take grandmamma in she said to her father and the other three followed though the evening sky was still radiant and there was light enough to have dined with unshuttered windows curtains were drawn and the room lit with many candles for staniers dined by candlelight quantities of candlelight whatever the sun happened to be doing round the panelled walls were a dozen family portraits each with its concealed electric illumination that made them look as if they had stepped forward from the walls and were part of that little knot of their heirs and inheritors who sat round the table for all their unbroken continuity the staniers had always grown on a slender stem and tonight with dennis rosily sleeping upstairs on the floor above only colin was wanting to complete the full number of the clan from generation to generation all collateral lines descended from daughters or younger sons had died out but the silver cord of the direct descent had never been broken now from the walls the past ages joined the present here seated in the soft glow of candles was the fruit and distillation of the years ronald with his heavy winebibbers face hester in whom as she had said beauty had run to seed in prettiness and violet the other two ronalds wife and old lady yardley had been so to speak but the fuel that made the stanier fire burn the younger violets mother was no more than a burnedout cinder in the grate she had done her part and the dustman would sometime call and remove her the elder watchful and alive below the ash still glowed with some inscrutable vigour through her had passed the spark that now blazed in colin and violet alike and something of it still lived in her embers for more than sixty years stanier and all that it stood for had soaked into her she had become a sort of incarnation of the stanier consciousness and sunk far below the surface except when colin was present into whose gay hands she could resign her watchful responsibility she witnessed and recorded the stately silent meal went on unutterably dull and impeccably exquisite a vagabond or a hungry tramp would almost have preferred to go unfed than to have his cravings so joylessly satisfied but then the staniers were not tramps or vagabonds and this was the way they had dinner alone with aunt hester or even with the additional incumbrance of her father and mother violet could have hoisted the standard of ordinary human sociability and made a normal little festival of the meal but neither she nor aunt hester could struggle long without the dispelling influence of colins beam against that paralyzing effect of old lady yardleys presence her silence and her steady watchfulness it was like talking in the presence of an open coffin where lay something corpselike yet alive violet as usual had begun dinner with her invariable effort to pull them all out of that deadly pit into which they nightly descended dennis walked at least ten yards this evening mamma without falling down once she said to mrs stanier colin will be surprised to see how he has got on for a second lady yardleys eyelids flickered at the name of colin he will get on quickly now said mrs stanier when babies once begin to walk they soon pick it up this was a very just observation but lacked any initiative touch i think hes rather forward said violet hes only fourteen months old yes just fourteen months said mrs stanier fancy violet wheeled to lady hester and where did you go aunt hester she said did you find any coolness its the hottest day weve had this year yes my dear its like an oven said lady hester i hate the summer it broils my bones and then theres a thunderstorm which scares me stiff yes a glass of sherry said ronald he took up the menucard and held it up to his monocled eye a short silence fell violet tried again and when are you going off to aix father she said i hear its tremendously full this year next week said ronald violet let her eyes sweep round the pictured walls just opposite her was the picture of colin painted by the most famous artist of the day he more than any of the other portraits seemed to have drawn close to the dinnertable he had stepped boldly forth in another moment he would be standing at old lady yardleys elbow lady hester made an effort the midges had bitten her during her walk and she felt what she would have called scratchy well i could never see the sense of filling yourself up with stinking waters she said and being pounded as if you were a heap of clothes at the wash ronald put down his menucard always he pretended not to be deaf beg your pardon hester he said there are many things which it is easy to say once but impossible to repeat this seemed one of them and the next silence was rather longer you will like your game of whist tonight granny asked violet at length lady yardley did not answer she held up her finger as if listening not to what violet said but to something inaudible to the others then she turned to the butler give me my stick she said i hear wheels that is colin no granny hes not coming tonight said violet lady yardley grasped her stick and had halfrisen from her place when there came a step along the gallery floor and the door opened it is colin said she colin entered it was as if the sunlight came in with him the room seemed to leap into brightness ah what a dreadful time to arrive he said dont get up anybody or i shall go away again violet darling how blessed to see you granny my dear granny aunt hester everybody just push me a chair in and let me sit down with you where shall it be put i dont know i want to sit next everybody he sat down between old lady yardley and hester and ran his hand through his hair im dusty im dirty im dishevelled he said but i neednt go and wash need i granny i want dinner dont send me away to wash and brush my hair as you used to do when i was little i knew you were coming colin she said i told them all you were coming youre a witch granny he said im not sure you oughtnt to be burned you shall have your game of whist afterwards and then well make a fire of the cards and burn you but you expected me didnt you i telephoned or somebody telephoned surely colin knew that he had not telephoned or told anybody to telephone the fact that his statement was not true made a mild reason for uttering it it had only occurred to him a couple of hours ago to come down and he had driven straight off with nino his young italian servant the image of stanier spacious and cool among its woods had drifted across the reek of the grilling streets and gave him the impulse he never resisted an impulse darling aunt hester he said i couldnt get on without you a minute more everyone in london was old and cross and i wanted to feel young again good gracious me have you got to dessert already you mustnt wait for me my fault for being so late uncle ronald will keep me company over his wine no i dont want any soup give me some cold ham or something granny im going to be like you for the future and never leave stanier any more well grow old together she was leaning forward listening to him and laid her hand on his no colin you must never grow old she said you mustnt grow old or die it isnt good to die and you havent brought raymond with you have you i dont want raymond colin patted her hand no hes not come with me he said he couldnt manage to come he spoke quickly and low to violet get up dear and take her away he said i want to have my dinner in peace what is that youre saying colin asked lady yardley nothing granny now you go and sit in the gallery and presently well have our game of whist but i want to have my dinner with you said she something ugly and impatient gleamed in those blue eyes of his for a moment but it sheathed itself again nonsense granny he said youve had your dinner violet had come round the table wont you let her stop with you she said quietly shes been looking out for you all the evening no darling i wont he said not much competition for her eh vi take her away go on granny violets waiting for you uncle ronald and i will come after you when weve had a glass of wine together the door closed behind the women and colin sat down again granny seems to be immortal he observed thats a great score shell see you and me into our graves uncle ronald the gouts better im glad to see and permits you to have port again have some more well perhaps another glass while youre eating your dinner said ronald he was never very comfortable alone with colin but he wanted port though not a person of very quick perception he felt as if he was in the presence of some lithe fierce creature which might suddenly snap at him when other people were there they served as bars thats right said colin you see if you can get through a bottle of port by the time ive finished dinner ill bet that you can arent we a sadly degenerated race uncle ronald i hardly ever touch wine tell me about the old days when you and my grandfather used to sit soaking at this table hour after hour bring another bottle of port he said to the butler no indeed colin theres plenty here said ronald just one glass more for me and then ive done colin felt himself scintillating with evil purpose the atmosphere the environment of stanier was always charged with currents that vivified and stimulated him if no more subtle entertainment offered itself at the moment he could at least induce uncle ronald to drink more than was good for him perhaps he would get tipsy perhaps his gout would begin jabbing him again it would all afford amusement oh i know what your one glass more means he said besides youre going to aix soon and that will set it right i think i must learn to drink for theres clearly pleasure in it and it is criminal to deny oneself a pleasure ah theres the fresh bottle sunshine you know uncle ronald it was the sunshine that brooded over some vineyard before i was born that produced that wine without the sunshine there would never have been any wine that year theres romance for you thats not a bottle of wine really its a bottle of sunshine and the warm air of the south just whats so good for gout ronald took a few seconds to follow the course of this admirable reasoning then he gave an appreciative chuckle upon my word thats a new way of looking at it he said makes it seem as if it will be positively good for me of course it will said colin thats the whole system of modern physics if you think anything is good for you it does you good ronald clapped his loose lips to the glass and smacked them nectar he said you miss a lot colin by not joining me but not a word to your aunt margaret mindi should get a scolding if she knew i had had more than one glass no i wont tell her said colin well see if she discovers it without being told ronald twiddling the stem of his wineglass faintly wondered what colin meant certainly it was a wonderful bottle of port that had been brought him and it did not matter much what colin meant he emptied his glass and with an absent air refilled it again much going on in town he asked dances dinners ah when i was a young fellow i dont suppose i dined at home once in a month nor got back there till three or four in the morning colin found his fingers twitching with sudden dislike of this buckish old winebibber why after all did he let him and his thinlipped scarecrow wife feed and board themselves here her return for her keep was to write out the menucards his to consume as fast as was reasonable to expect of any one man all the best bins true it was a custom in great houses at one time to keep a professional fool on the premises for entertainment but when he became a bore you sent him down to the scullery or wherever he lived he must really consider the question of conveying to uncle ronald and his wife that their visit had been rather a long one for they had lived here since before violets birth he might begin now oh its been quite lively he said and i daresay youll have a gay autumn i suppose you and aunt margaret will settle down in london when you get back from aix ronald finished his glass in rather a hurry bless me no he said theres no thought of that my london gaieties are over but for a week or two occasionally and naturally i couldnt think of leaving your grandmother again colins fingers twitched with dislike why should he at this moment be sitting here with this boring old man with his tremulous hand and his plastered hair who couldnt think of ever leaving stanier he might be assisted to think of it couldnt you indeed he said why of course that settles it doesnt it let me fill your glass for you ronald made a clumsy feint of putting his hand over the bowl no upon my word not a drop more he said colin inserted the lip of the decanter between his glass and the covering hand and filled it up again of course that settles it he repeated this reiterated observation seemed to give ronald food for thought he began to see that colin might be speaking ironically he did sometimes but his glass was full again and it was wiser not to pursue an uncomfortable topic at a convivial hour better to be genial and companionable and if you havent filled up my glass again he said well stanier was always a hospitable house and very worthily my dear fellow you carry on the tradition colin got up uncle ronalds little doxology might be brought to bear on the hospitality he had enjoyed for so many years kind of you to say so but i have my limits he observed perhaps you had better finish your wine uncle ronald or we shall have my grandmother back looking for you you mustnt leave her as you said just now ronald got to his feet he was still a little lame and colin moved towards him youd better take my arm he said or aunt margaret will see youve had another glass of port without anybody telling her ronald gave his gross chuckle that would be a singular thing he said if a stanier couldnt carry the drop of wine ive drunk without inconvenience its only the fagend of my attack of gout that makes me lame colin however pressed a friendly arm on him and together they went into the gallery granny dear weve left you a long time said he but uncle ronald was so amusing that i couldnt tear myself away now uncle ronald you sit quietly there on the sofa colin steered his uncle to the sofa thus conveying the impression that there was need for guidance now granny he said well get to our whist whom shall we ask to play with us heres violet and aunt margaret oh that leaves aunt hester out aunt hester instantly disclaimed any desire to play she had got hold of a number of vogue with a very dainty picture of a young lady on the cover with a hat that she thought would suit her at halfpast ten old lady yardleys bathchair was wheeled in for her and as soon as the second rubber came to an end she was taken off ronald had already left his sofa and drifted away without doubt to the smokingroom aunt hester who had cut into the second rubber gathered up her winnings and ill be off too she said or i shall lose my beautysleep bless me have i won all those silver shillings somebody will want to marry me for my money aunt hester knows that every handsome young man in london would like to marry her if she hadnt a penny observed colin youre a sad rascal said aunt hester fearfully pleased goodnight everybody aunt margaret followed and violet would have done so but at the door colin stopped her not five minutes chat vi he said i havent had a word with you all the evening ah thats dear of you come out on the terrace lets take a stroll i want to talk to you anything special asked violet oh just bits of things maynt a man want to talk to his wife sometimes he paused for a moment as they stepped out the moonlight shone fullorbed on the front of the house in vivid but colourless illumination making a warm neutral tone of its mellow redness below the lake gleamed silver grey across it was ruled the velvet blackness of the yewhedge and beyond the marsh stretched level to the sea colins eyes sparkled as he looked on the heritage that he loved but came back quickly to violet my word youre a beautiful woman he said i was in luck wasnt i with my wooing did you hear granny ask me if raymond had come i wish he had i often wish raymond was here to look on our happiness he took her arm and began walking towards the yewhedge stanier always stimulated him to be himself and it was through some little revelation of himself that he could most surely make her wince i often thought of telling you something about raymond he said which perhaps you never guessed do you know i actually saw him drown only just for a second but such an interesting one i can see it now like some scene on the movies i had gone down to the lake after him heard the crash of the ice and there he was in the water there was nothing to be done if i had jumped in after him i should only have drowned as well and you wouldnt have liked that nor would i violet felt herself shudder not at what colin had done or what he had not done but at what he was that trembling passed down the bare arm in which colin had linked his thats not really news to me she said i guessed it colin pressed her arm i wondered if you had he said characteristic of me wasnt it to be in at the death my dear how horrified you are at me youre trembling i rather like your being horrified at me and yet i rather resent it what odd people we are to be sure are you glad to see me vi pleased i came down rather a difficult question isnt it i make you shudder sometimes i make you freeze and yet you love me thats what tortures you look theres the door in the yew hedge it was exactly there you stood when you found out you loved me and the next morning you threw raymond over i adored that morning however well leave these romantic reminiscences and come on to this evening cigarette my god violet what an evening he offered her his case and then took one himself nursing the match in his hollowed hands his face vividly lit glowed with some elfish glee what a menagerie he said i dont suppose if you searched through all england and goodness knows there are monstrosities enough everywhere that youd find such a collection the whole lot of them ought to go into barnums show look at granny she would be the worldfamous animated corpse shes not alive shes been dead for centuries and ive got some uncanny power of animating her is she immortal do you think an immortal corpse will she see us all out i shouldnt wonder colin sat down on a bench by the yew hedge drawing violet gently with him but after all she only comes on for her evening turn he said and it rather amuses me to hear her talk about raymond shes almost a museum piece isnt she theyll send down from the british museum some day and say her case is ready for her and theyll put her in some room full of anglosaxon remains really im rather proud of her shes a bore of course but there are worse things than bores aunt hester for instance what an awful old woman what a grizzly kitten shes prinking before the glass now ill bet because i said all the handsome young men in london were in love with her theres an object lesson for you as to how not to grow old a cocotte of sixtyi think i shall tell nino to make love to her she would marry him im sure if he asked her colin paused and violet could guess what was coming next yet theres a sort of entertainment about aunt hester he said it amuses me to see how silly and preposterous she can be but what about your deadly old father darling what can be said for uncle ronald he waited to see if violet could find anything to say for uncle ronald dont bother your head over trying to find a decent point about him he said its so comfortable being able to talk him over quite frankly with you because youve never had the slightest real feeling for him and so i can say whats in my mind without fear of hurting you and probably i know him better than you for its my privilege to sit over the table with him when youve taken the female part of the menagerie out of dinner and to see him at his most characteristic moments hes really himself you know then when i entice him out of his eclipse of sobriety and he gets a little squiffy he comes out then the shadow of temperance passes off his bloated old face she interrupted him still shuddering at him ah youre dreadful she said why do you let him get like that you encourage him to it amuses you in some horrible manner to see him degrade himself lord he doesnt need much encouragement said colin i fancy he encourages himself quite sufficiently when im not there to help him tomorrow i shall just look at the cellarbook and see how much he has encouraged himself since ive been away dont misunderstand me now wilfully or unintentionally and think that i grudge him drinking a bottle or two of port every night even though hes rapidly finishing all the vintage which is quite irreplaceable what i object to is that i should have to sit there and see him growing more purple and nauseous while hes doing it but clearly as long as hes with us i cant be so inhospitable as to stint my own uncle and your father of the only thing he cares about certainly i wish he would take to whisky so that other guests of mine might get a few glasses of wine before he has finished it all but uncle ronald doesnt begin on whisky till he goes to the smokingroom the filthy old pig cigarette darling it will soothe you violet got up colin i cant stay and listen to you talking about my father like that she said it amuses you to make him drink and its horrible of you colin lit his cigarette with great deliberation well if you cant stay and listen to me he said you can go away but youre not going you want to hear what ive got to say next ah you sit down again i notice he threw the match away and again put his arm through violets i dont grudge him his wine he said because i want everybody to do as he pleases he may drink himself into his grave as soon as he likes or sooner for all i care and in fact i give him the shovel so to speak to dig himself in but what i do grudge is the damnable infliction of his company on me and uncle ronald seems to think that stanier belongs to him i hinted ever so gently tonight that i supposed he would settle down in london when he comes back from aix and he said that was out of the question because he couldnt possibly think of leaving granny now i hated that to begin with granny has no more use for him than she has for a toothache and also its quite untrue supposing grannyit doesnt seem likelywere to die he wouldnt dream of leaving stanier unless i kicked him out and what i hated most was his notion that he has a right to live at stanier and guzzle and snore his days away hes got a house in london let him go and live there and since he cant leave granny i suppose hell take her with him aunt margaret will go too then though it doesnt matter what aunt margaret does as its impossible to tell whether shes there or not sometimes im afraid of sitting down on her by mistake its dreadfully difficult to be aware of her of course when one is aware of her shes a crashing bore she fills up space somehow without putting anything there such a lady too all her nature is swallowed up in being a lady after all vi theyve paid stanier a nice long visit something over twenty years off and on and chiefly on but isnt it time almost that the menagerie went to a new place barnum used to travel you know they all do violet had never contemplated any possibility of such a thing nor imagined that colin would always at stanier there had been this background of relatives what would it be like to be here alone with colin as if he had heard her unspoken thought he answered it and you and i are never together alone vi he said never since our honeymoon at capri have we been alone do you want to be she asked he laughed no darling i should hate it i only wanted to see how you would look if i suggested it you looked just as i imagined you would but i daresay that wont often happen dont be alarmed now ive inserted into uncle ronalds mind the notion that perhaps when he comes back to england from aix he might live at his own charges for a bit and i want you tomorrow to touch on it again in a little while he will get it into his head not at once of course one couldnt expect that tell him he may take away all the port that he hasnt already drunk that may be an inducement or there maynt be much in it i will go through the cellarbook granny im afraid wont go with him though he cant leave her we shall have a lot of people here all the autumn i expect and uncle ronald isntwell he isnt really up to parties any more he behaves as if he was alone he makes windy noises in his throat and well begin to ask aunt hester for certain dates dont you know the twelfth to the seventeenth underlined stanier has always been a home to the older generation said violet i dont know how father will take it hell take it neat probably said colin but i really dont see why because stanier has always been a geological museum for family fossils it should continue to be thats all about that darling please do as i tell you ah and hows dennis very flourishing and learning to walk so quickly thats good and any signs of character yet emerging asked colin only the desire to investigate and explore colin about the other matter he interrupted her i know what you are going to say darling he said you will tell me to do my own dirty work though of course youll put it much more politely was that it yes its your house and if you choose to turn my father and mother out you must do it yourself colin patted her hand well well dont let us quarrel on the very evening i come home he said i just note that you dont intend to do as i ask you but i daresay youll be very glad to before long now about dennis he likes investigating and exploring does he thats like me we must feed him with plenty of material direct his attention as he grows to all sorts of things early impressions are so important they form a childs character and mind so psychoanalysts say and you never can tell what may be impressing itself i must see a lot of dennis he laughed quietly to himself a soft purring laugh and a sudden wave of terror came over her at this beautiful and awful boyhe looked no more than a boywhom she loathed and loved to her there was something sinister and menacing in his saying that he must see a lot of dennis that a childs character was determined by its early impression what impressions would he feed dennis with oh colin she cried clutching at his hand for gods sake let dennis escape the curse of the legend dont make him evil colin threw back his head and laughed aloud was there ever such a ridiculous woman he cried what on earth do you mean you speak as if i was intending to mix brandy with his milk to give him a taste for drink or bid him look at aunt hester to get a taste for cocottes or at dear aunt margaret to stunt his intelligence really darling the moon must be exercising a lunatic influence on you youre not very complimentary you know in fact i should say you were damned rude only i never say that sort of thing you tell me im a wicked fellow with a taste for corrupting the mind of a baby at the bottle lets go indoors or therell be a madwoman to add to the menagerie chapter ii colin woke next morning to a serene sense of wellbeing while still too drowsy to question himself on the cause of this sunny sleepy happiness he knew it was there then he remembered that he was at stanier which alone might account for this content at waking and one after another fresh interests and anticipated amusements came bubbling into his mind that talk with violet in the moonlight last night embodied several of them but there was another which interested him more he drew himself up in bed and took from the table by it a great pile of typewritten sheets the perusal of which had caused him so late and absorbed a session last night there was the transcript now made for the first time of the memoirs written by his elizabethan ancestor to whom and to whose bargain the fortunes of the house were wondrously due when last he went to london he had taken the original volume with him for reproduction in more legible form for the text was written in a strange crabbed hand the ink of which was dim with age and was so difficult to follow that the mere decipherment of it occupied the mind to the exclusion of the appreciation of the text but the fragments which he had puzzled out were so sprightly and entertaining that he had determined to procure a less distracted study of the whole colin had read last night with fascinated glee the account of the early life of his ancestral namesake who analysed his own nature not in tedious terms of abstract tendencies but by the far more convincing method of putting down just what he did and letting his actions analyse for him he admirably sketched his boyhood in the days when the marsh was still largely undrained and the whiteplumed avocets bred there when the tall ships came up fullsailed on the tide to rye and the smugglers brought in barrels of hollands and if caught were summarily hanged his father ronald stanier whom he succinctly described as a drunken sot how charmingly did heredity reproduce the type was a farmer with fat acres and full flocks who dissolved his substance in drink he was barbarously harsh to the boy and to his wife whom he tamed from her shrewish ways into obedience and silence and used to beat them both till there came a day when colin had no mind to take any more strappings and soundly thrashed his own father and this i did he wrote with great pleasure not only because i served him as he had served me and with a stronger arm but because i had always hated him he described his own queer power over animals a savage dog would never bite him an unruly horse behaved itself when he came near it and that was strange because i had no love for animals and indeed no love at all i made good pretence for so folk were kind to me and i liked a wench well enough for my own pleasure to which she ministered but all i loved was my own strength and my own beauty which they loved too colin had got to this point last night and now sitting up in bed ran over the pages again how amazingly history repeated itself there more than three centuries ago was ronald stanier the drunken sot and the tamed silent wife who was the mother of staniers and there above all three centuries ago was his very self incarnate surely in the bodily tabernacle of his ancestor he and his handsome face which the wenches loved and his heart which hated love and loved hate and then came the story of the legend told with sober conviction by the beneficiary himself the boy had gone that day it was a week before easter to see the queen pass through rye and luck attended him for he had been at hand when her graces horse stumbled and she would have had a fall had he not run forward and caught her in his arms and i knelt after she had released me from her flat bosom he recounted and gave her just such a look as i would give to a wench at a fair and i saw this pleased her she told him to wait on her at the manor of brede next day and he went back to the lambing for the ewes were fruitful and his father was drunk and all that afternoon and deep into the night he was busy with his midwifery and finally he threw himself down on a heap of straw in the shepherds hut for a few hours sleep before morning he woke while it was yet dark but dark though it was he could see that a fine tall fellow dressed in red stood by him who revealed himself as none other than satan he promised him all that his heart could desire of health and wealth of beauty and honour and affluence if in return for these gifts he would sign away his soul i cared little for my soul so ran the account and i cared much for honour and wealth and further he did promise me that our bargain should hold good for the heirs and descendants of this my body if they should choose to take advantage of it so quickly we were at terms and he gave me pen and parchment and i pricked my arm for ink and signed in my blood the deed he had prepared which deed he bade me keep as testimony to our pleasant bargain then shone there a strong flash of light in my eyes and i cried out and fell back on the straw where i had been sleeping and he was gone from me and the night was yet black round me but this was no dream for the parchment was in my hand and then came a blink of lightning and i saw that my signature of blood was still wet colin gave a gasp of pure pleasure and surprise what an inimitable touch of veracity was that no one could have invented that the experience fantastic and dipped in medival superstition was absolutely and literally real to the writer he described what he saw in this firsthand contemporary record the legend of faust lived again in unadorned and literal simplicity since then it had come into sad disrepute becoming merged in cookedup tales and elaborate myths marlowe had made a tragedy of it and gothe fishing it up had built a dreary and tedious philosophy on it and gounod had made an opera of it but here was the same story plain and vivid without comment or moralizing faust himself was describing just what happened colin turned the page authentic and eyewitnessed surely as was that touch about the blood being still wet there were difficulties insuperable ones about accepting the story of the legend in connection with the parchment now let into the frame of old colins portrait here was a perfectly ignorant shepherdboy who almost certainly could neither read nor write subscribing his name to a document which was if the parchment was authentic written in latin the most credulous could hardly swallow that he read on i had no skill then either to read or write but there still wet and red was what i had written after that i slept soundly and in the morning i got home and hid away the parchment and went to wait on the queens grace as she had bade me at the manor of brede of that i will tell presently but here first will i tell of the parchment and what befell for presently i was attached to her graces court as her page and there i learned both to read and write and latin i learned too for she loved to speak in latin and show her wisdom and learning which indeed was no great affair then could i see that though on that night in the sheepfold i had no knowledge of writing yet i had signed my name very scholarly and clerklike and in the hand that was mine when i had learned to write then too i could read what therein was promised me riches and honour all of which came to pass as for the parchment itself i kept that secretly and told no man of it for they burn at the stake those who have had dealings with my lord and benefactor and i had no wish to suffer such a fate for my soul i have no care i do not reckon my soul at the worth of a doit but it would be a grievous thing to be burned thought i while my life was yet strong in me and the lusts of the flesh sweet so i told no man of the matter except only in after years my two sons each of them when he came of age i had brought them up with both precept and example for their profit and they knew what manner of man their father was and how mightily he prospered and how it went ill with those who crossed him and so when their time came to know of the parchment and to make their choice it was no wonder that they chose with wisdom and prudence even as i had done now let me write what so wonderfully befell when next morning i walked to brede and waited on the queen just so far had colin got in his reading when nino his valet came in to call him usually colin slept like a child till he was roused often nino had to twitch his bedclothes or rattle with cans before he could raise him out of these tranquil deeps awake signor said nino in surprise yes very much so said colin morning nino ive been reading about what i was like rather more than three hundred years ago nino put his letters and the morning paper by the bedside there was no one in the world to whom colin felt more akin than to him nino was southern and gay and had the morals of a sleek black panther in the italian fashion he had made colin his chief interest in life he was devoted to him and was quite without fear of him in ninos eyes whatever colin did was right nino beamed over this unintelligible remark all that mattered was that colin was pleased and used i to call you in the morning then he asked noone called me in the morning as far as ive got said colin i was a shepherdboy with bare feet what sort of a day is it nino i brought it straight from capri said nino hot hot ever so hot ill bathe then said colin getting out of bed bring some clothes along nino just flannels come and bathe too i hate bathing alone and bring my tea with you ill drink it after my bath the morning as nino had said was already very hot but the dew of the night before had been heavy and in the shadow the grass was still shining with it and the smell of the wet earth was fragrant with liquid freshness colin kicked off his shoes for the pleasure of walking barefooted and for very lightness of heart ran whistling down the grass slope to the lake there was a bathing shed on the bank towards the deep end with steps and springboard and next moment he had stripped off his pyjamas and stood poised to cleave the deep water where the rhododendrons and the white balustrade of the sluice were unwaveringly reflected taut as an arrow of sunlit limbs he flicked outwards from the board and disappeared in a fountain of foam he rose to the surface and struck out into the lake swimming with overhead stroke his shoulders gleaming as they lifted themselves alternately his golden head now awash and now glistening in the sunlight as it emerged then when he was halfway across the lake and opposite the sluice he turned and swam straight towards it there the water was deepest and there it slept in the shadow of the bushes and now he dipped his head and dived scooping with his arms and pulling himself downwards down down he pressed till the twilight of the depths closed round him and the bright surface above was veiled and dim the water was markedly colder here and he thought how cold it must have been to raymond when the ice was thick above then turning he kicked out and shot upwards again into the sunshine and the sweet air nino had followed hard on him bringing his clothes and his tea and as colin came to the surface again there he was on the headerboard ready to dive colin swam towards him see if you can get to the bottom nino he said where its deep opposite the sluice nino rose from his plunge and laughed shaking the water from his face scusi signor he said but i do not like the depth below that is the place for the dead colin laughed back at him so it is he said down among the dead men theres a song about it i dont insist on your going there yet grazie molte grazie said nino soon colin paddled to land and lay basking on the grass never had he felt the current of life run more strongly through him tingling for some outlet of selfexpression and yet just to be alive was enough here in the home of his inheritance which he about whom he had been reading last night and this morning had built to the glory of himself and those who came after and it was more than kinship he seemed to claim with that engaging ruffian it was identity the memoirs shewed him his own mirrored self astonishingly revealed there was much more of them to come at present he had but read a chapter or two the sincerity of which he could vouch for by the picture it gave not of the writer only but of himself he burned with his passions bubbled with his hatreds revelled in the largesse of his lord and benefactor he had his son too whom one day he would initiate into the evil sacrament and like colin of old he would let dennis see how mightily his father prospered in his allegiance and how it went ill with those who crossed him so that when the time came for denniss choice he would choose with wisdom and prudence as old colins sons had done as yet he was but a baby scarcely able to walk but soon he would learn what splendid paths were hewn for him how royal a road the future lay before colin wrapped in this sunlit mist much as the plain of the marsh lay swathed in pearly vapours soon the heat would fold up that soft mantle of the cool night and the plain glitter in the sunsteeped noon and just so with him would the future emerge and shew its discovered delights he had no wish to brush the mists away or dive and grope into that obscurity all would grow clear as his own life rose towards its noon as for the evening and the decay of day which would follow it was idle to give a thought to them days were long in summer and the day was given for enjoyment he was a fool who wasted its goodly hours in thinking of what came next after it was done sufficient unto the day was the good thereof he lay back on the cool green grass while his body and limbs still wet with his bathe drank in the kindly heat purring with sheer physical satisfaction the activity of his vigour for the moment was satiated with his plunge and his swim the bodily demands desired nothing more than this freshness and effulgence which soaked through his skin into his very marrow and fed it with youth and pliant strength sinew and nerve and bone lay still and sunned and stretched content with this blissful passivity it could not last long soon their vigour would stir and twitch in them again and even as they drowsed and purred so for the moment his soul and the desires that lay behind the body were satisfied with the mere fact that he was at stanier in the midst of all that was his uncle ronald with his gaping codfish mouth aunt hester with her ridiculous sprightliness his grandmother that image of death in life violet even with her horror and love of him were mere puppets of a show over which he pulled down the curtain but this quiescence of the spirit was less lasting than that of his physical vigour and even while he lay slack and stretched with his arm over his eyes to shield them from the glare and his body still sunned itself without asking anything more than to lie open and naked alertness and the twitch of activity began to beat in the pulses of his brain again there was a broth of immediate interest bubbling there violet had been tiresome last night she had said she would not give a hint to her father and mother that they were not wanted he must move in that matter himself then and make her sorry she had struck that filial attitude and then there were the memoirs to read which revealed him to himself and there was dennis this stirring of his soul began to react on his body it was delicious to lie here with the cool grass below and the sun above but one could not do that for ever he rolled over on to his side and saw nino sitting by him nino its almost like basking at capri he said i shall come down again after breakfastwhat time is it nino pulled a watch out of the pocket of his coat that lay on the grass ten oclock he said colin sat up then why the devil didnt you tell me it was getting late he snapped i thought you looked happy said nino what does the time matter signor if youre happy colin laughed thats a very sound observation he said but you ought to have told me i was already late for breakfast never mind give me my clothes ive got a lot to do yes shirt and trousers and shoes thats all i want nino but for a towel round his loins was still as nature had made him but she had done it very nicely and as he handed his master his clothes colin looked at his shapely shoulders and broad chest youd make an awfully good bronze statue nino he said youd look nice in a museum covered with verdigris and with an arm and leg missing how would you like to be an antique i like better being young said nino colin pulled his shirt over his head so do i he said but times a thief nino and you cant insure against his burglaries this was too much for ninos english and he raised a puzzled eye you understand what i mean though you dont understand what i say observed colin do you believe in god nino the boy crossed himself si signor then why are you such a dreadful bad lot asked colin dont you know that he will punish you when youre dead nino shrugged his brown shoulders may be he said but im not dead yet colin laughed nor am i he said but why talk theology before breakfast scusi said nino but who began colin leaned against him as he stepped into his flannel trousers i did he said do you know youre extremely like me nino i think you must be a stanier i wonder if the old fellow ive been reading about had an italian mistress from whom youre descended we both believe in god and are determined to go to the devil there you are talking theology again and i told you to shut up i am dumb as a sheep said nino baaa said colin colin found his menagerie at breakfast as he came in coatless with his hair drying back into curls again and his shirt open at the neck with sleeves rolled up to his elbow there was aunt hester looking so he thought to himself like some aged hag under the delusion that it was still springtime with her the absurd old woman with her short skirt and girlish blouse and beribboned hat and there was uncle ronald blearyeyed and unsavoury beyond all words in a velveteen coat with his gouty knobbed hand all atremble as he lifted his teacup and there was aunt margaret looking as she always did as if the bells were ringing for church on sunday morning and she was just ready to start i wonder what she finds to accuse herself of in the confession thought colin a want of diligence over her patience i suppose and there with face suddenly and involuntarily lit up at his entrance and as suddenly clouded again was violet good morning everybody he said im late and im not dressed and im not sorry because ive been enjoying myself darling aunt hester why didnt you come down to bathe you would make the most seductive waternymph and why has nobody got a complexion like yours give me a kiss if you dont mind my being unshaved face like a peach said hester talk of complexions aunt hester we mustnt flirt with so many relatives present said colin youll shock violet uncle ronald you look awfully fit this morning thats the effect of good doctor colin coming home and seeing that you took that medicine for your gout now im going to make a nice dogs dinner for myself fish and bacon and a poached egg all on one plate whats everybody going to do this morning sit in my skeleton like that wag sidney smith said aunt hester when and where asked colin i want to come and look you must have got a delicious skeleton aunt hester neednt ask what violets going to do shes going to attend a threehours service of babyworship violet and i talked about dennis last night didnt we darling she wants to make him a string of amulets to keep off evil spirits sensible idea its a wicked world and aunt margarets going to write out menucards and uncle ronalds to take a glass of my famous sunmedicine at eleven youre all provided for well and what are you going to do asked hester me studious morning aunt hester over my books books indeed said aunt hester wheres the use of reading books when youre young when youve got to sit by the chimneycorner and keep your feet warm thens the call for books for they pass the time and make you drop off and have a snooze ive not taken to books yet thank god colin laughed my dear you talk about taking to books as if it was like taking to drink he said doesnt she uncle ronald eh what i beg your pardon colin said he uncle ronald was not very bright at breakfast he liked to be left alone to drink several cups of strong tea after that he could toy with a little toast and marmalade i was only saying that aunt hester regards reading as a vice in the young like drink and hopes i shant take to it yet colin let his laughing eye dwell on ronald long enough to be assured that he took in some of this and then on violet to see that she had arrived then he turned to aunt hester again one of the books i am going to read this morning is entirely about drink aunt hester he said and nobody can guess what it is theres nothing but drink in it from beginning to end guess aunt hester oh one of those rubbishy novels said hester seven and sixpence worth of gibberish dont ask me not a novel at all said colin every word in it is true in fact its the cellarbook and i shall see how much gin youve drunk aunt hester since ive been away and then if i find youve drunk it all so that theres none left for uncle ronald and me i shall go down to the lake and drown myself and haunt you ever afterwards oh lord i wish somebody would stop me talking such awful drivel tell us about your new patience aunt margaret mrs stanier folded up her napkin very neatly she would do the same with the napkin given her at lunch she would fold up her napkin when the last trump sounded im afraid i havent got a new patience colin she said ah the old is better you must teach me one of your patiences someday violet and i must learn patience to occupy the autumn evenings when were alone here colin was halfinclined to reconsider his plan for sending the menagerie on tour just as the lover is happiest when the object of his affection is with him so dislike and contempt sun themselves in the presence of their derision for it supplies them with fuel it was amusing to plant little stinging darts to speak of drink to uncle ronald to flick violet with an allusion to their solitary evenings in the autumn to make everybody uncomfortable with the threat that he would drown himself in the lake for that reminded them of raymond these darts were feathered with his gay inimitable geniality which charmed and enchanted with that sunniness that warmed their cold old bones for so the point stung more smartly certainly that allusion to the time when he and violet would be alone here gave them all something to think about colin before settling down to the memoirs again sent for his butler and the cellarbook and rather enjoyed the fact that uncle robert had been consuming the port at a steady average of a bottle and a half a day he was a sodden old brute of course but as drink was all that he cared about it shewed sense to annex as much as possible of the very best for he always it appeared asked for that memorable vintage but though it was an agreeable diversion to look at his tremulous unsightliness of a morning it did not counterweigh the heavy burden of his presence and he had better go violet would have to convey that to him if only for the reason that she had said she would not colin thought he had a persuasive device about that all this was very trumpery and with a sense of turning to something better worth his attention he took up the memoirs again and soon found himself delightfully absorbed in them never was there so sincere and unvarnished an autobiography the author rejoiced in his presentation of himself most men when they paint themselves cannot avoid dipping their brush in the medium if not of conscious falsity at least in that of selfdeception they view themselves with a kindly eye they gloss over or tone down even to the point of omission their uglier characteristics they emphasise what is creditable they find a sympathetic reason for their occasional frailties all this may be honest enough in intention for the reason that they have hoodwinked themselves and really see themselves in such and such a light but here colin found an honesty transcendent and diverting for this ancestor of his had no desire conscious or subconscious to fashion an edifying image of himself he had no mind to be decorated with virtuous phylacteries and with plain deft strokes he presented this evil and sincere picture of himself that picture was mirror as well as portrait and it took colins breath away to see himself so unerringly delineated so the shepherdboy waited on the queen next morning at the manor of brede he had not dressed himself up in his best but came in his shepherds garb shirt and breeches and shoes and he carried with him his crook and a young lamb the varlets would have driven him from the door but that he said it was by the queens orders that he presented himself and they knowing the whims of that fiery dame sent word to the controller of her household that a lousy lad demanded audience of her grace lad indeed i was indited the writer but no lousy one for i had washed the muck of my lambing off me and had bathed myself in the rother and i was cleaner and sweeter than any of they so out came the queens controller a pursey fellow and he too would have shooed me away but i told him fairly there would be trouble for him if her grace knew that i had been turned from her door he went to tell her grace and presently came back faster than he had gone and brought me speedily into the queens presence me and my lamb and my crook there she sat at the end of a great table where she had been holding a council and she said never a word but watched me so i bent my eyes on the ground but i lifted up my heart to my lord and benefactor and prayed that he should guide my doings and well he counselled me i put myself in his hands and thought no more what i should do or say but trusted him and i walked past the long table towards where she sat and the rushes on the floor pricked the soles of my feet for i had left my shoes outside once only did i look up and saw her still watching me out of those sharp eyes with their high eyebrows how little was her face i thought and how red her hair and how fine her ruff and how yellow her skin and this was the queen of england then i looked down again and walked until i saw close in front of my bare toes the tip of her shoes set with pearls and then i knelt down and bowed myself and said a lamb madam which is the first fruits of the spring my crook which i lay at your graces feet and myself who am not worthy to lie there then i raised my eyes and looked at her gay and bold as i look at the wenches for wench she was though the queen of england and then once more as if blinded by her splendour i abased myself and she spoke look at me colin stanier she said madam said i well what next quoth she impatiently my body and soul madam said i and i made my eyes dance at her and my mouth to be eager she bent towards me and drew her hand down my cheek and is your desire to be my shepherdboy colin she asked you desire to be my page i am sick with desire said i i appoint you says she i greet and salute you colin stanier now i had just that pause for consideration as she stroked my cheek and tweaked my chin but even then when i was but a downy boy i never thought long whether i should do this or that or should forbear and i knew that a man fares better by taking risks than by shunning them if he has his way to make i knew too how a wench looks at a lad when she would like to be kissed by him how her neck goes forward to him and she turns her chin and queen or whore they are all alike in that so my mind was made up and straight i kissed her cheek for she had saluted me as her page and was i not to salute my queen which when i had done i abased myself again and kissed her smelly shoe you bold dog says she stand up i might well have you whipped for that and i should still be the infinite gainer your majesty said i and she laughed that good thought then was the first of the benefits which my lord gave me and there was no whipping for me but for the slap she gave me on the ear and her grace clapped her hands and in came the controller of her household colin stanier is my page said she and attached to my person see to it and at the feast of easter i will dine off his lamb begone colin stanier and learn your duties and see that you serve not the wenches as you have served me so there was colin stanier who last night had been among the ewes translated as at the wave of a magicians wand into the queens page he returned home only to take from its hidingplace the bond he had signed and within a week he had his fine new clothes and was in waiting on his mistress never for a moment such was the conviction that inspired the record of his swift advancement in the favour of the queen and in the idolatry no less of the court did he doubt to whom he owed his amazing good fortune swiftly he acquired the art of reading and writing and by the next easter time he was the queens page no longer but her private and confidential adviser and secretary the same felicity which had marked his first audacious dealing with her in the character of wench never failed him but he had a true appreciation of her fiery magnificence and courage as well as of those aged tendernesses of a childless woman who makes an idol of a boy or a lapdog to quench the thirst of her virginity no lapdog indeed was colin he could stand up to her in her foaming rages with her ministers when they gave her spiritless advice in her dealings with trouble at home and political crises abroad and with an oath she would say i cannot abide their twittering diplomacy i shall go my own way for when all is said and done i am queen of england eh colin am i not in the rights of it and she tweaked her secretarys rosy ear as he sat at her elbow very often she was not in the rights of it and then colin would indicate further arguments prefacing them by saying as your grace has sagaciously told us there is this too to be considered with such deftness that though she had but so lately affirmed the flat contrary he would make her believe that she had pointed these things out herself whoever rose or fell in that fickle favour colin remained there firmly rooted and his advocacy with the queen was the surest way to secure the granting of a boon or the lightening of her displeasure my lord of leicester came to me one day he recorded for he was sadly out of favour with her grace and besought me to intercede for him nothing that he could do or say would meet with her approbation he feared she would deprive him of his offices and worse than that if her anger against him blazed up he knew well that a word from me would cause it to do so for i had but to tell her that he had laughed at her latinity and said that any youth in kings college at cambridge would be whipped for such grammatical errors as she made it was pleasant to me to remind him of that for not long before he had called me an upstart and a bumpkin from the marshes and now he was a suppliant to the bumpkin and well he had to pay for the bumpkins good word with the queen and it was not for that alone that he must sue to me first by reason of his insolence he must make me his friend and bleed for his unwisdom in slighting me otherwise i threatened him that it would be my sad duty to inform her grace how poorly he thought of her latinity he was wise enough to see with my eyes and rich enough to load my pocket and so i bled him famously and when i supped alone with her grace that night and had delighted her with the bawdy talk that she loves i told her that my lord of leicester was the unhappiest of her subjects for she had withdrawn her light from him and fool though he was he had the wisdom to know that he must presently perish of cold if the beam of her favour was not restored to him she was loathe to hear me at first but i pleaded with her and let her cuddle me and said it befitted not her splendour to grudge a ray to my lords sorry dunghill no flattery was too gross for her she would believe she lit the stars at night and presently i had my way with her and i was wise in keeping faith with lord leicester though it would have pleased me better to have taken his money and then have told the queen that he thought very poorly of her latin and i doubt not that my lord and benefactor would have liked me so to do but i had yet my way to make and my future to see to and none would sue to me if i did not keep my bargains sheer blackmail said colin to himself as he turned the page and he delights in it that was half the fun i wonder what my lord of leicester paid him while he was yet but five and twenty the queen created him earl of yardley decorated him with the most noble order of the garter and bestowed on him the monastery and lands of tillingham where soon he built the house of stanier she often told him that it was time for her colin to take a wife to himself but in this with a sure wisdom he positively refused to obey her saying that venus herself had no charms for him while glorianas light was shed on him and thus though he disobeyed the letter of her graces command she did not disapprove of the spirit which prompted his obstinacy but he sought and copiously found consolations for his celibacy and he devoted a long section of his memoirs to the account of them and of the diversions of his bachelorhood he gave a list of the women whose favours he sought and obtained but indeed he commented it was they rather who sought me though i was nothing loathe for youth is the time for pleasure and enumerated their charms or their defects as in his dealings with my lord of leicester his favours must be paid for though i accomplished some pretty seductions for my own pleasure of which i was speedily weary never a hint of love of devotion or of affection seemed to have dawned on him he sought his own pleasure and profit and what above all made to him the spice of these adventures was their wickedness he described at length how the spectacle of the love and devotion between a certain sir james bland and his young wife irritated him and how with a view to wrecking it he first made friends with the husband thereby to gain an intimate footing in their house and cover his ulterior purpose while he made himself cold to his friends wife she was accustomed to draw the eyes of men after her though she had no eyes for any but her lord and it piqued her to see i was indifferent to her presently for all wenches are alike in heart she must needs lay herself out to attract me and i softened towards her so that there were not three gayer folk in all london than this devoted pair and their attached friend this way and that i drew her into my net so that she cooled to her husband and became weary and restless and discontent and then my lord and benefactor whispered to me that the time was ripe and before long nought would restrain her but she cast herself at my feet and so i gave her her way once or twice but very soon she was tedious to me but i was very merry all that month colin threw back his head and laughed i was very merry all that month how well he knew the inward glee that this old kinsman of his must have experienced at the accomplishment of this pleasing design he had been in harmony with himself all that month that was what made him merry and of course when the thing was done it was done and who that was truly alive cared to dwell on an achievement he had bitten into the fruit and swallowed its mellow flesh and now there was but the rind and the stone which he spat out there were plenty more such fruits when he felt thirsty no need then to mouth the stone and squeeze out the last drop of juice from the rind naked cruelty and the pleasure of seeing others suffer gave the savour to this and other adventures and he described how he had gone to see a recusant tortured on the rack till the joints were wrenched from their sockets colin could understand that too he got up out of his chair stretched himself and strolled to the window which looked out over the terrace and the lake there was aunt hester sitting in the shade of the yewhedge looking like some foolish autumnal butterfly and close at hand on the terrace was dennis in his perambulator some day colin would read these memoirs with him and explain what he did not understand there would be some years to wait yet eleven or twelve perhaps till dennis had been a term or two at school that kneaded the dough of a boys mind it was ready then to be moulded it was soft and pliable and leavened then violet came out of the house she stood close to the window out of which colin looked she did not see him for her eyes were on her son take him out of his pram nurse she called and see if he can get as far as me dennis come to me dennis dennis was lifted out paddling in the air and set down on the terrace again violet called and he looked this way and that unable to localize the sound though recognizing his name suddenly he saw his mother and giving a crow of delight staggered towards her colin forgot about the memoirs for a moment there was violet stooping down with arms outstretched to the boy her face all radiant with motherhood and love and at the sight of her colin felt that exasperated impatience which love always provoked in him it was not for anything that dennis could give her that this beam transfigured her it was just because he was dennis from her he looked at the child maintaining that difficult balance which every moment threatened to topple and there too in that dimpled laughing face bright with the glory of this heroic adventure there shone the same that was even more exasperating to his mind while a childs intelligence was as elementary and undeveloped as this there was this instinct triumphantly asserting itself love seemed to be as natural as breathing and far more natural than walking dennis had now got on the high seas the safe harbour of the nurse with the perambulator was to him hugely remote and equally remote was the harbour for which he was steering and though he was progressing bravely across the billows of this perfectly level sea the awful loneliness of his position suddenly overcame him he staggered he put his advancing foot in a most untenable position collapsed on the ground and sent up a signal of distress in a piercing yell before colin knew what he was doing he had opened the window not hurt is he violet he called she looked round her face still all aglow but her brightness faded as she saw him oh no im sure he isnt she said put him on his feet again nurse come dennis youre half way already colin waited a moment longer till the adventure outside was happily accomplished rather astonished at himself for having taken any notice of it he had felt he supposed just a sporting interest to see whether dennis would stay the course he was sorry when he came to grief then he went back to his far more congenial occupation he embarked now on the account of the building of stanier and the collection of its treasures this for the next two years was clearly the great diversion and achievement of his ancestors energies the queens death which occurred when he was thirty was but casually mentioned with a shrewd recognition of her greatness and an impatient gibe for her vanity and a congratulation for himself for having used her weakness as a quarry for the building of his own wealth and splendour her last gift to him was the great sapphire that flawless and unique stone which the queen had worn every day when her fleet was out to meet the armada priceless in itself it was supposed to be a talisman which brought its owner prosperity in all he undertook after her death there had been an attempt on the part of the crown renewed again when the hanoverian dynasty came to the throne to repossess itself of the jewel on the grounds that it belonged to the regalia and so could not be bestowed but both times these efforts had failed and the winking cornflower splendour still reposed in the jewelsafe at stanier a queens gift worth a kings ransom lucky it was said the memoirs author that so few days before her graces death i had so mightily pleased her for that was her last and noblest gift to me and that was the finest fruit that i had plucked from my bargain to my lord and benefactor i owe it who shewed me how to please her grace so mightily that she gave me the most precious of all her jewels equally cursory was the mention of his marriage with the daughter and heiress of sir john reeve though he gave a detailed list of property which this illfated young woman brought to the house two sons were born to him and soon after having secured these great estates he secured his wifes divorce and presently married the only daughter and child of lord middlesex she gave him no further heirs but brought considerable addition to his estates an unseemly woman so ran her husbands comment and of a most unseemly temper of which i would have none she was red as a fox but rich but these events apart perhaps from the birth of his two sons were no more than acts of routine in his career his passion was the creation of this palace and pleasaunce of stanier only twelve years had elapsed between the day when he had gone a barefooted shepherd boy with his crook and his lamb to wait upon the queen at brede and now at her death he retired from court life and came back earl and knight of the garter to his estates at tillingham his fathers farm was close by where the drunken old sot still lived and colin coveting it for the completion of his gardens found a way to dispute the ownership claiming that it was part of the monastic land devised him by the queen and turned the old man out he gave him however a decent enough dwellingplace for a man of his station and adequate maintenance and further allowed him to draw on his brewery for unlimited ale making only the provision that the old man should never attempt to see him or obtain access to him otherwise his maintenance should be withheld this indulgence in the matter of the brewery may have been kind in intention for assuredly the old man was fond of beer but the effect was that he did not long enjoy the bounty he was oftener drunk than sober and before the year was up he had a stroke of which he died meantime the great house was rising rapidly and in two years was complete up to the lettered balustrade where you might read in latin that unless the lord built the house their labour was but lost that built it and into it lord yardley poured the treasures that he was constantly acquiring oriental carpets and french tapestries chinese porcelain greek marbles and italian pictures all arts and ages were sought by him for there was kinship in all fine work and a greek relief of heracles and hylas might be flanked by a crucifixion by tintoret on one side and a portrait by rembrandt on the other he made too a wonderful collection of occult and magical books that told the student how he might acquire supernatural powers and among them was a missal as colin read of wondrous blasphemies out of doors the work was pushed forward with the same expedition the great terraced garden to the south of the house was levelled and stepped and encircled by the yewhedge below the dam was pushed out across the dip of the valley in which had stood the house of his youth and the lake formed he planted too on the bare upland east of the house the oaks that flourished there now at this point in the typewritten manuscript there came an annotation directing him to a certain page in the original memoirs and colin turned it up and found that it referred to a loose sheet in the book dated which was the year before the author died on this page was a rough sketch of the house and gardens as designed then and as they existed now but with the addition of certain buildings which apparently had never been erected but while the plan of the house as it stood was only roughly indicated this addition was drawn with considerable care and detail it looked therefore as if after the completion of the house this building was contemplated and planned but never carried out it consisted of a long passage leading out of the room where he now sat which had always been lord yardleys private room and communicating with a small house that stood at the distance of sixty yards on a knoll just outside the gardens it was onestoried and consisted of three rooms en suite labelled parlour bedchamber and diningroom with a kitchen and quarters for a servant but on the south side of it there was a spacious oblong room equal in length to the three rooms adjoining with a descriptive word attached to it this was only faintly pencilled in and was difficult to decipher the initial letter s was clear enough the second might have been o or c then came a long letter that might have been either t or l followed with room for another letter between by arium which was distinct and legible colin puzzled over this and then a very reasonable solution struck him the word no doubt was solarium implying an open gallery facing south on the long side as this did and either open to the air or fronted with big windows a wintersittingroom a sunning place simultaneously with a laugh the significance of this discreet little establishment struck him no doubt it was intended to be the quarters of the companion for the time being for he soon wearied of each with whom lord yardley solaced his leisure there would be an impropriety perhaps in her being actually housed in the same dwelling as his wife and his sons convenience and propinquity were alike served by her having her pleasant little establishment with its solarium at a short distance from the house and communicating with his own room the interpretation was reasonable simple and entertaining but to be sure it did not seem very characteristic of his ancestors methods to be so tender of the feelings of his wife and guard the morals of his sons from loose presences and though colin was pleased with his explanation and his decipherment of solarium he was not quite satisfied with it and put a slip of paper in the place meaning to refer to it again he turned back to the typewritten copy of which now not many pages remained for his perusal there was a short description of how on the coming of age of his two sons they each chose to be associated with the bargain he had made in the shepherds hut and indeed from the few details given about their characters and their escapades the choice could not have been a matter of much difficulty to these young gentlemen the younger in especial attached to the court of his majesty king james seemed to have been as perfect and appalling a young rogue as even his father could have wished then there followed the entry that today was the authors sixtyninth birthday and thanks to the everconstant goodness of his lord and benefactor his health and strength were still unabated and the pleasures of his youth still his he blessed the day now fiftyone years ago when he had chosen so wisely and well as the parchment now preserved in his strongroom testified how would i rejoice he wrote to build some shrine in honour of my lord where i would worship him who has wrought so great benefits upon me some sanctuary where i might worthily adore himand then suddenly in the middle of a sentence the memoirs came to an end colin put down the last sheet of the manuscript and leaned back in his chair he felt as if narcissuslike he had all the morning been regarding himself as shewn in this elizabethan mirror of his ancestors confessions it was his own spirit so undeviatingly reflected there and the contemplation of it was an act of selfrecognition all that he had read was a three hundred year old portrait of himself even as he might have sat for the great picture in the hall into the frame of which was now inserted the signed parchment of the bargain whatever was the literal and the material truth about that his ancestor clearly who might be expected to know confirmed it there could be none about its spiritual authenticity noone who had seen the memoirs could possibly have any doubt about that and colin knew that he like most others of his race eagerly associated himself with the bargain he knew too that his choice was solid and real and no fantastic imagining there was god on one side there was satan on the other he had rejected god and not only for the benefits attached but because he preferred evil to good he had chosen satan hate and evil were dear to him he had no use for love there came the sound of the bell for luncheon and he got up it was a strange thing that anyone so diligent in evil as the old man had been should at the end of his life have turned coward and twitterer in the way he had done his last year on earth had been a terrible one for so family tradition averred and indeed the thing was attested terror of what was coming fastened on his flesh like a monstrous growth and he wrote no more in his diary of the sins that were so dear to him he practised pious and charitable deeds restoring the monastery church on the altar of which he had often played dice he endowed almshouses in rye he bought great tomes of the works of christian fathers and of the meditations of the saints and hour after hour he used to sit in the library to study these under the tuition of a priest who resided in the house and ministered at the church and no doubt it was then that he destroyed or dispersed that great collection of magical and occult works which he had brought together for no vestige of them was now extant here he cut himself off from the pleasures of youth he fasted and prayed in the hope of turning away the fate at which all his life he had mocked and it was said that when on his knees he attempted to address the god whom he had rejected no prayer or holy words would come from his lips but that he mumbled unspeakable and obscene blasphemies he seemed in fact so it appeared to colin to have gone crazy and though he continued throughout that year in the full serenity of his physical health he let himself be the prey of his disordered and terrified soul turning and truckling not in love but in abject fear of the destiny he had chosen to him whose spirit he had defied it was firmly rooted in his head that he would die on his seventieth birthday and that indeed no doubt because he so firmly believed it came to pass and in an appalling manner for he gave a feast that night to his tenants in honour of his birthday and had risen to speak to them at the end of supper when he put out his arm as if pushing away some invisible presence and shrieking no no fell forward dead across the table at that moment there came a blinding flash of lightning which certainly struck the hall but those who were nearest to him said that his seizure had preceded the flash and that it and the roar of thunder that followed were rather the endorsement of that judgment than the judgment itself that year anyhow thought colin was a common and craven conclusion to his brilliant life he did not fancy that he himself would suffer so deplorable a collapse legend or no legend but in the interval he had more than all his ancestors lust for pleasure and his hatred of love he put the manuscript in a drawer of his table and with it the original copy of the diary for he was not satisfied about the plan of that establishment with the solarium it seemed unlikely but if the word which designated that building was not solarium what on earth could it be chapter iii colin went back to his room after the invariable rubber of whist that evening with the intention of studying this plan more minutely but though the others had gone upstairs he was not surprised to hear his door open and violet asking if she could speak to him indeed he almost expected that interruption and he smiled to himself when she entered there had been a horrid little scene at the close of dinner a dovecotefluttering in the menagerie arising from colins having instructed nino to dispense the wine and to be lavish in his ministrations to uncle ronalds glass the wine in question was dagonet to which he was incapable of putting up the smallest resistance and nino did his duty so thoroughly that uncle ronald had got on very quickly and had told a story which might possibly have passed with a snigger in a smokingroom of broadminded men even aunt hester who was as broadminded as most people had said better hold your tongue ronald youre disgracing yourself while that perfect piece of patience aunt margaret bridled and folded her napkin and diligently perused the menucard which she had so neatly written out though at that period of dinner its information was obsolete and then when the women had adjourned uncle ronald having been told that there was not much port left had partaken so freely of what there was that he had become wonderfully voluble about the old days when he and his father used to sit here together colin had taken ninos place as dispenser of wine and so sedulous was he that uncle ronald presently lost the power of coherent speech altogether and when he tried to rise leaned lamentably against the table and was assisted upstairs by the butler and nino which again was quite in accordance with the tradition of the house colin had joined the ladies alone and said that his uncle had gone to bed with a nasty cough such a troublesome cough which made him feel a little giddy and clogged the free functioning of the vocal chords all this of course was directed against violet who must be taught that if colin expressed a wish that she should undertake some little mission like telling her father and mother that they must no longer consider stanier their house she must be a good wife and obey colin was just unlocking the drawer where he kept the memoirs when she entered and he hailed her with a smile and a word of welcome that you vi he said have you come for a little talk that is nice sit down she looked at him in silence as he brought the book out continuing to stand i thought i told you to sit down he said no ill stand she said he glanced at her still smiling you had better do what i tell you he said thats right how simple isnt it now what have you come about its something tedious i suppose about your father eh wasnt he horrid at dinner he made me blush for his dyed hair such a story awful for you and aunt margaret granny too at her age and the servants she looked at him again in silence then dropped her eyes i suppose it is your plan to make him tipsy every night she said until i tell him that he and my mother are not to come back here after their visit to aix colin nodded at her with that sunny smile of his absolutely correct he said how well we understand each other dear and youve come here to tell me youre going to be good and do as youre told is that it yes i cant sit by and see my father as i saw him tonight what do you want me to say to him oh just that say that you understand that hell be settling down in london for the autumn or for ever and ever just a little tact and pleasantness colin its awfully hard on him she said he and mother have practically lived here since their marriage yes darling a nice long visit as i said yesterday he must put his name in the visitors book saturday or whenever it was till monday and though i dont often criticize you i must remind you that you shouldnt always think of yourself what do you mean by that asked she ill explain youve got no real filial feeling for either your father or mother and that pricks your conscience so to mollify that smart you take their side and want them to have a comfortable home here that doesnt cost you anything and it gives you an atoning feeling inside it is your cheap manner of making amends to them there was just that grain of truth in this which made it impossible for violet to deny it completely she had not consciously thought of that but when he pointed it out she knew it was so there were plenty of other reasons kindliness affection compassion which prompted her but he with his amazing subtlety had put his finger on the smallest and meanest of them all you are an adept at seeing the worst side of everybody she said would it be rude if i suggested that the reason for that is that the worst side of people is so much more to the front than their best asked colin we all put our worst foot foremost and then think of dennis vi would you like him to have among the early recollections of his boyhood the memory of his grandfather telling bawdy stories and reeling up to bed after dinner in a squall of hiccups and then last and least theres myself your father bores and disgusts me i hinted to him that he was not perhaps such a fixture here as he seemed to imagine and now please youre going to repeat that timid conviction so that he may see that on this as on every point were at one mind the suggestion has got to come from yourself not from me otherwise he will think that i have asked you to make it now weve spent too much time and speech already over a trivial matter you think im a brute but then you often do that im used to that getting almost callous about it he held up the sheaf of typed pages which had occupied him all the morning ive had a delicious day he said for ive been reading the memoirs of old colin i had them typewritten and theyre entrancing he realized himself so wonderfully there was neither false shame nor conceit about him he was neither proud nor the reverse of being such a devil i thought of letting some learned antiquarian society publish them odd isnt it how all the puritanical pureminded people chiefly women who shiver and are shocked at what they call a bad man and wont visit him or have him to dinner and heave any sort of brick at him greedily devour any indecent memoir and simply roll in it like dogs when theyve found some putrescent muck youd have thought that if they shudder at wickedness they wouldnt care to read about it but they say its the historical interest that makes them devour it which isnt true its the insatiable fascination that wickedness has for prudes however the memoirs are enchanting they ring so absolutely true you feel you are looking at the very man himself i even found myself believing in the literal truth of the legend sit down and dip into them darling you wont find a dull page anywhere meantime im puzzling out a curious plan of some projected addition to the house which he never executed i wont read them tonight she said it is rather late very good i wont insist on that as youve been a good girl otherwise but you must read them some day i want to know if a certain thing strikes you as it struck me what is that she asked why that old colin was a sort of prophet i felt all the time as if he was writing not about himself but about me how types repeat themselves there is another character he mentions which so closely resembles someone we both know old colins father in fact ronald stanier whom he describes as a drunken old sot good night darling not a kiss i suppose i dont deserve one youre punishing me for being such a brute she paused at the door there he stood looking gaily and yet wistfully at her with his mouth a little open and the soft fire of his youth burning in his eyes and she yearned for him surely it was not only his beauty that she adored that physical perfection of him there was somebody surely imprisoned there who called to her through the bars of his nature and its love of evil and its hate of love as often as she had tried to reach that prisoner it was as if the guardians of his soul monstrous and terrifying pushed her panicstricken away she hated and feared them and their ruthless wickedness but in spite of them she knew that she would never cease from trying to get past them and rescuing him who lay there in iron bondage she turned back into the room her eyes troubled and eager full of love full of fear some gust of inspiration came to her colin you hate love she said and i cant help giving it you i pity you so you know all my heart pours itself out round you in pity youve tried to kill my love but you cant its so much stronger than either you or me he whipped round on her good lord you must have misheard me he said i asked you for a kiss not a sermon but i dont want either go to bed the door closed behind her and he stood there a moment simmering with anger and contempt at her undesired homily with its puerile message he could have laughed at the idea of love being strong love was the most helpless and defenceless of all the pieces on the savage chessboard it was vulnerable at every point you could wound it wherever you thrust at it any clumsy stroke penetrated and made it bleed or you could rope it down to the rack and quite without effort pull the lever that wrenched and distorted it and made it white with silent agony but how strange that just now violet should give vent to gabble like this when a moment before she had shrunk from him and his brutality in his dealings with her and her father in her small way she was like the martyrs praising and blessing god as their limbs writhed with anguish that they were accounted worthy to suffer for his sake she was like that comely smoothedlimbed s sebastian in the gallery for which nino might have been the model who seraphically smiled while he was being made a pincushion for arrows certainly colin had tried as she said to kill her love and often he had wounded it though none of those thrusts it would seem had proved mortal he shrugged his shoulders there were plenty more weapons in his armoury above all there was one which as yet was not ready for use for its blade was still soft and unannealed but he wondered if her love would survive the thrust when dennis was a sword of wickedness in his hand he brought out again the sketchplan that had puzzled him and examined it through a magnifying glass certainly the word which he had conjectured to be solarium did not stand this closer scrutiny and now when he looked again at the plan itself this oblong room thus conjecturally labelled could not be a solarium for on the south where you would expect it to be open or to present a row of big windows to admit the sun there were but two very narrow apertures marked there at the east end however there was indicated a very big window which took up nearly the whole length of the wall colin turned his attention to the written word again solarium it certainly was not for the second letter was a c surely not an o and there was a faint crossstroke over the l which made a t of it and another letter quite illegible preceded the final arium sct thought colin and suddenly a new solution dawned on him it must be sctuarium abbreviated from sanctuarium a chapel a shrine as he scrutinized it he was more than ever certain that he had hit on the true decipherment but this only complicated the puzzle instead of solving it for how was it possible to account for the author of these memoirs planning to build a sanctuary sanctuary however it certainly was and this identification explained the narrow lancets on the south wall and the big east window he considered the history of his ancestors last year on earth how as the time approached for his death he turned to god not from love of him but from fear of hells damnation he broke off the chronicle of his iniquities he built almshouses and indulged in fastings and charities with a view to avert the destiny that he had chosen and rejoiced in that all fell in with the notion of his building a chapel which communicated with his own room in the house so that he could go there by day or night for cowardly prayer and search for forgiveness of his trespasses then too on this assumption the little dwellingplace that adjoined it could be explained no doubt he intended that a priest should reside there as domestic physician of his soul for the moment this hypothesis seemed to account for the whole project and colin unwillingly accepted it it was disappointing it was just another instance of that collapse and cowardice which came over his ancestor and made his last year on earth such a pitiful surrender and yet why did he not then put his plan into execution if this was the design of it for a whole year after the date recorded on this drawing he practised his belated pieties and yet never a sod was cut nor a brick laid in the erection of this chapel surely he would have hastened on the building of it with the same speed and enthusiasm with which he had built the house for his own glory clearly if this solution was correct and he had intended to build a chapel here with lodging for a priest he abandoned it but why if his soul was set on pieties and repentance colin got up from the chair in which he had been sitting for the last halfhour since violet had left him frowning and puzzling over this riddle he felt that there was a key which would fit the facts and that he was hovering round its discovery it was close at hand but some sluggish mist of his own mind obscured it he paced up and down his room for a minute or two then went to the window open behind its tapping blind which he drew half up only the faintest nightwind stirred the sky was bare and the full moon rode high in the south among the stars just in front the terrace lay grey and the garden dark but beyond the square black line of the yewhedge the lake shone so bright in the moonlight that it seemed a sheet of pale flame brimming and molten to right and left rose the swelling uplands of the park and all this spacious stateliness within and without was the creation of that ancestor of his who had planned a sanctuary colin felt no doubt that his spirit survived in some remorseful hell and what more poignant hell could there be for it now shorn of its pomp and prosperity and naked in the immaterial world than the splendour of its earthly habitation where it no longer had a place somehow his spirit seemed close and ready to communicate could it not give to one who so rapturously claimed kinship and sympathy with it some hint some expression of itself that should awake in him the comprehension of its strange desire to build a sanctuary colin stood quite still looking out on to the silent tranquillity not cudgelling his brain with conjecture any more but letting it lie open and quiet to the midnight to see if from outside or from its own subconscious activity there did not emerge what he was seeking for it was curious that a satisfactory solution of this point seemed of such immense importance but rightly or wrongly he believed that it held some great significance and certainly there was a power abroad tonight something that tingled and throbbed in his veins it was hard to keep still under it not to let his brain busy itself with ingenious surmise but he had done that already to the utmost of his power and now with this stir of force round him he must let himself stay passive and receptive suddenly the faint stirring of the nightbreeze grew stronger it ruffled his hair it blew the cracking flapping blind out horizontal into the room and the pages of the manuscript on his table whispered and shivered as if they were talking to themselves and giggling together and then the mist that had obscured his mind was whisked away and he knew he had the explanation for which he had been seeking in a couple of steps he was back at his table and open in the manuscript he had been reading all day there lay before his eyes the final words of it which he had read uncomprehendingly before but now saw to contain the key he looked for how i would rejoice he said aloud to build some shrine in honour of my lord where i would worship him who has wrought so great benefits upon me some sanctuary where i might worthily adore him there was no need to search further all was clear it was indeed a sanctuary he had planned in honour not of god but of him who had given him all that his soul desired clear too at last was the reason why he had never built it for just then when it was freshly planned fear began to darken round him and the shadows to stalk and he turned from his lord and benefactor and wrote no more in his praise but prayed and fasted in impious piety one oclock had already sounded and colin replaced the memoirs in a drawer and turned the key on them the gust from outside that seemed literally to have blown the mist from him so that he saw sharp and distinct across the sundering centuries the purpose of this design and the sure reason for its abandonment died into stillness again but the night seemed charged and alive with consciousness all day he had put himself to soak so to speak in the spirit that infused these memoirs with so sympathetic a vitality now even when the book was finished it was friendly round him stimulating and quickening him so that reinforced with its vigour the idea of the physical refreshment of sleep seemed ludicrous to sleep was to abandon your consciousness for the sake of its recuperation it was the expression of his consciousness that he needed he put his hand on the low windowsill and vaulted out on to the terrace where he had watched denniss early essays in locomotion in the stillness past and present seemed melted into one the centuries no longer represented the movement of time they had not been borne away on its stream but were static as if portrayed in a picture it might have been on this very night that the original bargain was made it might have been here and now that his ancestor was devising the sanctuary on the little plateau that lay among the oaks which he had planted in the moonlight colin could almost visualize the windowed corridor that had been planned to run from the corner of the room which he had just quitted till it joined among the trees the west wall of the sanctuary what a symbol would that shrine have been of old colins life what a jubilee of the dedication of himself there without doubt he intended to celebrate those satanic rites that worship of evil for evils sake in which they to whom the sacred service of love was a thing abhorred and derided renewed their allegiance to the enemy of god and in the blasphemy of the black mass drew near to their lord and benefactor who strengthened and refreshed their souls the shallow the indifferent who just made as pleasant a pilgrimage as possible out of life or who from vague instincts tried to be good or merely fell into evil because they were weak or selfindulgent could have no part in that it would be savourless as bran to any who had no living belief both in god and in satan for blasphemy signified nothing to souls who did not hate the sublime majesty of love they who took part in its dark mysteries were they who believed in god and who by their deliberate choice rejected and hated and defied him old colin would have been a fit worshipper there had not that senile panic hoisting the white flag of his surrender overtaken him before his bond was due it was a craven pitiful end it was not love of his lifelong enemy that drove him to that camp but fear of him who had so magnificently befriended him colin had wandered in the moonlight past the end of the terrace and now stood on the plateau where according to the plan the sanctuary was to have been built round him rose the tranced foresttrees the grass drenched with dew glimmered like a spread sheet of moonstone then suddenly springing up again the wind warm and caressing made the branches of the oaks whisper and sway and through him ran a great exaltation he raised his hands spreading his arms out wide o lord and benefactor he said how will i rejoice to build a shrine in honour of thee colin woke from his dreamless sleep next morning to find ninos hand on his bare shoulder gently stirring him his clothes were in a heap on the floor by his bedside for when he came in he had but stripped himself and wrapped a sheet round him in which cocoonlike he had lain unstirring he was conscious of a strong glow of happiness as he was thus recalled and his lazy strength came soaking into him oh nino what a nuisance you are he said you spend your beastly life in waking me will you sleep again then asked nino no the mischief is done now whats the morning like whats the news a telephone message from mrs hunt said nino she would know if she may come down today for sunday colin grinned the moment nino had said telephone message he had guessed from whom it came well then she maynt he said damned cheek it would never do would it nino she will be very happy she said if she may come observed nino colin raised himself a little and drew his hand down his arm the fact that he had decided that pamela hunt should not come made him see causes for reconsideration just rub my arm he said ive been sleeping on it and it isnt awake of course if it would make her happy thats a different thing we ought always to make people happy nino except when were making them miserable tell her she can come then whats the morning like splendore said nino i shall bathe i wish youd carry me straight down to the lake and drop me into it sicuro said nino colin looked at him yawning get on then he said wondering what he would do nino bent down and putting one arm below his neck and the other under his knees lifted him up right about turn said colin march nino carried him as far as the door and was evidently perfectly ready to bear him with the sheet folded round him down to the lake he held him as easily as a child and his face was all wreathed with merriment i am your nurse he said you are my bambino signor colin laughed oh but this wont do he said put me down nino people would think it so odd there are enough oddities in the house without our adding to them and go and telephone dont keep a lady waiting but i was busy attending to my signor said nino i know youre a good boy you shall come off to capri with me before long follow me down when youve telephoned i know theres something i want to ask you about and i shall remember it when the water has awakened me as colin ran downstairs he was in two minds again as to whether he should allow pamela hunt to be happy or not their friendship quite a recent one had been founded on laughter and good looks and high spirits but since then he had become aware that she was searching for more from him than that was digging below those flimsy foundations of liking and laughter for something more profound he did not really care about her in the least but she was eminently ornamental and he liked the bland unscrupulousness with which she pursued her way her suggestion indeed that she should come down to stanier for the sunday where she knew he was in retreat in the bosom of his family had a daring innocence about it which was rather attractive their friendship had already been a matter of extensive public comment in london and it showed a charming disregard of the usual conventions that she should propose to share his domestic tranquillity it was no secret from him that she was in love with him and he was guilty of no fatuous gratification about that in fact it seemed to him a pity for he had nothing whatever for her and beyond doubt she was getting serious and eager however she had proposed herself and he had permitted it and after all there might be some amusement out of it some chilling disappointment for her some ludicrous dnouement derived from his own indifference or possibly exasperation if she became tedious he had not given her the smallest encouragement but that of laughter and chatter and if she chose to attempt to hunt him down any consequences were of her own seeking then too how would violet take it in case some kind friend had whispered warnings to her it might be an amusing sunday he stepped out on to the terrace already grilling in the sunshine but it looked less real now than a few hours ago under the moon the stage then had been alive with dark forces brewing drama whereas now in this sane freshness of day it was mere paint and pasteboard like that same stage seen next morning when the actors had left it and no drama vivified the splendid setting but as he walked along the terrace to the yewhedge it gained reality again just there would be the windowed corridor and there close at hand was the plateau among the oaks yes it was growing real again and at that he remembered what he had wanted to ask nino a couple of years ago when he was staying for the night with the very lively little english consul at naples who had shewn him such curious neapolitan diversions he remembered his having said something about a cabaret in a room behind which were held certain satanic rites possibly nino might know nino had much gay native knowledge of an unexpected kind and had many local stories to tell of the doings of the monstrous emperor tiberius who took such wonderful holidays from the cares of state in capri these satanic rites were as old as religion itself in fact they were the earliest form in which religion the belief in the supernatural appeared for originally the supernatural was an evil power to be propitiated it was later that mankind had conceived of it as beneficent and loving colin was out of the water when nino came down well have you made her happy he asked what an age youve been nino ninos mouth twitched and broke into a smile sissignor he said she is very happy and what are you grinning at asked colin she thought it was you at the telephone he said she thought i had gone to fetch you and what did she say asked colin nino schooled his mouth into gravity she saidscusibut she said colin darling how perfectly sweet of you so i said signora and i think she understood for sheshe rang away rang off said colin youre thinking of ran away she is running away here said nino colin lay back on the grass why do men get in such a fuss about women he asked chi sa there are plenty for all said nino yes tell me more tales such as you told me at capri about tiberio nino laughed why does the signor love to hear of tiberio he was a fat old man yes but full of ideas he liked wickedness the sort of man who would worship the devil sicuro italys a very wicked country said colin i believe they worship the devil still in naples nino crossed himself so it is said why do you do that asked colin i dont believe you really think it protects you its only a habit tell me about the worship of the devil in naples i know little said nino and though others find it diverting i would not find diversion in it why do they want to behave like street boys and make faces at holy things and it is not prudent may not lightning strike them or madness come on them there are many things which the priests say offend il padre which are diverting but this is not one of them colin gathered up his knees in his arms his skin still shining with his bathe what nonsense as he often thought were the english ideas of class here was he talking to his own valet on terms of perfect equality and nino accepting that as perfectly natural though had colin next moment said get me my shoes nino would have jumped to his feet his most obedient and respectful servant these southerners had fine breeding in their bones whereas so many englishmen of his own class had only got it on the skin his brother raymond for instance what a howling cad compared to nino or uncle ronald last night telling a smokingroom story so that one really sickened at his grossness nino talking about the much more awful deeds of tiberius was not gross at all he was only gay nino why do we talk theology before breakfast he said we did yesterday and here we are at it again today i was very theological last night i suppose thats it and this is an overflow but dont you see that its diverting to defy il padre and be rude no that is not diverting said nino well everyone must go to the devil in his own way so if i wanted you to do something wicked which didnt divert you i suppose you would refuse i shall always wish to please you said nino well you can please me now i want to hear about the black mass i think it might make me happy have they a book have they a missal yes said nino nino youre rather annoying youre becoming serious nino shook his head i have no use for it he said and indeed i know little of it they have a book there is a priest but he must be one who has been turned out of his office but where is the good of it all it is enough for me to do what is diverting and wipe my mouth after till i want to be diverted again colin reached out for a towel the mere fact that nino found something revolting in the idea of the black mass was naturally a reason for causing him to interest himself in it but if he did not feel the fascination of defiance he could be no true worshipper and somehow nino was so perfectly delightful as he was it might spoil the gaiety of his paganism to tamper with his instincts he only cared for diversion there was no devotion about him nino were wonderfully alike in some ways as ive told you he said but were wonderfully different in this i dont believe you like hurting people for instance thats where the difference lies not if i am fond of them only when i hate them said nino oh youre no good said colin give me my shirt nino scrambled to his feet and held it up for him have i displeased you he said no youre a nice boy but i believe you want to go to heaven when you die sicuro said nino colin mentioned casually at breakfast that pamela hunt was arriving that afternoon she telephoned this morning he said so of course i said we should be delighted i forget if you know her vi he violet and aunt hester were the only three down yet the latter looked up from her wellfurnished plate for aunt hester always had a fine appetite for breakfast and couldnt bear the silly rubbish of those who said they were better without whether violet knew her or not it was evident that aunt hester knew something about her pamela hunt coming here she said well i never colin turned to her with his most radiant smile what is it that you dont ever aunt hester he said lady hester returned to her plate she had no desire to make mischief but really the way pamela hunt had run after colin and his perfect readiness to be caught they were always together the whole world noticed it well i hope we shall have a fine sunday she said colin shooting a glance at violet saw that her attention had been aroused probably it could not fail to be aroused when pamela arrived but what on earth had that to do with this old victorian creature whose morals as everybody knew had been of the most indulgent order in her own affairs her old age and her wit had begun to whitewash her now but it was a little too much that she should wish to change her name to mrs grundy it wasnt nearly such a pretty name as hester brayton nor did she look the part however he would deal with that soon i hope so too he said well go to church together aunt hester and sing a few more years shall roll thats so encouraging isnt it good morning uncle ronald your coughs better i trust uncle ronald presented a rueful appearance people ought not thought colin to be allowed to spoil the appearance of a room like this presently aunt margaret joined them all the menagerie was here now except grandmamma he turned to aunt hester again with all his sunniest good humour aunt hester youre got up to kill he said i never saw anything so saucy as your hat should i look as nice if i wore a hat at breakfast i think i shall have breakfast in a bowler have you been out already aunt hester felt encouraged it had been a mistake to make that ejaculation on the subject of pamela hunt but it had popped out but colin bore her no grudge bless him such a goodnatured boy he was and she felt it would be quite easy to speak to him after breakfast and beg him to reconsider the propriety of letting that baggage come down here of course staniers werent saints and she herself wasnt a prude thank god but to bring that wench down here with violet in the house was a bit thick as they said nowadays she had finished her breakfast and got up colin immediately followed her and they strolled along to the shady end of the terrace and now my dear im going to talk to you like a mother she said colin took her arm ah do he said thatll be lovely well my dear youre doing what you shouldnt she said all the world and his wife have been talking of the way that pamela of yours is running after you dont think i blame her for that for thats her business and yours and nobody elses but everyones been saying that you and shewell with that snuffy old husband of hers no wonder shes wanting to make the most of her youth they sat down in an encampment of chairs under the trees colin had wanted an excuse for getting rid of aunt hester and she was evidently going to give him one it was so pleasant of people to dig their own graves his eyes were soft and gay as he spoke dear aunt hester he said go on my dear youre charming to me i was afraid you looked vexed for a moment when that silly speech of mine popped out so there it isand it aint quite decent of you my dear to bring her down with violet in the house i dont know what your relations with the woman are though of course youd tell me there are none but whether there are or not doesnt affect it you oughtnt to have her down here for even if violet knows nothing about it now therell be a host of kind friends to tell her when they know that pamelas been to stay at stanier and it makes a fool of her dont you ever make a fool of anybody my dear for theyll heave it back at you sooner or later thats my experience colin felt a sudden inexplicable impulse of affection for this damaged old butterfly which ought to have been hybernating she was such a pagan and she had enjoyed herself so in her time and she had shrewd wicked little eyes like an elephant but that softening towards her only made him impatient of himself and he rallied against this insidious intrusion just a little more from her first i suppose youre right he said yes my dear i am but its nice of you to listen like this to an old woman like me you ring her up or get that young italian ruffian of yours to ring her up and say youve got the influenza ive not forgotten what its like to be young and kick over the traces a bit but down here you know colin sighed he had got rid of the intrusive affection she was just like an improper little doll theres one thing i want to know aunt hester he said she looked at him a moment really he was the handsomest and most attractive boy she had ever seen anyone so endowed ought to have carte blanche to do as he pleased tell me my dear she said i will as were talking so pleasantly and confidentially ive been wondering what the deuce youve got to do with it i believe im master here i fancy i can invite anyone i choose perhaps im wrong perhaps im only a dummy stuck at the head of the table and the place is run by a syndicate of aged relatives certainly it seems to be for theres uncle ronald drinking the cellar up and telling me he couldnt dream of leaving granny and theres aunt margaret as adhesive here as a postage stamp and now theres you dictating to me about my morals and my guests as for what you tell me the world and his wife say how can you expect me to be interested in the gabble of a pack of your foulminded old friends you always liked gossiping in the gutter colin jumped up from his chair and shook off aunt hesters hand which lay on his arm cruelty is a whet to itself it grows sharper with use do you know im not going to stand it any more he said ive already told violet to get it into uncle ronalds head that he mustnt expect to be here all the rest of his life and now i tell you the same youve got houses of your own and you can all go and live in them as for telephoning if there is any telephoning to be done itll be you to telephone to your housekeeper to say youve got influenza and are coming home i dont want you to do that i hate rushing things but if you stop here a day or two longeri shall be quite pleased if you doyou must first apologize for your damnable interference in things that dont concern you really aunt hester for you to set yourself up as a guide to the young is just a shade too grotesque aunt hester sat still her hands tight on the arms of her chair and her mouth holding itself in into her eyes there came the small difficult tears of the old she wiped them away with a little pinkbordered handkerchief and got up ill be telling my maid to pack she said just as you please said colin thats what i please said she colin felt a spasm of impotent fury with her he could not have been more invincibly brutal but he had not won she went down with her flag flying she was sinking unsubdued goodbye my dear she said i was always devoted to you and i thought you liked me but you hate me else you couldnt have spoken to me like that im sorry i was wrong about you and i thank you for my visit so good of you to have come aunt hester he said violet had come out of the diningroom and was now close to them ive got to go up to town my dear said aunt hester turning her back on colin i must see to my togs violet cast one glance at colin who stood there all debonair and smiling but youll be back this evening she said no my dear not so soon as that said aunt hester and tripped off to the house violet turned to colin has anything happened she said why is aunt hester going colin followed the retreat of the sprightly little figure for a moment in silence then with a sigh he looked at violet shaking his head its all wretched he said yes aunt hesters quarrelled with me she took it on herself to tell me i had no business to ask pamela here she said everyone believed i was having an affair with her and that it was an insult to you to ask her here now that doesnt happen to be true do you believe that darling violet looked at him with that direct limpid gaze so like his own if you tell me so of course i do she said i do tell you so he said even if it wasnt true what on earth has it to do with aunt hester but her talking to me like thatshe called it talking like a mothergave me the opportunity i wanted so i told her i was tired of being ruled by aged and parasitic relatives i said i wasnt in a hurry for her to go but that if she wanted to stop a bit longer she must apologize so she went to pack thats all oh colin poor old thing said violet me or aunt hester he asked aunt hester she didnt mean to insult you i suppose then she did it by accident said he if so she ought to have said she was sorry how about the others by the way have you spoken a seasonable word to uncle ronald yes he understands he and my mother are thinking of going today they would be off on monday anyhow golly the animals are going out three by three observed colin you and pamela and i will be trois a quiet peaceful sunday i hope it will be fine as aunt hester said violet turned towards the house i must go and see aunt hester she said what for to commiserate with her for having a brutal nephew asked colin no colin to say i am sorry she is going but that if she cant see her way to apologize to you theres nothing else to be done i believe what you tell me and that being so she has wronged you colin paused and supposing now i told you i was in love with pamela he said violets eyes wandered away from him a moment and mused alone i believe that at the bottom of my heart i should rejoice that you were in love with anybody she said colins beautiful mouth curled with derision god thats the last word in wifely devotion he said but its true said she ronald and his wife had decided not to alter their plans but to stay till monday and thus pamelas arrival left the party numerically as they were but her presence brought into it some sort of emotional intensity flippant as was her speech violet divined a certain force behind the flippancy below her wit there was will certainly she was extremely goodlooking black of eye and hair olive in skin a wonderful contrast to the fairness of staniers and flippancy and force alike wit and will were all shooting at one target london is getting addled she was saying it always does halfway through july the hens that is the hostesses sit and sit and sit but nothing comes out except a few engagements of their sons and their daughters or rather of their fathers and their mothers that would be nearer the truth there was a summary of the ages of newlymarried people in the times the other day there were six over seventy three over eighty and one of ninetytwo deaths surely deaths said ronald pamela had been making him feel young he was glad he had settled to stop till monday no dear mr stanier marriages she said the people who died were much younger i noticed it particularly how do you explain that colin that marriage keeps you young is the only explanation said he no my dear you dont grasp it they were already wonderfully old when they married being old keeps you young is the only explanation i can think of we must get old otherwise we shall die instead of marrying and what was the age of the babies who were born on this remarkable day asked colin how can you ask babies are the oldest things in the world you cant compute their age it is infinite they are age itself but by degrees through experience they get young we come into the world all red and wrinkled and we go out all white and wrinkled weve been bled thats all all the time violet felt she was talking at colin these sprightly trifles unreal as stagedialogue were but the steam that rose over what lay below whether she addressed ronald or his wife or violet herself the steam blew always towards colin she talked impartially to one or another just as she looked impartially at one or another so that out of that very impartiality she might look at colin too but on him her hovering glance settled for a moment a woman always did that if she was in love with a man she talked here and there she glanced here and there in order to make it natural that she should glance everywhere but when she came to the face that she sought she hovered no longer but just for a moment she settled as certainly violet knew that colin was not in the least in love with her he had never spoken a truer word than when he had told her that he was amused with her he looked long and very openly at her he did not disguise his admiration but he had no secret message for her as she for him lady yardleys voice broke in she had been perfectly silent throughout dinner why is hester not here colin she said has this lady who has been amusing us all come to live here instead of hester colin nodded to violet who rose no granny darling he said this lady has only come to live with us till monday unless you can persuade her to stop now itll be time for your whist in ten minutes go on with violet colin took a delicate pleasure that night in not allowing uncle ronald to drink more than one glass of port he had told violet that he would make him tipsy every night till she did as she was told and informed her father that he was not to regard stanier as his home any longer now since she had been obedient he would see that uncle ronald was lamentably sober he could play whist tonight in fact and violet and her mother must make up the table for old lady yardley this left him and pamela free and presently he strolled out with her on the terrace it was delightful of you to propose yourself he said though upon my word i felt it was very selfish of me to let you come how can i prevent your having a fearfully dull sunday with nobody here youve missed aunt hester she adds a little spice sometimes to the plain family pudding pamela glanced up at the noble faade of the house and to the suburban villa she said no wonder you adore it be it ever so humble colin theres no place like home colin had been reflecting what he should do with pamela he had seen all that violet saw but his opportunity did not allure him she was magnificently handsome but she conveyed nothing to his senses she was all very well as a unit in the general crowd she talked nonsense she made him laugh but he had no earthly use for her beyond that he knew very well what she was after what she was after walked by her side now and his own entire indifference to her made that appear an unwarranted liberty in his summary of her she wantedthat was so characteristic of some womens loveshe wanted to possess him by making herself indispensable to him that was the way a woman worked she put it that she gave herself to a man whereas in reality she aimed at just the opposite for she meant the man to give himself to her she wanted always to undermine a mans independence and subject him to herself she used her beauty her wit her short skirts her powderpuff all for the same end to enslave him to his desire for her that sapped his strength it sheared him of his manhood even as delilah cut samsons mane so that he was helpless in her hands a womans avowed abandonment of herself her yielding her weakness were all fetters of steel with which she cramped and enchained the man her weakness indeed was precisely her strength and she called this rapacity tenderness it was the tenderness of a leech which softly fastens itself and softly clings till it is satiated with the blood of its victim then fullfed it drops off thus at any rate he judged her quality a quality greedy and common that called itself selfsurrendering she was out for what she could get and colin had a certain sympathy with that for it was sensible and intelligible it had not at any rate anything in common with violets love for him which sought to give and not to get that was wholly alien to him its manifestations bored him its spirit just because it was so unintelligible to him he hated and defied pamela was not like that nor again was she light she did not think of this physical desire which she called love as a diversion had she offered him a part in a comedy he might have accepted it comedy was a pleasant pastime but it was not that which she wanted she was engaged so he construed her on nefarious designs against his liberty and these must be met with counterplots which would lead her on to some final debcle they paused a moment as she looked up at the house the moon tonight had only just risen tawny and large on the horizon yes i adore it he said it casts a spell on us all you know i would sooner be here than anywhere on this earth but as you know now there are certain drawbacks to it drawbacks shew me some she said ah youre too polite polite pamela but imagine what dinner would have been like if it hadnt been for you granny uncle ronald aunt margaret my dear youve left out violet she said i think shes too fascinating colin saw that his counterplot was positively opened by her he put his arm through hers i feel sure you have seen he said and im sure youre sympathetic give me a drop of pity pamela thatll be rather healing and then well be gay again but pity why pity said she colin stopped violet detests me he said yes i know you saw that and naturally you couldnt say it but its said now its sad isnt it just a little sad its not her fault any more than its my fault that i love her and i suppose i shall get used to it they say one gets used to anything wounds heal if you give them time but oh how easily theyre torn open again look here where we stand in the shadow of the yewhedge is the very spot where violet first kissed me it was here she said she would marry me come away i bleed he saw her eyes sparkle and soften they sparkled first that was the genuine symptom then they softened that was womanly sympathy her arm just pressed his encircled hand and that perhaps was both all this he read so easily with that adeptness derived from the birthright of his inheritance no saint of god could find good in people with such dexterity as he could find evil my dear im so sorry she said i hadnt seen more shame on my blindness and really it never occurred to me that sorrow could come near you for you always seem so robed in joy im glad i mustnt lose hold on joy said he quickly but what atrocious manners ive got theres nothing so thoroughly rude and middleclass as to tell your friends of your troubles theres no greater compliment that you can pay than to do just that she said but i should never have guessed colin youre a wonderful dissembler he laughed im a wonderful grouser he said grouse too pamela be sociable tell me the secret sorrows of your domestic life you know quite well i havent any my husband and i are the greatest friends whenever we meet which is about once a year we have the most delightful talk and always hope we shall meet again soon in the intervals we hear of each other occasionally i hear about his little affairs and i suppose he would about mine if i had any but i cant behave as so many women seem to colin gave a little shudder i should hate you if you did he said dont make me do that that certainly was not part of pamelas plan i promise that you shant for that reason she said but we wont talk about me oh colin i hate your being unhappy what can be done my dear youve got so much too youve got so many people who are devoted to you he looked at her with eyes brilliant and wistful have i he said i dont feel as if i had people are friendly i know but i am only one in a crowd to them they come down here in shoals in the autumnnext time you come you shall really have some more amusing people to meet she interrupted him no dont do that she said the shoals of amusing people arent anything to me ah thats nice of you said colin they stood there a moment in silence then he turned quickly to the house we must go in he said granny will have finished her whist and then my uncle likes a chat in the smokingroom you never knew i was such a domestic character did you pamela i always knew you were a dear she said and you do like me a little dont you colin when he found himself aloneuncle ronald was gloomily consuming whisky to make up for the dearth of portwas as pleased with his terracetalk as his companion had been there was the little sideshow gratis of representing himself as yearning for violet but that was only an antechamber so to speak which he and pamela were passing through and there she saw him the gay trappings of his brilliance stripped off him hungry for love and already pamelahow well he read herwas at his side closer and closer must she get till she could not exist without him all the time she would be posing as the consoling friend the healer of wounds and all the time to the truer vision she would be the hunting leopard hungry for the hot blood of its prey and just as she thought she had got it it would be the prey somehow that turned on her with derision and mockery with the exact manner of that furious turning of the tables colin did not trouble himself it could not be settled now for it must depend on developments before long he would be going out to capri he might ask her there perhaps for at capri everything always turned out well how often had he made plans lying there on the beach between the bathes and how surely had their accomplishment justified the design the fruit was not ripe yet though the moonshine on the terrace had brought it on towards maturity tomorrow ought to be a nice growing day too what a high morality he would then exhibit and how delightful would be the mockery of it his plan thus vaguely outlined to himself was a derisive parody of morality in which a decent married man would be seen resisting the improper seductress what could be nicer it would be a veritable tract about a messalina and a galahad and then you looked closer and saw that hate and the desire to hurt twitched in every gesture of galahad there was the cream and felicity of it for it would all be a defiance of love a campaign of hostility and rebellion colin stood up stretching himself slowly and luxuriously he had taken out again from its locked drawer the plan of that annex which his ancestor had never erected to study it further but there was really no need of that he had sent for his architect to come here on monday morning who must get to work on this outlined sketchplan and devise something in the style of the house using old brick and weathered stone and timber that would all be talked out on monday and the building of it begun at once for tomorrows employment there was church in the morning where he always read the lessons if he was at home and after that there were fruits to be ripened and very soon after that certainly during this week he would go off with nino to capri for a month of basking and bathing and he made no doubt a moral interlude for he meant to ask pamela to visit him there and researches must be made in underground naples that red ridiculous consul mr cecil would have to lend his friendly offices he would get him to come over for a night to the island colin looked round his room just there the door would be pierced that led into the corridor communicating with the sanctuary chapter iv colin woke from his siesta very gradually he had not the slightest idea when the first faint glimmerings of consciousness began to return where he was he scarcely knew who he was and with a deliberate quiescence of mind he tried to prolong this vague sense that what lay here was alive and happy without orientating it or attaching it to any fixed point nirvana he thought must be like this mere awareness of existence and content but this nirvana began spontaneously to break up from outside his window a whisper of wind and a stir of sunwinnowed air spiced with indefinable southern odour flowed across to the bed where he lay in shirt and trousers and at the end of his bed very curiously he saw two bare feet it was still unconjecturable to his drowsiness to whom they belonged and what they were doing there but now a fly settled on one of them and he made the great discovery that it was his own foot which twitched to dislodge it this snapped the chain of his identity round his neck and he knew he was colin then the hot southern scent and the whisper of wind in the pine outside localized him for nowhere else but in that beloved villa on capri did a pine whisper like that yes he was in capri of course he was for he had arrived late last night and had spent the morning in the sea when once the sluices of sleep were raised memories began to pour through and he let them flow as they would without direction he had come here first only two years ago with his father and instantly his italian blood had initiated him into the magic of the south the lizards basking on the walls the grey olives the stone pines the steep cobbled ways were as homelike even when he saw them for the first time as the thrushes that scudded across the lawn at stanier and the yewhedge and the lake of course his fathers presence and his fathers devotion to him had been tedious at times but he had borne that very indulgently then he had come here with violet on his honeymoon and here she had begun to learn something of his real nature and that cold terror she had of him which so inexplicably existed side by side with her love had first laid a finger on her strange to think how that hand of ice had never frozen her love nor squeezed it out of her heart and then he had come here a third time after raymond had been drowned but had stayed here only one night for waiting himwelcoming himwas the telegram to say his father was dead he had not wanted his father to die exactly he was quite content to wait a few years yet but how his heart had leaped to know that already while he was not yet of age his great inheritance had come to him surely capri was a lucky spot for him yet was there where he was concerned such a thing as luck luck as it was generally understood was a fitful visitor with rare capricious advents and long absences but with him it abided always colin yawned till the whole halfcircle of his milkwhite teeth was disclosed with his tongue lying like a curved roseleaf between them and when his mouth closed again it closed into a smile he slewed himself off his bed and barefooted stepped across the cool tiled floor to the next room where tea was waiting for him this siesta through the hot hours of the afternoon when it was impossible to go out made two days out of each twentyfour hours you awoke as to another morning with body refreshed and brain alert already the sea breeze was stirring and the westering sun was off the front of the house and presently cup in hand he strolled across to the window and pushed back the closed greenslatted shutters which had kept the room cool during the heat in came the flooding freshness spiced with sea and chasing before it the stagnant air of the house which had been darkened against the tropic blaze of the noon it heralded the approach of the caressing italian evening and the starsown night nino entered to clear away the teathings the house was entirely run by him and his family in true italian fashion for his sister was housemaid and his stepmother the second that his father had provided him with was cook and she was abhorred by the boy with a genial intensity for there would be no patrimony left when his father had finished with this brisk succession of wives each of whom feathered her own nest before she died well nino and hows mamma said colin nino who had been audibly exchanging compliments with his stepmother in the kitchen drew his eyebrows inward and down and muttered something which with certain prudent expurgations indicated a pious wish about desiccated and barren stoats colin laughed well you wouldnt like her to be a fruitful stoat he observed scusi but i would said nino for surely she would die in childbirth and there would be one coffin for the two i thought i heard you kissing in the kitchen observed colin i would sooner kiss the gridiron said nino well go and kiss the gridiron then if you prefer it and take the teathings away nino and when youve finished kissing the gridiron come back i want you the southern smile broke through colin could always make nino smile even when the stepmother was in the picture sissignor said nino i will kiss the stoat and the gridiron we shoot stoats in england said colin and hang their corpses upon trees eh shed look nice on the pine there said nino but dio the stink when the scirocco blew nino departed with the teathings to kiss his stepmother or the gridiron or anything he chose that was the true spirit in which to live here you never bothered your head as to what you were proposing to do you just did exactly as you liked whenever an amusing opportunity suggested itself and yet it was a wonderful place in which to make plans thought colin you lay on the beach after your bathe and without effort your brain seethed with ideas the sun seemed to liquefy the contents of its cells and the secret juices scarcely known to yourself oozed out in the clear broth of thought and fruitful too was the night when the wind whispered in the pine and the great furrybodied bats with wings of stretched black parchment wove silent circles in the air there was a power abroad then colin knew well and if you were in tune with it you caught like some wireless receiver strange messages from the midnight not less surely did he know that there was power abroad for those who sought it whenever above the altar the lamp burned before the tabernacle that held the sacramental food which is the bread of angels but unless your heart lay open in faith and loving adoration the power which in itself was infinite was no more than a fragment of wafer or a sip of wine faith set that vast engine of love and redemption at work and across the sky from horizon to zenith the worshipper beheld how christs blood streamed in the firmament and adored the divine miracle so too with the power that whispered in the pine and poured itself out on the midnight unless you believed in it and by faith laid hold on it there was for you nothing there but the night wind and the wheeling bats there was the truth of the legend a truth eternal and irrevocable a matter of choice not for him alone but for the whole world he could not so passionately have loved evil if he had not known there was a definite choice to be made he might have drifted into any sort of sin and selfindulgence from the mere fact that they were pleasant but the only thing that could have given him his furious zest for evil in itself was the terrible conviction of the existence of god if evil had been the dominant power in the world he would without the sense of choice have lain and soaked indolently in it but he chose it because he loved it and because in its service he defied love colin made no pretence of doubting the existence of good and evil and the original living causes of them they were principles perhaps but since they certainly lived and daily and hourly manifested themselves he could not conceive of them otherwise than as persons with the same faith that he believed in the power that inspired evil he believed in the power that inspired good which had once been incarnate in man and in some mysterious way suffered for the redemption of those who desired it for those who believed and colin was among them he was love infinite in power but choice was given to every man and his sacrament of love to those who abhorred love became the sacrament of hate and the adoration of evil those who had chosen thus could receive it in mockery of love and to them their derision was an act of faith through which they dedicated their powers and their will to the service of evil and drew therefrom the strength that inspired them these thoughts were no more than the steam which ascended from the bubbling liquor of his mind and he did no more than just watch for this idle moment as he waited for ninos return the familiar wreath and here was ninos step on the stairs and it was time to put these general principles into practical shape he had come to capri no doubt primarily for a month of that basking amphibious life which always put him into harmony with himself but there were other projects as well which now in strict accordance with these principles presented themselves for execution projects no less dedicatory than diverting nino were going to have two visitors here he said and we must arrange about them mr cecil is coming from naples tomorrow for two nights and next week there comes the pretty lady wholl bring a maid lets go round and inspect the villa was deficient in accommodation for more than a very small number of persons for colin during this last year intending it to be no more than his own hermitage had thrown rooms together and had converted a spare bedroom into a bathroom downstairs therefore nowadays there was only the kitchen and the long vaulted diningroom originally two rooms upstairs there was a large studio running the length of the house the bathroom ninos bedroom with colins next door and en suite the sittingroom with the balcony where colin had been having tea and a slip of a room beyond opening out of the sittingroom this latter would do for pamelas maid but where was pamela to go ninos stepmother and sister always went home in the evening after dinner returning again early next morning im afraid youll have to turn out nino said colin while pretty lady is here and go home in the evening with your dear gridiron then you can make love to her on the way grazie said nino or scrag her in the dark said colin no you mustnt do that or how should we get breakfast next day but what room can pretty lady have except yours id sooner have you in the house though the fell prospect of walking home every evening and coming back every morning with his stepmother sharpened ninos wits the signor does not really want that sittingroom next his bedroom as well as the studio said he could not that be the signoras bedroom while she is here then she will have her maid next door good boy said colin well do that therell be the maid at the end of the passage then pretty ladys bedroom then me then you and you wont be able to flirt with the maid without passing through the signoras room very good for your morals nino nino laughed if it is the maid the signora brought to stanier she is like a broomstick he said then dont fly away on the broomstick said colin well thats settled but when youre married nino i shant turn out of my sittingroom for your wife colin was always charming to those who were in a position to serve him and mr cecil found a most cordial welcome when he arrived next day he was a convivial little cad so colin would have described him gratified that lord yardley should have asked him to spend a weekend at his villa and delighted to get out of that fryingpan of a town for a couple of days in person he was a round red bachelor with a taste for wine and obscenity colin supplied the one and mr cecil had as his contribution a considerable fund of local lore not quite suitable for children usually dinner was served under the pergola in the garden but tonight the weather was uneasy with hot puffs of scirocco and instead they ate indoors in this heat it was impossible to shut the windows but the venetian shutters were closed and little blasts of hot moist air entering through the slats hovered and fluttered batlike about the room yes yes said mr cecil mopping his flushed forehead after the relation of one of these curious episodes a bad piece of work but picturesque undeniably picturesque my belief is that the girl was possessed that sounds a queer thing to say in the twentieth century when physiologists have proved that every disorder of mind or body alike is due to some microbe but what microbe covers the facts eh shew me the microbe thats all and let it produce that effect again on a guineapig colin pushed the decanter towards his guest awfully curious he said and it would be even more curious to see a guineapig behave like that girl lord wouldnt it look funny besides arent there diseases and disorders of the spirit as well as those of the mind and body of course there are what makes one fellow a saint and another a devil is that a microbe colin laughed the microbe that makes a man a saint is a devilish rare beast he said i never saw a case of sanctified possession did you but possession yes the devil was in the girl give the devil his due anyhow they believe in him in italy dont they evil eye all that sort of thing colin spoke in the lightest possible manner flicking the ash off the end of his cigar yes and it goes much deeper than that said mr cecil how interesting you mean they take the devil really seriously as a force to be reckoned with to be fought or sided with quite quite said mr cecil fought of course in general the church has a very strong hold and by exception sided with said colin the direct worship of satan really goes on still doesnt it inin holes and corners mr cecil evidently did not like the subject more than nino by now the puffing wind had increased into a roar which rattled the shutters and screamed round the corners of the house one does hear of such things he said the hot wind strangely exhilarated colin he felt it tingling in him he vibrated to its friendly violence on nino who entered the room now to see if the signori were not disposed to quit the table so that he might clear away it seemed to have an opposite effect like all natives he detested scirocco and looked jaded and washedout black mass for instance said colin to mr cecil nino at colins elbow clicked his tongue against his teeth colin turned round oh dont hang about nino he said go to bed you look cross and tired you can leave the things here till the morning good night nino had no answer for him but sullenly withdrew your servant doesnt seem to like the subject remarked mr cecil he looked as stuffy as a thundercloud when you mentioned the black mass i know nino twitters with superstition hes a son of the church he fears the devil without believing in him the black mass now do tell me what you know about it i dont believe theres anything you dont know about these wonderful southerners mr cecil certainly prided himself with reason on his extensive knowledge of subterranean italian life and it was hard to resist justifying his conviction well as a matter of fact i have some little knowledge of it he said indeed i possess a copy of the missal an extremely rare book ah thats interesting said colin what language latin italian no strangely enough it is in english in fact the book is probably unique it was printed in london in the early seventeenth century how it got into a bookstall in the via maurizio i havent any idea but there i found it colin leaned forward over the table his face all alight with eagerness such exactly might have been the missal in use in that sanctuarium at stanier had not his ancestor turned his back on his lord and benefactor and striven by craven acts of loveless piety to shuffle out of his contract before it became due now three centuries later it looked as if it was given to him to atone for that lamentable surrender and here was an opportunity for the furnishing of the chapel that was already being built sitting there with his face vivid and eager in the matchless charm of his youth and beauty he looked in contrast with the flushed little silenus opposite him like some young god in whom was incarnate the spirit of physical perfection surely no such gracious creature had ever been fashioned in the image of god mr cecil youre the most wonderful person he said you know everything take some whisky whats that damned boy of mine done with it ah there it is colin got up to fetch the bottle as he rose the catch of the shutters gave way under the press of the wind they swung wide and with a triumphant whoop the scirocco burst into the room like some vivid invisible presence colin laughed aloud with exultation and ran to the window where he wrestled with the shutters then just as suddenly there came a complete lull and he fastened them back into place and closed the windows the wind has been wanting to come in all evening to join us he said now it has had its way and it will be content theres your whisky now tell me all about the missal you will have to let me see it too mr cecil helped himself well certainly its a curious book he said and i take an antiquarians interest in it but naturally thats all to you and me of course it appears a mere farrago of ridiculous blasphemy because though were delighted to amuse ourselves eh and perhaps are not always as moral and monkish as we might be we dont want to be wicked for the sake of wickedness just so said colin in order to appreciate what the missal and the mass mean to the worshippers continued mr cecil we must try to imagine ourselvesif it were possibledelighting in evil for its own sake we must realize that to such ruffians as these evil is the mecca of their every thought and deed they worship it and in consequence detest and mock at all that you and i hold sacred though we may not live up to our beliefs still we hold them colin was bubbling with amusement and impatience he wanted mr cecil to get on but on the other hand it was wonderfully diverting to hear him talk like this he took a hand in it i think i can see what you mean he said these ruffians as you so rightly call them are fanatics in the cause of evil but do such people really exist yes and all the time they believe in god said mr cecil their creed is of defiance as well as worship colin liked knowing that his theories of yesterday were so wonderfully confirmed but it was all stale stuff to him mr cecil was instructing a master in the rudiments of his art and now for the contents of the missal he said as i say it will seem to you only a farrago of blasphemy repeated mr cecil but interesting as a human or rather a devilish document it follows the english use it is a parody in fact of the english use the exhortation i remember begins ye that do truly and earnestly delight you in your sins and intend to lead a vile life and so forth then follows the confession addressed of course to satan we acknowledge and bewail so it runs our manifold good deeds and loving actions which we from time to time have most grievously committed against thy divine majesty provoking most justly thy wrath and indignation against us we do earnestly repent it follows the words of the confession in our prayerbooks but what of the priest asked colin is he really a priest certainly he must as is stated in the preface be a dulyordained priest on whom the church has bestowed the power of absolution and of consecration if the celebrant was not a real priest the blasphemy of the black mass would be meaningless i see said colin horrible then follows the absolution and a satanistic rendering of the sanctus and then we come to what the romans call the canon of the mass and the consecration and that really is so shocking that i cant tell you about it but the point is this that when the priest has consecrated the elements he desecrates them in a manner laid down in the rubric that is the crowning and awful infamy i dont say im a very religious man myself but when i came to that i really felt the sweat come out on me all the time that colins eager face had been raised to his the brightness and beauty of it was something amazing never had he felt himself so truly in harmony with the spirit that inspired his life here under the symbolism of this rite was his own spirit revealed to him his hatred of love his love of hate here was the strengthening and refreshing of his soul the renewal mystically of the bargain made in elizabethan days he recalled himself from that flash of perception there was mr cecil looking really shocked and he lowered his dancing eyes how absolutely awful he said you make me shudder mr cecil and how well and vividly you are telling it but horrible as it all is i think you must let me see that missal ive got gruesome tastes you know i like to be horrified when will you let me see it you shall see it whenever you like you will be passing through naples on your way home and i should be delighted to shew it you we could have another bachelor evening together as we had before dear me i quite forgot that you were married now lord yardley i should never have said that but if you will persist in looking like a boy of eighteen colin was on fire with impatience to see this missal but he did not in the least want to spend another evening such as he had done before with this sprightly elderly sensualist in the cafs of naples passionately evil though he was there was not a grain of coarseness in him he had no objection to others wallowing in mere animalism poking and giggling and prying but he had no mind for it himself that was not his brand what was imperative was that he should get hold of this wonderful book without delay literally he thirsted for it and his thirst must be assuaged he would want to make a copy of it unless as he determined to try to do he could secure the original he could not wait ah yes bachelorevenings are not for me any more he said gaily im a father a heavy father mr cecil and i read the lessons in church on sunday mornings imagine if some respectable neighbour from stanier saw me razzledazzling in shady places in neapolitan slums i should be thought such a hypocrite but this missal couldnt i send nino across to naples tomorrow with a note from you to your housekeeper telling her to look on a certain shelf and let him have a certain book mr cecil gave a complacent little giggle im afraid that would hardly do he said that book is locked away in a cupboard and there are some other things there i should hardly like my housekeeper to see one or two of those terracottas from pompeii not quite in my housekeepers style you remember her comes from aberdeen aberdeen granite i call her colin had to continue propitiating this dreadful little man till he had got what he wanted excellent he said what a knack you have of hitting a person off mr cecil i remember her perfectly aberdeen granite awfully good but ive got to go to naples soon would it bore you too much if i came across with you on monday by all means do that and ill shew you the missal but its queer to me that you are so anxious to see it what was my phrase for it just now a mere farrago of blasphemy thats all it is somehow youve interested me in it said colin well what do you say about bed ive got no amusing little nighthaunts to shew you in capri were innocent arcadians here mr cecil who eat lotuses and go to bed at ten colin shewed his guest to his room and went to his own the scirocco which an hour ago had been raging had quite died down and he threw open his closed shutters and looked out on to the darkness thick and hot that furious wind which had clamoured round the house until it had burst open the venetian shutters and then as if its purpose had been fulfilled had ceased altogether seemed to have charged the night with power it tingled round him in bubbling eddies he could hear the sea maddened by that fierce tempest buffeting along the rocky coast to the south and surely not far away the wind still yelled but just here there was calm as at the centre of some cyclone colin accompanied mr cecil to naples on monday morning and they went straight to his house presently the cupboard containing the objects which were not fit for the stony eyes of aberdeen granite was open and mr cecil drew out a very thin quarto volume finely bound in tooled morocco but much worn theres your book for you he said its quite a long time since i set eyes on it a fine binding and i see what i had forgotten that theres a coronet and a coat of arms on the back colin before opening it looked at the cover there was an earls coronet and below he jumped out of his chair his eyes wide with wonder but mr cecil he cried this is the most amazing thing the things a miracle those are my arms and theres the date the book must have belonged to the founder of the family the elizabethan colin who made the bargain with satan no one could have put the coronet and his arms on a book in except him he died in then in a flash the whole history of the book dawned on him the theory was as incontestable as a mathematical proof ive got it he cried as you know he built stanier he collected pictures and bronzes and as i read the other day only in the memoirs he himself wrote he collected a quantity of magical and occult books and mentions among them a missal of wondrous blasphemies they dont exist at stanier nowadays probably he disposed of them dear me dear me said mr cecil reaching out his hand for the book your arms are they and the date and the coronet yes i see go on please my dear fellow well he lived an awful life said colin i will show you the memoirs when you come to england and stay with us as you must promise to do he enjoyed the benefits of his bargain to the full and he certainly contemplatedthis is rather private family historyhe contemplated building a sanctuary for satanic worship then the year before he died he got into a state of terror about the future he wrote no more about his awful deeds in his memoirs and he did not build the chapel of which he left the plan with a priests lodging adjoining now doesnt that fit in completely with the disappearance of the collection of magical lore and the book of wondrous blasphemies he fired them out of his library and read lives of the saints and that sort of truck those books are there yards of them and now the missal of wondrous blasphemies has turned up again there it is in your hand mr cecil looked at the device on the cover well upon my word that does seem a very sound hypothesis he said really if i had known colin laughed you neednt finish that sentence he said what is in your head is that you would never have shewn it me if you had known that it came from stanier he sat down again and laying his hand on mr cecils arm summoned all the charm and persuasion of which he was master i must have that book you know he said i should have tried to get you to let me buy it from you anyhow but now i really have the right to acquire it havent i now this reconstruction so ably sketched by colin had considerably increased the pride of possession in mr cecil it gave an immense interest to the missal to know that it had once belonged to so historical a faust as the first earl of yardley i dont see that theres any question of right about it he said colin bridled his impatience once the book was in his possession he wanted no more of mr cecil who for all he cared could burrow in underground naples to his hearts content until somebody knifed him perhaps right is too strong a word he said lets say suitability surely its very suitable that the book should go back to stanier as for price if youll tell me what you paid for it ill give you five times what it cost you mr cecil laughed i fancy i bought it for five liras say four shillings he said i dont know that twentyfive liras would tempt me very irresistibly five liras said colin my goodness i wish i had been shopping with you that day of course that makes my offer ludicrous but how about getting it valued by quaritch or somebody who knows i would then be delighted to pay you twice its estimated value mr cecil shook his head i dont really want to part with it he said charmed to let you read it but i want to own it said colin quietly in fact i must after all it is only a question of terms please name your terms mr cecil for answer merely put the book in the cupboard from which he had taken it and turned the key on it colins insistence had increased his determination to keep the book as a strong subcurrent in his mind there was the notion that here was this enormously wealthy young man who for some reason of his own intensely wanted the book there was no harm in running up the price ah my dear boy you dont understand the collectors spirit he said he is as obstinate as a mule when he has got hold of something he values the book is not for sale colin felt one spasm of furious rage it was for the honour of his lord and benefactor that he was engaged and at that moment he would have stuck at nothing to get his desire from the depth of his heart he let some voiceless intense petition issue as that silent prayer welled out of his inmost soul his anger fell off him like dead autumn leaves and through him there spread the clear consciousness of the presence of the power which two nights ago had infused the riot of the wind and brooded in the calm that followed what had made him angry was the sense of his own impotence to get what he wanted what gave him now this sense of perfect confidence was the knowledge that an allencompassing power possessed him he spoke as it was given him to speak without thought or reflection but with the irresponsibility of inspiration his smile came back to his lips and to his eyes that boyish charm and brightness ah we mustnt quarrel mr cecil he said surely you are wise enough to see that people who quarrel with me have no luck ever afterwards and believe me i should hate to be the cause the unwitting cause i may say for it is none of my doing of what might befall you dont force me to break you to atomsyes you may stare but i mean just that and at the bottom of your heart you know i mean it and youre afraid already well you may be for you are beginning to guess what stands by me indeed mr cecil was staring at him and indeed he knew that he was afraid as he looked some nameless inexplicable terror began to stir in him colin paused the power that gripped him grew in intensity as he yielded himself to it and it now completely possessed him so that he had no volition of his own and no consciousness of himself apart from it once more he spoke and though with his outward ears he could hear the words he uttered he did not grasp their import he was a mouthpiece only of the power that used his lips he had no idea what he was saying all he knew was that his voice uttered the syllables which as they were spoken he heard but which once said passed from his mind altogether but as he spoke he saw mr cecils face change the ruddiness of it blanched to a deadly glistening whiteness and suddenly with a cry he started to his feet and fumbled for his keys and opened the cupboard door stop stop thats enough he said for gods sake for gods sake here heres the accursed thing take it and begone the power that possessed colin ebbed and sank and he felt his own individuality restored to him he did not know what he had been saying but whatever it was it had been sufficient for this gross little man was as white as paper and shaking he thrust the missal into his hand thats delightful of you mr cecil he said i thought i was sure in fact that when i put the case to you quite simply like that you would agree with me now i will take this to quaritchs or wherever you choose and send you their estimate of what it would fetch at a good auction and with that i will send you a cheque for double the amount its value to me as perhaps i told you is quite inestimable mr cecil mopped his face i will not receive a penny for it he said hoarsely it is for me to thank you for taking it off my hands oh i cant accept such generosity said colin i must ask you to and in your turn you can do me a favour willingly it is yours said colin then never let me set eyes on you again said mr cecil colin rose and picked up his hat delighted he said why on earth should i want to see you again you didnt think i liked you did you he found a letter from pamela waiting for him on his return to the villa with his treasure that evening in which she announced her arrival in a couple of days this letter to his mind was thoroughly typical of her type reeking with subconscious falsity cloaking the obvious with the transparent and pretending that it did not shew through was it worth while for instance to ask whether violet was with him when she knew so well that her visit was based on the fact of violets absence and was it worth while to say that she wondered whether she had not better stay at an hotel she knew perfectly well that she had not the smallest intention of staying at an hotel she would not have come to capri for that colin could imagine the blankness of her face if when he met her he told her that he had taken a nice room for her at the bella vista or that violet was with him at the villa or should he telegraph and put her off altogether he carried this question still undecided down with him to the beach next morning and as he swam turned it coolly over in his mind and as he basked on the hot shingle let his decision liquefy and declare itself for himself he did not in the least want her here neither as comrade nor as lover had he any use for her her beauty made no spell for his senses and the very fact that it was his for the asking discounted it to a zero if she had been difficult of access he might have found pleasure in the chase as it was it was only himself who was being chased on the other hand as he had already sketched it out the prospect of some ludicrous and humiliating dnouement for her attracted him it would be amusing also to play the part of the outraged moralist the unsuspecting and devoted husband how his face would pass from amazement to indignation when she made her meaning clear or perhaps some intolerable humiliation he turned over on to his back and threw an arm across his eyes to shield them from this resplendent glare of the noonday and let his body and limbs drink in the light and the heat these were the allurements of the south the hot basking and the plunge into that liquid crystal the mouldering fragments of roman masonry with lizards basking on them and tufts of fragile campanula springing from the crevices dusty roads with walledin paths leading through the ripening vineyards stories of tiberio wine decanted from perettas into bottles stoppered with green folded leaves ripe figs and the warm dusk of evening saunterings on the piazza among darkeyed boys and smiling girls gay and friendly all these made up the italian spell of exquisite conditions and effortless existence to his loveless nature mere physical passion was an affair of kisses and laughter and light caresses to be enjoyed and forgotten and renewed if you adored a womans personality you would need her body soul and spirit but without love to inspire passion she provided no more than a pastime and love was his enemy whether it was such love as violets or such as pamelas its only office was to give quarry for his sport he liked laying traps and ambushes for it he liked hurting and humiliating it sometimes of course the claims of the body were insistent you desired satisfaction if only to rid you of its unease just so if you had a corn you would go to a corncutter who would make you comfortable yes pamela shall come he said to himself and god knows in what plight pamela shall go that would all be settled for him he thought some inspiration would come not out of his own contrivance and ingenuity but like those words which he had spoken to mr cecil yesterday out of a subtler wisdom than his never had he been able to recollect them they were spoken in some ecstasy and how well they had done their work he had seen how the mans face changed to damp ash as he listened would pamelas suffer some such change he raised himself on his elbow the air over the hot white beach was tremulous with the heat a few yards away the sea still as a lake sent no tiniest ripple to its liquid rims within it like the fire in some precious stone a network of light played over the pebbles that lay below and more than ever this morning colin was conscious of the fire within himself which like that radiance within the sea made a dancing light deep in his soul he had read and reread that missal of wondrous blasphemies and like faust it fed his soul in the devotion of worship was the true expression of the spirit and with what knowledge of its needs had the compiler framed the ritual of mockery and defiance the vestments of the priest and his acolyte the gestures and genuflexions with which he accompanied his acts the atrocious symbolism ordained for the decking of the altar all stirred the imagination to the lust of evil those impious orisons how they prepared the soul for the culminating act described in the rubric the very reading of which had made mr cecil sweat with horror to colin it had given a gasp and spasm of delight it expressed in visible symbol the core and spirit of his being here was the fire and the dancing radiance that worked within him presently when the building which his ancestor had planned at stanier was erected it would blaze up a beacon of selfdedication well it was time for a final swim for he was roasted through and through and already nino with the boat that should take him back to the marina was approaching and running over the hot pebbles he fell forward into the sea and lay floating with arms and legs spread wide and face submerged his own shadow hovered below him on the bottom with flickering outline and the water clear as air seemed to hold the sunshine in solution for the moment the cool tingling touch made him forget the missal and the traps to be laid for love the sheer exquisitness of bodily sensation contented all his needs if only that sensation could be preserved in all its first sharpness he could imagine himself happy without his burning love of hate and his hate of love in this nirvana of liquidness and sun chapter v colin was lying full length in the shadow of the ruined walls and tumbled masonries that crowned the cliff at the east end of the island a few yards away was the windbitten edge from which the huge rock plunged sheer into the sea pamela sat by him leaning on her elbow at the moment her hand was foraging in his breastpocket for his cigarettecase she would find it for herself she said he need not disturb himself his shirt was unbuttoned at the neck and the raising of his left arm to make a pillow for his head delved a cupped hollow of suntanned skin above his collar bone he had just told her that this ruin of walls was one of the palaces of tiberius he had seven palaces on the island said colin lazily wasnt that imperial one for each day of the week perhapsoh they didnt have weeks but it doesnt matterand this was the sunday one her fingers found the cigarettecase it lay against his chest and as she withdrew it her fingertips perceived the steady beat of his heart presently when she put it back they would dwell there again for a moment why his sunday palace she asked oh just the best and biggest the one he enjoyed most the better the day the better the palace he was awfully tiberian here nino told me all about it such goingson it was a sort of sunday school he used to send for some samples of nice young things to stay with him from saturday till monday and if he got tired of the girl he chose he had her brought out and chucked over the edge just as you throw away a paper bag when youve eaten your spongecake colin what a horrible story she said i think i had better move further from the edge in case you feel youre tired of me now thats unkind of you said he ive been doing my best as host not only to amuse you but to enjoy myself which is the first duty of a host i wonder if you have enjoyed my being here she said in interruption dont stop me in the middle of a sentence said he as i was saying ive been trying to do my duty as a host and the impression ive left on my guest appears to be that i am tired of her she put the cigarettecase back even if his pocket had been full of redhot pebbles she could not have prevented her fingers from lingering there to feel that slow steady pulsation below but it did not quicken under her touch and how she longed for that no i dont believe youre really tired of me she said i was fishing for a compliment but i dont seem to have used the right bait but my dear why should you fish for compliments from me he asked great friends like us dont pay compliments to each other sometimes i wonder if we are great friends said she colin waited for this train of thought to develop itself if he took no notice of what she had said it was certain that she would carry it a step farther or at any rate repeat it she had been here a couple of days during which she had never let go of herself at all she had been quite cool and comradelike violet might have listened to all that they had to say to each other but today there had been signs that her selfcontrol was becoming difficult to her she had sulkedno lessat luncheon and that was a sure sign it always meant that a woman wanted to be asked ever so delicately and affectionately what was the matter he knew quite well what was the matter and so had not asked but remained goodnatured and maddeningly unconscious of her mood till she gave that up and apologized for being so silent then to make amends as if he cared she had been effusive with protestations of how much she was enjoying herself of how good it was of him to ask her here and now again this wondering if they were great friends indicated a certain perturbation tell me are we great friends she asked he knew she would ask that again women are such damned fools and he leaned lazily towards her and tell me he said dont you know it his face must have reassured her for she let her eyes dwell on it and broke into a smile i suppose i do she said you wouldnt have asked me to stay with you otherwise what a bore we women must be we always want to be reassured about the things a man takes for granted colin turned over on to his side i never take anything for granted he said its really much wiser not to expect anything and not to count on anything till its given you he knew she would attach a certain meaning to that she did colin what nonsense she said why youre the one person in the world who always gets what he wants he sat up plucked two long stems of grass and threaded them together with that rapt intentness which must mean to her that he was thinking of something else than this task of his fingers not a bit he said i have so often expected to get what doesnt come to me and then what comes instead is a disappointment moral never ask never expect take what is given you and be thankful and if nothing is given you do without it but my dear i didnt bring you up here to bore you with mild philosophical homilies he threw away his threaded grass stems and appeared to throw away with them his unspoken preoccupation to get back to our topic he said i was telling you that tiberius pitched the favourite of the night over the edge of the cliff i always make pictures in my mind of ninos stories of tiberius he tells them so vividly it was just here it happened at dawn when the rising sun came over the top of the hills there above sorrento so that it shone on this palace on the peak but below it was still clear dusk and tiberius came out of the palace rather bored and rather sleepy followed by two black slaves who dragged hishis discard along then he made a sign to them and they picked her up by the wrists and ankles and swung her once or twice and then let go out she went a glimmer of white limbs like a starfish clutching at the empty air and turning slowly over as she fell she passed out of the sunlight into the shadow below and then there was a little splash just a little white feather on the sea and that was all or perhaps if they did not swing her far enough she would fall on the beach and there would be no splash tiberius peered over the edge and then went in to have his early morning tea or whatever they took then and probably dozed for a little perhaps the chill of the dawn had made him sneeze i shall write a picturesque guidebook to capri some day and send you a copy from the author pamela hastened to fit herself to his mood he did not want to talk about the only thing that interested her which was their personal relations to each other and she was wise enough not to bore him by an insistent return to them men were like that even if they were tremendously in love with a woman they did not want to discuss it all day they kept their other interests alive and intact they played golf just the same or talked politics or ate their dinner whereas a woman when she was in love thought about nothing whatever else but she did not make a man any fonder of her by limiting her conversation to that and if he was not in love with her she ruined her chance if she irritated him by bleating she had to be sympathetic and interested in what occupied him if she was to get her way with him but how increasingly hard it was to be intelligent and companionable when only one thing mattered and it was the part of wisdom not to mention that do write a guidebook to capri she said youre quite horrible about tiberius and his sunday palace but you make it tremendously picturesque youre frightfully pitiless you know you havent a grain of sympathy for that poor white starfish what had she done to be chucked over the edge why she had bored him said colin lucidly after all what more horrible outrage can we commit on each other pamelas mind switched back to personal matters she mustnt bore colin well it was his own fault for having chosen her she said he ought to have seen she would have bored him quite so of course he became more savage just because it was his fault what a nuisance she was he thought whatever he said to pamela she wanted to be bright and discuss it and argue and interest him it was his fault also that he had allowed her to come here and that had the same effect on him as on tiberius yes thats quite true we always are angry with others when weve been mistaken in them or have injured them she said colin suddenly registered the fact that he hated her the knowledge seemed to spring from no particular source it was blown to him perhaps on this evening breeze in consequence he exerted himself to charm and attract her for that was the path that led to the completest outrage and humiliation for her he hated her passion for him and therefore inflamed it so that she would pay the more for it i dont believe you ever wanted to injure anybody he said youve got the most adorable nature do you know my dear how about compliments she asked great friends dont pay each other compliments you told me well i wanted to let you know that i had noticed it leave it at that ah look the loveliest light of all is beginning just before sunset sea and sky and land all get inside an opal the hard wearisome brilliance of the afternoon fades and you have ten minutes of pure fairyland everything is unreal and exquisite you can hardly believe in the beauty of it i could almost jump over the cliff myself for the sheer joy of falling free and unfettered through the air one is too much anchored when one is on land swimming you get some feeling of being unattached to anything but think if one was falling falling through the air and what does it matter if theres death at the end one would have had a perfect moment fancy being happy though only for a few seconds he sat with knees drawn up to his chin looking outwards over the bright gulf of air below which the sea lay blue and unflecked and he heard her take a quick breath as she looked at him then turning he saw the fire in her eyes so nearly breaking into flame fairyland he said and you look a real native of it pamela my dear real native it sounds as if i were calling you a whitstable oyster and then as one fairyland fadeslook its going quicklyanother the fairyland of night begins i could sit here at least so i believe this moment all night with you watching the stars wheel and fancying i could hear the rustle of the world as it span through space until it came out of the tunnel of the night into morning again but you would have to be close by me i couldnt do it alone i should get selfconscious and thats the ruin of magic my dear how bored you would get before sunrise he saw the fire begin to leap in her eyes and he did not want it to burst out yet there must be some greater abasement for her than his mere solitary derision if he let her now say what was trembling on her lips or if under the impulse she could barely resist she clasped and clung to him that fire must be damped down for the present the core of it would only grow the hotter for that he laughed and went on without pause what dreadful positions i put you in he said you are almost bound to say that you would be delighted to stay here all night with me and your tongue would be blistered for that thumping lie how bored you would be before morning i shall get nino to come instead poor nino he would have to do as he was told and i shouldnt care how bored he was or your maid perhaps she would come or ninos stepmother but a companion would be necessary just somebody just anybody she got up stung to the quick but colin was quite undismayed the fire burned all right that blast of cold air only made the core of it turn whitehot as the surface of it for the moment ceased to glow perhaps she was going to sulk again but apparently she had not found that of any use instead after that one moment of averted face she laughed youre a savage she said i wouldnt trust myself up here for a night with you you would get tired of me and push me over the edge he sprang up this was how to treat her with romance and sweetness one moment and the next with this callous indifference and then with gay affection again and encouragement and nonsense till she was dizzy with desire and bewilderment and pique he could play on her like a lute which presently he would dash down and trample on the manner of that was beginning to form itself in his mind it would serve her right for coming to capri in this compromising way ah youre really unkind he said thats the second time youve told me you were afraid i should commit a murderous assault on you im a savage there it is how you bully me but i forgive you youre one of those blessed people who will always be forgiven whatever they do sunbeams of life you melt whatever you shine on blessed ray from that celestial luminary colins sudden pomposity was irresistibly funny he spoke with a throaty pious intonation oh what nonsense you talk she said are you ever the same for two minutes together just now you were in fairyland and then you snubbed me and now youre a dreadful sort of parson when are you colin colin continued to be the dreadful parson dear friends he said let us ask ourselves in all humility of heart how often we are our own true selves i would fain we were our true selves oftener what is it that the swan of avon says to thine own self be true and then you will be true to everybody else truth and lies how wholly unlike they are the one to the other let us sing the hymn the sun is sinking fast golly so it is pamela and the antiquarian lecture i meant to give you hasnt been begun yet lets go home and my hair is full of grassseeds with lying down stand still and ill pick them out she said she perceived in his sunwarmed hair the faint fragrance of the sea and longed to bury her face in it no it doesnt matter perhaps theyll sprout i should like to have a hayfield on my head i would sit in the hay then to skip a few centuries when the christians came to the island they built a little shrine up here and erected that bloated statue of the virgin i suppose they thought her image would disinfect the place from its tiberian memories but it doesnt its pagan in spite of all their statues youre a pagan too pamela thats why you fit in so well up here yes ive never believed in anything said she how can one believe in anything one doesnt know of i believe in what i see and hear and touch and feel i know of nothing else but these things im a flame that throws a little light round itself so that it perceives and then its blown out all the more reason for making the most of it while its alight they had begun the downward descent of the steep path too narrow for two to walk abreast colin just behind her found his muscles twitching with intolerance of her shallowness then you dont fear death he asked of course not as long as things are pleasant and i dont have toothache or cancer i dont want to die but if i was fearfully unhappy i shouldnt think twice about dying or if she paused a moment the path had broadened out and there was room for them both or if said he stepping to her side or if i was terribly happy she said softly it would be dull to go back to ordinary pleasantness after that to flare up and go out not a bad fate colin who wants to gutter away into old age he laughed then all your friends must keep you gently simmering he said you mustnt be allowed to be terribly happy or terribly unhappy or youd blow yourself out like a candle but i dont agree at all i shall like being old i shant then have desires and expectations which i fear to put to the test i shall be a gentle old man with a beard and a bathchair and some grandchildren and some gout and no memory and no desires but enough of that lets observe the features of the landscape theres the town beginning to twinkle with lights and theres the marina with the evening boat just coming in and theres that wonderful monte solaro where well go tomorrow if you like a long walk at the top you can see fifty thousand miles in every direction and there are tawny lilies in the grass also quantities of insects with quantities of legs and heres the villa blessed place but rather sad yet i have been awfully happy here sometimes you know i spent my honeymoon here with violet that was designed to prick her and excellently well it did so for pamela had not forgotten that little tragedy of violets dislike of him which he had talked of on the terrace at stanier and now he clearly conveyed to her that violets coldness had infused the villa with the bitterness of sweet memories as they entered together in the cool dusk there was lying on the table just inside the door a letter for him and she heard him mutter to himself rather than say to her ah thats from violet and opening it he instantly became absorbed in it to pamela that was the definite challenge it was as if violets glove had been thrown on the floor between them and all aflame she went on up the stairs and into her room which stood at the head of them so it was violet for whom he still ached and thirsted and the knowledge was a spur to her passion the cause of his cool friendliness to herself vague and indefinite before was firmly outlined now she knew what stood in her way and what must be demolished after all he had asked her here alone that argued strongly in favour of her success and it was up to her to make good the footing he had given her it was still the thought of violet which occupied him now that she knew that she could act on her knowledge she must use her utmost seduction not alone for her own enhancement but to point the contrast between violets lovelessness and herself and without doubt she held an advantage he and she were alone together in this spellstruck island with all the setting for passion they were both young and she was a beautiful woman his preoccupation with violet had blinded him he had not seen with what intensity she wanted him he had said that he never counted on anything until it was given him what could that mean except that he was not certain about her there should be no further doubt about that colin read his letter through twice as a matter of fact it was not from violet at all but how well he played on that poor lute with his muttered information he knew just what effect his absorption in a letter from violet would have on his companion but there was nothing false about his absorption in his letter for it was from his architect and told him of the progress of what was in building at stanier the walls were rising apace he had plenty of old weathered bricks for the facing of it and assuredly the addition would be quite in keeping with the south front of the house so that was good and in the meantime there was plenty to occupy him he went up to his room where nino was waiting for him to come and dress and his tactics for the evening were all settled now though he had scarcely given a conscious thought to them the plan whatever its success might be had ripened of its own accord like a fruit hanging on a sunny wall and he longed to set his teeth in it surely his project would be successful what came to him like this always succeeded as he dressed he looked round the room the door from the passage was opposite the window in the wall to the right was the door into pamelas room converted from its usual habit of sittingroom in the wall to the left the door that led to ninos room there was but little furniture there would be plenty of space for ninos bed along the wall of pamelas room his own was on the other side in the corner by the window head to the wall beside it were two switches that turned on the light above his bed and that in the middle of the room suspended by a cord from the arch of the vaulted ceiling that would do nicely well nino he said i havent seen you all day i dont have so much time to bully you now ive got a visitor to attend to dont you hope shell stop till we go back to england nino grinned he did not want any visitors he much preferred being bullied by colin to not seeing him and it had entered his curly head that his master was just as happy alone with him as with his guest i can do without visitors he said well i expect you will very soon have to said colin he pulled his shirt over his head and went softly to the door into pamelas room it was shut nino you dont say your prayers before you get into bed do you he asked or snore when youre asleep or have any monkey tricks of that kind no neither prayers nor snoring said nino you have never heard me pray or snore i dont think i have and dont let me he came close to the boy i want you to sleep in my room tonight nino he said isnt that odd but i do and ill promise not to pray or snore either bring in your bed when your sister has done the room and put it alongside that wall there be in bed when i come up can you keep awake if you wish me to said nino i do and when ive got into bed and put out the light i want you to lie quite still whatever happens i dont suppose it will be for long and if by chance afterwards i turn on the light again i want you to sit up in bed and look cheerfully round and laugh or do anything you like do you understand i understand what the signor says but i do not understand what he means said nino well perhaps you will and then after that you can go to sleep poor nino how i bully and sweat you arent i a queer creature youre sure you quite understand what i say say it over to me and then run downstairs and see if dinners ready colin finished dressing and when nino returned tapped on the door that communicated with pamelas room dinners ready he called out and if you are come in here a minute youve never seen my room have you pamela entered for the last two evenings she had only put on a teagown for their gardendinner but tonight she was resplendent in a blue silvershot magnificence cut very low and clinging close to her beautiful girlish figure over her arm she carried a cloak of pale pink feathers colin stood openmouthed you perfectly glorious vision he said youre superb youre dazzling do you like it she said i was tired of being so dowdy like it i adore it said he its really almost worthy of you she looked round the room oh colin what a nice room she said just a rug and a bed and a washingstand and a couple of chairs tremendously like you somehow he laughed im a penny plain said he and youre quite twopence coloured i bet you that gown didnt cost less than twopence come to dinner i shall walk backwards in front of you and stare at you you wont youll give me your arm the table was set at the end of the pergola lit by electric lights half screened in the vineleaves among which the bunches were beginning to ripen curtains of brown sailcloth were hung between the pillars and nino had drawn all these but one so that their table was screened from the house and the road below this one square opening looked westwards where the last crimson of sunset was fading and across it rose the black stem of the stone pine and though the night was windless here some murmur as of the distant sea stirred drowsily in its branches nino serving them slipped noiselessly to and fro and presently he brought them their coffee shall i draw the other curtain signor he asked colin glanced at pamela and there was no need to ask her what she preferred yes nino he said and clear away now just leave the cloth all through dinner they had been gay on trivial topics and again and again she had known that battery of swift glances like signals that he had cast on her as if unable to take his eyes off her for long now she pushed back the cloak that she had thrown over her shoulders ah thats right he said more to himself than her though he laughed at himself for doing so he often listened to the sound of the breeze as if to a wordless and friendly counsellor what a delightful evening youre giving me pamela he said you wean me from myself with your splendour and your gaiety i declare that since you came into my room before dinner i havent once thought of that letter i found waiting for me from violet she said his eyebrows contracted as if with a twinge of pain yes oh no bad news excellent news shes getting on wonderfully well without me hopes i am enjoying myself very much i join her in that wish said pamela i know you do bless you and it would be black and ungrateful of me if i didnt recognize that my dear youve been such a godsend coming here to sit on the perch with the moping owl you mustnt mope she said youre an owl for moping colin i dont mope except with you said he its shocking bad manners i know and yet its one of those involuntary compliments ooh the relief of getting somebody who understands his eyes left her face dwelt hovering over her breast and came back again help me pamela he said she leaned forward over the table she loved this weakness and this appeal violet has used you abominably she said no no you mustnt say that he interrupted but i must say that i want to help you my dear and ah how lovely it is that you ask me to tryand you must lay hold on that she gets on wonderfully well without you you told me let that rouse your pride dont let your happiness suffer shipwreck over that heavens if i found that anyone i was fond of got on wonderfully well without me that would make me determined to get on just as well without him i saw how charming and gentle you were with her at stanier and she gives you a stone she gives me nothing said he in a voice suddenly harsh and bitter she put her hand on his as it lay on the table and he felt her pulses leap at the contact i like to hear you say that she said say it again and again till the truth of it stings you realize it make it part of yourself instead of looking at it from outside and mourning over it oh my dear have some pride you arent going to let all your power of love and of happiness pour itself away into the sand of a desert youve got enough power of happiness to light up the midnight dont waste it shes going it rather well thought colin and im not doing it badly i know youre right he said he raised his eyes to hers of course im right said she oh youth passes so quickly and with it all power of real happiness though you may tell me that you will like to be old ah what nonsense colin youre so different to what i thought you at first when first we met and made friends you were all laughter and enjoyment who could have guessed that you knew sorrow or unrequited love she paused a moment in that gaze of his there was a light she had never seen there yet so suffocatingly sweet to her was it that she panted for breath dont fence yourself in she said and mourn over ruins build with them use use the stones you spoke of to make a pleasurehouse laugh to see them serve your end he looked at her in amazement there was enchantment and force in her and her beauty was enough to make a mans senses reel was this the strength of which violet had spoken which was more potent than all else in the world pamela leaned back her head pushing the heavy black hair from her forehead open the curtains colin she said lets have some air im stifling was she going to faint he thought or adopt some mean feminine device of her weakness to escape from the situation that was closing round her and which she had done her best to provoke that would be tragic he pulled back the curtain with a rattle of rings and the still tide of the night swept in ah thats delicious she said not faint he asked not overtired not a bit it was just a breath of air i wanted our lovely little tent was concentrated overcharged are you sure he said hadnt you better go quietly to bed it would be wretched if in return for the help and strength you bring meah such help such strength if all the kingdoms of the world had been his he would have staked them against a pennypiece on her answer it was her hour she was winning so she thought all down the line this was not the moment for the victor to ask for a truce she rose from her chair and stood by him the flame burst out from her enveloping her in fire its all yours she whispered all all she swayed towards him and he caught her close her face was against his and she sought his lips no word no whisper even came from her dumbly she clung to him and exultant he betrayed her with a kiss the best and the worst of her love trust and all that was merely sensual as well were his for one second he wavered and reconsidered partly it was the mere beauty and physical intensity of her that gave him pause partly also something akin to what he had felt when he saw dennis staggering on the terrace at stanier then back stronger than ever from the gathered force of that check came his hatred of love we must go in he said pamela you adorable thing your pity first and then your love they paused at the head of the stairs not a word had passed since they left the table but your maid next door he queried and her smile told him she understood colin went softly into his room there was ninos bed along the wall and nino there already awake and silent and eager for any adventure of colins contriving he tore off his clothes and as he undressed once or twice his eyes caught ninos and he had to check himself from laughing aloud he slid into bed and clicked off the light there was no long waiting there came a faint rattle from the door into pamelas room but in the darkness nothing was visible there and colin heard the door close again and the key turned he could just hear her feet on the bare tiles of the floor and then from close at hand a little bubbling laugh and his name softly called the sheer happiness of love sounded in that whisper it might have been violets voice speaking to him on one of the nights of their honeymoon here and he hated the inimitable thrill of it he reached his hand to the switches and turned them both on she was standing in the middle of the room just under the light from the ceiling in that strong illumination the thin silk nightdress which was all that covered her was transparent as a veil of sunpierced mist her figure crowned by that bright flame of her face was clearly visible and her apparelled magnificence was pale beside this luminous revealed perfection colin almost regretted that he had prepared this hellish surprise for her tonight tomorrow would have done as well and yet what thrill of physical love could rival this gorgeous humiliation how superbly moral it was the woman had tempted him coming to him at solitary midnight in the blaze of her beauty and for once the man master of his soul derided her seduction but the infamy of the brothels of sodom was nearer salvation than his chastity she heard a stir behind her and halfturned there was nino sitting upright in bed simultaneously colin spoke hullo heres a pretty lady he said has she come to visit you or me nino ill pretend to be asleep if you like she turned back towards colin as he spoke and there came over her face just such a blanching just such a stark terror as had struck the colour from mr cecils colins laughing mouth his dancing blue eyes were close to her in his hurry to be ready for her he had not put on his nightclothes and over his slim suntanned body as he sat up in bed the skinsheathed muscles rippled as he breathed and at the sight as if the horror of the gorgons head had been shewn her she turned to stone her arms made one stiff movement as if drawing a cloak round her to hide her and she went back to the door through which she had come a violent trembling seized her she could scarcely grasp the key in her fingers the locks a little stiff said colin ah thats right what a short visit good night dear pamela colin jumped out of bed the moment she had gone and briskly turned the key well have no more visitors tonight nino he said the bold slut theres a lesson for her whats the matter nino ninos face was buried in his pillow he had given that one glance at her as she stood under the light and then for very pity had hidden his eyes from her intolerable shame now at colins voice he looked up ah the poor lady he said you were terrible to her signor some ecstasy of wickedness possessed colin naked as a young greek god and as fair he capered round the room in an abandonment of glee oh the poor pretty lady he cried what a pleasant hour she had planned and what a disappointment but how naughty of her she shocked me what will she plan next do you think i would bet on a slight headache in the morning and breakfast in her room or will she make an effort and catch the early boat chi sa good night nino he jumped into bed nino could hear it shaking under the gusts of his smothered laughter colin according to his wont slept dreamlessly and woke to find ninos hand on his shoulder rousing him wake signor he said colin yawned and stretched himself ill raise your wages nino if youll go away he said the signora began nino colin broke off his yawn and began to laugh good lord yes he said well what about the signora i hope she had as good a night as i she did not sleep in her bed said nino and she is not in the house well what then shes gone by the early boat i thought she very likely would so cool in the early morning probably she has left a note for her maid to say so look and find it ill have breakfast out of doors he got out of bed and while he dressed basked in the wonderful memories of the night before just here had she stood for that short moment and then with that odd gesture of folding something round her had turned what a horrid humiliated night she must have passed too badly stung to sleep and only eager for the morning and the boat that left at six oclock which would carry her away from the island he wondered whether if he had received a slap like that he would have turned tail certainly it would have been an embarrassing breakfast next morning they would have had to talk with great perseverance and animation he rather thought that he would have stopped and brazened it out to show he didnt care nino entered again ive found a note signor he said but it is addressed to you not to her maid it was on the breakfast table in the pergola colin held out his hand for it and opened it it was quite short i was terribly happy here it ran and i have been terribly unhappy so it is goodbye colin he knitted his brows surely he had heard something very like this only a few hours before then he remembered noone knows of this but you nino he asked no signor i found it and brought it to you colin stood crumpling the note in his hand a contingency had presented itself with the reading of that note which he wished to be prepared for if the implication there hinted at was true he did not want to stew in that ebullition of scandal and gossip which would boil up if last nights adventure were known three people knew of it possibly only two now himself and nino for a few seconds he thought intently then his face cleared now listen to me nino he said you have found no note for me you have brought me no note the last you saw of the signora was when you brought us coffee last night after dinner in the garden thats all you know ah wait a moment your bed move it back to your room where of course you slept last night as usual ill help you now colin laid his hands on the boys shoulders and looked him in the face when did you see the signora last he said ninos eyes were wide with some unspoken terror last night he said when i brought your coffee after dinner and you found nothing on the table when you went to lay my breakfast this morning no signor good boy now be quick with my coffee i long to be in the sea this morning colin swam and basked and swam again spending the whole morning on the beach he was convinced that when pamela wrote that note to him she had intended at any rate to take her own life for the wording of it reproduced too closely for any explanation of fortuitous resemblance what she had said to him the evening before as they came home very likely she had not done so for there was a big gulf between such an intention and its execution it was one thing to feel that you were terribly unhappy and quite another to put an end to your unhappiness most people preferred any amount of unhappiness to forcing an entry through the door that led no man knew whither even if it led into nothingness anything that could happen to you was better than nothingness colin came up out of the water and after brushing the wetness off him sat down on the hot shingle supposing pamela had done what her melodramatic little note implied what would he think of her or what which concerned him more would he think of himself of course he had never dreamed of such a possibility but if she had done it what a swift and surprising drama yet how abominably stupid and how if you looked at it clearly how selfconscious there was revenge in it too she meant at fatal cost to herself to overwhelm him with remorse at this great final gesture was it a sign of love to do that which might be calculated however mistakenly to bring misery on the adored yet after all it was not love of him that might have driven her to the desperate act it was no more than selflove and selfpity for that unexpected exposure he remembered just how she had looked when he turned up the light and she heard nino stir if he had supplied a determining motive at all it was fear misery remorse what had he done to be miserable or remorseful for the woman was a slut and she had come to stay with a respectable married man who had assured her that his hearts devotion was consecrated to his wife and knowing that she had deliberately tried to seduce him coming into his room at midnight and offering herself there was a fine story to tell the world if so he chose and nino with a wink from him would testify to the veracity of the crucial episode and the stern morality of his own attitude his scorn of her intrusion that was the cream of it the missal of wonderful blasphemies itself contained no mockery so distilled and then supposing she had done nothing desperate at all but simply gone for a nice walk to think things over and console her wounded vanity it was easy to realize what he would feel then mockery sheer mockery and contempt at the fiasco she had written that note to indicate what she meant to do and when it came to the doing of it she had squealed and shied off at the idea of going out alone into the dark of nothingness or whatever she imagined was the next scene probably she thought that nothingness came next that was the usual conclusion of such shallow folk he knew better than that the dense stupidity the blindness of those who did not believe in the hereafter of heaven and hell he knew his hereafter well enough the eternal hate or if love was too strong the eternal spectacle of love and to have no share in it to sit in a cave of ice and in an everlasting numbness of cold to behold the sun but the very thought of that the certainty that in the end god would somehow beat him gave the spice to defiance safe in the protection of evil as long as life lasted he would enjoy and deride without remorse or fear he chose evil because he loved it and because he hated love even when it was such love as pamela had tried to enchain him with for it partook in its narrow greedy sphere of the true essence in that she wanted somebody not herself and if she longed to get she also longed to give through the windless calm there came the sound of some rhythmical movement and sitting up he saw a boat approaching with swiftlydipping oars the sun was bright on the water and it was only a vague black speck but soon he saw who was rowing in such a hurry he had said he would come back for lunch so why had nino come down to the bathingplace news of some kind perhaps nino beached the boat and jumped out the signora he said so shes come back said colin i knew she would nino looked at him with wide eyes of horror they brought her back he said two fishermen found her in the water below the high cliff where tiberios palace is the palace you call the sunday palace part ii chapter i colin got out of his motor when it stopped at the lodgegates at stanier and struck into the woods through which a short cut led to the house he had been in london for the last month and had driven down after lunch on this april afternoon through glints of sunshine and scuds of windy rain but now with the fall of day the sky had cleared and after the pavements and fogs of the town he longed to immerse himself in the sense of stanier and spring woods and birdsong all round him were the melodies and the enchantments of the spring the turf underneath the foot was elastic with the thick growth of the young grass and vivid with little round cushions of greenest moss and the smell of the damp earth was fresh and fragrant neither oak nor ash were yet more than budding but the great hawthorns that studded the slopes up from the lodge to the high ground were covered with the varnished clusters of young leaf the hazels and alders by the stream that ran into the lake were gay with pendulous catkins and moleskin buttons and the copses of birch and hornbeam were fullfledged clumps of primroses and sheets of anemonies were in flower in plantations where the young trees had been felled last year and outside on the turf the wild daffodils bloomed among the curled heads of the young bracken once and again a coppercoloured cock pheasant scurried away from beside the path with head low and stealthy stride in the covers thrushes were vocal with evensong and in some remote treetop the chiffchaff was metallically chirping from the firs pigeons started out with clapping wings and a heron disturbed at his fishing flapped ponderously away the path rose steeply and presently he came to the top of the ridge and passed through the deerfence into the old park here the trees planted by elizabeths colin on what was once bare down were of statelier growth and more widely spaced so that between their trunks broad stretches of the reclaimed marshland below could be seen and beyond the faint melted rim of the sea a warm spring air out of the southwest flowed up from the plain seasoned with saltness and he drew in long breaths of its refreshment ten minutes more brisk walking along the height brought him to the end of the ridge and below he saw the roof of stanier and its red walls smouldering in the clear dusk the thrill of home vibrated in him he could never look on stanier after an absence without a smile of pleasure and welcome on his lips there came into his mind vaguely and distantly the memory of someone looking at stanier with him and ironically saying to him be it ever so humble theres no place like home that had happened on the terrace one night in an afterdinner stroll and almost immediately he recalled the incident wondering at the tenacity of the memory it was pamela hunt who had said that when she came down here at her own suggestion for a domestic sunday in the country how infinitely remote and meaningless was the recollection of pamela he did not suppose he had thought of her halfadozen times in the last halfdozen years after all there was no reason why he should have thought of her for it must be close on twelve years since he had seen her yes when august came it would be twelve years since she had paid him that visit in capri that had been an affair of ludicrous tragedy long ago it had lost all personal connection with him and had become no more than a sensational episode which though no doubt it had happened to him might equally well have been something he had been told or something he had read in a book of short stories a book of sketches and episodes he sat down on a fallen treetrunkseveral of old colins oaks had blown down in the fierce gales of marchand as his eyes wandered over the wide plain and distant sea below his mind dwelt idly on that remote month in capri what had affected him far more intimately than pamelas death was the sequel that nino had refused to stay in his service nino had been utterly devoted to him but something strange had come over the fellow from the hour that he learned of pamelas melodramatic suicide he had simply frozen up his gaiety and devotion had been replaced by some sort of abject terror of colin he had become like one of those women on whom the frost and blight of stanier had fallen he started and stammered if he was spoken to he looked at him with eyes behind which lurked some deadly fear he had no answer to give when he was asked what ailed him he said nieute signor and quaked finally within a week he had said he could stop with him no longer colin had used his utmost persuasions but without avail and from persuasion he passed to warning and to threats reminding him that it did not go well with those who crossed him as nino had seen not so long ago but there was no keeping him and colin naturally resented ninos desertion for his companionship his gay paganism thoroughly suited him yet he seemed to himself to have done no more than let this resentment flow where it willed without conscious direction certainly he did not concentrate and aim it at nino he but shrugged his shoulders and said to himself well its ninos fault if anything happens and sure enough nino sickened of that illdefined fever which was rife in the island and in naples that summer and not long afterwards colin had to give his cook and his housemaid a halfdays holiday to attend his funeral it had served nino right thought colin for if he had remained up at the villa he would not have gone back to live in that insanitary hovel by the marina where the fever was so prevalent and he wondered whether in a sense it had served him right too for there was no denying that he had been really fond of him and that was an offence to his lord and benefactor today the memory of nino was far more vivid than that of pamela who was a tiresome woman greedy and graceless and often even now when he lazily awoke in the morning he found himself sleepily imagining that it was nino who was moving about the room it had been very stupid of him to behave like that colin had always been kind to him he need never have feared for himself it was ninos fear that had driven him into danger if he had only stopped where he was and remained gay and companionable he would have run no risks but his fright his mad attempt at escape had been his undoing he had run underneath the very wheels like a startled fowl on the highroad that month in fact had been full of incidents tragic for others but strangely prosperous for himself episodes had taken place then farreaching in consequence that fitted into each other with more than casual coincidence at stanier before he left for instance there had been the discovery and certain solution of that pencil plan in his ancestors diary followed when he got to capri by the finding of what beyond doubt was old colins book of wondrous blasphemies of which he had so easily possessed himself and the chain of odd occurrences had not been broken there for within a week of his having obtained that he saw for the first time hugh douglas now librarian at stanier the memory of that was very vivid and had none of the episodic insignificance of his recollections about pamela or indeed about nino he had gone down to the marina one evening to meet violet from whom he had received a telegram immediately after the catastrophe saying that she was starting at once for capri that had been both wise and kind of her she had not previously known that pamela was there and had seen one day in the daily press the notice of pamelas death when staying with lord yardley at his villa at capri with quite admirable wisdom she had thereupon sent notices to half a dozen papers that she was returning from capri in a fortnights time and had instantly started colin had no taste for the foolish scandal of wagging tongues and violets prompt action making it appear for the benefit of the world at large that she had been with him all the time was a most effectual silencer even those who knew that she had not been there when the catastrophe occurred would look on it with quite different eyes when they knew that she had gone there at once and colin had unreservedly applauded her intuition no doubt by now any scandal that might then have arisen would have been as episodic and obsolete as the cause of it but colin in this lazy retrospect of that marvellous month permitted himself to stand aside a moment and say well done violet he took up the thread of the far more significant happenings and let his mind dwell on each recalling details fingering them like a rosary he had gone down as he had recalled to meet her and waited on the quay for the disembarkation in small boats of the passengers from the steamer there she was and as she stepped out of the boat at the quay side he saw a young man put out to her an assisting hand she did not avail herself of it and colins eye met that of the man who would have helped her instantly he knew that the glance had some significance for him the face he saw was alert and cleanshaven and it had stamped on it that unmistakable quality of a priests face a quality impossible to define and impossible to miss he was not in clerical dress but that detracted nothing from the certainty if the man had worn spangles and pink tights he would have been a priest day by day as colin had seen him always alone at the caf or lounging in the piazza or at the bathingplace the conviction of his calling and of his significance whatever that should prove to be in his own life grew stronger he entered into casual conversation with him introducing himself and saw at once there was reserve and suspicion to be overcome but the young man gave him his name hugh douglas he was out for a holiday he said and expected to be here some weeks as they idly talked sitting at a caf in the street it so happened that a priest came by at the sight of him douglas rose to his feet and deliberately spat on the ground and in his eyes was a smoking blaze of hatred so you are a priest thought colin with no love for priesthood then colin asked him up to dine one evening after violets departure and set a wonderful example of frankness and unreserve he told him about the legend and saw his interest kindle he felt he was somehow on the right track though still he did not guess where it led but the old fellow was craven at the last he said and tried to escape from his lord and benefactor he abandoned the building of the shrine he had planned where beyond doubt he meant to celebrate some satanic rite he paused a moment with intention the other turned quickly to him that is most interesting lord yardley he said you have no notion i suppose of what he contemplated colin laughed indeed i have he said in fact there has lately come into my hands a book which beyond doubt was actually his for it bears his coronet and arms of the correct date and i feel sure he intended to use it in his chapel a missal in fact though following the english use he refers to it in his memoirs douglass face was alight with eagerness indeed he said have you it here i should enormously like to see it colin leaned forward to him across the table yes i have it here he said and perhaps ill show it you for i feel that im meant to show it you but first doesnt it strike you that im telling you a good deal and that youre telling me nothing instantly the man shrank back into himself there is nothing that could interest you he said i have no profession colin felt on absolutely sure ground yes youre a priest he said quietly i am nothing of the kind said douglas oh once a priest always a priest said colin no man nor any body of men can take from you the power that has been given you of doing the great miracle at the altar you were a priest mr douglas and you know that perfectly well im not the least inquisitive and i dont want to hear why you no longer wear priests dress unless you care to tell me you hate the priesthood now i saw that for myself the other day and perhaps you hate that which makes a priest a priest colin summoned all that gave him his charm and all that gave him his force arent you wrong not to trust me he said hasnt our meeting and what i hope will be our friendship been wonderfully contrived for us how can i make you trust me i am building i may tell you what my ancestor left undone at that he saw the mans soul leap in fire to his face and not only without shame but with pride as to one who would appreciate he told his story ever since he was a boy he had been conscious of his secret love of evil just for its own sake his own profanities horrified him and yet below his horror there was love under the whip of his horror he had striven to mortify that lust for evil within his soul and yet all the time that he tried to suppress it he looked on himself not as a sinner but as a martyr he had taken orders in the catholic church had joined an english community with vows of obedience and chastity and the joy of sins secret and abominable became all the sweeter because in the name of all that was holy he had renounced them he found himself like a spy in the camp of the enemy talking their language practising their manuvres and making war on the powers to which his hearts allegiance was given only a few weeks ago exposure had come and he left england for fear of a criminal prosecution all this came out in gasps and jerks of speech sometimes there was a pause and the pause would be succeeded by the pent exultant torrent of what had never been told yet at the end colin got up i see we shall be friends he said i will show you the book i spoke to you of all these things were welded together like links in a chain the discovery of the plan of the sanctuarium and then of the missal and then of the priest each linked on to the next indeed it would be an imbecile who saw in these events a mere grouping of fortuitous circumstances and there was more too a chiselling and chasing of these links decorative detail you might say nino in spite of persuasions and threats had gone so soon to sicken of the fever and colin had let it be known that he wanted a servant to take his place there were many applicants for it had been seen how nino just a barefooted boatmans son had become almost a signor himself with fine clothes to wear and money to spend and the friend and companion as much as the servant of the marvellous youth rich and noble and beautiful as a god for the sake of whom capri made no doubt the english lady had popped herself over the high cliff among them was a young neapolitan employed during the summer season as waiter at one of the hotels shrewd and monkeylike in face some incarnation of pure animalism hugh douglas was with colin when he came up to be interviewed and the boy made his obeisance as to a priest why do you do that asked colin why do you behave as if this gentleman was a priest the fellow looked at him once more and smiled when he smiled his ears moved and colin noticed how pointed they were but i am not wrong am i he said when i was a boy i was an acolyte douglas rose ill leave you he said and he nodded at colin as he went out the boy had spoken in perfect english and when the door had closed colin came up to him put his hands on his shoulders and smiled into his eyes what he was going to say was derived from no process of reasoning in his own mind scarcely even from observation let me see your names vincenzo isnt it he said well vincenzo i like your face its the face of a devil did noone ever tell you that you must have been a queer sort of acolyte did they choose you for your sanctified face and when you crossed yourself did you cross yourself like this colin made the sign backwards like that was it he said i have never been to a mass where they did like that i should like to see you serve mass for i shall have a chapel at my house in england and maybe i shall wish you to serve again and you were right about that gentleman he is a priest so go to him now and tell him i have sent you to say you will serve him how vivid it all was to him still and most vivid of all that which took place that very evening he had been hitherto like someone receiving instruction merely now he was received into the church of his religion the room where pamela had slept and to which her body had been brought was decked as a chapel and in symbols and desecrated rites he set the seal on his faith he had bought not long before in naples a cope of fifteenth century needlework in which the celebrant was vested and douglas read from the missal of wondrous blasphemies he threw his cope wide when vincenzo censed him as the supreme moment approached some ecstasy stirred in the very centre and shrine of colins being and from there spread to his mind and his physical frame would god permit the approaching defiance and blasphemy he did not doubt that he could by some swift judgment assert the infinity and the omnipotence of love and it was just that belief which spiced the defiance or was love itself powerless against this supreme act of hate and mockery colin rose from his seat on the fallen oak and began the descent of the long smooth slope towards the house never before that evening at capri or ever since had he attained to so clear a realization of the spirit of evil his initiation had also contained the ultimate revelation often in the years that followed he had here at stanier attended the black mass but his allegiance once definitely and symbolically made the repetition of it had progressively failed in fervour it was not so with those whose souls worshipped love the more they mystically joined themselves in acts of faith and worship to their lord the more closely if you judged from the chronicles of the saints were they knit to him had love then some quality which hate lacked hate had often seemed to him as infinite as love but now he wondered if you could attain to the absolute in hate to the realization of pitch darkness than which nothing could be darker whereas you could never attain to absolute light for some fresh sun from all the millions which love lit and moved would add its spark to the illumination or was there on the other hand no such thing as absolute darkness of the spirit just as scientists assured you that there was no such thing as absolute physical darkness did some ray always penetrate it was there no place utterly devoid of god in either case you arrived at the utmost possible in hate and could go no further colin let the question go unanswered the abstract never much concerned him compared with the concrete and the practical how purely episodic his life had been and how full of prosperous conclusions episodes of his boyhood episodes in capri episodes here and in london strung like beads on the thread of his own personality but each distinct from the other accounted for the whole of it he desired nothing for long he got it whatever it was so quickly sucked it dry and threw the rind away all that wealth and position could bring him all that health could bestow were his no desire of his went unfulfilled all he had to do was to find something he wanted and if it was the gift of his lord and benefactorand wide was his bountyit was his as soon as he cared to put out a firm hand to take it and yet in spite of this perfect freedom which he had used to the uttermost to do exactly what his desire or fancy prompted to eat any fruit on the tree of evil without fear of scruples interfering like a seed or a stone with its lusciousness he knew that this liberty was somehow built on the foundation of a slavery which enchained him he was in pawn and in bondage to evil and these episodes were links of his fetters as fast as one was hammered and welded there would be another one an appetite gratified or perhaps an account revengefully squared as in the case of raymond his brother and of pamela often as in the case of raymond the catastrophe fell without his active intervention at all it just followed on his wish or again the victim might bring it on himself as that wretched nino had done episodes just episodes to find things to wish for to find experiences and expressions that excited and absorbed him he had already begun to recognize that this was not so easy as it had been life was full of amusements his vigour now that he was in his thirtyfifth year still retained all the elasticity of youth but it was hard to find for it experiences that were not staled by custom he had to find those it appeared for himself his lord and benefactor did no more as if that was not enough than give him what he wanted well there were a dozen people coming tomorrow and for the easter vacation the house would be crammed from cellar to garret with a huge party and diversions would spring up like mushrooms and then he remembered that dennis was at home for his holidays now his fourteenth in year and at school at eton colin had come to the east end of the building which he had erected in execution of the plan he had found in his ancestors memoirs he had stopped long in capri the year that was built and when he came back the fabric was complete before he left he had shewn the plan to violet telling her that this was an addition to the house planned in elizabethan times and never executed there was a little apartment he said for a priest and a sanctuary adjoining it was this which was now to be built a sanctuary she had said yes darling a little chapel old colin was a very fervent sort of man it was for his private devotions no doubt that he planned it he thought she had understood and this impression had been born out by the fact that never had she alluded to the little chapel again she knew that it was approached by a corridor from his room she knew that this librarian mr douglas whom he had brought back with him from capri lived in the apartment there but she had never asked colin anything about it nor had he volunteered any information but that she guessed the general purpose of it he had no doubt old colins private devotions was sufficiently explicit and she had understood violet takes no interest in what means so much to me he thought now shall i try to make her a little more sympathetic she had had a very easy time lately with him away so much and perhaps it would be a good thing to wake her up to her wifehood as he passed he saw that the chapel was lit within the east window was of plain rubycoloured glass frosted on the outside so that none could see in and he lingered there a moment and thought he caught the sound of a voice within douglas his chaplain and librarian was there and perhaps vincenzo who had driven down from london with his master was there also in his more ecclesiastical capacity the shrewd monkeyfaced boy of twelve years ago had grown into a darkfaced silent man wonderfully efficient as a servant but as a server colin had never seen anything so like possession the apelike gestures twitching and vehement the rapt surrender the tearing animal passion of devotion and when the rite was over he lay sometimes on the altar step panting with gleaming eyes of a surfeited ecstasy then the mask of humanity covered him again and he became the impassive watchful valet anticipating colins wants almost before he was conscious of them himself but these seizures for they were really nothing less than that were terrible colin wondered sometimes if he himself would ever know such physical frenzy such mingling apparently of torture and exaltation he passed on round the corner of the yewhedge he was late for whatever was going on and indeed he had no particular mind to be present but he felt as if some force like that of a great engine that beat in pulsations momently increasing in power was at work there then the bell in the turret sounded three strokes and in the pause that followed before those strokes were repeated he felt himself thrilled and charged with the mysterious dynamic energy that spread through the still air in invisible waves of inspiration and into his mind there came the vision of himself kneeling there at some such moment as this with dennis by him that of course would not be yet the boy was at present far too young to understand even the nature of the moral choice on which the rites were based not yet did he know the force of love and hate he only liked and disliked he had to feel the power of love before he could loathe it or comprehend the infinite seduction of evil the essential qualities of love had to be apprehended before they could be rejected and mocked at he must know them first he must know too what hate meant before he could realize the presence of its inspirer that and the things which some day dennis would see with his father in the chapel there would be inexplicable and indeed meaningless to him until in his blood there was developed the perception that gave them life certain of these rites would seem to him merely grotesque or disgusting till he was hot with the passions of which they were a symbol he would be puzzled he might even be amused at these grimaces and contortions of vincenzo he would want explanations and even then would not understand all this was not so much a train of thought in colins mind as a flash of perception that vibrated through it at the sound of the bell in the turret of the chapel and dismissing principles he let himself into the door on the garden front that opened into the long gallery principles would take care of themselves provided your practice was in accordance with them and with the thrill of homecoming to this beloved stanier he stepped out of the glimmering dusk into the lit house he got one comprehensive glance at the two who were there before his entrance was perceived violet was sitting in a low chair by the fireplace at the far end of the gallery her face all alight with love and on the floor full length in front of the fire was dennis lying his head was bent back and he looked up into his mothers face as he told her something in his boyish voice high treble one moment and suddenly cracking into a mans tones whatever it was that he said it made her suddenly burst into laughter and she threw herself back in her chair oh dennis how wicked of you she said go on darling what did the master do colin stood very still was it really violet who could laugh like that with that pure abandonment to amusement was it she who shone with that serene and radiant love she sat up again after that burst of laughter and saw him in an instant her face changed to the face he knew it changed from the face of a mother girlish still though that big boy sprawled there to the frozen beauty which she presented to the world no faintest glint of laughter lingered on her mouth or in her eyes and yet amazingly they were still alight with love something that had beamed there for dennis still beamed there for him though it was shrouded like a gleam of fire through smoke by the blight and the frost ah colin she said there you are get up dennis heres your father for a moment sharp as a stabbed nerve and coming from some icebound cave of consciousness a pang of regret shot through colin that it was not in his nature nor in theirs that he could join the group of mother and son and partake of their mood their laughter and their ease and all that it implied they looked so jolly and his hunger for pleasure always envied those who were enjoying themselves for all enjoyment ought to belong to him but the instantaneousness with which violets carefree laughter had withered from her face shewed that she instinctively recognized the inconceivableness of that it was not to be wondered at after all she always froze in his presence and then he looked at the boy who had jumped to his feet and pride at having begotten anyone so beautiful supplanted for the moment every other consideration he was very tall for his age already his head was nearly on a level with his mothers and bred as he was on both sides from stanier blood he seemed the very flower of his race looselimbed and lithe he stood there with shoulders low and broad and neck rising square from them and there was the small head yellowhaired and blueeyed the straight short nose and the mouth as perfect as violets own colin had not seen him since the christmas holidays in the interval he had greatly grown and his boyhood had emerged from the sheath of its childish sexlessness now the father saw in his son his own magnificent youth carried to a stage finer yet physical perfection could go no further and on the heels of that exultant pride in his sons beauty there came the vision again of going with dennis up the corridor from his room and into the chapel what a peerless offering to bring his lord and benefactor the boy had always been much fonder of his mother than of him and here at once was a thing to be taken in hand dennis must learn to be at ease with him to open his heart to him and eagerly to receive what was good for him to learn that was the first requisite hitherto dennis had been rather shy with him and apt to be on his good behaviour he must be charmed out of that and learn to be comfortable with him and lie on the floor and tell him stories about school he put his arm round denniss neck and kissed him why you dear boy he said this is nice dennis youve grown in a perfectly indecent manner stand up there with your back to your mother suddenly he remembered that he had not yet said a word to violet violet had denniss heart at present therefore dennis must see how dear she was to his father for that would predispose him favourably violet darling he said kissing her how are you i neednt ask though youre always well thank god and such shrieks of laughter as i heard when i came in what was it all about dennis i believe youve been telling your mother something quite unfit for a parents ears so you must tell me too and let me judge my word it is nice to be home again have you had tea colin she asked now have i or have i not i dont believe i have but i dont want any i shall sit on the floor if dennis can make room for me lie down again dennis exactly as you were before and well all be fearfully comfortable now whats the story oh its only a rotten yarn father he said the master im up to doesnt like mice soso someone bought a clockwork mouse and wound it up and set it running in small circlesyou know how they gojust under his chair you never saw anything so funny he thought it was real till he heard it buzz dennis had sat down again on the floor colin with a shout of laughter put his fingers in the back of his collar and pulled him down across his knees i think ive got hold of that someone by the short hairs he said what brutes you boys are what shall we do with this brute how long are the holidays dennis three weeks and a bit and where do you want to spend them oh here of course youre just like me i never want to go away from here unless its to capri now lets talk in a whisper so that your mother cant hear she doesnt like capri dennis shes not been there for twelve years that summer dont you remember when you were one year old of course i dont remember said dennis thats because you didnt attend you must be more attentive next time youre one year old but there it is shell never come with mewere still talking in a whisperso next summer if youll promise not to put mice in my bed perhaps ill take you oh i say how ripping said dennis you bathe all day mr douglas told me except when youre basking in the sun how is mr douglas by the way i havent seen him may i ask him to dine tonight vi i know you dont like him darling but he has a pretty lonely time when were away i think we ought to have him in as often as we can when were here he shall sit next granny he shant sit by you and how is granny dennis was finding a father that he had never known before and he felt himself expanding to him colin had released his hand from the boys collar but denniss head still lay contentedly on his knees grannys dotty i think he observed i mean your granny father dennis dear said violet she turned to colin grannys been expecting you all day she said she always knows when youre coming she was out on the terrace this afternoon in her bathchair and when she saw dennis she thought it was you yes mother thats what i mean by dotty it is dotty said dennis colin tucked his hand under the boys head you shouldnt call your aged relatives dotty dennis he said your mothers quite right when im as old as your greatgrandmamma which will be in a week or two for time goes so fast i shall be exceedingly vexed with you if you say im dotty so there old boy she probably thought you were dotty when you told her you werent me and then she thought i was uncle raymond continued dennis that just shews it just shews that youre an ugly little devil observed colin when you come down to dinner tonight but i dont said dennis i have supper upstairs well i ask you to come and have dinner with me tonight dont drink too much port like your grandfathers and greatgrandfathers what was i going to say oh i know nip round like a good boy to mr douglass rooms and ask him to come to dinner tonight say its to have the honour of meeting you hes probably in the library isnt he asked dennis no hes probably not and then come back here and ill have a game of billiards with you colin waited till dennis had gone then turned to violet how the boy is growing up he said was i as big as that at fourteen darling hes a splendid fellow we ought to congratulate ourselves hell develop swiftly now how interesting to watch that eh dear violet and to train and influence him youve kept him all to yourself hitherto its time that a fathers care she had long feared this moment and now that it had come it roused in her not her womanly motherhood alone but something of the tigressmotherhood that will fight for its young with any who threatens them even if he is her own mate but it was the woman who spoke first oh colin leave me dennis she said he laughed how funnily you said that he remarked you speak as if i were meaning to take him away from you you speak as if he was a piece of private property of yours maynt a father take an interest in his own son and as i say hes growing up he knows nothing of his inheritance at present or of his family history he must learn yes yes he must learn colin shifted his position and leaned his back against the chair in which violet was sitting i feel awfully remiss he said i feel as if i had neglected dennis shamefully but surely hes grown suddenly not in inches only but in sex and temperament i seemed to feel that hes entrancing my heart goes out to him but he must be moulded and educated mustnt he what a wonderful fruit of our love vi what joy for us to see it ripen and physically what a young apollo you and i were rather a pretty pair at his age but dennis beats us hollow he leaned his head back to see violets face well he knew what he would find there for he had felt his words go home but he was not prepared for the fierceness of it you shant have him she said and you know what i mean when i say that hes a manly sweethearted boy oh as naughty as you please but hes a good boy thats the part you shall never have she got up stepping sideways away from him colin weve been strangers for many years now she said youve frozen me with horror at what you are but youve never frozen my power of love its there and its always melting the ice and by that i know that you wont get dennis for its stronger than you colin raised his eyebrows well then theres no more to be said about it he remarked i hate arguing anyhow if one wants to prove a thing the simplest plan is to go and do it and then it proves itself without any palaver ah there was something else i wanted to talk to you about but heres dennis back again well dennis will mr douglas have the honour of meeting you dennis was looking excited oh yes thats all right he said and vincenzo was there he was lying on mr douglass sofa lookinglooking like nothing at all looking awfully queer but mr douglas said he would be all right soon i expect he knows said colin vincenzos devoted to mr douglas dennis ive been catching it hot since you left me your mothers been scolding me whose side do you take hers or mine dennis looked from one to the other but he moved towards violet i dont know he said but arent we going to have a game of billiards the dowagers wing at stanier of which colin had made so summary a clearance twelve years before had never become repopulated again aunt hester was still alive very much alive indeed but never since the morning when she had interfered about pamela had she set foot in stanier colin behaved like a devil to me my dear she had said to violet of that occasion he meant to turn me out and made that his excuse well you dont catch me going where im not wanted i hope ive got too much spirit for that violet however often took dennis to see her when they were in town and he had lunched with her and been handsomely tipped by her today on his way from eton aunt hester adored dennis she saw in him the colin she had loved and dennis for his part thought her one of the most enterprizing old ladies he had ever come across why she did not come to see them at stanier he did not know and she was remarkably brisk at changing the subject when it came up but he meant to ask his father about it of the others ronald stanier and his wife though deprived of their permanent domicile had been occasional guests here till when a year or two ago on one of their visits he had had a stroke one night as he sat over his wine after dinner quite in the traditional stanier style and had gone down with the decanter flying his widow strongly reacting had gone to live at winchester where she drove out daily in a brougham gave small sad little dinnerparties from which everyone went away at halfpast ten and was similarly entertained by her elderly guests once or twice a year she came to stanier for a few nights and played patience and put some flowers on her husbands grave but she had no real existence stanier as it had so often done to those who married into the house had frozen her or perhaps rather burned up all such inflammable material as she had once possessed and she lay now so to speak in the fender clinking a little from time to time as she cooled and disintegrating into ash but the fourth occupant of the dowagers wing was still there and still every night old lady yardley was wheeled down to the long gallery five minutes before dinnertime and sat by the fireplace near the diningroom till the others had assembled and then with the aid of her two sticks went in to dinner and afterwards played her phantom game of whist she was now over ninety years of age she ate and she slept she had her sight and her hearing but she lived in some withdrawn twilight peopled it would seem by shadowy figures of her century of memories certain rays could still illuminate that crepuscular kingdom colins presence was a sure lamp there and dennis was beginning to be another perhaps from his likeness to colin twenty years ago perhaps because she realized that in him lay the perpetuation of the house for the dim archives of her mind contained only the records that concerned stanier strangely enough hugh douglas was the third who could lighten that black darkness probably she did not know his name and he belonged to the later years of which she had normally no memory but it was clear that she regarded him as somehow significant and often if he dined with them she would sit looking at him with that unwinking gaze that saw noone knew what and begin speaking of days of fifty and sixty and seventy years ago others her nurses for instance and violet made no reaction on her mind she was no more directly conscious of them than she was of the chair where she sat or the carpet she walked on and they cast no shining glimmer on the memories that reached back and back to years when not only were none of those present born but not even her own children of the generation before colins father and violets and aunt hester and when she herself was newly come as a bride to stanier physically by some miracle of vitality she was upright still and her skin instead of hanging in parchmentlike laps and folds over her face was one with it she looked as if she was made of bloodless imperishable alabaster when she sat motionless and without speech she seemed scarcely alive and then her wrinkled eyelids would lift and she spoke in that quiet uninflected voice of those who had been dead sixty years and more as if they were still here to her they probably were colin felt a sort of fascinated pride in hershes clearly immortal he said in fact shes a sort of totemisnt that what they call ita tribal god she belongs to myth and legend especially legend i wonder if she signed a bond too tonight she was in her place when violet came in as usual she took no notice of her and violet sat down with the evening paper and did not see douglass entrance till suddenly old lady yardley began to talk my grandson colin came home from school today she said he has grown violet looked up ah good evening mr douglas she said colin and dennis have been playing billiards but theyll be here in a moment you saw dennis i think douglas shook hands with her more markedly than ever was his face that of a priest he knew very well that violet disliked him dislike perhaps was too superficial a word he had seen just that same horror in her eyes when she looked at her husband he wondered sometimes what she knew yes dennis came up to my flat he said how he has grown developed too i thought as well dennis and colin came in together denniss fault that were late he said he took so long to beat his poor old father well granny how are you i believe you grow younger every day dennis and i are going to take you in to dinner one on each side she got out of her chair and stood erect ah i knew colin was coming she said i told them colin was coming now all will be well at stanier she pointed at douglas i want him she said he must sit by me because he and colin know and i know those who know must sit close and talk in whispers colin laughed so we will granny he said dennis dear you take in your mother grannys got no use for you dennis put violets arm within his own lord what pomp he said shall i always come down to dinner now mother oh and i beat father at billiards well dont trample on me now im down said colin youve no feeling of chivalry for the aged dennis old lady yardley looked from one to the other they dined at a small round table colin and douglas were on each side of her dennis and violet between them her eyes travelled past violet as if there was no one there but at dennis she looked long tonight the stimulus of these three was strong and she began to say things she had never said before the boy there she said thats my colin before he grew to be a man hes come back to us as a boy he doesnt know the legend yet oh but i do granny said dennis it was when the devil no dear you dont know it yet said she youve only heard it thats a very different thing my son philip never knew he only heard colin intervened now granny eat your soup he said or we shall never get through dinner tell us about it afterwards he looked up at dennis just one passing glance and saw that the boys attention was violently arrested and does mr douglas know asked dennis is that what you wanted to whisper about father what is it that you know and ive only heard it was odd how the atmosphere was suddenly charged with impalpable tension lady yardley alone whatever she said could not have produced it it required dennis and his innocent boyish inquisitiveness at the other end violet interrupted dennis mustnt ask dennis mustnt know dennis dear you saw aunt hester today didnt you she said didnt she send any message to me denniss whole mind was fixed on this other puzzling matter but at his mothers voice he seemed to detach himself yes her love he said and im going to write to her tomorrowsos father two letters and a motors going up to london to take them to her and itll bring her down here we think colin turned to violet darling youll be nice to her wont you he said its so long ago all that misunderstanding and she loves stanier i was going to tell you of course violet felt there was no need for explanation she knew colin he had represented to dennis evidently that aunt hester never came to stanier because of some bygone quarrel between herself and her dennis had asked why she never cameit must be like thatand that had been the answer then colin had concocted just such a plot as a boy loves to ask her in spite of it and bring mother and her together colin was the peacemaker she was the person to be propitiated the wonderful falsity of it all there was nothing too small nor too great for colin in the accomplishment of his ends here there was no question of what his ends were they were the wooing of dennis by him the detachment of dennis from herself she could not sit down under this but it was you who turned her out colin she said you quarrelled with her you sent her away what have you been telling dennis colin was seated next her he laid his hand on hers darling before the servants he said gently besides its all over years ago old lady yardley was looking fixedly at dennis again hes growing up she said soon he must make his choice staniers will never fail as long as they choose wisely and well i am an autumn leaf now on the old tree but the sap hasnt left me yet and though the leaves fall fresh leaves come this is a beautiful young leaf it is springtime with the tree again and the birds are singing in its branches it will always be spring at stanier if they take care of the young leaves colin turned from violet to her granny dear the spirit of prophecy is upon you but you really mustnt prophesy at dinner everyone finds it so disconcerting darling now there are some friends of mine coming tomorrow and you must promise me not to prophesy at dinner otherwise you shall have dinner upstairs and no whist at all for once she paid no attention to him i watched them building twelve years ago she said they made a chapel for the prosperity of stanier aha that makes the legend thrive colin saw denniss wideeyed gaze fascinated and puzzled he had settled that he did not want the boy to know anything about that at present and yet surely you sowed in winter the seed that did not germinate till the spring how marvellously dramatic too that dennis still hardly free from the soft enveloping sheath of childhood should learn the beginning of wisdom from this aged sibyl it was like taking a child to learn about druids from stonehenge but dennis was too young yet it would never do to initiate him into the final revelation till he had learned the rudiments and the alphabet of the creed simultaneously violet spoke to him oh colin stop her she whispered she mustnt go on she mustnt tell him about the chapel so violet knew he always guessed she had known he turned to old lady yardley again granny youre being very naughty he said i promise you you shant come down to dinner again unless youre quiet i wont have it do you understand now go away with violet if you say a word more you shant have any whist at all take her away violet violet got up come along granny she said and you too dennis nothing of the sort said colin sharply dennis is going to stay with us he waited till violet and the old lady had gone dennis old boy he said you were quite right when you said your greatgrandmother was dotty she was talking gibberish there wasnt a word of sense in what she was saying dennis looked unconvinced but she must have meant something father he said did she mean the chapel by mr douglass rooms colin was always swift in invention very likely but you know all about that i built it as ive told you before to complete the original plan of the house very likely old colin intended to be buried there memorial chapel you know just think of the old lady as dotty shes got the legend on her mind she always had why i really believe that if satan came to her now and said sign please as they do in shops shed find one drop of blood in her body still and use it up give mr douglas some port and take half a glass yourself not more dennis we cant have you like your grandfather ronald before you grow up dennis gave that delicious halftreble croak of laughter good lord i shouldnt like to be like grandfather ronald he said he was a rum un father did he know about the legend in the way granny meant no dennis i should say he didnt but weve finished with the legend for tonight someday ill tell you more about it hurrah when when i think that you will be able to understand it mr douglas and i will set you an examination paper oh not in the holidays said the boy you wont know its being set you said his father thats an improvement on the eton plan remarked dennis dennis was sent up to bed when old lady yardley had had her two rubbers of whist and presently mr douglas went too and now were alone vi said colin and i havent seen you for a month maynt we have a little talk in fact ive got several things to say about aunt hester now yes i think you owe me an explanation of that said she darling dont talk about owing explanations in that way you speak as if i had run up a bill with you and wouldnt pay it probably thats just what you do think colin moved across to the fire where the traditional log smouldered i hate explaining he said and really you can understand for yourself but if you insist on it its this dennis asked me pointblank why aunt hester never came to stanier well i couldnt tell him about her impertinence with regard to poor pamela her imagining that i had an intrigue with her good lord didnt the sequel exculpate me an edifying incident wasnt it you know what i think about that said she yes i remember your saying you wished i was in love with pamela and i kept telling pamela that i was in love with you but she rushed on disaster oddi was thinking only this afternoon how long it was since i had given a thought to pamela and now she comes up in connection with aunt hester well i couldnt tell dennis about that you would have been very much shocked with me if i had i couldnt tell him that the woman was in love with me and his mother wished i was in love with her such a dreadful thing to tell a young boy at the most impressionable age you agree you distort it all she said but i agree oh distortion he said everyone elses point of view is distorted when viewed from ones own we all have our own individual perspective which shews everybody elses out of drawing but as you agree i had to give some other reason i gave one that naturally occurred to me namely that you resented and found unforgivable something poor aunt hester had done i was pleased when i thought of that you always think of everything she said yes darling i am pretty thorough and you see why i was pleased dont you perfectly well you wanted to give dennis a new impression of me as being hard and unforgiving and of yourself as kind colin softly clapped his hands ah i knew you really understood he said i knew you didnt need any explanations but why not have said so at first you shewed you knew at dinner she moved the screen that stood by her that might have been to shut out of her eyes the flame that had broken out from the smouldering log or it might have been to shut out his face i didnt mean that when i asked for explanations she said the explanation i wanted if there was one was any justification for what you did colin stretched out his hand to the blaze the shapely smooth fingers looked redly luminous as the fire shone through them the justification is that it was part of my policy he said dennis is devoted to you at present i must detach him he must be devoted to me he must love what i love and hate what i hate no man can serve two masters she slid from her chair on to her knees holding up her hands to him the face of the future now that it was coming close was terrible ah colin no no she cried your souls your own and youve chosen for yourself but denniss soul is his his and gods you darent tamper with it colin laughed oh but youre inconsistent he said youve told me that love is stronger than me and that im powerless now you seem to be afraid that there is something pretty powerful to back me have faith darling she had no personal fear of him now that dennis was in question the instinct of protection swallowed it up i know youve got something powerful to back you she said youve got the power of hell to back you no one who believes in god dares despise that he hates and fears it colin drove the poker into the blazing log and a squib of sparks shot up his face in that brightness seemed to shine from some inward illumination very wise he said now another thing its clear to me that you know about the sanctuary clever of you darling because ive only once mentioned it to you when i settled to build it telling you old colin had planned it for his private devotions did you guess then i wonder did you imagine for what purpose he had planned it and for what purpose i carried out his plans it wasnt a guess she said i knew in whose honour must he have planned it and in whose honour must you have executed it thats logical certainly he said but how about grandmamma i never said a word to her and i dont suppose you have but yet she knows has she got some sort of second sight do you imagine is she a sort of incarnated genius of stanier so that by instinct she knows all that concerns the welfare of the house sometimes i scarcely believe that shes human at all will she go on living for hundreds of years a sort of priestess my word were an amazing institution you know colin turned round away from the fire and yet it seemed to her that his face glowed i wish my family were more with me in my convictions he said dennis doesnt know and you dont sympathize supposing dennis was to die before he had come to the full knowledge once he had chosen he would be protected violet felt her mouth go dry colin youre not meaning to take dennis there are you she whispered aha now we come to the root of it he said of course i mean to take dennis there as soon as hes learnt well the rudiments of the faith i see hes not fit for it yet but he soon will be hes got high spirits and the lust of life is beginning to bubble in him that just has to be directed then the moment he is ripe and a boy like that ripens quickly violets face whitened and hardened you darent she said that would be the sin for which theres no pardon dont you understand marvellously colins eyes glittered it was as if they were faceted and caught a hundred points of light and dont you understand he said that thats the very reason for my doing it i pine for unpardonable sin from outside there came the sudden stir of wind it rattled at the window and then blew with a great gust he paused holding up his hand and listening and within him swift as inspiration the fire kindled just so it used to blow in the stonepine in the garden at capri he said it was there i heard it first thats no common wind violet its a message its a herald the power is abroad and i hail it listen isnt that even to your ears something more than the common wind you know it is fear it and loathe it or worship it and adore it but dont deny it ah the thrill of it the splendid pentecost never had she seen him like this and whether it was that his exaltation communicated itself to her or whether there was something present there inherent in that sonorous sudden gale she felt her very spirit shudder and flicker like the blown flame of a candle he sprang to his feet and took hold of her arm come with me now to the chapel he said well get father douglas yes of course you know hes father douglas join with me violet throw scruple and struggle away who has the best time after all you with your agonizings and fears or i who dont know what pain of soul or body means whose every whim is gratified come and see see if i havent chosen well see if you dont exult and glory in the power that i serve and that serves me a midnight mass youll see me as an acolytei make a damned handsome oneand the book father douglas will use is the very book the missal of wondrous blasphemies that old colin speaks of in his memoirs ive got tepid about worship but with you there it will be new again to me its in your blood youre a stanier just as i am it will boil up in your blood she stood quite still letting his hand still rest on her arm but sundering from herself the distraction of all the flood of desires and yearnings of fears and of terrors that had been streaming from her she did not articulately pray she did not implore and agonize for protection she simply spread out her soul with an act of unreserved surrender to the spirit of god and in this turmoil within and without let the peace that passed understanding seek her of its own accord and encompassingly hold her her only effort was to make no effort to make herself utterly helpless the timeless moment passed and she knew that the stress of some spiritual crisis was over the wind outside which seemed to have been raging round the very fortress of her soul died down and ceased colin spoke again but the ecstasy of direct inspiration had died out of his voice for a little while he had been like one possessed now he was himself again terrible indeed but not terror itself satanic but not satan violet if you dont come he said i shall go and get dennis i said i would go up and say good night to him and he shall dress and come with me to the chapel rather like abraham taking isaac to sacrifice him rather biblical its you or he i mean precisely what i say he will obey me violets choice made itself without any question but it was made under the compulsion of love and under loves protection then of course i will come she said youve given me my choice and there it is but you wont like it if i come colin i should only despise and scoff at what you believe in and the power on which you lean is failing and you know it wheres the ecstasy that filled you just now it has all evaporated it has leaked away rage and rebel as he might he knew the truth of what she said reading it in her quiet eyes and her pitiful mouth definitely and for the first time to his full consciousness he had failed something stronger than the wind of the powers of the air had interposed between him and its inspiration he looked at her with quiet hellish eyes i think you will be sorry for this vi he said some inner plane on which this scene had been transacted seemed to her to slide away again she had been on it it had sustained her now she was back again on normal levels conscious only of a supreme fatigue but the memory of that uplifting still held her one power had englobed her another him and somehow inscrutably the two had come into direct contact and at the touch his had been shattered like a film of glass i do not think so she said i think i shall be glad of it thankful for it as long as i live he turned on her but his eyes were no longer bright with that quality with which he had heard the wind rise and roar do you suppose youve beaten me he said are you really such a fool as that she moved a step nearer to him and pointed to the curtained door out on to the terrace colin she said do you remember coming in at that door this evening and finding dennis and me talking by the fire you were jealous of him then and jealous of me because you knew why we were so happy together you wanted in spite of yourself to have a share in it chapter ii denniss holidays sped in an orgie of delightful amusements there was the splendour of having a gun of his own and being allowed to go out with the keepers and his father to blaze at rabbits and the pigeons among the trees in the old park there was the splendour of a motorbicycle given him by his father and that of dining downstairs every night but among all these experiences there was none so enchanting as his fathers companionship colin had suffered a defeat he knew it and he understood why and learned a larger wisdom from it he had been altogether too abrupt excited and possessed himself he had expected violet to leap at once in surrender and panic over that huge gulf that separated them when he asked her to come to the chapel with him he should have known better he told himself it was demanding the impossible the effect had been that in her vital recoil she had accomplished a supreme feat in the completion of her selfabandonment to the power of love she had made no reservation she had cast herself on the spread arms of its sustaining force it was quite consistent too that the moment afterwards when he had told her that if she refused to come he would take dennis with him she had said she would come love still upheld her and chose for her and its force he knew had drained him of his so that he no longer cared at that moment whether she came or not or whether it was worth while even to fetch dennis he could have done that but it would have been a mere repetition of his original mistake dennis would no more leap to the sacrament of evil than violet the worship of evil demanded a dedication of the soul dennis must be wooed like some shy maiden his boyish heart was affianced to his mother and its clinging tentacles vigorous as young shoots of ivy must be ever so gently detached so that the boy would scarcely know that any detachment was going on and laid full of the sap of spring round his fathers encircling arm until that was done dennis would turn but a puzzled and incurious ear to anything of ultimate significance colin must abound in wholesome schoolboy topics and interests until the ivy clung close to him and leaned on him for the support of its growth then but not till then could the education and enlistment of his instincts begin it would be rather a bore colin thought he would have to play golf with him and go out to shoot the silly pigeons and take him up to london perhaps to see the publicschools competition in racquets dennis evidently adored one of the boys who was playing for eton his senior by some four years colin wondered what sort of a fellow he was a dozen guests or so came down next afternoon to spend a week and before that week was over their numbers were redoubled they settled on stanier like a flock of gay and chattering birds they were at liberty all day to amuse themselves as they liked tennis and fishing and golf were diversions enough for them all violet admirable hostess as she was saw that they were occupied and devoted herself to the dowagery element among them which liked motoring to points of interest or going to see friends in countryhouses in the neighbourhood there was breakfast and lunch at elastic hours and no full or formal assembly met until dinnertime then there was the immemorial ritual of the house reassembling itself old lady yardley in alabaster silence and immobility was the first to arrive in the long gallery and the guests collected and when all were there the majordomo opened the door into colins room and he joined them just that one oldfashioned pompous moment was preserved it was the stanier use like grace before meat as he entered everyone stood up it was only colin of course who next moment would be chattering like the rest of them or shouting with laughter but just then he was lord yardley but most of the day colin would have had dennis with him and often the boy dressed early and spent this last halfhour before dinner with his father very likely the two would be playing some game together when the summons of the opening door came but on the moment colin would jump up leaving whatever fascinating pursuit was in progress and become somebody quite different now behave yourself dennis just for a minute he would say well go back to our game afterwards if we can my move that was part of denniss education just for that minute it was a solemn business to be lord yardley the master of this magnificent inheritance with its regal splendours there was no other house in england like it nor had there been for three centuries past and it was his fathers now and would one day be his and plenteousness would be in its palaces so long as he into whose hands it was given remembered to whom he owed it and rendered affiance and allegiance so grace was said and the diversions of the evening began dennis must not be pompous but at the back of his mind the knowledge of his potential magnificence must consolidate itself at dinner there was a place for him by his father for that was colins order and dennis could see the charm that had been poured out on him in their employments together during the day now weave itself for these dazzling ladies his mother he knew had not wanted him to come down to dinner when the house was full but colin had begged her so it conveyed itself to his mind to allow him and dennis secretly felt it to have been rather unkind of her to have tried to make him miss these wonderful hours of course there was a threat veiled and not understood by him behind this begging something about dennis having nothing to do while they were in at dinner except say his prayers with mr douglas and go to bed dennis had not understood that for he never said his prayers with mr douglas but his mother consented to his coming down after that it was immensely amusing at dinner there was his father to begin with whose gaiety was irresistible dennis had not known how fascinating he could be over nothing at all whether he asked a silly riddle or told an absurd story or just joined in the general chatter he cast the magic of mirth over everyone and all the time old lady yardley silent and aware would be watching him perhaps her neighbours would attempt conversation with her but they were swiftly defeated her business was to look at colin now and then he caught her eye and shouted something encouraging to her and he would say to her neighbour darling old granny i hope she isnt a nuisance but she would break her heart if she didnt come down to dinner look were four generations she and aunt hester and violet and i and dennis after dinner there were all sorts of amusements one night there was nothing but cards with bridgetables for those who cared about those sedate joys and old lady yardleys whisttable in the corner by the fire which was its immemorial situation violet mr douglas and aunt hester were immolated there and for the rest there was a delightful round game called poker once again his mother had suggested bedtime for dennis but again had colin begged for him give him half an hour darling he had said hell get bored with it and wont touch a card for the rest of his life nothing like early associations dennis your mother says you may sit up for half an hour so you and i will be partners and you shall have a small salary as long as i win but if you lose father suggested the cautious dennis then i shall sell your new dressclothes which i havent pinched you for yet and buy a hurdygurdy and collect coppers in st jamess square till a copper collects me for obstructing your mothers motorcar on the way to church you shall be the monkey on the top of it and go to prison with me rather i say will you tell me how it goes youll soon see where are the counters who wants money and how much oh i think unlimited dont you blanche were all so prudent and were all so poor that we shant lose our heads lets all have a hundred pounds that gives a false air of opulence lady blanche frampton counted her portion with avaricious fingers i havent seen so much money for years she said colin youve given me ten shillings short no i havent dear add it up again lets have six at this table and six at the other dennis doesnt count hes going to bed in half an hour if he doesnt sit up longer but i want dennis said lady blanche ill give you a pound for dennis hed be a mascot because you havent played before have you dennis or is poker part of a modern boys education yes of course it is said colin the head holds pokerclasses for the sixth form twice a week and the house master for those under fourteen dennis attend to me ich deal as the prince of wales said now there are pairs and two pairs dennis and a flush and a straight whos in everybody then whos shy and has not put his mite into the pool oh i believe its the dealer an hour later dennis instead of being in bed had been started by colin on his own with a capital of ten pounds luck favoured him and presently it had doubled itself then luck went against him and he lost every farthing of his capital twenty pounds he was crsus and next moment penniless the tragedy was quite appalling hullo dennis cleaned out said colin observing this pokers not so entertaining after all dennis stiffened his rather drooping neck ive enjoyed it tremendously he said rare good run for my money he gave that boyish cackle and it was yours all the time he said sorry father for losing it colin had watched the tragedy and inwardly applauded the boy was really plucky about it and colin respected pluck it might be a virtue but it was not connected with love how handsome he looked with his flushed face and eager eyes and chin slightly in the air to show he cared nothing about the loss of that millionaire capital never mind he said now dennis would you rather go to bed with a sovereign in your pocket or shall i start you again but if you lose it this time you wont get a penny oh lord ill go on said dennis ripping of you father another night there was a theatrical performance given by three actors of a play that would certainly never see the london footlights and once again dennis sat between his father and blanche frampton the surface of the first act scintillated with cynical witty nonsense light as foam and the boy bubbled with laughter but presently his laughter was not so frequent something began to shew through the surface and a soft perpendicular wrinkle engraved itself between denniss eyebrows and he puzzled out what seemed so clear and vastly entertaining to the rest of the audience yes soon he thought he had got it and his brow cleared but he didnt laugh it just did not happen to amuse him colins attention had been about equally divided between the stage and the boy the play was to his mind it drew with deft distinctness the passion that exists only as a pastime and is a foe rather than a friend of love the author had expended inimitable wit in its delineation but before the act was over colin was recognizing rather than appreciating the corrupt and subtle handling and his conscious attention was more engaged with the effect it had on dennis than with the entertainment he himself derived from it during these last few days he had grown very proud of dennis there were his extraordinarily good looks to begin with and he enjoyed himself enormously but never boisterously everyone tried to spoil him but no one succeeded he was ever so friendly and well at ease and without a trace of selfconsciousness his manners were excellent there was no impression that he was behaving himself he was perfectly natural with a winning boyish simplicity withal he was not grownup and greenhoused for his years he was on the contrary extremely young colin put his arm round him as the act closed with a frank emergence of polished indecency well old boy enjoying it he asked dennis made one of those confiding boyish movements fitting his shoulder close under his fathers arm i liked the beginning he said butbut theyre rather playing the ass arent they clearly he wasnt enjoying it colin had distinctly hoped he would that was why he had let him come it was disappointing but it was no use boring the boy with these intriguing animals the last thing he wanted to do was to bore him go away then he said if you dont care about it i thought it would amuse you i expect im awfully thick said dennis you are my dear youre thick and fat with that enormous dinner you ate did you like your champagne rather i should think i did may i have some tomorrow you must ask your mother dennis laughed id much sooner ask you he said youre a winebibber youll get gout and delirium tremens and your mother will say its my fault well what about this next act are you going to stop or not i think i wont said dennis and will you come and say good night no youll be asleep i shall keep awake if youre coming all right say good night to your mother and tell her ive sent you to bed but you havent said dennis no but thatll make her pleased with me dennis stole out and blanche gave a sigh of relief thats a good thing she said dennis was as much out of place here as i should be playing football with him at eton but youd enjoy that said colin youd love being the one female in a crowd of handsome boys she laughed yes my dear we all detest competition as we get older but why did you let dennis come at all either hed wallow in it which would be extremely bad for him or hed be bored with it i wanted to see which he would do it would have been very interesting if hed wallowed in it youre no judge of character you might have known he wouldnt she said oh do you think that children of that age have character arent they more like white sheets of paper ready to be written on colin youre an awful father fancy wanting this delicious witty piece of muck to be written in poor denniss first chapter im glad hes gone i shall be able to enjoy it with a freer conscience oh observe your aunt hester she looks as if she was receiving early impressions and finding them wonderfully agreeable and oh look at your much revered grandmother did you ever see anyone so monumental there she sat in the centre of the room in a great chair of rosecoloured genoese velvet in this interval between the acts the cutglass chandelier over her head had been lit and the blaze strongly illuminated that alabaster face motionless expressionless inscrutable and yet what sculptors skill could have wrought a countenance from which every sign of feeling or even of consciousness was so expunged in a face of stone some expression lurks in the sightless eyes and the shadows at the corners of the mouth and an attentive observer will seem to see the expression change and discover some fresh hint of what the sculptor divined in his living model and chiselled into the lifeless stone but here there was no such elasticity of interpretation possible the closer you looked the more you were baffled and yet there was no tranquillity there as on the face of the dead lady yardleys face was immensely alive but with what was it alive talk of white paper said blanche colin laughed not a bit of it covered with strange writing he said look he leaned forward granny dear he called she turned her head in the direction of his voice then came recognition for the blank eyes brightened and the folded lips uncurled there was something there it was as if colin had caused characters written in invisible ink to spring up over the blank surface but they faded again before they could be read and presently she turned back and looked up the curtain in front of the stage where the footlights were just rekindled gracious me its covered with writing said blanche but quite unintelligible what was it about it was about stanier said colin stanier is the only thing she is conscious of you see im the incarnation of it to her and i think shes beginning to see that dennis will have something to do with it but i really dont believe she knows violet by sight supper succeeded the play and it was not till after one oclock that colin went upstairs dennis slept in a room close to his fathers the door was ajar and there was a light within colin went in and there was dennis propped on pillows and sitting up in bed but fast asleep his yellow hair was tumbled over his forehead his mouth was a little open shewing the white rim of his lower teeth clearly he had sat up in bed in order to keep awake for his fathers coming but his precautions had failed sleep heavy and soft had come upon him colin stood looking at him there indeed in the unguardedness of slumber was the white paper he looked extraordinarily young as he slept his was the face of a child still sexless just a radiant piece of youth holy in its innocence would it not be possible without really waking him to put into his soul now unprotected by the guard of its conscious self some suggestion which would like a fruitful seed lie buried there and take root and presently push some folded horn of growth above the soil colin turned out the light by the switch near the door and began to gather force into himself it was not an effort of concentration at all rather it was a complete relaxation he had only to lie open and tranquil like a dewpond and let it flow in from the air from the night drop by drop at first and then in ampler streams it came flooding in making a tingling in his blood more and more he must collect attracting it with images of evilhow well he knew the process of ittill he was charged and brimming with it and then he would direct it and turn it on that boyish figure that sat up in bed not with an effort of will but making himself so to speak just the channel through which it flowed throughout he must not think of himself at all nor even of dennis he was no more than the reservoir which was storing what dennis should receive he must direct and convey that without quite waking the boy there was a hitch somewhere an obstruction at first he could not conjecture the nature of it then he perceived what it was he was not surrendering himself thoroughly some rebellious part of his soul ever so faintly was protecting denniss beautiful face and slack limbs and standing between the boy and the force that was seething about him it would not allow colin to be the channel it blocked the way was it pride in the boy as he was was it pity was it something more powerful yet whatever it was it was there colin clutched at it to wrench it away he felt it give and he felt the force foam by it towards denniss bed there came from the bed some stir of movement and a gasping breath then denniss voice muffled and strangling as if there was a hand on his throat no no it cried no ah the boys breath came thick and fast what is it whos there he screamed father father colin reached up his hand for the switch and turned on the light he did not intend to do it his hand moved as if by some reflex action outside the power of his will for there was something in that instinctive cry to him which set at work some uncontrollable mechanism within him dennis was half out of bed his face bathed in perspiration his eyes wide and terrified with a leap he sprang to colin never pausing to think how it was that he came to be standing there in the dark and clung close to him oh its you he said with his head buried on colins shoulder thank the lord oh i say ive been so frightened something came into the room i dont know what it was but something hellish i say its not here now is it colin patted his shoulder why dennis whats the matter he said youve had a nightmare thats all i came in here a minute ago and found you asleep with your light burning i turned it out dennis wiped his forehead with the back of his hand raising a troubled face out of which that sheer terror was beginning to fade was that all he said are you sure there was nothing that came in oooh i thought i was going to die of fright strange was it that so few minutes ago it was through his fathers presence and complicity that the terror had gripped dennis by the throat and that now it was that same presence which so quickly restored the boys confidence with his father there he knew that nothing could hurt him not nightmare nor phantom nor the terrors that walk in darkness get back into bed old boy said colin its late you know you must go to sleep dennis unwound his clinging arms and hopped back into bed oh do wait two minutes he said its its awfully rotten of me but i couldnt stand to be alone in the dark again this moment i never had such a horrible nightmare well just two minutes said colin and what was the nightmare dennis pulled his father down till he sat on the edge of the bed and held his hand i dont know what it was he said with a shudder it felt like the devil but it wont come back will it when i go to sleep again of course it wont youre not frightened now are you no at least i dont think so if you promise me it wont come back im not frightened yes i promise you that said colin colin left a tranquil dennis curled round in bed like a drowsy puppy when he went to his room a few minutes later but he was not so tranquil himself he had not imagined that any panic terror would seize the boy he had only meant to plant a seed a suggestion ever so quietly leaving it to mature dennis would not come to love evil so that when the time for his choice arrived he would choose wisely and well if it approached him with these strangling assaults of nightmare why had it happened like that he wondered no boys soul at that age was of such virgin and stainless purity that the breath of evil suffocated him more likely that it was his own divided purpose his own struggle against that obstacle which somehow he had himself set up against the free flowing of the stream he had directed against dennis some force he felt sure had reached the sleeping boy from him that he had intended and he had felt it flowing through him but had it reached him in some fierce torrent raging at having been checked in its passage and settling on him with claws and teeth had it been like some wild beast which having been shewn its lawful and desired prey was held back from it he must not approach dennis again like that nor seek to hold back the power that he directed it was no conscious scruple on his part which had blocked the channel the obstacle seemed to have made itself and planted itself there it was of the same nature as the instinct that made his hand search for the switch and turn up the light at denniss appealing cry he hated the boy to be frightened quite apart from the fact that dennis must of his own inclination welcome and cherish the power that was ready to protect him and be his friend even as it had been his fathers friend and the friend of old colin it had come to dennis tonight as a foe of malignancy and terror that would never do colin had slipped quickly out of his clothes and now before he got into bed he drew up the blind and throwing the window wide leaned out into the pregnant spring night thick and warm was the darkness a floor of cloud covered the sky and there would be rain before morning the soft fruitful windless april rain which sent the sap flooding upwards through stem and branch till it burst into leaf and bud the young growth needed not pelting showers and fierce suns it prospered most in these still warm nights and dennis was like these tender sappy shoots he must be left to grow quietly yet awhile not drenched by deluge and speared by violent suns these would only blast and wither him how panicstricken the boy had been that psychical onslaught had from its very vehemence been to him a hostile intrusion not the advent of a protecting power how instinctively in the shock and terror of it he had called to his father there was an irony about that instinct was a blind ignorant force else dennis would have shuddered and fled from his father not clung to him with arms close pressed and terrified face hidden on his shoulder and yet here was the puzzling the baffling thing dennis had been perfectly right at that cry of his in the dark colin had had no thought but the answering instinct to comfort and reassure him his hand had shot out independently of his purpose to flash on the light and he had given the boy the protection he sought he couldnt stand that wail of desolation what made him do that him who had jeered and flouted pamela to her selfdestruction without a pang of pity but only with devilish glee who had let nino die of fever with a shrug of his shoulders who had worshipped evil and drunk of the derided sacrament of love dedicating himself by rite and symbol as by the daily conduct of his life to his souls master how came there that disloyalty to his affiance how was it that there flourished in the garden of his soul that despicable weed he had not done it in mere careless pity as he might have raised a corner of netting to set free a bird that was caught there nor had he done it with the deliberate reasoning that justified it to his mind afterwards when he perceived that it would never do to have dennis regard this directed force as hostile and malignant he had done it because there was no question of choice an inward compulsion not to be resisted had made him and thus denniss instinct was right he called on him and he clung to him exactly as he would have clung to his mother because he loved her and was certain of her love colin had given him too exactly what his mother would have given him there was no other conclusion and instantly all colins nature was in revolt it had been an impulse of love that had taken hold of him he had leaped to the protection of denniss terror and of his innocence he had denied his allegiance he had rooted evil out of his heart for that moment and and how curiously sweet it had been to have the boy in his arms like that and see the terror and trouble vanish from his eyes there was no woman in the world whom he would have suffered to take denniss place at that clinging moment no promise of physical rapture and consummation to follow that would have been so desirable as that comforting of dennis that sitting by him on his bed for five minutes while he tranquillized and composed himself he revolted and rebelled it was not for this that he had grown proud of dennis delighting in his physical beauty and in the sunshine of his boyish vigour and in the grace and charm of him he had enjoyed them with ever increasing zest because of the thought that someday dennis would be one with him in his allegiance to the lord of hate he had seen himself bringing him to the tribunal of his choice and beholding him choose as he himself with never a moment of regret had chosen who in all the world of men with their callow consciences their bloodless ideals their cold duties had prospered as he had done or whose days succeeded each other in such procession of satisfaction all that must be denniss it was his unique birthright to be allowed to choose all that the lust of the eye and the pride of the flesh and the glory of the world could bestow with never an ache of compunction or a sigh of pity or a pulse of love colin got up the rain had begun to hiss on the shrubs below his window he must have been sitting here for more than an hour for the chimes in the church a couple of hundred yards away struck three he had not been thinking consciously or with purpose it was as if pictures had been spread out in front of him on which he let his eyes rest now as he went across to his bed there came an intenser focussing it was well enough that dennis should come to him as he would have gone to his mother drawn there by the bonds of his love colin had meant to oust violet from the boys heart and take her place and if nothing more at present dennis had given him a niche of his own there he wanted denniss affection and confidence for it was through them that he would most surely lead him it was natural too that he himself should delight in the boys magnificent youth and abounding charm but it was not well that his own heart should have gone out to dennis like that whence had come that spark of soft authentic fire was it from some remote and infinite conflagration the warmth and the light of which can penetrate the uttermost darkness colin turned out his light and curled himself up in bed as he had seen dennis do that would be a nightmare indeed he thought all that week and the two that followed stanier outvied itselffor indeed there was no other competitorin the splendour of its hospitalities the great houses of england were now for the most part shut up and the owners crippled by the ruinous taxation only lived in small corners of them like picnicking tourists those who were fortunate let them to americans or argentines preferring like sensible folk to live in comfort in smaller houses rather than shiver in palaces they could not afford to warm and which after all were very desolate abodes unless they were full of the life and merriment of guests they sold their pictures for who could afford to look at a reynolds which hung unharvested on the walls and not reap it into five hundred a year they sold tapestries and ivories and plate whatever could be alienated and turned into cash went to christies and like some monstrous insatiable reptile america gorged already with the gold of europe spat a little of it out and took some majolica or some beauvais tapestry instead lucky indeed were the impoverished landowners of england to find in their kinsmen across the atlantic this delightful illusion that living in a castle conveyed culture and to have somebody elses family pictures on the walls quickened the ancestral sense and that to eat off caroline plate was like a course of history lectures of hospitality as a kindly and sociable virtue colin had no opinion at all that side of it did not concern him nor again did he in the least care in itself for mere lavish ostentation he would just as soon as far as personal inclination went have had stanier empty and serene in its established security as swarming with guests some of whom he scarcely knew by sight and for none of whom had he any real affection nor did the presence of two royal personages who had come down for three days directly after easter and found that they were able to honour him and violet by staying for a week give him any thrill of satisfaction it was a matter of complete indifference to him whether they came or not or whether they were so much amused that they stopped longer than they had intended but what was to the point was that stanier should carry on its tradition for magnificent entertainment for that belonged to it just as its legend did it might be a deplorable waste of money yielding an infinitesimal dividend of pleasure on the capital expended but that could not be helped everything that could be procured to give gorgeousness must be there one night the russian ballet danced on the enclosed terrace and another there was a concert whatever the diversion was it was a matter of course that his guests should be thus amused for an hour or two and it was stanier that gave the cachet to the entertainment more than the artists when stanier was en fte it was not to be supposed that the guests should be asked to spend the evening in polite or even impolite conversation or in making words out of words they might do so if they liked if they wearied of that there was the concert or the ballet but every evening for this was just as much a part of stanier as the rest there was old lady yardleys whisttable by the fire in the long gallery and whoever was there she had her two rubbers of whist this was the stanier use and the presence of all the crowned heads in the world would not be suffered to interfere with it one night violet and a couple of guests played with her another night colin took his place there that happened to be on the night of the russian ballet and as the rubbers were unusually long the other entertainment had to wait when they were over colin without explanation escorted one of his royal guests to the front row and violet the other he rather enjoyed that it was an objectlesson for dennis to shew him that at stanier the sovereignty of the house took precedence of anything and anyone else he did not call denniss attention to it but he let dennis see and on sunday of course colin read the lessons at morning service all this week too and with what infinite address the education of dennis went on even the mistake that colin had fallen into in thinking that the direct force could be brought to bear upon him as he slept in such a way that he would not be startled at it had turned out not so badly for that night dennis had leaped to him to seek protection in love and certainly the boy was fonder of him than ever he did not want denniss love in itself any more than he had wanted pamelas or violets but he saw now into what an admirable weapon for his own use that love could be forged love should be the goad fashioned by dennis himself with which when the time was ripe colin would drive him where he would already dennis would sooner please his father than please himself if his father gave him by way of test some rather irksome duty of hospitality to perform towards his guests the boy would obey him not grudgingly at all but with that alacrity and joy which is loves obedience but it was no use forcing him to that of which his natural instincts warned him let the young fruit ripen thought colin in similar preparation it was good that dennis should see what the prosperity of stanier connoted and what its lordship implied dennis was by no means the sort of boy whom mere splendour dazzled but he must be impressed by the greatness of that to which this magnificence was just a whim a flick of the fingers to summon diversion for a fortnight of easter recess dennis was enjoying it vastly and without doubt it was dawning on him that some day he would be in his fathers place and if this sort of thing amused him it was his to evoke or if he had a mind for anything else that would be his also on the last night of the party when all would disperse next morning colin meant to call his attention to that and very carefully to the contract on which it depended he knew now that dennis would not leap to it as he himself at that age would have done but so he reflected the existence of raymond his elder twin had even then schooled him in hate dennis had had no such schooling and incentive but this was not all that that night had revealed it had revealed in himself a tenderness altogether alien to him even though he had been in the act of loosing on the boy the force which was to befriend him his mere physical distress had sufficed to make him abandon that and give him the protection he sought all this week that memory had lain in his mind and below the occupations of the busy days he had impatiently considered it cavilling at his own faintheartedness probably certainly indeed he had done wisely the power with which he had sought to surround dennis must come to him not in this nightmare guise but as a friendly and protecting influence and to have continued then directing it on him would have been a great mistake it might even have done some mental or spiritual hurt to the boy for his whole nature had been up in arms to resist it and who knew what deadly struggle might not have resulted for the force which he had turned on him was no pretty toylike drawingroom mesmerism you could not play with it and try psychical experiments it was a thing deadly and potent even when it was not resisted but welcomed and embraced its passion could manifest itself in disturbing and terrible ways and colin shuddered to think of dennis in the grip of it in such manner as he had before now seen vincenzo possessed when he served at the rites in the chapel and dennis had not yielded to it he had struggled and fought but that and colin knew it had not been the primary reason for his abandoning that midnight assault the primary and instinctive reason had been that dennis called to him with the insistent and compelling voice of love strange indeed that he should have hearkened to it for the voice of love was most unmusical in his ears and made not melody but exasperating discord just so had it been with him when he came unperceived on the day of his return home into the gallery and found dennis and his mother there happy and content for no reason except that they were together at that moment how quick violet had been to notice it he had envied them though he knew precisely what the ground of their happiness was love and he had nothing to do with each other he did not desire to have any commerce with love either in giving or receiving he had chosen and the reward of his choice was that he had everything else as long as his life lasted but that he had always hated love and never would he consciously or deliberately make terms with it but it was as if some shadowy semblance of it in the shape of dennis had come silently and burglariously up to his wellguarded house of hate and opened the sash of some unbolted window he wanted denniss love because as he had seen that would be a useful weapon but dennis must not gain entrance to him he must make his house more secure he had been careless not seeing to its safety not once since he had returned home had he been to the chapel or strengthened himself in his allegiance by sign or symbol he remembered the glee with which he had built it the glee with which he had found the book of wondrous blasphemies and knew that the edge and keenness of his devotion was blunted was it this remissness which had allowed the wraith of dennis to slip open the windowsash or was it that this soft assault on his heart had caused the remissness of course during these last two weeks it had been almost impossible to attend these rites but as soon as the house was empty he would make amends with the intention of the abhorrence of love in his heart at midnight now the hour at which chiefly he used to love to attend the impious celebration some entertainment was in progress and he could not leave his guests and unlocking the door in his private study which communicated with the corridor move along it past those infamous pictures with which it was decorated to the chapel the altar with its black cloth would be blazing with lights and presently father douglas robed only in that magnificent italian cope would enter from his lodging followed by his server tossing fresh clouds of incense into the air he must resist this stealthy menace of winged love he must spread nets and lay traps for it and when it lay unresisting in his hand squeeze it with strangling fingers till it ceased to flutter chapter iii a fancydress ball had been arranged for the last night there were already some forty guests in the house who as colin said would form a sort of nucleus and a special train was coming down from town arriving at ten and going back at three in the morning and invitations had been sent to the neighbourhood for twenty miles round with the hope that ladies and gentlemen would be elizabethan but begging the ladies not to be elizabeth dozens of elizabeths he thought of all shapes and sizes with crumpled ruffs and jewels off crackers were bewildering and you collided with the queen with improbable frequency instead violet was to be the sole elizabeth present and dennis was to appear as her young colin in attendance colin came into the wifes room in a wonderfully good humour that morning to talk over the manner of their appearance for several days he had scarcely had a word with her i think we wont stand by the door as host and hostess he said and shake hands one has to say to everyone how wonderful and charming they look and guess who they are and then they have to say how wonderful and charming we look and guess who we are and the entrance gets blocked oh isnt it rather rude not to receive guests she said not a bit its perfectly proper swank in fact i dont want you and dennis to appear till the special has arrived and everyone is in the ballroom the royals will be on their dais at the end of the room and the rest shall be marshalled round the walls and you and dennis and i will march up the whole length of the room and then we go straight into the royal quadrille ive told them very well said she but what about you i dont even know who youre to be yet youve always represented old colin at fancydress here but you cant if dennis does he laughed admirably reasoned he said too many colins would spoil the broth like too many queens but im going to complete the group just a little way behind dennis merely mephistopheles but he had something to do with it strictly elizabethan too though belonging to other ages as well oh colin thats rather grim she said why produce the family skeleton well its the skeleton on which the family has grown fat of course everybody thinks the legend is medival bunkum but theyll play up dennis will be an adorable colin i made him try his things on just now and if the real one looked as enchanting as he i dont wonder the queen lost her aged heart and as youve lost yours to dennis we shall have a real parallel as for you darling youll be an anachronism but that cant be helped elizabeth was an ugly old woman at the colin epoch and we cant call you that exactly she was silent a moment i wonder if youll be vexed at what i want to say she said how can i tell he said i dont suppose i shall care much its this then please dont get yourself up like mephistopheles its for denniss sake i ask it i want him to be among those who think the legendwhat did you call itmedival bunkum colin do leave him to think that he sat there looking at her with that brilliant sunny smile that alertness of perpetual youth well a fancydress ball is medival bunkum isnt it he said but you arent said she all you do all you are has a tremendous reality for dennis everything you do is perfect in his eyes thats good thats the right filial attitude are you as right conjugally darling besides what do you believe about the legend shouldnt a child learn its faith at its mothers knee the legend is fairly real to you isnt it there was the spirit that mocked but when dennis was concerned she was not afraid of him there are many things i believe which i dont want dennis to believe she said he laughed what an easy riddle he said you dont want dennis to believe that his father is an unmitigated devil thats the answer so dont trouble to say it isnt and as i believe in the legend too it would be nice to have our only boy one with us thats the root of domestic bliss i cant argue with you she said you mock at whatever i say but who asked you to argue said colin im sure i didnt but as were on the subject i may as well say that my whole object in making a black guy of myself is to help dennis to realize the legend he has heard it as everybody else has but its nothing to him though a fancydress ball is only a sort of play a play makes a thing more real to you dennis will be colin in the play and hell look round and see his dear mephistopheles at his elbow colin paused to light a cigarette and spoke with gathering impatience hes got to believe it sometime he said we all begin you and i did by thinking it just a picturesque old story but somehow it grows into us or we into it its the curse of the house said violet suddenly and its believing in it that makes it real oh colin let dennis grow up without it becoming real to him then it will stop it and all the horror and the misery it brings youre quite right it grows into us dont let it grow into him he got up do you know i really havent got time for an ethical discussion just now he said and why should i disinherit dennis thats what it comes to you may call the legend the curse of the house if you like but its been big with blessings youve got no sense of gratitude darling no family pride pride said she yes i said pride didnt i i wish you wouldnt make yourself into a damned echo and force me to be cross we wont discuss denniss future any more well confine ourselves to the present you and dennis and i will come in as i have indicated i want you to wear every jewel that you can cram on chiefly pearls i think but also that sort of large red plaster of rubies stomacher isnt it but you mustnt wear the stanier sapphire i want that for dennis you might give it me now if youll open your safe but thats all wrong she said the queen never gave that to colin till just before her death my dear you neednt tell me that i suppose i know the history of colin as well as you but i want dennis to wear it i want it thats all colin had recovered his temper he was all serenity and sun again theres something queer about the stone he said it never looks well on you it loses half its light whereas on me it blazes like a blue arc lamp everyone round looks blue as in the grotto at capri and i want to see what effect he has on it who could be as devilish as colin she found herself thinking but who had such charm one moment he would sneer and mock the next he had dropped all that and without intention and certainly without effort he was like a boy again making plans and having secrets with her often during this last week or two that enchanting side of him had popped out unawares one moment his mouth would be full of veiled insults and scarcely veiled hostilities the next as now he would be eager and pleasant more particularly had she observed this when he was with dennis though she knew that in his heart he had contemplated the boys initiation into all that was evil she could not believe that it was not from his heart that every now and then there came up the impulse that made that soft light in his eye that tenderness on his mouth could it be possible that he was getting to love dennis after all there had been that moments jealousy of that she made no doubt when he had seen dennis and her together was that the grain of mustardseed poor little seed if it was it would find poisoned soil and corrosive moisture for its growth ill get you the stone she said its in the safe in my bedroom wall colin perched himself on the arm of the sofa where she sat oh theres no hurry he said lets have five minutes chat i havent seen you all this week and i havent told you what an incomparable hostess youve been i always recognize merit vi and youve been most meritorious the sapphire now there is something queer about that stone pearls always shine with you like moons but the sapphire gets as stale as a piece of mildew its because it was old colins i believe his getting it seems to me his most remarkable achievement he can never have been more hugely inspired than when he made that stingy old woman give it him all else that she had given him his garter his estates cost her nothing but fancy getting her to part with something that was hers and that was worth a ransom and you cant look at it without seeing theres something in it you dont understand she laughed you speak as if there was something magical about it she said well why shouldnt there be im not such a shallow ass as not to believe in the supernatural and the whole point of the supernatural is that you cant understand it if you could understand it it wouldnt be supernatural suddenly he appeared to forget about the stone altogether i want to ask you something he said did dennis by any chance tell you that about a week ago he had the most awful nightmare yes then tell me exactly what he said violet thought a moment he had gone up to bed he told me and as he expected you to come and say good night to him he didnt put his light out but propped himself up with pillows to keep awake he thinks that he must have gone to sleep though he didnt know that he had then a great blackness he said came into the room and tried to force its way into him he struggled and struggled and called out to you and then he found he was awake and you were there and comforted him he said you were angelic to him colin turned quickly to her what do you make of it he said i make of it what dennis made of it thats simple enough isnt it she looked at him and saw there was something more the notion somehow branded itself into her mind like the touch of a hot iron there was the conviction incredible and terrifying that colin had something more to do with that visitation than to bring comfort but what tell me your side of it she said colins face changed the impatience and mockery came back good lord how can i have a side he said wasnt i right to comfort him or should i have scolded him for being frightened by a dream has he forgotten about it do you think i mean does he accept it just as a nightmare and me as an angel im not certain he was most frightfully scared but it will wear off if he doesnt have another nightmare you remain an angel anyhow that doesnt wear off still that irrational conviction of some complicity of hishow insane it appeared when she faced itbeset her colin he mustnt have another nightmare she said terror is so frightfully bad for a child she saw colins fingers beginning to twitch when he was getting angry or impatient they made the strangest little movements as if some electric current was jerking them im responsible for denniss dreams then am i he said why else did you tell me he mustnt have any more nightmares whats the meaning of that come out with it you did mean something she could not state what after all was the most fantastical notion it would not bear examination it was just as much a nightmare as denniss i mean that you have the most extraordinary control over dennis she said his whole soul is devoted to you waking or sleeping he would obey you you know that as well as i do surely colin had never been in so strange a weathercock of a humour as he was this morning at one moment he was ready to fly out at her with unbridled irritation the next he was all sweetness and amiability he put his arm round her vi you and i are like norns he said arent they norns who in some dreary wagner opera sit in the dusk and toss the shuttles of destiny to and fro dennis is flying from hand to hand between you and me you catch him and weave and then you toss him back to me and i weave there ought to be three norns though oughtnt there who is the third i dont believe we shall agree on the third all her unfathomable distrust of him came flooding back on her his purring content seemed to her like that of some lithe savage beast basking in the sun who next minute might deal some shattering lightningblow with unsheathed claws who could trust him who had ever trusted him that did not repent unless already it was too late to repent of such a madness and yet she believed that he was getting fond of dennis with a quality of affection not proud only and paternal but personal she made up her mind to stake on it i dont think we should disagree she said we both love him he pulled his arm away from her and looking at him she fancied she saw for a moment behind the brightness of his eye that dull red glow not human which you can see in the eye of a dog one glimpse she got and no more for he rose i think weve bleated long enough on the vox humana stop he said or shall we sing a short hymn before you give me the sapphire she went into the bedroom next door and opened the safe that was built into the wall and returned to him with the shagreen case he took it from her without a word and left her the special train of saloon carriages that brought the guests from london and ran without a stop into rye was on time and by halfpast ten the last of them had passed into the ballroom the request that they should be as elizabethan as possible was faithfully carried out never was there such a oneperiod galaxy no house but stanier could have induced people to pour out into the country for a few hours but how they flocked to stanier for the last fortnight this easter fte had been the talk of the town and noone of the amused and amusing world who was so fortunate as to be bidden to the final and crowning splendour could afford to miss it and noone who was bidden could afford to fall below the standard of its magnificence glittering and bravely attired was the throng a joy to behold in these dingy days when never were women so garish and slovenly and when men all wear the same illinspired livery every great jewelchest in london that night must have been void of its finest treasures for here was their gorgeous rendezvous no host or hostess was there to receive the guests they flowed in jewelled and kaleidoscopic and wondered where lady yardley was and where colin was and collected and dispersed again in shimmering groups over the floor some of those staying in the house appeared to know something about their absence but could give no further information beyond that the hosts would be sure to be here presently and acting as marshals and masters of ceremony gradually began clearing the centre of the room back and back towards the walls they enticed the crowd and soon it was seen that this was some intentional manuvre to secure an empty floor in a gallery above the door into the hall the band was stationed still silent on a dais at the other end were seated the two royal guests who had been here all the week with others who had come down tonight then at some signal given from the far end of the room a dozen chandeliers hitherto unlit blazed out and the hosts arrived violet advanced some few yards into the room with her retinue close behind her she was dressed in a gown of dark blue velvet thickly embroidered in gold with the tudor rose the tall white collar of her ruff was edged with diamonds and round her neck were the eight full rows of great pearls the first three close round her throat and five others each longer than the last falling in loops over her bosom the fifth being clipped to the stomacher of large rubies and round her waist was a girdle of the same stones on her head she wore a net of diamonds that pressed closely down on her golden hair so that it rose in soft resilient cushions through the meshes of it just behind her came dennis in trunk of white velvet and white silk hose over his shoulders leaving his arms free was a short cloak of dark red velvet this was buckled at the neck with the great sapphire and on his head was a white cap with an aigrette of diamonds in his lowheeled rosetted shoes he was a shade shorter than his mother and his face flushed with excitement was grave with the desire to acquit himself worthily a pace behind him came colin a foil to the sparkle and splendour of the others for from head to foot trunk and hose and cloak he was in black black too was his cap with one red feather in it he was a little the taller of the three and standing just behind denniss white gleam he seemed to encompass the boy with the protection of his blackness and round the room as they stood there ran whispers of the legend the legend but people looked not so much at the jewels and the clothes and the gorgeous colouring but at those three faces all cast in one peerless mould gold haired and blue eyed the difference of age and sex quite overcome by the amazing likeness between the three of them here indeed was stanier itself the splendour of its jewels its wealth its palaces its story shrunk into insignificance in the marvel of its incarnations they paused there a moment and then violet gave three deep curtsies the first towards the dais in front and then to right and left to the rows of guests marshalled by the walls there was stanier in the person of its hostess saluting its visitors dennis and colin stood quite still meantime for they were but in attendance as she moved forward again the full blare of the band shattered the silence and the welcome was over with the departure of the special train back to town the ball came to an end and no attempt was made to carry it on to a dwindling and fatigued conclusion it ended as it had begun and continued in a blaze and after it there was no flickering of expiring flames and fading of its glow last of all colin and dennis came upstairs together colin had been watching the boy all night dennis had suffered a short experience of high selfconsciousness when he entered the crowded expectant room but after that it had vanished altogether and he had merely enjoyed himself immensely without being in the least aware who he was the radiance of his youth shone round him like a fire noone could look at him without a smile of pleasure that the world held such perfection of boyhood all that colin saw and again and again his heart leaped to think that this was the son of his loins no sculptor could have made so fair an image no painter have found on his palette such colouring four generations of them were there that night old lady yardley sat like some white alabaster statue of deathless age on the dais then came aunt hester with a wreath round her head perdita or ophelia he supposed outrageously flirting with every man she could get hold of and succeeding to do her justice in getting hold of an incredible number then came himself and violet and last the flower of them all the guests had had no greeting on their arrival but the three stood at the ballroom door as they passed out and it was with dennis that they lingered frank and friendly but a little shy again at this multiplicity of smiles and greetings for himself he stood there erect and boyish the bonniest figure in all that assemblage of beauty he tucked his hand into his fathers arm as they went up the broad stairs from the empty hall oh father wasnt it fun he said i wish we could have a fancydress ball every night when shall we have another tomorrow if we have one every night said colin dennis cackled with laughter itll only be you and mother and greatgranny and me wont it tomorrow i say are you coming to talk to me while i undress and after that may i go to bed said colin oh if you like ill come and talk to you while you go to bed said he im not an atom tired colin looked at that radiant face still fresh as morning and for the first time he consciously noticed the sapphire that buckled his cloak that gave the measure of his absorption in dennis himself for he had given him the stone to wear with a definite object and now he saw how stale and unluminous it was no blaze of light burned within it its brilliance was dim compared to what it could be it was splendid still but no more than a shadow of its real self he knew his own idea about the stone to be quite fantastic but he felt a sudden spasm of anger with the boy that that great blue cornflower was so faded yet he felt he might have known it no ill see you to bed he said here we are turn up the light the room flashed into brightness and colin closed the door undo your cloak dennis he said and give me the sapphire the boy stood in the full light of the lamp above the dressingtable fumbling with it rather he said its like a bit of ice on my throat i almost took it off during the ball but i supposed it wasnt a thing to leave about oh i cant unfasten it do it for me father he held his head up smiling into his fathers eyes and moved by some uncontrollable impulse colin kissed that smooth cheek the boy was so splendidly handsome of so winning a charm and after all as colin thought to himself as if in excuse of the affection of that caress hes my own son then he raised his hands to undo the fastening at which dennis fumbled and even as he touched it light seemed to dawn somewhere deep in the heart of the sapphire there you are he said theres the icebag removed it doesnt look much like ice does it dennis shook off his cloak ooh it doesnt look very icy he said have i really been wearing that all evening why its alive its burning or is it only that it looks so bright against your black clothes you ought to have worn it tell me about it you said you would colin looked at the rays that danced in that blue furnace that he held it was scarcely possible to believe that this awakened lustre was purely an imagined effect and not imagined surely was the counsel that its splendour gave him to tell dennis a little more about his birthright well it was the last thing and the most splendid that the queen ever gave old colin he said he speaks of it in his memoirs which ill shew you oh do shew me them tomorrow i should love to see them the old rip sorry father about the sapphire colin let his eyes rest again on the great stone and then looked straight at dennis he says that his lord and benefactor caused him so mightily to please the queen that she gave it him he said you must learn to love it dennis for he calls it the finest fruit of his bargain dennis looked puzzled his bargain he asked oh the legend then do you think he really believed in the legend certainly he did and wise he was too you shall read how satan came to him one night as he slept dennis had taken off his tunic and stood there stockstill his face now more definitely troubled like some horrible nightmare he asked colin came a step nearer black as the pit and fair of face with the stone gleaming in his hand a nightmare good heavens no he said like some wonderful dream if you like but it was no dream it was gloriously real you cant understand yet what the bargain meant for youre only a boy and theres nothing that you really want which you dont get but imagine what it would be when you grew up to have every wish gratified the bargain holds not for old colin alone but for all those who come after you and me for instance who by their own choice claim their right to share in it the legend is no fairy tale dennis it is sober serious truth it was a miracle if you like but the evidence for it is conclusive the trouble deepened in denniss eyes when colin first spoke of that visitor coming to his ancestor as he slept there had started unbidden into his mind the remembrance of that nightmare from which his father had rescued him and now again he felt that invasion pressing on him and though it was surely his father who stood there yet somehow his black robes and his redfeathered cap and that blueblazing gift of satan in his hand seemed to obscure him it was as if some shadow had passed over him and behind that shadow he was changing oh dont father he cried i hate it its awfully stupid of me but i do hate it please there was no doubt that the boy was vaguely and yet deeply frightened his voice rose shrilly his hands were trembling and once again colin recoiled from the idea of denniss terror when he had directed the force towards him before in the defencelessness of his sleep it was easily intelligible that the invasion of it should alarm him but now speaking to him in his own person with the authority that denniss love for him gave he had hoped that the boy would at any rate sip at the cup which he held out to him but still he was troubled and alarmed he was not mature enough yet to guess the lure of dreams and of desires and yet that was not all that made colin pause if that had been all he would have persisted he would have induced dennis somehow to taste the sweetness of evil he would have pricked his arm to let just one drop of blood flow in which so to speak he could begin to write his name to the everlasting bond and bargain to initial it at least dennis might be a little frightened but the beginning would have been made what withheld him was not the wickedness of his intention nor yet the unwisdom of frightening dennis with it but his own damnable squirming weakness in minding the boys terror it was cowardly it was even apostate of him to recoil from that but he wavered before it he lacked firmness and indifference he must get rid of that scruple and the hateful tenderness that prompted it there dennis stood his bare arms stretched out to him halfimploring it seemed and yet by that same action keeping him off the throatapple in the soft neck moved up and down in his agitation as if struggling to keep his panting breath steady and the red flower of his mouth quivered the great sapphire slipped from colins hand and rolled on the floor he let it lie there unheeding or unknowing and came close to dennis putting his arm round his neck dennis my dear he said whats the matter what ails you why youre having the nightmare again while youre awake this will never do the boys attitude of defence of keeping his father away from him collapsed suddenly he threw out his arms and caught his father round the shoulders im an awful fool he said i was frightened and i cant think why just as if you werent protection enough against anything oh father youre a brick i do love you colin drew the boy down on the edge of the bed and sat close to him but what was the matter my darling he said tell me about it it wasnt anything said dennis im a bloody foolsorrybut just for a second it was nightmare again and i thought somehow it wasnt you standing there it was like some awful conjuringtrick and i wanted you and ive got you i wont be such an ass again sure youre all right said colin we cant have you getting panics dennis and being an ass dennis laughed you shant he said its all gone i say im keeping you up i must undress and go to bed or youll never get there dennis got up and stood there between his fathers knees erect and tranquil again he peeled off his hose and vest and put on his pyjamas just then his eye fell on the great sapphire that lay on the floor why youve dropped the sapphire father he said so i see never mind that ill pick it up now into bed with you how can i when youre sitting there no dont get up ill crawl in dennis inserted one leg between his pillow and where colin sat and drew himself into bed curling himself against his father there thats all snug he said good night then said colin dennis raised himself in bed and kissed him its been a lovely evening he said and itll be just as lovely tomorrow with you and mother and me i wish i wasnt going back to eton on thursday colin with the stone in his hand went out and down the few steps of the corridor to the door of his room once again and this time with a more direct and personal defeat dennis had routed him before he had directed the force that governed and protected him on the boy as he slept and who could tell in what fury of lambent evil it had begun to encompass him but now he himself whom above all dennis loved and trusted had approached him with the same initiation and yet all his love and trust had not given dennis confidence the spiritual semaphore of his instinct had hung out the red light of danger the boy had recoiled from what he brought with a shrinking that was not reassured by the fact that it was his father who brought it he had detected the nature of it and all his affection would not suffer him to take it even from the hands he loved and this time dennis had been broad awake knowing well what he was doing here then was a more personal rebuff it appeared that all colins trouble to endear himself to the boy and with what success he had accomplished that was useless for the purpose for which he had intended it indeed it was far worse than useless for in the process dennis had somehow entered his heart and for the second time he had been unable to persist the fault then in great part lay with himself he made no doubt that if with denniss love for him to assist him he had reasoned and persuaded telling him that in sober truth this ancient bargain was valid still and that when the day of his choice came he could have all that had been so richly showered on his father something of what he said would have remained in the boys mind quietly fermenting there but he had failed to do anything of the kind some incalculable impulse had seized him and he had thought of nothing except to reassure him he stood in his room the door of which he had not even closed looking at the sapphire that blazed in his hand that azure fire bade him go back to dennis now and conquering this despicable softness in himself tell him with all the gusto of a splendid surprise and he knew that a tongue of skill and persuasion would be given him that the legend was alive today that a power mightier than the kings of the earth was alert and eager to befriend him at so cheap a cost for the price was no more than that he should root out of his heart the sickly and sentimental stuff the injurious weakness called love which saps the strength of a man and enslaves him to others that was all that was meant by the bargain and the signing of the soul away that was the true and the sensible way to look at it and those who talked of it as being a consignment to the outer darkness and eternal damnation were merely trying to frighten people by hoisting bogies dennis would not understand but that wonderful and impressionable thing a boys memory would retain letter and form of it till bit by bit he began to understand it and then from its having dwelt long in his mind it would appear familiar and friendly dennis would already be half asleep and his father would just sit and talk to him a minute or two quietly and affectionately sowing seed and smoothing the rich fruitful earth of the boys mind over it he moved towards the door opened it and went into the passage and then as his hand was on the latch of denniss door he knew that even if he went in with his intention hot within him his expedition would be in vain dennis would sit up in bed sleepily smiling and welcoming the intrusion on any or no excuse so long as the intruder was he once more he would be disarmed by the defenceless the change that had to be wrought must begin with himself there was no doubt that he had allowed himself to get fond of the boy and for that reason he winced at the thought of the first incision he must anneal himself to the gay ruthlessness with which he dealt with others with which he had mocked pamela to her doom and jeered at his brother raymond struggling with the broken lids of ice before he attempted to deal with dennis again if only the boy was not so affectionate how easy it would be he had thought of denniss affection for him as a weapon in his own hand but at present it was a weapon in denniss perhaps he would have to snap that or wresting it from him turn it against him at any rate he must anneal himself he must weld the armour of hate against love the general dispersal took place next morning for an hour an almost incessant stream of motors left the door and dennis and his father were like ferryboats conveying their visitors from the gallery where they said goodbye to violet to the hall vastly as the boy had enjoyed this fortnight of crowd and turmoil he got even gayer as it streamed away and when the last had left he executed a wild rampageous dance in the hall hurrah theyve all gone he cried and now its just us father what shall we do all day its my last day you know you must let me have you all the time what shall we do first what was the use of spoiling denniss last day colin asked himself the boy would be gone tomorrow for the next twelve weeks and then would be the time to rout out the intruder indeed that uprooting should begin tonight that change in himself that recantation of his recent apostasy at midnight when dennis had gone to bed he would renew his vows and partake in the mockery of love itself dennis dont whirl round me like that he said you make me giddy and its very grumpy of you do you know to be glad that your friends have gone how many tipped you oh a frightful lot said dennis im rolling in riches will you come and play golf or tennis do you think or what about potting rabbits or dont you want to be bothered with me well do just what you like said colin sit down and make up your mind oh but its made up said the boy golf first well drive over to rye in the twoseater ill drive colin paused a moment you dont want to look at the memoirs then he asked ill read interesting bits to you if you like denniss eyebrows drew themselves together some remembrance was it of his vanished fears oh id sooner play golf he said all day the two were together and at dinner for aunt hester had gone back with the rest to london there were just the four of them at a small round table in the diningroom which last night had resounded to the gaiety of fifty and blazed with the costumes of elizabeth and yet all that was essentially stanier was gathered undiluted there the splendour and the sparkle of these last days had been no more than a casual decoration it had plucked for itself and worn a little while and thrown away again last night old lady yardley had sat up till the very end of the ball and all the week she had attended whatever entertainment was provided but these unusual hours seemed to have made no call on her strength and now brighteyed and somehow terribly alive beneath that immobile alabastrine sheath of her body she looked from dennis to his father and back again as if searching searching for some assurance some confirmation of what she desired of violet as usual she seemed unconscious the ball of laughter and talk had been thrown hither and thither merrily enough all dinner time dennis and colin were the chief performers and violet had taken but little part in it all day she had wrestled with a secret jealousy not once had dennis to whose last day at home she usually devoted herself appeared to want her and since their guests had left in the morning he had been exclusively with his father it was all very natural his exuberance wanted his golf and his rabbitshooting and the activities of his budding manhood and yet it was not the boys fault that he had not spared her a halfhour out of his day for at the conclusion of each diversion colin had been at hand with another was it simply for her discomfiture and the exhibition of his own triumphant rivalry that he had done that certainly that would have been a sufficient motive for him but she felt there was something else as well a larger issue an ampler cause if it had been that alone he would have had little oblique mockeries for her would have called her attention to his success would even have told dennis to go and talk to her and that when he had had a nice talk he was ready to fish or play tennis and then like a blown flame those little surfacejealousies went out was colin planning some final employment for dennis tonight she knew he had sent for mr douglas this evening and had had some private interview with him for she had unwittingly interrupted it and seen the breaking off of their topic when she entered the room at the thought that small green flame was quenched and cold apprehension gripped her as dinner went on she ceased to take any part in those gay crossing volleys and became like old lady yardley silent and watchful and aware she seemed to enter into the spirit of all those generations of silent and frozen women who were the wives and mothers of the race they had always been like that who were knit into the line through which the legend was transmitted and now she seemed to comprehend the nature of that vesture of ice that clothed them for they knew that it was through their blood and the love of their conceiving bodies that the satanic bargain was kept alive and that their sons were the inheritors of the bond was that not enough to freeze the mother the fruit of whose womb would be dedicated to hell who watched the growing strength and beauty of her son and knew the consecration of evil to which at his choice he gave his soul she would see him prosperous beyond all other heritors beauty and health honour and wealth would be his and her spirit would freeze and burn in the ice of knowing that all this was but the payment in dross for that which in the eyes of god was worth the ransom of the precious blood would she get used to that she wondered so that the knowledge became part of her nature and as the flocks of greywinged years passed over her head she would become so one with stanier that the prosperity and continuance of the house would grow into the very fibre of her nature it was so she guessed with old lady yardley colin and dennis were the connotation of the world to her over all else the penumbra and eclipse of age had passed and just that rim and nothing else was illuminated neither evil nor good nor love nor hate perhaps existed for her any more the sense of stanier was her only reaction to the exterior world dinner was over and the coffee handed and still lady yardley had not broken that frost of her silence but now there came a sudden uncongealment stanier is itself again tonight she said they have gone all the fine folk who come like dogs when my colin whistles to them they lick his hand and he feeds them colin turned to her granny dear what nonsense he said and you shouldnt call our distinguished guests dogs didnt you like having them here i thought you were enjoying it all that wraith of a smile dimpled her mouth yes i enjoyed it she said i enjoyed seeing them all doing homage to stanier to my colin she looked from him to dennis and here is my colin as he was when he was a boy she said when he grows up they will do homage to him too but before then he must know the legend instead of only hearing it read mark learn and inwardly digest the prayerbook says that about the legend colin pushed back his chair granny you are charming he said but we settled the first night that i was here that we were to have no prophesying at dinner but i am not prophesying said she i am only saying what you and i know and what presently he will know it will be pleasant when we all know for then we can talk freely shall i tell him now colin shall i break the sheet of ice i would be out in the sun then instead of being cold i will melt my frost he took her stick and put it into her hand get up he said go and melt the frost by the fire in the gallery where your cardtable is ready for you now not a word more she rose still smiling as if content with what she had said she had borne witness to what she knew and what colin knew and whether he was sharp with her or not was insignificant compared to that leaning on her stick she went out followed by violet colin watched denniss troubled face as he came back to the table after closing the door behind the others when first three weeks ago old lady yardley had prophesied he had been puzzled but excited and fascinated but since then he had learned something waking or asleep he had seen the outline of a terrible shadow and it seemed to be the same as that whatever it was of which she had just spoken what does she mean he said what was all that about her telling me and melting the frost dottiness said colin at once you discovered she was dotty weeks ago and just now you remember she thought that you were me as a boy again that wasnt very clearheaded was it and all the rest was just as muddled dont think anything more about it dennis that cloud did not clear away at once from denniss forehead his father had clearly wanted to tell him something last night and by an unerring instinct he divined that this same something lurked behind what he had just stopped old lady yardley from saying it concerned the legend clearly some practical personal application of the legend dennis youre not doing what i told you said colin sharply youre thinking of grannies dottiness dennis pulled in that sail of his mind which was still catching that mysterious breeze righto he said come and sit next me then you exclusive brute said colin instead of sitting at the other side of the table and youve liked your last day have you dennis oh father it has been lovely said dennis drawing a chair quite close to him why they all went away at eleven and ive been with you ever since except when i had my bath and even then you came in in the middle ten solid hours with you not bad no not very bad youve made an elderly gent like me play golf and tennis and shoot pigeons i shall have a restcure after youve gone do come and have it at eton theres a nursing home somewhere in the town elderly gent well dont rub it in said colin come on dennis we must go and play whist you and i will rook your mother and granny and then after being up till nearly four last night you shall go softly and silently to bed like the snark not silent youll come and talk wont you perhaps ill look in but i dont promise i must sit up and do some jobs why said dennis because youve prevented my doing them all day colin smiled to himself as he said that it was most emphatically true he would concentrate on his jobs tonight violet went upstairs with dennis at bedtime relieved of her immediate fear for colin made no move to detain the boy and whatever he had planned for himself he did not look for denniss partnership colin sat in his room when the others had gone up and for half an hour while he was waiting for midnight he read and mused over the memoirs of his ancestor how symmetrical and consistent he had been till that senile ague of terror palsied him in the last year of his life never once in those fascinating pages was there a hint of any struggle in his soul any stirrings of compassion or love which disturbed the poise of his undivided allegiance nor even at the end did he waver in spirit for it was easy to see that his belated pieties his formal acts of pity and charity sprang not from any turning of him in spirit towards god but from the mere physical terror of his approaching doom he only added cowardice in fact to his other sins and went forth with a blacker load than ever so early too must he have initiated his two sons into the doctrines of the gospel for long before the time came for their choice they were ripe and ready colin dropped his reading there was yet time to go upstairs and bid dennis dress and come with him but still the excuse held that the boys soul was not ready for the sacrament of evil he had to learn the sweetness of evil for evils sake before he could take part in its worship he would understand nothing the rite would be meaningless or worse than that would perhaps disgust and horrify him and it was not in disgust and horror that he must be drawn but must spring with a leap of the spirit towards a congenial mystery and still colin knew that all this was an excuse only and his reason for not fetching the boy was that obstinate intruder in his own heart which made him recoil from the notion of dennis being frightened or revolted it was in fact himself with whom he had to deal he must cleanse his own heart of the tenderness which was in bud there and by the inspiration of evil root out that alien weed he must concentrate his mind on defiance and hate there came a tap at the door which led into the corridor up to the chapel this was always kept locked and the key to it like a latchkey he wore on his watchchain otherwise the chapel could only be approached through mr douglass lodging he opened the door and found vincenzo standing there pronto signor said vincenzo and fell behind him as he walked up the corridor leaving him at the door into the chapel while he went through to the priests dwelling to vest himself as server colin entered the chapel was redolent of stale incense soon to be refreshed and renewed and blazed with lights presently the priest entered served by vincenzo he was robed in that wonderful cope which once stolen from some italian sacristy had been bought by colin in naples for a minute or so he knelt with his back to the altar and then making the sign of the cross reversed rose and began though he knew the ritual well colin closely followed the service in the vellumleaved book on his faldstool douglas had copied this in his exquisite formal handwriting from the missal of wondrous blasphemies illuminating the initial letters with appropriate decoration and sacrilegious parodies of holy scenes two years had it taken him a labour of love and colin by keeping his attention on the book strove to devote his mind to the spirit of the blasphemy he confessed his fallings and his lapses from his vowed life he tried to root dennis out of his heart he let his mind dwell on evil and cruelty and hate and now the new clouds of incense rose from the censer that vincenzo swung the altar gleamed through the fragrant sanctification and the supreme moment approached colin felt the stir of the power seething round him but he knew he no longer went out to meet it with welcome and hearts surrender all the pressure of his will was bent on doing so but it was as if some grain of grit had got into the psychic mechanism of his soul it checked and laboured it did not respond with full smooth strokes why could he not be like vincenzo who knelt there his face working with some diabolical rapture vincenzos hands were clasped in front of him his mouth grinned and slavered he shook and swayed in that fierce gale of possession the priests arms were raised now for consecration and vincenzos eyes were fixed on them in a moment more on the completion of the act he would pull the rope of the bell that hung by him and the three muffled strokes even as colin looked halfenvying him halfhorrified at the tension of the mans face vincenzo suddenly rose to his feet with hands stretched out in front of him he swayed as he stood as if blown by a great wind and then crashed forward and fell full length on the altarstep the priest with the wafer still unconsecrated in his hand turned at the thud of his fall he placed the wafer back on the paten and beckoning to colin stooped down by the mans side vincenzo had rolled on to his face and lay there trembling and twitching they turned him over his eyes wide open seemed to be focussed in blank terror at something close in front of them and at the corners of his mouth foam had gathered the priest felt for his pulse what happened he said to colin he fell forward well is he alive is he dead i cant find any flicker of pulse said douglas can you get some brandy ive got none yes theres sure to be a tray in the gallery ill go and get it colin nodded towards the altar take the vessels back to your room he said and disrobe ill be back in a moment father douglas knew something of first aid but it was in vain that they tried to restore the stricken man the brandy unswallowed trickled out of his mouth again the raising and lowering of his arms started no flicker of vitality we must send for the doctor said douglas but colin nodded understanding him yes not here of course he said we must move him now for hells sake dont let us make any mistake which we cant correct afterwards first of all we must take his cotta and cassock off get a pair of scissors quick we must cut the sleeves colin was perfectly alert and collected coolly and swiftly he thought over what was to be done just one glance of angry disgust he gave to that distorted whitening face which was the cause of all this trouble but for the present he needed all his wits to grapple with the dispositions which must be made instantly and without the possibility of correction afterwards his brain was busy as they slipped the severed vestments off vincenzo and he began to see the road lay him down again he said when this was done we mustnt move him at all till weve settled everything cover his face though i hate those dimmed glass eyes god what terror is there he sat down on the step with his back to the body i want to smoke he said nothing like a cigarette for filtering your thoughts now look here douglas of course he mustnt be found here at all no doctor or anybody else must come in here therefore its clear weve got to move him luckily its late the servants will have gone to bed we shall have the house to ourselves the priests hands were trembling he was utterly unnerved by the catastrophe memories of years long past when he was a priest of god and when to the dying he gave the bread of angels for their souls refreshment and support stood before him like white statues silent and aware now he was priest of a creed that mocked and defied and at the moment of supreme blasphemy this stroke had fallen was the visitation from god or from satan under which king he buried his face in his hands the horror of it he whispered the terror colin turned sharply to him here take some brandy he said asas nobody else will and you can enjoy your terrors afterwards at present youve got to help weve got to carry him away first good lord man youre not frightened of the dead are you the world must be a jumpy place for you with its millions of dead generations and vincenzo worshipped satan what better death do you want for him well well talk theology by and by think man help me to make up a story thats questionproof and we must be quick too these doctors have a trick of knowing how long a mans been dead perhaps hes not even dead were not doctors and we cant tell colin smoked in silence a moment frowning but brighteyed damned lot of use you are he said but hold your tongue now im getting at it he got up briskly and began walking up and down the black marble floor of the chapel come along he said youve got to help me to carry him out down the corridor and through my room and into the hall and then youll be pleased to hear all youve got to do is not to know that anything at all has happened youll come back here afterwards and put things away and then get to your bed and sleep or lie awake just as you feel inclined look theres the censer overturned and burning a hole in that carpet spit on it or something my word youre lucky that this didnt happen when you were alone with him but had someone with you who doesnt suffer from terror of the spirit now catch hold of him under his knees and lift him when ive got hold of his shoulders why the mans as light as a child thats the devout life under colins directions they carried their burden with the slit cassock still over his face and the arm hanging limply down out into the hall and laid him sprawling there much as he had fallen then colin twitched the cassock from the face and gave it to the priest lock up that and the cotta he said and bury them tomorrow in your bit of garden or weight them that will be better and make a parcel of them and chuck them into the lake above the sluice and now go back to the chapel make everything shipshape just as you would have done if this had not occurred and get to bed you know nothing nothing colin looked at his ashen face in contemptuous pity youre all to bits he said i suppose i shall have to come back and help you or youll forget to lock the chapel or something wait a minute he went to the telephone and got connected with the house of the doctor at rye im lord yardley he said as soon as he got a reply and im so sorry to trouble you but would you make all haste to come up to stanier my servant has had some sort of fit hes still unconscious thank you very much colin saw father douglas through with his part of the business and then waited in the hall where he would hear the doctors wheels there on the floor lay the body curiously insignificant and now he noticed that the famous picture of old colin with the supposed deed of bargain let into the frame was on the wall just above where it lay there was something rather suitable about that but he gave no further thought to it over and over in his mind he conned what he was going to say framing answers to any questions that might be put and above all rehearsing his own initial statement that was the important thing it was that which he must make so familiar to himself that he really believed it to be true for no doubt he would have to repeat it again at the inquest over all else though it teemed with surmise and wonder he drew an impenetrable curtain nothing else mattered just now but what he must say to the doctor before he had begun to expect his arrival he heard the crunch of motorwheels and undid the bolts of the door come in doctor he said it is good of you to have been so quick its my servant vincenzo who has been with me a long time there he lies exactly as he fell i thought it wise not to move him in any way i tried to get him to swallow a mouthful of brandy but i couldnt very wise of you lord yardley said the doctor a man taken by a seizure should always be left till it is ascertained of what nature his seizure is now let me examine him dr martin knelt down by his patient he felt for his pulse he listened at his chest and with a light brought close he looked with narrow scrutiny into the eyes then he rose to his feet im sorry to say i can do nothing he said the man is dead ah poor fellowpoor vincenzo said colin it is terrible terrible perhaps you would tell me exactly what happened said dr martin yes yes let us come into my room sit down doctor now let me think for a moment my wits seem all abroad colin covered his eyes with his hand a moment the clock on the mantelpiece chimed the three quarters after twelve he pointed to it and spoke vincenzo always sat up till i went to bed he said but often if i was sitting up late i would ring for him and tell him he neednt wait this evening when my wife and my boy went upstairs i came in here it must have been not long after eleven i began reading the typewritten copy of an old family memoir got interested in it and did not notice how the time went when i looked up i saw that it was late twenty minutes past twelve or thereabouts i had not finished my reading and so i rang the bell here in order to tell vincenzo that he need not sit up almost immediately i heard the noise of some heavy fall the house had been silent for some time and it startled me considerably i went out into the hall which we have just quitted and found the poor fellow lying there from the fact that i heard this noise immediately after ringing my bell i suppose that he had been waiting in the hall where he would hear my bell i instantly rang you up and remained there with him till you came i thought perhaps he might come to himself and i could be of use it occurred to me to call some of the other servants but since i felt sure that it would be safer not to move him there seemed to be no object in that ah yes i tried to make him swallow some brandy quite so you acted very wisely colin looked imploringly at the doctor it would be a great relief to my mind he said if you could definitely tell me that there was nothing i could have done to help him i am positive there was nothing probably he was dead when he fell there is a question or two i should like to ask when you rang me up you said he had had some sort of a fit had he suffered from fits before colin almost smiled with pleasure at that question he told me once that when he was a boy he was subject to them he said he supposed he had outgrown them i see of course this was not a fit medically speaking no sign of an epileptic seizure or anything of the kind sudden death thats all we can say at present and from what do you conjecture asked colin it is quite impossible to say that of course will have to be ascertained you can form no idea one would imagine he had some terrible shock there was an expression in his eyes of the most abject terror dr martin got up now would you like to summon one of your men to help us he said we must move the body of course is there some room near at hand where we can place him till morning when i will be back early to make all arrangementssome room which you can lock up and give me the key or keep it yourself yes theres the smokingroom close at hand said colin but there is no need to call anybody i will help you they laid him on a sofa there covering the face with a rug and presently after the key was turned and colin had taken it from the lock he saw the doctor to the door in his admirable way he had conveyed the impression of being terribly shocked and keeping a firm hand on himself you can rest assured lord yardley said the doctor that you did all that could be done you acted with great wisdom in not moving him and in sending at once for me i wish i could have been of any use put your mind quite at rest about that youll sleep i hope colin raised soft swimming eyes i feel as if i should he said now it is all over i feel most awfully tired good night dr martin ever so many thanks colin bolted and barred the door switched off the lights in the hall and went upstairs passing denniss door he saw that it still stood ajar and a line of brightness was rectangled round it he pushed it quietly open expecting to see that dennis had again fallen asleep while waiting for him to come and say good night this time however the boy was wideawake oh father what an age youve been he said what have you been doing it was as if some shutter had been snapped down in colins mind behind it lay all that had happened in this last hour bright and vivid as in some decked shop window but now cut off from view dennis you little wretch he said you ought to have been asleep long ago dennis laughed oh dont be silly he said you didnt think i was going to sleep without saying good night to you on my last night did you come and sit down for two minutes dennis wriggled away to the middle of the bed leaving room for his father to sit on the edge of it and put up his knees to form a back for him i expected you to be snoring said colin i never snore said the indignant dennis as for being asleep i didnt want to go to sleep finished your jobs pretty well i can leave the rest till morning dennis sniffed wrinkling up his nose like a young terrier where have you been he said your coat smells of roman catholic churches rot my dear cigarettes but it isnt rot well never mind i say father we have had a ripping holiday and todays been the best of all and its ever so much nicer here than in london i love stanier thats a family affliction said colin i wonder what youll do with it when im dead and you get it oh shut up as if i should care about it without you dennis what compliments said colin colin went to his room and let that shutter in his mind rattle up and looked into that lighted window between the catastrophe and the coming of the doctor his acuteness had been entirely busy over the account he would be called upon to give and there his cool ingenuity had served him well his story had been coherent and consistent and he had eliminated from it everyone but himself and the dead man who could bring forward no conflicting testimony but for the moment he looked only absently at that sensationally decked window for he congratulated himself on his wisdom in rejecting that wayward thought of taking dennis with him at midnight only a little more than an hour ago into the chapel if he had done that what face would dennis be wearing now would he have curled down in bed so quietly and followed his father as he went to the door with the shining of his tranquil affectionate eyes already he knew and had shuddered to know that there was in the legend something more than a fairy story something alive and satanic from the touch of which he shrank when it came near him colin would have told him that what he was to see in the chapel was the worship of that power which through the centuries had so wonderfully befriended the house and while he quivered in the face of that initiation there would have come this appalling this unexpected stroke the boy would have been distraught with terror evil which for its own sake he must sometime choose as guardian of his soul and body would have been to him for ever a force that smote its suppliant with death sudden and terrific it would have been disastrous if dennis had seen that colin looked into the lighted window there vivid as when the scene itself was before his amazed eyes he scrutinized the image of vincenzo already writhing in the ecstasy of possession and then falling forward like that why had that happened what was its psychical significance he had died it appeared of some shock of terror panic yelled in his wide silent eyes had there come to him some appalling revelation of ultimate absolute evil even as it had come to old colin himself when at his birthday feast he had shrieked out no no and with repelling hands had fallen dead across the table or had he looked in the eyes of god and seen there the infinite love of him at whom he mocked colin felt himself shudder at that thought that indeed would be enough to shrivel the spirit of a man like a burnt feather in a furnace hell could not contain such torment as to realize that through the night and blackness of absolute evil the love of god still shone without change or dimness even as the light of a steadfast star burns unblown by the puny violence of terrestrial tempests if there had come to vincenzo at the moment of death only some vision or internal realization of the wrath of god that surely to one whose joy it was to mock and defy him would have been like a waved banner of victory a sign that his mockery had reached its mark gods anger would be a testimonial to his success but it would have been hell indeed to know that all his defiance and rebellion had never caused the infinite love and pity to waver that for him still christs blood streamed in the firmament that would have been sufficient to glaze with the terror of utter and ultimate defeat those dying eyes see where christs blood stream is the firmament colin muttered the words to himself they came he remembered now from the last scene in marlowes faustus just before the stroke of midnight on which mephistopheles came to exact the payment of faustuss soul that to faustus had been the ultimate anguish and what if it had been so too to him who now lay in the locked room downstairs colin shrank from that thought even as dennis had shrunk from the terror of his nightmare it was better to suppose that there had come to the man some fresh intuition into the power of evil and that in the panic of his eyes was the knowledge that his time was come and that he was eternally consigned to the protection of what he had worshipped at that so easily the flesh might quaver in the dissolution of the body from the spirit that in comparison was a comforting thought he felt himself at home there and not afraid he himself had chosen evil for his good and hell surely could be no other than the eternal severance of the soul from god it was physical terror merely that had distorted vincenzos face and with that thought there sprang up in him the desire to look on the dead once more and convince himself that there were imprinted on it just the tokens of this natural cowering before the face of death he had with him the key of the locked smokingroom where the body lay and now taking off his shoes so that his step should be noiseless he let himself out into the passage again the switch was to his hand just outside his door and at his touch the passage and the hall below flashed into light he paused after fitting the key into the door of the smokingroom the great portrait of old colin seemed to smile on him on the floor in front of it was the rug on which vincenzos body had sprawled it was crumpled into ridges where they had taken it up again he entered the deathchamber there on the sofa with its face covered lay the body and standing there beside it he told himself again what he had come to see namely the tokens of physical terror the shrinking of the flesh at the touch of death then he drew the covering away vincenzos eyes were closedperhaps the doctor had done that the face was perfectly composed and tranquil and looked younger than his years he did not seem to be dead it was more reasonable to think that he was asleep and the mouth slightly smiling suggested that he dreamed of happy affairs of friends of home in life there had been something a little sinister about his expression now he looked contented and kind colin covered his face again with a sullen spasm of misgiving he feared that tranquillity he hated the conjectured cause of it death had stamped that face with terror and something stronger than death had smoothed that terror out again he went upstairs had the events of the evening begun to get on his nerves spurring them to unreal imaginings perhaps it was normal that after death the face should grow tranquil again but its tranquillity was more disturbing by far than its distortion of terror had been chapter iv colin went into his wifes room early next morning and gave her his official version of vincenzos death they were both agreed that dennis should be told nothing of it and before the hour for the removal of the body came to await the inquest in rye he took the boy out for a final morning of rabbitshooting he had slept well and woke with nerves quieted and refreshed denniss ignorance too both of what had actually occurred and what was supposed to have occurred was in itself a healing to those troubled fancies of the midnight just as this warm april morning was healing in its physical tonic to his nerves indeed stanier had never seemed so tranquil and serene an abode of prosperous peace as now when he walked with this tall fair son of his along the terrace and up the wooded slope beyond the chapel where the ruby glass of the windows was penetrated by the gleaming sunshine and shone like a fire to be out of doors this morning was better than being within and better it was to walk in the warm wind than to breathe stale incense smoke below them the broad lake glittered and for a moment in a gap between the rhododendron bushes along the sluicewall the figure of the priest black against the vivid green of the youngleafed trees beyond came into sight and vanished again he had gone down there no doubt to do his part concerning the secret version of the events of the night colin was pleased to have caught that glimpse of him later when dennis had gone he would have to see him but just for the present he let all that concerned the drowning of slit cassock and cotta slip down into the depths of his mind even as those relics with the weight to sink them had dwindled into the darkness of the deep water where once raymond lay soon he would have to fish these problems and perplexities up again and discuss them with the priest but for an hour or two till dennis departed he would keep on the sunny surface of this windy morning there lay the house that he loved more than anything or anyone in the world he could almost fancy himself if this april day were only eternal being happy here as the deer were happy browsing on the fresh growth of spring time and letting that love of hate and of evil in his heart sink into quiescence even evaporate away would life lose all its effervescence without it supposing now that the whole history of the legend from its inception to his own passionate participation in it was a dream supposing it rolled away like those moving mists which an hour ago lay fleecy and thick over the plain and that with an opening of his eyes and a tranquil awakening he found himself just here mounting the steep slope with dennis chattering by him and the house gleaming rosyred below and that all which had given to him the thrill and the motive of life passed into unsubstantial nothingness so that even the memory of it was elusive and hard to capturewould he look forward over the coming years as over a desert featurelessness of barren sand the notion occurred to him for just long enough to frame itself into a definite mental question but the moment it presented itself like that he saw that any answer to it must be inconceivable simply because the question itself was so he could not with deliberation even frame the question for in itself it presupposed an obliteration of all that which consciousness implied he might as well ask himself what he would think about if his brain was incapable of thought he took dennis down to the station after lunch and on his return meaning to ask douglas to come to see him was told that he had already asked if he could do so and was waiting in his room he went there but had he met in a crowd away from stanier the figure that rose on his entrance he would scarcely have recognized it the mans upright athletic carriage was bowed and bent he stumbled as he walked and the freshcoloured face was a drawn white mask so this was the diver with whose help he had to try to bring up to the surface the submerged burden of the night colin did not mind other people looking ill their weakness only emphasized to him his own superb health hullo he said you look rather poorly douglas i might almost say you look ghastly oh by the way i caught a glimpse of you this morning telling your beads no doubt down by the lake i take it then that youve done that little job is that so yes i did exactly what you asked me capital then all that remains for you is to realize that up till this moment you are not aware that anything unusual occurred so much so in fact that you must listen to a sad piece of news ive got for you listen my italian servant vincenzo had a sudden seizure shortly after midnight in the hall i had just rung my bell to tell him not to sit up and it appears that he was waiting for that he was in the hall in fact already he got up it would seem to come to this room here when a seizure took him and he fell i heard the noise of his fall and found him there and as one should never touch a man in a fit i telephoned for the doctor who said he was dead there will be an inquest which i shall have to attend sad news isnt it i shall miss him i thought i had better tell you any questions to ask well take your sympathy for granted colin moved quietly about the room as he spoke he lit a cigarette and pointed to a chair and now that ive taken that off your mind he said let us discuss something quite different look at me douglas and tell me in your capacity as spiritual expert black and white what happened last night or rather what caused that which we both saw the priest raised his eyes to colin terror deep and still as a summer sea gleamed and darkled in them the words came slowly at first for his twitching mouth stammered as he spoke i can tell you what happened he said just at the moment when evil and defiance were mounting in a blaze of triumph in his soul he saw god there is nothing else that can account for it if he had seen satan himself would the terror that smote soul and body asunder have come to him he might have fallen in a trance of adoration but what cause would there have been for terror there was cause only for ecstasy but was that ecstasy which you and i saw on his face i tell you it was the despair of final defeat he was at the mercy of him whom he had made his enemy as i raised my hands in consecration god came was it the infection only of that mute panic in the priests eyes that caused colins heart to beat suddenly small and quick and his hands to grow cold that occurred to me he said there was a moments silence the clock ticked and just outside the window a thrush sang colin made a violent effort with himself he attacked his fear driving it before him were rotten satanists you and i he said we ought to be ashamed of ourselves as i tell you that idea did occur to me but i was without knowing it overwrought last night and excited i too when i saw that terror in his face thought that the sight of god alone merciful and pitiful could have caused it and i thought so even more strongly when half an hour later i looked at his face again and saw it was quiet and serene but i neednt go into that what i intend to do now and for ever from this moment is to put that notion away it doesnt matter if you put it away or not said the priest it is true colin made that silent effortless relaxation that opening of his heart to the power that he loved and served which is the essence of prayer he had just to remain like that till it began to tingle and throb within him till he was charged and brimming with it soon he spoke of course the ways of god are inscrutable he observed but i dont take the slightest interest in them of course hell win in the end somehowits such a score to be omnipotent but it isnt the end yet im going to have a good long run for my money first besides the notion is quite illogical it doesnt hold water you were the principal culprit last night werent you why in the name of justice werent you bagged instead of vincenzo i wish to god i had been said the priest now will you explain why because i am in hell this pleasant room asked colin the priest got up cant you understand he said vincenzo has been conquered he has made his submission he saw the truth of what he denied and mocked it was made real to him in some manner inscrutable to us and if that was the end of life it was the end of hell also oh i thought hell was eternal said colin every moment holds eternity said the other millions of years multiplied by millions of years are no nearer eternity than the millionth part of a second eternity isnt quantity it is quality something shone on colin at that as from an immense distance over stormy water there shines some steadfast beam from a harbour light instantly his whole will strong in the power that possessed it mocked and derided ah fine durable quality he said that abyss of terror in the priests eyes was veiled for a moment yes the quality of god he said nothing else but it exists at all colin stretched himself in his chair oh damn he said quietly im sure i beg your pardon douglas but when i try to impart a little lightness to your solemn gibberish you flop back again let us quit theology or demonology or whatever were talking aboutim sure i havent the slightest idea what it isand be a little more practical now i hear you asked to see me what did you want to say i wanted to tell you that i am leaving stanier today said douglas colin raised his eyebrows thats rather sudden isnt it he said yes its very sudden what happened last night was sudden and what it wrought in me and so im to be left without mymy librarian at a moments notice said colin it would make no difference if i stopped said douglas i could never do my office again colin laid his hand on the priests shoulder and put into his manner all the whining charm which was his my dear fellow he said you mustnt think that im unsympathetic youve had a frightful shock and it has absolutely upset your nerves it has had no effect on mine as you see but i quite understand that youre all abroad today now take a complete holiday for a month and dont go near thethe library were having a divine spring may is delicious down here and then after a month youll find youre yourself again douglas shook his head i couldnt possibly stop here he said well then go out to capri for a month or so the villa is at your disposal and of course youll be my guest though i shant be there that is kind of you said douglas but i couldnt do that either i must go but i cant permit it said colin youre part of stanier now a very important part too why its through you that old colins original designs are complete i built the chapel he planned before he turned traitor but whats the use of a chapel without a priest its no more than an empty picture frame last night was very upsetting i quite grant you that but for a fit of the nerves you mustnt break up the very shrine of staniers hidden life do you suppose it was chance that caused us to meet why weve often agreed it was the most miraculous design you cant smash it up like that take a holiday by all means but you must come back i cannot stop here and i can never come back here said douglas the placehow shall i say itis saturated colin moved a step away from him i think your attitude requires explanation he said is capri saturated too douglas faced him my attitude is perfectly simple he said for twelve years the worship of evil has been my spiritual life and last night my eyes were opened to what i have been whether i can find salvation i dont know but what i can do is to hate and loathe myself and break off all connection with those who are as i have been ah now were getting at it said colin the saturation you speak ofi am the saturator i perceive is that it yes you and the evil which you worship colins blue eyes were still smiling and kind i think youre inconsistent he said shouldnt the zeal of the convert inspire you to missionary work a brand plucked from the burning ought surely to want to spoil the fire by pulling out another brand douglas hesitated i am afraid he said not of me asked colin yes you have a power for evil that is terrible the legend is true i cant stand up against you and yet go on said colin its this and these are my last words to you i have watched you this last month and you have changed at least there is the shadow of change over you till last night you have never come to the chapel and last night i could feel that you felt no true devotion if i could hope to assist that change i might stop but it has nothing to do with me you have let love approach you dennis he loves you as you know very well and there is something in you crush and throttle it as you will which goes out to him colin suddenly shot out his hand at him never not even in the days of raymond had he known so blistering and undiluted a stream of hate flood his soul this man with whom he had been knit in the worship of evil not only had thrown it and him aside but he had seen and spoken of that which like a disgrace he had tried to cover up and excuse from himself thats enough he said and let me tell you that you never spoke words more illadvised for your purpose than these its the truth in them that damns them do you think i dont know that as well as you and dont you see that if anything was wanted to encourage me to root that change out of my heart it would be that you you trembling renegade should tell me of its shadow lying on me he came close up to him again there was not much of a smile in his eyes now and he spoke with a cold and deadly concentration i know that ive been weak he said and its a tonic youve given me for my weakness therell be no more complaint of my lack of fervour what has frightened you has put resolve and courage into me you and your truckling submission why i shall hear of you teaching in a sunday school next perhaps youd like dennis to come and sit under you ill wring the weakness out of my heart as you wring the last drop of moisture from a wet cloth and out of denniss heart ill pluck the weeds of love and plant the flowers of hate there thick as the spring daffodils on the hillside colin broke off suddenly go away he said while you have time if you stop here youll see something that will curl you up like vincenzo it wont be the face of god but it will be something you cant bear youre trembling in every limb now by god therell be two inquests instead of one if you stop here youre afraid of me as you said and thats very prudent of you how the power surged and foamed through him it was like fire and wine in his veins buoyant and intoxicating i would kill you now he said except for the fuss and bother that would involve me in theres one mysterious death to be investigated already and you may thank your luck that it is so it was true enough that douglas had shrunk before him holding up his arm as if to ward off some impending blow but now he suddenly straightened himself up as if new force had nerved him and in the strength of that he stood steadfast and unafraid before the power that flickered in colins eyes i was afraid of you he said but it was my blindness that made me afraid now de profundis i call on god whom i have mocked at and defied but in whom you believe just as i do i daresay you could kill my body for that is mortal it is weak with sin and defilement but against me you are powerless as hate in the presence of love you know that yourself and one day you will be conquered and make your submission too you will go down into hell as i have done and find that god is there also he waited a moment watching now without dismay the furious impotence of the others face but no word came from colin and presently he moved to the door goodbye lord yardley he said and god will have mercy on your soul in spite of you colin stood where he was hearing douglass steps pass across the gallery and into the hall his fingers still twitched with rage he felt himself charged and crackling with the friendly power and he had no doubt in his own soul that by the mere exercise of his will he could have brought to bear some disastrous force on the man who had just quitted him that should exhibit itself in illness or misfortune or in ways more swift and terrible and yet though the mere opening of the sluice of pentup evil would have done it and though with every conscious fibre of him he hated and wished evil he did not do it for what might happen to douglas was a side issue not worth pursuing and as regards the main issue namely his souls abhorrence of the power in whose name douglas had withstood him he knew that he was defeated already he had come up against something that did not fight him nor strive against him it merely stood there patient and pitiful serenely existing he confessed defeat but he did not acquiesce in it rather it stirred in him as he had said to douglas a more determined antagonism and took him farther than ever from any notion of submission but douglas was right in saying that there was a breach in his defences and that in the breach stood dennis boyish and smiling and clad in that armour of love and innocence somehow he must be stripped of that and wounded and driven away from the crumbling wall of colins defences else he would never be able to repair it of course the boy was not conventbred he was no pious barleysugar little saint but a highspirited vigorous fellow with a good leaven of mischief and boyish naughtiness but that was nothing his armoured innocence lay in his utter lack of the love of evil when it came near him in the abstract he choked and shuddered at it instinctively recoiling dennis had no notion of hate of the desire to hurt the rudiments of cruelty that bramble full of thorns and red fruit which when it has taken root in the soul spreads over it quicker than any other lust and chokes and stabs to death any growth that impedes it had no existence in him he liked enjoying himself and there perhaps lay the seeds of selfishness but selfishness was a negative quality compared with the other and there more impregnable yet the very breastplate of denniss armour which covered his heart was his propensity for love colin knew that in these three weeks of his easter holidays he had made a sad mess in attempting to use that as a weapon in his own hand he had thought that by making dennis attached to himself he would be able to influence the boy to his own ends and lay his soul open for the introduction of that which he intended to implant there but a strangely miscalculated result had ensued easily indeed by the exercise of that charm which was his to command had he won the boys heart but by some mischance of carelessness he had let denniss love ooze into himself that leak must be stopped up as it was his house of hate was not impervious to those soft april rains why was it he wondered that dennis penetrated like this whereas violet whose love for him still lived could make no entrance he could sit so to speak in the window and watch her streaming on the pane and never a drop come in but dennis dripped from the roof and entered through chink and cranny was it that with violets love there was mingled fear of him and horror which cloyed its power of penetration whereas dennis was pure limpid water dennis had neither fear nor horror of him he had clung to him in the midnight hour of his fear as to a rock and a sure defence unknowing that it was from there that he was assailed and that he fled to him from whom he was fleeing there was love in all its innocence and its awful power above all then he must kill denniss love for him the weapon he had thought to forge out of that had only been turned against himself and at the same time it was in itself denniss chief protection dennis loved no one colin was sure as he loved him and there was his cuirass of security which must be hammered into fragments which should pierce and wound him until he drew them out of his own breast and cast them from him as poisoned things which were the origin of all his woe yes that damned douglas was right thought colin and im grateful to him for warning me ill see to it he sat there a few moments longer then ejected the topic from his mind altogether and for distraction moved across to the window the superb and luminous afternoon was already near its close and the tide of clear shadow was creeping up the terrace below the lake reflecting the sky was a mirror of steely blue beyond the plain was dim with the mists rising from its intersecting dykes its further edge and the line of the sea which bounded it had vanished altogether for a sea fog hung over the channel and was slowly drifting inland towards sunset in the chill of evening following on warm days like this it often spread right across the plain opaque and impenetrable covering it completely and like a sea lapped round the lower edges of the higher ground turning its contours into bays and headlands the hill of rye rose above it like an island and the tops of any tall trees in the plain would float like derelicts on its surface but it submerged the featureless flat beyond and till it dispersed again with a rising wind or the warmth of dawn it was bewildering and blinding and a man caught by it unawares where there was no path to guide him might lose his bearings altogether and wander half the night in aimless circles over pastures perfectly familiar to him tonight reinforced by the moisture rising from the dykes the dense mist spread very rapidly and even as colin watched the whole plain vanished before his eyes from the sea the foghorns were already hooting with hollow longdrawn wails colin turned from the window the luminous west had grown pale and this march of the shadows and the mists was rather a dreary spectacle but within it was scarcely better two days ago at this time the house had been seething with life and the fancydress ball was yet to come then yesterday morning the guests had all gone but there was still dennis here and what a festival they had made of his last day then had come that midnight catastrophe of which the sequel had been the scene which he had just gone through and the departure of douglas that was over and there was no object to be served by brooding upon it but above all it was the absence of dennis that contributed to this mood of slack purposelessness which was so unusual with him only this morning as he trudged up the slope with the boy for the silly rabbitshooting he had taking himself unawares fancied that he could be content to expunge all that had given the zest and alacrity to life and browse here animallike so long as he was at stanier and stanier was his here he was at stanier but for some reason mists chilly and obliterating had crept up round it penetrating everywhere surely they had come before they were dueit was not evening with him yet but broad noon and many years must pass before for him the sun set and the frost of death came on him and dennis plucked the reins from his nerveless hands for a moment he let himself visualise what manner of impotence would be his at that hour just the power of hate would be left him he thought and even the red of that would be fading like the sunset outside into the grey encompassing mists but surely as long as one touch of colour remained there he would be hating the very existence of stanier because it was his no longer but denniss and hating dennis for the dawning pride of his ownership how would he long then to summon some cataclysmic force which would annihilate heritage and heritor alike what worse torment could there be for those uncharted aeons that should follow than to be condemned to exist unseen and unheard here where he stood now and be actively aware of dennis in possession with sons growing up who would inherit after him while he himself drifted impalpably about surrounded by the warmth of life which yet could not thaw that icecold bubble that contained his consciousness he must school himself to think of dennis enjoying all that had been torn from him already dennis was his potential foe his supplanter it was time to eject these comfortless imaginings all that he need retain of them was this new conception of dennis for that surely might prove an antidote to affectionand he went out of his room into the long gallery where violet all alone was seated at her teatable she put down the book she was reading as he sauntered up anyone dining tonight he said or are you and granny and i going to spend a quiet evening of domestic bliss she poured him out his cup of tea we shall be alone as far as i know she said would you like to ask mr douglas colin paused that subject was one of those he had meant to put away from him but she should have it if she liked douglas has gone he observed gone asked she yes i said gone didnt i said colin to spare you any more questions i dont know where hes gone because he didnt tell me sometimes i thought he would be rather a good tutor for dennis in his holidays a little later on he just glanced at violet and saw she had understood but thats all over now he continued i shall have to conduct denniss holiday education myself yes the atmosphere of stanier didnt suit douglas he was impolite enough to say that it was saturated with me and that he couldnt bear it for a moment longer youre delighted i suppose arent you i saw very little of him said violet as you know i didnt like him how very unchristian of you what was the fault you found with him i dont think we need go into that said she how reticent you are darling he said sad isnt it that theres so little mutual confidence and trust between us i wonder if youre glad that vincenzo has gone too would you feel inclined to come to the inquest with me and say that vincenzo was a lovable godfearing fellow who had nothing on his mind no fears no worries she looked at him with a sudden spasm of alarm colin what do you mean she said he didnt kill himself he liked producing that look of terror in her eyes he liked playing with her fears of course i havent told you what really happened he said for as you know i am always considerate and should hate to shock you perhaps i will tell you sometime but suicide no it wasnt suicide theres a little puzzle for you violet to occupy your leisure now that the duties of a hostess no longer take all your time vincenzo dies very suddenly one night and douglas finds he cant breathe the same atmosphere as me next day ah i guess what youre conjecturing but its wrong i wasnt the cause directly or indirectly of vincenzos death what a mind youve got darling to let that suspicion ever peep into it colin spoke with a soft deliberation he was like a great purring cat with a mouse between his paws you did think that you know he said just as you still think that i had well lets say the tip of a finger in poor pamelas death altogether i feel rather lonely and deserted this afternoon here are you with dark suspicions about me and then my old friend douglas has gone and my old servant he was a friend too vincenzo has gone and then dennis has gone and all within twentyfour hours he put down his cup and sat down on the rug by her feet clasping his knees and i find so little sympathy he said i believe youre not sorry that douglas and vincenzo have gone and i wonder i really do wonder whether youre sorry that dennis has gone there was a fiendish ingenuity violet suspected at the bottom of this question how well he divined her mind how like him as if he was some deft conjurer to guess what was in it why i miss dennis most awfully she said the house seems dead without him colin smiled yes very pretty and madonnalike he said but that wasnt what i asked you i asked you if you were sorry dennis had gone thats a direct question enough cant you answer it directly she rose with all her nerves on edge but that would never do if she was to reach colin at all with the love that was the only efficient power she had she must eradicate her fear of him brushing aside all that she shuddered at for that cramped and clogged her movement towards him the question is direct enough she said but i cant give you a direct answer youve made the boy devoted to you thats beyond question and sometimes ive been afraid and wished he was not here but then ive wondered whether i havent misjudged you altogether dennis is just as sweet and innocent as he has always been and then ive asked myself whether you havent begun to love him oh colin if thats only so you know i would give my life for that colin jumped to his feet if you think im going to listen to your damned sentimental maunderings he said youre awfully mistaken dennis is devoted to me that is perfectly true i effected that for two reasons one which concerns you was in order to cut you out dear violet ive done that and ive seen how youve writhed with jealousy once or twice under the knowledge the second reason was more important i made dennis love me in order that i might have unbounded influence over him for as youve often told me love is infinite in power no wonder you were afraid but as a matter of fact i havent used that influence over him in the way that you expected and now perhaps this will be a relief to you im going to change my tactics i dont like love you know im going to make dennis sorry he loved me he hasnt yet seen me with anyshall we call it with any clarity of vision so important for a boy to form habits of accurate observation he must get to dislike love too because it wounds him and makes him bleed there spoke the very spirit and essence of wickedness and yet violet felt that it struggled for utterance fighting its way to his lips his purpose was plain but there was something which contested it an impediment that threatened its free exercise he so she guessed was aware of it too for though he had never been in more deadly and bitter a mood never swifter with those characteristic gibes that pierced and stung she felt that there was an effort about them as if the bow that shot them had to be strung again and again instead of being always ready in superficial and trivial ways also in the days that followed that struggle whatever it was seemed to manifest itself in strange little indecisions which irritated him and made him unlike himself one day for instance he would tell her that connubial solitude with an immortal grandmother thrown in was too delicate a form of happiness and that he would go up to london that afternoon and an hour later he would have changed his mind and told her to ask down a party for the weekend then before she had done that he would change his mind again and say that he wanted nobody and spent the day rambling about the park or in this hot spell of may weather bathing and basking by the lake another day he started off to drive to eton and see dennis to whom he had promised an early visit but when that evening she asked him how dennis was he told her he had not been there they were at dinner just the three of them when he rapped this out at her and it roused in old lady yardley some dim disordered train of thought for she began to speak in that level monotone which came out of her twilight mists yes much wiser much wiser she said let there be no force not even persuasion let him come to it naturally it is bred in the bone do not make him drink of the spring he will be thirsty someday and then he will go to it colin turned sharply round go to what granny he said what do you mean what are you talking about aha i am talking of what i know and what you know we talk in parables that are plain to us he knew toothat man who never comes here now yes and yet another they have both gone only colin and i are left now and the chapel is empty she stopped as suddenly as she had begun and rose leaning on her sticks but all through these days while spring every hour was weaving fresh embroideries some black pattern was being worked stitch by stitch so violet felt into colins heart sometimes the needle was nimbly plied and then despite herself she shuddered at the depths that lay beneath the bright surface of his gaiety for it was when some black business within went well that his mood was sunniest such was the case when he came back from the inquest held on the body of vincenzo there was an autopsy he told her and though they rummaged about so dr martin told me with great thoroughness they could find no cause of death whatever visitation of god that was all they could make of it and i daresay they were quite right he was like enoch apparently he was translated i wonder how vincenzo would bear translation i wonder what he was translated into it was difficult not to shudder at that colin dont talk like that she said youre terrible terrible why i didnt translate him and then i gave my evidence and we were all very polite and complimentary and bowed at each other with respectful and mournful little smiles i told them just what i told you and they all agreed i had acted with great wisdom and prudence that was quite true they had no idea how true that was and then we all bowed again likelike a minuet by the way have you made anything of that little puzzle i set you about the departure of douglas following so closely on the death of vincenzo and the reason he gave for it violet made no reply your manners are getting very bad darling said colin i asked you a civil enough question now heres another queer thing both the doctor and his assistant noticed a very curious smell about the frail earthly tabernacle of poor vincenzo what do you think that was youll never guess so ill tell you there was a strong odour of incense now where can that have come from i could throw no light on it can you she got up colin supposing i told them there was more about vincenzos death than they know she said ah thats a great idea what fun write an anonymous letter to the coroner and what will you say it was that they dont know i thought that information about the incense might interest you consider it in connection with the puzzle another day it seemed as if things did not go well with the black embroidery for he was savage and silent then it was she guessed that something was struggling with him for its existence and that he stabbed at it and tried to strangle it yet such days lashed by blasts of his bitter tongue were more welcome to her than those on which he was smiling and content and in harmony with himself as these weeks of may went by violet saw more and more clearly that she had no significance for him at all and it was just that which gave the days their unspeakable tension sometimes she was the butt of his irony sometimes he completely disregarded her but whichever it was he was not concerned with her she was just the traditional stanier wife whose duty it was to provide an heir after that she might freeze he knew she loved him he knew she feared him and he was quite indifferent to both it was dennis round whom all his thoughts and all this strange hidden contest centred and unerringly she knew who were the combatants now beginning to come into touch with each other on the one side was all that the legend stood for the love of hate and the hate of love colin all his life had been an apt pupil in that deadly school perhaps no such scholar as he had ever graduated there already he had tried to use love as an instrument of corruption and he had failed and changed his plan now he was out to kill love and in command of the black panoply he was arraying himself to fight against a young boy who stood there unaware that there was anyone but the father he adored coming to meet him he had no defence except love and yet was there a traitor in the very heart of his foes and she had to stand aside and watch of what use was it to warn dennis what form could that warning take all he knew was that it was his father coming to him if she could somehow throw herself between them colin would pass on over her indifferent scarcely even aware of her one thing only perhaps she could do and that was to stamp out her fear of him for the only effect of fear was to paralyse thus then dimly and mistily was the new situation forming but it would not present itself like that it would take shape when dennis was home again in daily domestic ways in ways cunning and cruel in ways perhaps affectionate and winning but they would all contribute to the end in view chapter v the eton term came to an end in the last week of july and dennis found that by leaving at some timeless hour he could get down to stanier by the middle of the morning the idea was irresistible for there would be time to have an hour or so bathing with his father before lunch and keep the afternoon intact and so though the original plan had been to lunch with aunt hester and tipped and gorged go on to stanier afterwards he telegraphed to her that he had to go straight home and sent a second telegram to his father to say that he would arrive at rye at halfpast eleven he knew that colin was there for his mother had written to him a day or two before to say they had left london and were at stanier the heat of the day promised well for the pleasure of diversions such as bathing and the addition of excited anticipation made dennis strip off his coat when he had got into his train from london and turn up his shirt sleeves to the elbow these long summer holidays with an extra week at the end in honour of a certain royal visit to the school contained an eternity of joys not only was there stanier to look forward to but that visit to capri with his father which had been promised him as the train neared rye he hung out of the window to catch the first sight of the house glowing among its woods there was just a glimpse of it with its flag flying on the tower and then the trees hid it again and he must bounce across to the other side of the carriage to see his father standing on the platform and wave to him he would be there to meet him as certainly as stanier was waiting for him on the hill the platform was rather full and dennis was still searching for colin when the train drew up he descended with arms full of agreeable impedimenta and then the very natural explanation of colins absence occurred to him without doubt he had driven down in the little twoseater and was waiting for him outside he went through the gate of egress but in the stationyard there was no twoseater nor any other conveyance from stanier again an explanation was easy his telegram had not yet been delivered this was not quite the ecstasy of arrival that he had anticipated but it was entirely his own fault the cab laboured up the long hill and jogged very sedately along the level up to the lodgegate at this rate he could traverse the short cut on foot more quickly than this deliberate quadruped would make the detour getting out at the lodge he struck across its park arriving at the house before the cab came within sight he ran through the hall and burst into his fathers room but the room was empty there was his mother anyhow in a shady corner of the garden below the terrace and he hailed her and next moment was running down the steps and leaping the flowerbeds she rose to meet him and caught him to her close and clinging dennis darling she said this is lovely and oh my dear what a heat youre in i know i ran across the park and got here before the old cab and wheres father he started an hour ago to drive up to london oh how rotten i think thats beastly of him and didnt he get my telegram to say i was coming this morning violet hesitated yes dear he did get it she said he thought that having said you would come in the afternoon you ought to have kept to your first plan dennis looked impartially at this verdict i suppose i ought he said but as i found i could get here earlier of course i did and so he scored off me by making me come up in a cab and going away himself when will he be back some time today late perhaps he thought denniss sun was very certainly clouded but sufficient brightness remained to illuminate a pleasant day there was a bathe before lunch and violet took him to play golf after a slight demur over the chance of his father arriving during their absence and there was tea on the terrace and a stroll through the woods with his gun all these things had been rapturous in anticipation and though nothing could quite rob them of their honey it was not of that transcendent order well did violet understand that and well she understood why colin had suddenly settled to go up to town that day then came dinner where his place was laid but unoccupied and old lady yardley groping in the twilight which was darkening round her now thinking that this was colin back from school now asking where colin was but still he did not come and about eleven dennis visibly perturbed and depressed and his mother went up to bed and youre sure he hasnt had an accident he asked yes darling quite sure you mustnt think of that a bright idea struck dennis oh mother somebody must sit up for him to let him in he said maynt i no dear i know he wouldnt wish you to go to bed darling and get a long night you were up early enough today dennis sighed well ive had a ripping day with you anyhow he said denniss room looked out on to the front of the house and before he got into bed he set his door ajar and the window wide so that by no chance could he miss the sound of his fathers arrival and without turning off his light sat propped up in bed prepared for any length of vigil for in spite of the daylong disappointments he was sure that colin would look in on him when he came and it would never do to miss that conference there were millions of things to tell and be told but better than any would be the fact of his fathers presence sitting here on his bed and after ever so long a talk wishing him good night and leaving him to fall asleep with the sense of him still lingering in the room it was not long before he heard the crunch of the gravel beneath the wheels of the motor and he jumped out of bed to look out of the window and call to him but they had been equally quick in letting him in and dennis had no more than a glimpse of him standing in the oblong of light from the open door before it closed again behind him but that was of no consequence he would be here immediately and dennis leaped back into bed the minutes passed but very likely colin would want something to eat after his drive from london before he came upstairs soon there came along the passage a step that dennis knew and his eyes sparkling with the imminent joy were fixed on his door to see it swing open but the steps stopped short before they reached it and another door a little way down the passage was opened and closed i suppose he thought it was very late and that i should be asleep said dennis to himself as he put out his light he slept late next morning and hurried downstairs to breakfast his father dressed in flannels with his hair still wet from his bathe was standing by the window opening his letters oh there you are at last said dennis springing to him colin gave him a rather absent hand hullo dennis he said hullo father i say how late you were last night and you never came to see me no i managed to curb my impatience till this morning said colin ooh sarcasm and have you been bathing why didnt you fetch me i didnt imagine you had forgotten your way down to the lake if you wanted to bathe dennis gave him one quick anxious glance there was something wrong perhaps the business in london yesterday had worried him or perhaps his father was vexed with him though it seemed very inexplicable about that matter of the train yesterday im sorry about my coming in the morning yesterday he said after i had told you the afternoon but i thought it would be so ripping to get here before lunch oh yes thats all right said colin absently at this moment violet came in and colins manner instantly changed ah vi darling he said there you are i got back very late last night for i thought i would dine with aunt hester she was quite delightful also quite astounding about eleven she went off to a dance in a short pink dress and a wreath of flowers she promised to come down here today and stop till i go to capri dennis pricked an ear at this oh when will that be father he said one of these days and then if she likes and you dont mind darling she can stop on here though i really believe she would like best to come to capri and disport herself like a small imperishable highlycoloured seanymph how she would astonish the islanders dennis gave a cackle of laughter at this picture best of all was the gay good humour in his fathers voice colin turned to him dennis she told me that you had promised to lunch with her yesterday he said and that you sent a telegram saying you had to get down here there was no compulsion on you to get down here that im aware of oh but i wanted to get down here so frightfully said dennis i see anything you want frightfully has to happen said colin and i suppose anything you want not to happen isnt allowed to but in spite of that next time you say youll go to see aunt hester and then throw her over at the last minute its just conceivable that something may happen which you dont like go and put your mothers plate down for her this was all bewildering but dennis did as he was told and having finished his breakfast came and stood by his fathers chair well what do you want asked colin sharply dennis flushed oh nothing he said dont hang about then you can go if youve finished your breakfast dennis had a spirit of his own and one thing was perfectly clear to him as he left the room namely that if his father did not want to be bothered with him he was not going to make any importunate requests for his companionship it was a horrid state of things but no doubt temporary he could parallel it by the bleakness which sometimes fell upon his housemaster at school for no apparent reason this paternal bleakness unknown in those last glorious easter holidays was of course far more depressing for it took all the colour out of life he was absolutely ignorant what cause of offence he had given throwing over aunt hester and coming by another train were clearly inadequate as the reason for it and all he could do while it lasted was to be prompt and obedient and above everything to spring to him whenever his sun should shine out again without any shadow of resentment or reserve this treatment was wounding and inexplicable but he must keep his hurt to himself and most certainly he must not go to his mother with querulous wonder as to what it was about it concerned his father and himself and nobody else it would be disloyal to his unshaken allegiance to make moan dennis had ample opportunity for loyalty in the next few days for he could do nothing right in his fathers eyes he scarcely saw him or had speech with him except at meals and then if he talked he was told not to jabber if he was silent he was asked why he was so sulky it was a heartrending and inexplicable affair and all the more puzzling because except with him colin was in his gayest and most entrancing mood aunt hester who apparently had not in the least minded denniss conduct received the most delightful welcome for an indefinite period and colin chaffed her and made much of her till she beamed again with violet he was the same only dennis had the power to check his geniality and cause him to rap out a reprimand of some kind in the evening the four of them with old lady yardley played their whist and he was left to amuse himself as he best could even then he could not escape censure if he watched them a dreary enough occupation he was asked why he didnt get a book and read a bit after his day of enjoyment if he read it was supposed that whist was too oldfashioned for the young generation to interest themselves in once aunt hester intervened let him read or look on as he likes dear she said to colin he can please himself surely on that occasion only colin was sharp with her dear aunt hester he said perhaps youd mind your own business were waiting for you to play and then after the dismal whist there was the dismal going up to his room with the knowledge that the door would not open nor his father look in and sit on his bed and make delightful plans for the next day a darker phase succeeded in the following week an eton friend came to stay and now at least there was someone to play with jim airedale was an engaging and goodlooking boy devoted to dennis and even in this eclipse the two of them with all the resources of stanier to chose from might entertain themselves with considerable enjoyment but all went more grievously for dennis than ever colin appeared to take a great fancy to his friend and at dinner on the day of his arrival talked to him delightfully with occasional interspersions of snubs for dennis no oneas dennis was bitterly awareknew so well the road to a boys heart he made jim at ease in a couple of minutes set him chattering in a couple more and it was a hilarious meal that followed after dinner he set dennis down to play that weary whist and took the other boy off to play billiards when the whist was over dennis joined them and marked for them then at bedtime colin took jim up to his room to see that everything was comfortable and lingered there talking while next door dennis halfundressed sat on his bed waiting for those merry sounds to cease when all was quiet he slipped out of his room to have a few words with jim and perhaps colin was waiting for that for as he passed his door it opened quietly and there his father stood hullo where are you going he asked something in dennis seemed to strain almost to breakingpoint at the cold hostility of his tone im just going to see jim he said well then you had better just go back to your room again said colin next morning he took jim off in the twoseater to play golfdennis would lend him his clubsand they came back late for lunch better friends than ever afterwards there was some rabbitpotting at which jim excelled and colin found occasion to say to dennis i wonder if youll ever learn to shoot like that and there were dreadful games of lawn tennis in which colin saying that he was the worst player of the four must play with jim against violet and dennis he really was the best so of course they won all this was sufficient to turn the boys head and jim became slightly condescending to his friend but when he said to dennis i say youre fathers pretty rough on you sometimes with the intention of being consolatory and friendly he found he had strangely miscalculated up went denniss chin rough on me he said what on earth do you mean hes perfectly ripping to me finally on the last evening of that nightmare week colin made it impossible for jim after a decent allowance of champagne at dinner to refuse a couple of glasses of port he became rather tipsy and when with a rolling eye and a menacing sense of rising nausea he hurried away to his room colin watched him go with a shrug of the shoulders nice sort of friends you bring to the house dennis he said that seemed to round off the visit very pleasantly colin was sitting up alone that night after the others had gone upstairs he had been more brutal than usual with dennis at dinner and for the first time he had seen dennis bite his lip obviously to keep tears back but in spite of all his pitiless persecution he knew that he was no nearer to the attainment of his purpose as far as dennis himself was concerned he had systematically and continuously hurt and wounded him in that attempt to which he was committed to kill his love but no failure could at present have been more complete often when the whip of his tongue had been cruellest and his cunning to hurt most diabolical he had looked at dennis saying well answer me cant you and dennis had raised to him troubled and bewildered eyes in which no spark of hate smouldered there was no meekness about dennis he could answer back with his head up quite unsubdued and unafraid but in vain colin looked for any sign that his love was ailing or like to die and occasionally when he relaxed and gave him a kind word love leaped sparkling to his eyes and his beautiful mouth what confirmed this impression was the pride of the boy for he never as colin knew uttered to his mother a single word of complaint or went to her for comfort little as colin knew of love he knew that here was the noble pride of love which would never admit failing or blemish in the object of its high affection colin opened the door on to the terrace and strolled out into the warm pregnant night there was something more indicative of failure than this impregnable loyalty of denniss and that was his own unchanged affection for the boy in every possible way that could be devised by his alert perceptive brain he had wounded and injured denniss heart and though there is no such royal road towards hate as to injure he had made no headway at all his devotion to hatred his vow to himself so faithfully kept to all that was evil had often made him bubble with secret glee to see dennis wince under those barbed attacks but all the time there existed that soft aching tenderness for him so easy to stifle but so impossible to smother like eternity as he had sneered to douglas it seemed of very durable stuff all this fortnights persecution had done nothing to break it up uninvited it had entered his heart and nothing could stir it he could act as if he had no other feeling for the boy than this contemptuous aversion but something ached the nightbreeze drew landward from the sea and sometimes it fell altogether and there was dead calm and again he heard its whispered approach in the trees by the lake and presently it flowed over the garden and streamed on to the terrace he tried as he so often had done to lay himself open to the spell that had woven the prosperity of stanier he thought of dennis heir to all its glories and possessor of them when he had gone from this world and at that the flicker of jealousy a strange offspring of love and hate shot up in his heart but supposing dennis died before he did would he sooner see him lying dead and know that he at any rate would never succeed to stanier and its magnificence or when death drew near to himself see dennis by his bedside and picture him assuming what was his to enjoy no longer on his deathbed surely he would entirely hate dennis and wish that he lay there in his stead at the end of the long faade there stood the chapel unused since douglass departure and colin going back into his room let himself into the corridor which led to it turning up the lights as he went he had not been there since the night of vincenzos death and now it seemed to him that if he sat and meditated there where so often he had made the consecration of himself to evil he could arrive at some clearer and conscious realization of it he told himself that he hated love and delighted in hate but no fervour warmed his creed in that sanctuary of satan the truth of that might shine more vividly on him and he might get rid of that fancy that denniss eyes eager and ready to kindle or sad but without reproach were watching him surely they would not follow him where dennis had never been colin sat quiet in his place looking at the altar the faint odour of incense still hung about but emotionally the place was dead he thought of vincenzo twitching and grinning as he knelt he thought of douglas lifting high the consecrated elements so soon to be a mockery and a derision but his mind gave no welcome or greeting to the remembrance well his deeds must atone for his lack of fervour and presently he rose and went back through the silent house and upstairs along the dimlit passage suddenly the desire came to him just to look at dennis the boy would certainly be asleep by now for he must have learned that it was not much good to keep awake on the chance of his father coming in to say good night he would just open the door turn on the light for a second and look at him and leave him he told himself he wanted to remind himself that the boy would inherit all that he now loved and enjoyed what he concealed from himself stuffing it away out of sight was that some human craving hungered for the sight of him dennis would be asleep he would get no pleasure from what he did not know colin opened the door quietly and saw the room was light and there was dennis sitting up in bed his face was bright with the unexpected surprise and he stretched out his arms there was something appealing and timid in the gesture oh father how ripping he said colin was helpless in the grip of that welcome he tried to frame his tongue to some chilling reprimand but none came dennis not asleep yet and your light on what does it mean he asked the boy broke out into a little bubble of a laugh why i always keep it on till i hear you go to your room he said why asked colin of course on the chance that youd come in as you always used to do i knew you would sometime jolly glad i kept it on oh come and sit down against his will and his purpose colin came up to the bed dennis wriggled aside to make room for him and put up his knees for him to lean against i cant stop said colin sitting down its fearfully late and youre a villain for being awake all right im a villain said dennis and you wait for me every night asked colin dennis nodded just then he could not trust himself to speak but his shining eyes spoke for him what shall we talk about asked colin just for a minute oh anything it doesnt matter a bit as long as its you at that moment colin was happy but he had hardly realized that before just as he had heard the nightwind coming up and whispering in the trees by the lake he knew that there was approaching the blast of hate and evil which he had tried to conjure up in the chapel he leant towards dennis put his arm round his neck and kissed him good night old boy he said i wont stop now sleep well ever so well said dennis colin clicked out the light and went to his room already his brain seethed with images of evil vivid and alluring and fierce at this treason of his they swarmed like a loyal garrison to that breach in his defences where dennis had stood and drove him off they urged colin to pursue to go back to the boys room to let loose on him their assault to defile and desecrate his innocence to show him the ecstasy of evil the charm of cruelty what matter if panic or horror made nightmare round him he would wake from them with new currents coursing in his veins new desires stinging him to their fulfilment where was the good of his being heir to the legend if he did not enter into his birthright fierce was the stress of that possession colin withstood it feeling that if he yielded the very bonds of sanity would be loosed if he went back to denniss room now he would go as a devil unchained ready and eager to perpetrate any spiritual outrage and desecration and who knew whether the very balance and poise of denniss being whom he had just left with all his serenity restored and the lamp of love bravely burning might not be upset altogether already he was scarcely in his own control and maddened to an invincible lust of evil by the sight of that tender victim he might let himself cross the boundary which separates the territories of human life from the untamed welter and chaos of prodigious forces which both threaten and maintain it he had served satan all his life alike in spirit and in works and would serve him still but while this stress which seemed like some dervish possession was on him he could not trust himself with dennis something of irremediable violence might happen some fatal laceration of the fibres of the boys soul the crisis passed leaving him conscious only of immense fatigue there had been a struggle not between himself alone and this satanic power but between it and something in himself but not of himself which opposed it he was too tired to think any more and throwing off his clothes sank into the dark of dreamless sleep he slept late and waking brought with it a certain incredulousness at his memory of the night before what had happened seemed buried at any rate under deep layers of consciousness so that he could not handle and examine it much more accessible was the memory of his weakness in going in to dennis at all whatever fruits might have ripened from this fortnights harshness to the boy were certainly frostbitten now for dennis knew and hugged himself to know that below these bleak cruelties the father he loved existed still it was a foolish thing to have done not only for that reason but because he had weakened himself in allowing that spasm of affection to assert itself but it is never too late he thought to mend foolishness by wise courses dennis had finished breakfast when he got down and he heard from violet that he had gone for a morning in the water leaving an urgent message for his father to follow and the boys radiant this morning she said he told me you came into his room last night and were ripping so he said colin was busy at the side table oh what else did he say he asked just that i am glad you did it that couple of minutes made him forget all the woes of these holidays ah hes forgotten about them has he said colin absolutely theyve vanished oh yes he wondered if i knew when you and he were going to capri i said you hadnt told me i shall go tomorrow but how it concerns dennis i dont know unless as is highly probable hes glad to get rid of me but arent you taking him asked violet you promised to take him did i well now i promise you not to entirely for your sake of course darling youll love having him here to yourself youll be able to make up lost ground now i dont want to hear anything more about capri ill tell dennis myself why should i drag a brat like that about with me before long colin strolled down to the lake there was denniss yellow head far out on the water and his browned arms glistening with wet lifting themselves alternately as he surged back to the shed by the time colin had come to the smooth turf that margined the lake he had got to land and stood kneedeep in the shallow water slim and shining with an aprilface of happiness he gave a great whoop of welcome when he saw his father hurrah father he said you have been quick the waters lovely lets bathe and lie about all morning oh i say i was diving just now and found an awfully funny thing in the mud at the bottom looks as if it was lace of sorts catch dennis picked up a sodden grey ball which he had put on the bank and threw it at his father at the moment colins attention was attracted by some waterfowl swimming at the far end of the lake and denniss missile wet and muddy hit him full in the face oh im sorry said dennis i thought you were looking the missile had fallen at colins feet and he saw at once that it must be the lace cotta which had been torn off vincenzos body at the sight a horde of recollections drove in upon him once more vincenzo twitched and grinned and the incense smoked those instincts of hate and cruelty which had dozed last night in the chapel leaped up brighteyed and snarling then too this recovered relic had splashed him the mud slimy and evilsmelling had dropped on to his white coat dennis youre a damned nuisance he said ill teach you to behave what the devil do you mean by doing that he plucked two lithe shoots of willow from a tree that grew by the waters edge and stripped off the leaves come out he said and stand here with your back to me dennis looked at his father and saw blind rage and fury in his face as he peeled the willow wands im awfully sorry father he said youll be sorrier in a minute come here im going to give you six of the smartest cuts youve ever had it hurts more when youre wet dennis stepped out of the water and stood where his father pointed and four strokes savagely delivered fell across his shoulders he stood perfectly steady gasping a little at the burning sting of them as colin slashed at him he felt an exultant glee that at last he was hurting him to some purpose he had spoiled the effect of his fortnights cruelty by that concession last night this should start him afresh with no apostasy to follow he saw the red crisscross of the strokes and the weals rising on the boys skin with some such ecstasy of satisfaction as he had seen pamela standing in his room one night at capri and then in the middle of this chastisement he knew he could not strike dennis again that will do he said turn round dennis turned and looked him straight in the eyes in spite of the sharpness of the pain his face was in perfect control his mouth was just a little compressed and once more colin knew that he had failed for he saw there pain and bewilderment mute reproach but of fear not a trace nor yet of hate with regard to himself he had failed also for he had been literally unable to finish the punishment he had promised and now he wanted to put his arm round denniss neck and kiss him and tell him that he knew what a devil he was and beg the boys forgiveness the very consciousness of that failure made him rage again well did you like that he said it hurt i expect yes said dennis why dont you cry then asked colin i dont choose to colin sat down on the grass and lit a cigarette well theres another pleasure in store for you he said im going to capri tomorrow and your mother says you think youre coming with me thats an error on your partthats all yes said dennis again he walked to where his clothes lay on a bench and began dressing arent you going on with your bathe asked colin it will take the sting out no father ive finished said dennis colin began taking his clothes off going to sulk i suppose he said but please yourself smarting of skin but far sorer at heart dennis walked quietly off when he had dressed and skirting the lake went up along the brackencovered slopes of the park that looked out over the marsh he longed to confide in his mother and ask if she could account in any way for this pentecost of trouble which the holidays had brought and which had culminated in this thrashing but in spite of the comfort she might have brought from the mere knowledge of her sympathy he could not tell her of that not because it was a humiliation to him but because it was a disgrace to his father and that must never be known to her the offence which provoked it was no cause at all in the easter holidays he might have done that until seventy times seven and his father would only have laughed and called him a little devil and thrown the missile back at him and the same policy of repression must be preserved about his other woes in whatever manner his father treated him that was an affair that concerned themselves alone mere manliness forbade him to go whimpering to anybody and more stringent yet was the prohibition that his own love for his father enjoined on him it was impossible to complain he had got to shoulder his own burden whatever injustice and harshness had laid it on him he waded through the waisthigh bracken with the scuttle of rabbits about him there were patches of bare turf between the clumps of fern it was great sport to walk through the bracken with a gun and get a potshot at a rabbit that bolted across these clearings often had he done that with his father but today he had not the least inclination to fetch his gun he wanted only since speaking to his mother was out of the question to be alone and stare this intolerable state of affairs in the face and he sat down in one of these open spaces with the aromatic smell of the woodland round him and tried to focus it he smarted with the blows he had received and with the utter injustice of them but most of all his heart cried out against the virulent glee in his fathers face when he told him to turn round again and asked him how he enjoyed it if only he was like some other fellows at school who either disliked or just put up with their fathers he would merely have been angry at this abominable treatment and delighted that the beastly man was taking himself off tomorrow but dennis felt none of these natural sentiments in spite of these harshnesses he would rapturously have gone with his father to capri if that had been allowed unshaken in the faith which for a minute or two last night had been so joyfully justified that today or tomorrow his father would turn to him again and be ripping as noone else in the world could be but his fatherand what had he himself done to evoke this desolating displeasurehad altogether changed to him he disliked him and he wanted to hurt him and finely he succeeded as the sense of this bitter tragedy grew on him dennis could bear it no longer but rolled over on his face and for the first time in this awful fortnight sobbed with the pain of his wounded affection after a while he sat up again there was no earthly use in indulging in such sloppy tricks and pulling himself together he walked back to the house it was close on lunchtime and he made himself neat for fear of provoking sarcastic comments and sat in the gallery over a picture paper presently his mother and colin came in together well dear nice bathe she said to him yes mother jolly and warm he said she came over to his chair and leaned over him putting her hands on his shoulders dennis could not help wincing at that whats the matter darling she said nothing i scratched my back against a snag as i was bathing he said rather sore colin heard that and instantly he thought to himself now ill tell her that will humiliate him but on the heels of that came some sudden glow of pride at the staunchness of the boy he guessed that he said that not to spare himself but to spare him and as last night the yearning for him the affection he had not yet succeeded in killing pulled at his heart it was an unutterable relief to violet when next morning with charming farewells to her and aunt hester and with a nod to dennis colin drove off to catch his boat at folkestone she had ached and mourned over her boys misery but at the same time she had rejoiced in that reticence he had observed to her for there indeed was the banner of love flying bravely if he had struck that and come to her for comfort and with complaint indeed there would have been no matter for wonder but she delighted in the fact that he flew it still but it was good that colin was gone poor dennis had had a rotten time and she longed to give him pleasanter days naturally he had no inkling of the meaning of his tribulations of the significance that underlay them and she had no notion of telling him that in her belief a battle was going on that somehow centred round him in which he boyishly unheeding was standing his ground in the face of black and bitter assaults she knew well that it was not yet over nor yet nearly over he had but held his own and fresh assaults fiercer yet perhaps would come but just for the next few weeks there was truce and she was thankful for that the summer days passed on another schoolfriend came to stay with dennis and after him another and dennis seemed happy though no one could kindle in him that abandoned radiance which colin so easily lit colin had been away a month now and according to his plans would be back for denniss last week at home but one evening there came a letter to violet saying that he was intending to stop on in the island for another fortnight she read this to dennis as they sat together that night for a bedtime talk after old lady yardleys whist was finished and aunt hester had hurried away in horror of the lateness of the hour and the fear of missing her beauty sleep one piece of the letter was not for his ears colin asked if she was making up lost ground with dennis and supposed they had hatched plenty of conspiracies against him he also sent a message to dennis to say that he need not trouble to ink his fingers over writing to him as his letters were quite illegible violet thought it unnecessary to deliver that message but reading out the postponement of his fathers return she saw denniss face fall then i shant see father before i go back to eton he observed violet considered the dates no dear youll have gone back several days before he comes she said the cloud deepened on denniss face did father say anything about the letters ive written him he asked she laughed yes dear he did say something she said about their not being particularly easy to read no other message for me asked the boy violets heart began to ache for him lets see where have i got to she said wonderful vintage he says in the lovely hot weather theyre having hes been bathing all the morning and has had lunch and is going to sleep but no message for me persisted dennis violet finished the letter and tore it up there was a good deal about dennis though nothing for him but it struck her that these uncomplimentary comments were forced in one colin had first written the boy but had crossed that out and substituted the brat he had not thought of him as the brat originally the brat was the image under which he schooled himself to think of him the sentences had no spontaneous ring about them they expressed what he tried to feel she felt sure that her interpretation was no fanciful one dennis had accepted her silence to his repeated question and what else has he been doing he said dining out in the garden every night said violet and looking at them making the wine the garden is a good deal burned up with the heat nothing else the bathing takes half the day dennis crossed from the far side of the hearthrug and made a back for himself against her knees it sounds awfully ripping and lazy he said father loves it doesnt he i should have liked to have gone with him for a bit perhaps another year hell take you said violet she felt no sense of injury in the fact that dennis wanted to be out there with him rather than at home with her she thanked god that it was so that all these wretched days when his father had persecuted him had left no stain on the luminous brightness of his affection at all costs she wanted that to retain its shining quality even if dennis suffered he suffered in the cause of love if he had not loved his father he would have thought of him now as merely a very disagreeable person whose absence was a matter for congratulation but even now dennis wanted to be with him he was disappointed that his postponed return would rob him of a glimpse before he went back to eton i wonder if he will said dennis i wonder violet felt that the boy was on the verge of speech she drew him back against her knees encompassing his shoulders yes darling what do you wonder she said dennis drew a long breath i wonder what made father so beastly to me when i came home this time he said i cant think of anything that i had done i didnt mean to speak of it but but had i done anything mother no darling she said gently then its not my fault anyhow he said thats something oh lord i have thought about it so much so if its not me its something that has just got hold of father i wish it would let go he came up to my room one night you know and was just as he used to be i believe i believe hes fond of me all the time really what am i to do she wondered how near the truth he had come the words something has got hold of father i wish it would let go were extraordinarily apt but she could not tell him that his father loved hate and hated love and that in her belief love was beginning to assert itself against that black dominion to tell him that to speak of the legend and of the choice which colin had renewed for himself might spoil the instinctive simplicity with which dennis faced it all she could not tell him that his father had tried to corrupt him and failing there was trying to kill his love the truth baldly stated might easily produce in him if he understood it just that atmosphere of horror in which love gasped for breath dennis darling she said you can help your father in a way that nobody else can how said dennis quickly and whats it all about it doesnt matter what its all about she said but you can help him by doing just what you are doing go on loving him dear never let yourself cease loving him as if i could help doing that said dennis he was busy next morning he scribbled a long letter to his father and copied it out with extreme care no one could possibly say it was illegible chapter vi it was not until the first of the autumn shooting parties at stanier was nearly due that colin came back from his island and from then till early in december a succession of guests passed through sometimes he went up to town with the party that was leaving returning a few days afterwards with the new relay and then again he was busy with his duties as host sometimes he stopped here in the emptied house but even then violet was never once alone with him for any private talk he pointedly avoided all chance of this and on the only occasion when she had attempted to break this ring of his seclusion from her he had flamed into devilish anger oh for gods sake clear out he said if youve come for a hearttoheart talk youll know fast enough if ive got anything to say to you but i want to talk to you she said i havent seen you since you left here in august he gave her one furious glance youd better go he said dennis she knew wrote to him for sometimes she would see that laborious and legible script on one of his letters so different from the cursive scrawl which he gave her colin certainly read these but he never wrote to the boy and one day there came to violet at the end of one of denniss letters a postscript without comment father has told me not to write to him any more there was no reply to be made to that dennis had stated it without comment and without comment it had better remain for they understood each other on the subject which it concerned and yet for some reason which she could not justify and could scarcely even define violet felt that underneath the harshness of that injunction there lay not so much the desire to wound as the deliberate intention of so doing colin had sat down and thought of that it had not sprung from the open garden of his mind but had been reared with deliberate care it had not been derived from instinct but from craft that waspish little prohibition was no spontaneous product she might even regard it as a missile discharged not in offence but in defence and then he never spoke of dennis not once did the boys name pass his lips to her who knew him so well and had so often shuddered at what he was this carried the same interpretation he wanted no suggestion or reminder of dennis to come near him not even to her did he mention him though it was just here that she was most vulnerable to the taunts and gibes that wounded it was not like him to spare the most sensitive spot for fear of hurting her it was much more probable that somehow or other he was sensitive there himself and forbore from a contact at which he would have himself winced they were alone for a few minutes together one evening early in december old lady yardleys whist at which her nurse had made the fourth was just over these sepulchral games were now in the dimness that was falling ever duskier over her mind no more than the mere approximate symbol of a game she held her cards and played them quite fortuitously and smiled as she gathered the random tricks but after a few hands of this phantom game had been dealt and disposed of she was quite content when told that her two rubbers were over and that she had won them both though she would whimper in some vague distress if she thought she was not going to get her whist even colin had become now to her a shadow among shadows just occasionally some faint ray from her mind illuminated him but for the most part he was but a piece of that grey background ever receding of the visible world tonight however some thought of him quickened her just as she was being wheeled out of the room though all evening she had seemed unconscious of his presence for she turned in her chair and said my colin is coming back from eton before long and it will be well with stanier again colin had got up and was half way along the gallery on his passage to his own room leaving violet there but at this he came back and stood in front of the fire when does her colini suppose she means that brat of yours and minecome home he asked violet gave him the date some five days before christmas i suppose youve made a calendar as one used to do at school he sneered and tear the days off as they pass oh no i can remember without that said she there are eight days more and what happens at christmas he asked the usual intoxicating family gathering aunt hesters coming said violet and my mother very exhilarating observed colin then why dont you go to some friend for christmas if you feel like that said she theres no reason why you should be here with a handful of women there is if youll excuse my contradicting you he said i must make denniss christmas happy and joyful and after all i have a certain right to be at stanier if i like or have you planned to give dennis a taste of what it will be like to be master here when im out of the way just as my father gave you and me a taste of it one year after your discarded raymond was out of the way how well i remember that somehow raymond was still at cambridge and my father made you and me hostess and host at a big party before raymond came down perhaps youve counted on my absence at christmas knowing how exhilarating i find the company of my aunts and are asking a large party with dennis to play host sure you havent the question was too preposterous to need an answer and he continued i shall be here for christmas with your permission he said just to give dennis a treat you may have him alone a bit first andand tonic him up for so much pleasure he kept writing to me when i was in capri saying he wished i was here and that he was sorry i should not be back before he went to eton there was a sarcastic touch about that which made me laugh violet shook her head no youre wrong there she said there was nothing sarcastic about it he looked at her with a sort of malignant pity you make me feel sick sometimes he said with that sort of remark i suppose dennis thought it a positive joy to be thrashed by me you thrashed him said she do you really expect me to believe he hasnt told you that sneered colin and that you havent wept over me for it it doesnt matter to me whether you believe it or not said she dennis never said a word about it what had he done colin smiled nothing very particular and so you thrashed him that was brutal of you thank you for that kind word said he but i wish you wouldnt interrupt in the middle of a sentence i didnt thrash him for what he did but for what he was it was just on occasions like these when colin as now was in his most fiendish mood that she felt this sudden pang of compassion for him oh my poor colin she said thats what is the matter with you it isnt what you do its what you are the noble art of tu quoque remarked colin but its a rather meaningless art dont my actions express me pretty well i fancied i shewed myself fairly frankly to dennis in the summer no you only shewed him what youre trying to be said violet you shall explain that in a minute he said i was saying that i gave a sincere exposition of myself i hate dennis you see i hate the fact of his existence stanier will be his when ive gone to hell probably the knowledge of that will be what constitutes hell for me and i allow it will be damnable but until then i can make it pretty damnable for him colin took a cigarette but theres more than that he said i hate love and if youre rightthanks for the hintdennis loves me im going to kill that not only because i abominate it but because it will help to wither denniss soul i want to make him like me i should delight in him then i might even be pleased to know that stanier would be his is that all clear if so you might explain what you meant when you said i only shewed him what im trying to be she looked at him as she might have looked at some sick child its very simple she said youre trying to hate dennis and youre trying to make him hate you youre acting as if you hated him but youre not succeeding she felt that she had never known him till then so nakedly his soul leaped into his eyes she had no physical fear of him it did not seem to matter if he struck her or if he killed her but at that moment she looked into the nethermost pit and her spirit cried out for the horror of it that reacted on her physically she knew she turned as white as paper and that her heart fluttered in her throat like a bird ready to take wing but all that was a secondary effect she knew that she had spoken truly and she knew also that he recognized that for otherwise he would not have flamed into that icy fire of anger he took a step towards her and she saw him clench his fists so that the knuckles shewed white on his brown hands stand up he said are you mad that you speak to me like that with a violent effort she controlled the shaking of her knees and stood in front of him with her hands hanging defencelessly by her side no colin im not mad at all she said he drew back his arm as if to strike her ill give you one chance he said are you sorry no if youre going to knock me down do so i shant tell dennis she looked him perfectly straight in the face waiting for the blow and then suddenly she perceived that her defencelessness had beaten him youd better go he said you havent made things easier for dennis i may tell you instantly all her courage which had sufficed for herself surrendered colin its nothing to do with him she said do what you like to me but dont strike me through him i think that will hurt you most he said there was no use in saying anything further and she moved towards the door i am going back to london tomorrow he said violet heard nothing more from him during the days which intervened before denniss arrival as he knew the date of that she expected him to come back that day but there was still no sign from him and she and the boy had to themselves these few days before her mother and aunt hester came out of doors there was windless and sunny wintry weather every night there was a frost and the bare trees were decked with the whiteness of it which lay thick over the lawns and grassy slopes till the sun resolved it below on the marsh there was spread a mantle of dense mist through which the rays could not penetrate and when on the third day a breeze from the east folded it up the whole plain from edge to edge was dazzling with the glistening fall of the hoar frost on the lake the lids of ice shooting out from the shallow water had already roofed the whole surface with a promise of skating imminent but this wind with a veiled sun though chillier by sensation than the briskness of the still clear frost melted the frozen floor and brought up flocks of grey clouds and that evening the snowfall began for two days and nights beneath a bitter wind it fell without intermission lying in thick drifts in hollow places and giving the yewhedge an unbroken coat of white then as the wind dropped and the snow ceased the sky cleared again and a great frost black and of exceeding sharpness set in once more and this time very swiftly the chilled waters of the lake were congealed and the surface was dark like steel and transparent as the water over which it lay two days before christmas it already bore at the shallow end and dennis frenziedly began hunting for skates there must be some mother he said if one only looks in the right place you find them with broken golfclubs and old croquetmallets and he ran off to explore suitable regions there had been no further talk between them about his relations with his father every morning he asked if there was any news of his coming but there had been none violet had suggested his getting some eton friend to stay with him and then only distantly dennis had answered with it seemed to her a recollection of last holidays oh i think i wont thanks he had said father may come any day maynt he apart from that he had said nothing whatever and to violet every day of colins absence was so much remission old lady yardley seemed to accept the boy as being colin back from school again and all these days seemed to violet like hours of calm lit with a pale cold sunshine which preceded some inconjecturable tempest aunt hester and her mother arrived that afternoon and aunt hester instantly had her snowboots unpacked and went for a walk while the light still lingered i hate seeing the windows shuttered and the lamps lit my dear she said it makes me feel that i am being put in a box and im too near my latter end to waste my time now over boxes but if you get a bit of a walk while theyre shutting up the box seems pleasant enough when you get back to it and ill be ready for my tea too such esquimaux practices of course made no appeal to violets mother she brought down from her room her patience cards and an altarfrontal which she was embroidering for winchester cathedral and hoped to have ready by easter of the two for immediate employment she settled on the altarfrontal as she had a vague idea that she and violet must have a great deal to say to each other and it was impossible to talk while you were playing patience or rather it was impossible to play patience if you talked she had grown a shade greyer a shade more ladylike a shade more inaccessible but she always did everything slowly dennis will be quite a big boy she observed i have not seen him since last year at this time yes hes grown a great deal said violet could it be possible that colin was not coming for christmas and colin is well asked mrs stanier i hope so he has been away for the last fortnight and the wretch has never even said when he will be coming back it is a pity that he should miss denniss holidays said mrs stanier violet had no sympathetic contribution to give to this sentiment and her mother moistened her lips with the tip of her tongue they got dry and a little cracked in this very cold weather i have brought a wreath for your fathers grave she said i made it entirely from flowers in my greenhouse my gardener is very clever at getting me plenty of flowers throughout the winter violet rummaged her mind for some ardent rejoinder that is always nice she said flowers are a guarantee that spring will come but the poor things will wither very quickly when you put them out in this icy air yes dear but i should feel very remiss and hard if i did not always put a wreath on your fathers grave whenever i come to stanier i daresay it will not be for many more years that i shall do so violet laughed dear mother what nonsense she said why theres my grandmother who was married before you were born she plays her whist still and walks in to dinner her mind i suppose is now completely gone said mrs stanier she did not recognize me at all last time i was here and occasionally she mentioned your father as if he was with me still the arrival of tea interrupted this lugubrious interchange of thought followed by dennis triumphantly clashing a pair of skates which were screwed on to boots the leather of which was perished and wrinkled like withered funguses theyre old enough he said but theyre all right im going to put them on to my boots so that theyll be ready in the morning i found them in a cupboard upstairs instantly it occurred to violet whose those skates had been for more than a dozen years now there had been no skating at stanier probably the last person who had skated on the lake was raymond almost certainly the skates were his for they were workmanlike blades screwed on to the boots whereas the rest of them used to shoe themselves with strange antiquated wooden concerns or skates with keys and catches which invariably came undone but raymond had spent a winters vacation once at davos and violet remembered his laughing at her when one of her skates unclasped itself and slithered across the ice somehow with fantastic disquiet she hated the idea of dennis using raymonds skates arent they too big for you she asked lord yes said dennis but theyre better than nothing hefty skates too i wonder whose they were mrs stanier put a small saccharine lozenge into her tea the lake has not borne for many years she said i think we used to have harder winters once than we have now the last year it bore ah dear me yes the return of aunt hester from her tramp in the snow was a welcome advent she professed herself vastly refreshed and had a very pretty colour in her checks nothing like a frosty air for giving you an appetite she said and they say that the microbes all get killed in it though for my part i never believed much in microbes everythings microbes nowadays if youve got a pain in your stomach from eating what you shouldnt its a microbe if you covet your neighbours wife theyll make it out to be a microbe soon give me a good strong cup of tea violet dear i hope its been standing whats that youre working at margaret a shawl for cold evenings mrs stanier drew in her breath with a sound of shocked sipping no hester its an altarcloth for winchester cathedral she said well i couldnt see the pattern and it looked to me like a shawl and whens that wretch colin coming back i thought i should find him here ive not heard a word from him said violet ive been expecting him for some days well i shall have to flirt with dennis till he comes said aunt hester rather said dennis theres the telephone ringing mother shall i go and see what it is dennis ran into the hall leaving the skates which he was transferring to his own boots on the floor yes who is it he asked there was a moments silence hullo is that dennis asked his fathers voice yes father well tell them to send down to the station to meet the train im coming by it oh ripping said dennis ill tell them colin rang off again without another word colins train was very late he did not get up to the house till they were half way through dinner and came in as he was he was clearly in the best of spirits dont get up anybody he said violet darling how goes it and aunt hester and aunt margaret and granny an awful journey they always cut off the heating apparatus when its more than usually cold dennis waited for a greeting but there was none for him colin ignored him altogether as if he had not been present to all the others no doubt in intentional contrast he was extraordinarily cordial but as he spoke now to one and now to another with affection for violet with extravagant compliments for aunt hester and sympathetic enquiries about the girls friendly society for aunt margaret who was a pillar of that admirable institution violet saw his eyes as they flitted by dennis pause on the boys face from time to time with a look that peeped out like a lizard from a crevice and whisked in again and then for the first time he spoke to him any tipsy schoolfriends coming this christmas dennis he said my word that was a beauty you treated us to in the summer dennis raised his eyes to his fathers and even as they met violet saw that look pop out again instantly sheathing itself in the iron of colins voice no father i havent asked anybody these holidays he said quietly colin paid no more attention to him till the women got up to leave the table then he watched him to see what dennis would do dennis stood by the door he had opened not knowing whether his father expected him to go with the others or stay but his hesitation was enough perhaps youd kindly shut that door he said you can leave yourself on whichever side of it you like dennis shut it and came back to the table looking out for a drink i suppose said colin rising ring the bell when youve finished im going into the other room dennis went to the door again to open it for his father and followed him colin sat up late that night thinking of dennis and of little else he thought of him as he always did now as his survivor and supplanter who in all probability would rule at stanier for twenty years after he was dead unless he himself lingered on like his own grandmother till all the fires of life had grown cold then possibly he might outlive his son and possibly there might be enough heat in his grey embers to chuckle at that for he would sooner be the last of his race than be succeeded by dennis who would come after him he wondered in that case he knew there was a small homestead in the marsh just outside his property where there lived a farmer called stanier with a brood of scarecrow children perhaps they would establish their claim and there would be a romantic sequel to these centuries of direct line and everincreasing prosperity but he would sooner have them reigning here than dennis of course there was another chance the leaven of evil might yet work in the boyfor he was young stilland turn sour that sweet milk of love with which he dripped but he meant to make no more experiments with regard to that dennis must come to it because he loved evil he would only struggle against it and abhor it if he was forced to it besides colin knew he could not do it he could bully and illtreat him striving to kill love in him but the ultimate direct initiative was beyond him he could wish him dead he could wish him corrupted but he could not take on himself the actual sacrifice it was his own fault he had allowed dennis to enter his heart where noone else had ever been and now with all the vigour of his evil soul it was as much as he could do to stop his advance but never would he allow that love was stronger than he he would fight it till it lay bleeding and helpless at his feet it had grown cold in his room he fancied there was a draught from the door which led into the corridor to the now disused chapel but as he tried the door and found it shut the notion came to him to visit the chapel where he had not been since last easter and he fetched the key and turned up the lights it would be christmas eve tomorrow he remembered last year they had held a midnight mass there and the sacring bell had rung simultaneously with the peal from the church near by it was bitter tonight in the chapel and he shivered as he stood there in the air there still hung the faint stale odour of incense and faint too and hardly to be recalled was the thrill of satisfied evil with which once he had knelt there there was the step off which vincenzo had rolled when the slavering ecstasy in his face was struck from it by that mortal terror how horrible to think that perhaps he had seen god at that moment poor vincenzo colin had a sneering smile at the thought of that god did not come to you unless you permitted it for otherwise there was no such thing as freewill vincenzo must have had a weak spot somewhere he must have loved somebody for his own sake and that perhaps gave god a permit he must be careful then he went back into the silent house and upstairs he saw that denniss door was ajar and that there was a light within morning brought no such deplorable disaster as a thaw and soon after breakfast dennis came into the gallery with his skates in his hand colin was by the fire looking at the paper and glanced up at him skating he said yes the lake bears said dennis colin looked at the rusty skates on the boots he was carrying where did you get those he asked i found them in a cupboard said dennis they were on a pair of very old boots so i took them off and put them on mine it flashed through colins mind that they were raymonds he had meant to stop dennis skating just for the mere sake of spoiling his enjoyment now he rather liked the idea of his doing so well dont go out through here he said and let in the cold air go round by the hall perhaps ill come presently colin put the paper down on just such a morning as this clear and sunny after a nights hard frost had raymond gone down alone to the lake and he himself had strolled after him in time to see the white face already bluelipped rise out of a hole in the broken ice where the lake lay deepest and sink again before his eyes as he leaned on the parapet by the sluice and asked him if it was not rather cold the ice was always treacherous near where the stream came out of the lake some inward certainty took possession of him preposterous though such a coincidence would be he found himself believing that dennis was now gaily tramping over the hard frozen snow to his death and that he would be there to see it out of the window he saw the boy running down the white slopes beyond the yewhedge with his great coat on that reached nearly to his heels and his breath smoking in the bitter air three minutes later he was walking down over those same slopes dennis had gone into the bathingshed to put on his skates presently when he got warm he would divest himself of his greatcoat but it was too cold for that yet besides it would make a fall the softer he tried the edge of the lake and found it firm as a floor beneath him and soon he extended the field of his manuvres colin heard the ring of his skates as he came down to the lake he did not go to the bathingshed but kept straight on along the retaining bank hidden from denniss view by the rhododendrons he felt it was all going to happen as he expected the chain of coincidence was already strong for was not dennis alone on the virgin ice just as raymond had been and was he not marvellous that wearing the skates which raymond had worn there would be no more struggles to hate the boy no more looking on him as his survivor and supplanter things did not go well with those who crossed colin and who shuddered with nightmare at the approach of his protector there came a sudden crack sharp as a rifleshot from the lake and he heard a splash the open gap in the rhododendron bushes where the sluicegate stood was now only a few yards in front of him and he ran there ten or twelve yards from the bank where the water was deepest there was a jagged hole in the ice and denniss cap floated on the bubbling water next moment he rose only just his face thrown back appeared above the water for his coat heavily weighted him his eyes were staring with fright his mouth already blue with cold he saw colin father he called and now in a moment colin would be rid of his supplanter it had happened without plan or effort of his and he had only got to stop still for a few seconds and fill his mind with images of hate he hated dennis and smiled to himself as he repeated that while he met the boys eyes dennis still looked at him he had clutched a rim of the broken ice in one hand but it broke as he tried to raise himself and still struggling his head sank a little lower in the water that now covered his chin and mouth and then with a flood that bore all opposition way the knowledge burst on colin that he loved him and already perhaps it was too late he knew well too that it was risking his own life to jump into that deep water paralyzingly cold and swim out to him and he knew that life was sweet and he believed that death would be to him the open door through which he must go into the outer darkness of damnation but swiftly he tore off his coat for his arms would have to be strong for the two of them hold on old boy he shouted well have you out in a jiffy dont be frightened and those were sweet words to dennis and sweeter yet to him who spoke them colin vaulted over the parapet of the sluice breaking another hole in the ice and before he had come to the surface was striking out for the boy he did not know whether the water was hot or cold all that he was conscious of was the stark necessity of reaching dennis before he got to him the boys head had disappeared and plunging downwards he dived after him there he was still struggling but slowly sinking and colin caught hold first of his hair then got an arm round him and looking upwards saw the glint of the sun on the open water furiously kicking downwards he rose to the surface pulling dennis with him but the boys thick coat was a terrible drag and got heavier every moment as the water soaked into it and few yards as they had to go he thought for a moment that they would never reach the shore kick out for all youre worth he panted weve got to get there its just a few yards dennis at last a rhododendron branch growing out over the water came within reach and he caught hold of it this brought him to the edge of the unbroken ice again and letting go of dennis for a moment he brought his elbow down full on to it and broke another yard of passage then dennis came within reach of further branches and felt the steep sides of the retaining bank beneath his feet next minute they had dragged themselves out of the water colin turned to the boy his teeth chattering with cold and now that dennis was safe his heart was hot with the tide of hate momentarily driven back but now flowing swiftly you damned little idiot he said i suppose your plan was to drown me a revulsion of feeling not less than that which seized colin drove over the boy all the time that they had been struggling in the water with that strong arm upholding him his heart had sung with the thought that his father had risked his life to save him and now bitter as the icy water itself were his first words to him take off that coat of yours and run said colin after all my trouble you neednt stand here and freeze colin was now the more exhausted of the two and after they had trotted some fifty yards together dennis staggering and hobbling in his skated boots he had to stop i cant run any more he said go on he was terribly white of face and his breath came in short panting sobs thats likely said dennis here catch hold of me father give me your hand colins spirit rebelled but the flesh was weak and he let dennis tuck his arm in his and pound away up the hill the boys vigour and young blood had reasserted themselves the colour came back to his cheeks while the elder man after his frantic struggle for them both was growing every moment more exhausted but presently they came to the level paving of the terrace and violet from within saw them pass a window and rushed to the door to open it colin was now near collapse but between them they lifted him into the warmth ring the bell dennis she said what has happened i was drowning said dennis and he saved me a few hours in bed encircled with hot waterbottles and blankets soon restored dennis but the cold had taken a much firmer grip over his father for several days without ever being dangerously ill he was in danger of so being for his vitality which had always been so serene and vigorous failed to recuperate him and repel the effects of that icy struggle and its sequel of exhaustion never before in his life had he known a days sickness now it seemed as if the spring of his vital force was drained he made but little resistance he let himself lie passively there while nurses and doctors fought for him but all the time as he lay there and so slowly recovered his strength a struggle more grim than that to which others could minister had laid hold on him the exuberant vitality of his love of hate had suffered a shock to which that of his chilled and exhausted physical frame was not comparable that vitality never before seriously threatened but always bubbling with energy had collapsed at the moment when he vaulted over the sluice and crashed into the ice on his way to save dennis he who loved life with every fibre of his being and with every fibre of his being hated love knew well enough that he risked his life and betrayed his vow of hate when he did that a moment before he had been smiling at this wonderful coincidence which would rid him of a survivor and supplanter even as in identical manner and at this same spot he had been rid of that elder twin of his who stood between him and the lordship he coveted and then came the humiliating collapse of his hate before this assault of love and now as he lay here hour after hour of sunny wintry days and fitful sleep it was not so much that he thought all this over as that it was presented to him from outside like a picture on the wall which too was painted within his eyelids so that when he closed them the images were still there he saw himself risking everything for denniss sake not because dennis was his son for that for many weeks now had been a solid ground of hatred but because he loved the boy with whatever incredulity he tried to counter that it always slipped under his guard and stabbed him he was forced to admit it to himself for the wound it made bled but instinctively he covered it from others even as from dennis himself to whom the moment after the danger was over he had addressed those bitter and railing words which came hot and fluent from the instinct of his soul but still the flickering fire of hate doused for that moment with deep and icy water was alive and day after day he refused to see the boy and violet and though as his bodily strength returned that fire burned more bravely there was always present the knowledge that he had betrayed the lord and benefactor who all his life had done such great things for him was it in revenge for that betrayal that he had physically collapsed like this was it a warning that those whose souls were dedicated to evil had better not have commerce with love there was but a day left out of denniss holidays when colin came downstairs for the first time he had debated with himself whether to keep himself withdrawn till the boy had gone but this would deprive him of the opportunity of testifying that he still hated him he must put himself right and all the time for other reasons than these he knew he wanted to see dennis not even to himself would he admit that but in some closed cell the knowledge lurked aunt hester and mrs stanier had gone there were only dennis and violet at lunch when he came in neither had seen him for these two weeks nor had they any clue as to his attitude towards them except such as was implied by his refusal to see them they were not left long in doubt they had both risen on his entry ah colin said she this is splendid he turned upon her the full bleakness of his face well take the splendour for granted said he ah theres dennis its splendid isnt it dennis to have got rid of me for all your holidays thats what your mother means dennis looked at him unwaveringly the moment when colin had leaped in after him was so far more real than anything else that could be said or done in the whole world but she doesnt mean that father he said nor do i oh youve learned to contradict in my absence have you asked colin dennis was still radiant sorry father he said the meal went on in silence till dennis overanxious to give no cause of offence made a terrific crash with his pudding spoon if you cant eat your lunch decently you had better leave the room said colin dennis took this to be a general objurgation not a command sorry father he said again and went on with his pudding did you hear what i said dennis asked colin dennis got up at once but stood by his fathers chair a moment scarlet in the face at this public ignominy and very nervous but determined to speak ive never thanked you yet father he said for what you did for me i cant do more than thank you for theres nothing else i can do for you but if there was colin wheeled round in his chair damn you go away he said chapter vii the rigour of the winter abated and a rainy january was succeeded by a long spell of warm caressing weather borrowed from maytime so mild and sunny was it the trees were bursting into early bud the sallows were hung with catkins primroses were abloom and all over the marsh the ewes were with young no shepherd there remembered so early a lambing season nor one more fruitful colin had spent a month on his beloved island recuperating and that very successfully after his illness then one day after a week of london that longing for stanier overcame him and he drove down alone with no plan but to stay there as long as he was content he would find there only his grandmother and she now kept to her room entirely and no more preposterous rubbers of whist would be demanded in the evening after all she has played two rubbers every night for seventy years thought colin and tried to work out the portentous sum of the total but on his arrival her nurse came down to tell him that she was mysteriously aware it seemed that he was coming for she kept restlessly muttering to herself colin will be here soon perhaps she would be quieted by the sight of him so rather grudgingly for it must surely be a sheer waste of time he went up to see her there she lay in bed pallid and immobile with her pearls round her neck and looked at him with that disconcerting unwinking gaze behind which there seemed to lie some frozen consciousness and knowledge she was still repeating even while she gazed at him colin will be here soon but suddenly she stopped and gave that smile which looked as if it was the blurred reflection of something very far away and she muttered no more surely the spell of stanier thought colin as he left her that nameless magic of the legend and its gift had so penetrated her that now when the ultimate mists thickened about her that was the last illumination dimly piercing the cold shadows that shone on her she still had some consciousness of him as the inheritor of it all and he remained the last link now wearing so thin of her connection with the visible world he could imagine that the spell of stanier was strong and it would be so still he thought as he closed his dying eyes on its splendour and his doom a long way off that seemed on this young morning of spring he had started early from town and the day was yet at noon when he arrived and reserving himself for a long outing after lunch he wandered about the house soaking himself in it and inhaling its associations he went into violets rooms he went into the room where raymonds dead body had lain and thought of that fortunate morning which brought him his inheritance denniss room he passed without entering and some twitch of exasperation took him at the thought of dennis he was forever checking that truancy of his mind overhauling it and bringing it back when it went on these illicit excursions it would belong anyhow before he saw the boy for in the easter holidays he would be in italy again and assuredly dennis should not accompany him he went down the broad staircase into the hall with the portrait of old colin facing him with the parchment of the legendary contract he had made let into the frame o bonum commercium he thought and the picture smiled back at him across the prosperous centuries near by was the smokingroom that too was a place where the dead had lain and he recalled how he and good unsuspecting doctor martin had moved the remains of vincenzo there then came the long gallery with the sunshine pouring in and outside the terrace and the yewhedge where beneath the summer night violet had said she loved him there he had walked with pamela too that silly pamela she might have been alive today and young still if she had only not been so reckless as to love you never know into what dangerous places love might lead you into depths of unsubstantial air or depths of icy water and there none too soon for his appetite the door of the diningroom was opened and his new valet whom he had brought from italy told him that he was served the boy was rather like nino he drove out after lunch in the little twoseater that went lightly over the roads in the marsh rough with the scourings of the winter storms out past the golflinks and along the sandy road towards lydd he intended to walk home across the marsh and presently he got out for his tramp the dykes were full of water but it was always possible to find a way over footbridges and culverts it might be devious and zigzag but you could progress in the required direction and how more pleasantly after the grime of london could he pass a couple of hours than by strolling through the pastures bright with the young growth of spring and populous with anxious ewes and newborn lambs there was rye on the edge of the plain and above it the woods of stanier with a glimpse of the house among them that would be his general line and with half the afternoon before him he would strike the romney road before dusk and follow it along to the outskirts of the town where his car would be waiting for him he had been walking for an hour with the sunlight warm on him and the larks carolling in the lucent air when the brightness began to grow dim and looking up he saw that the sky was veiled with mist through which the sun peered whitely a little breeze had sprung up and from seaward there was drifting in a fog off the channel where already the sirens were hooting the warmth of the day had drawn up much moisture from the marsh into the air and now in the chill of the veiled sun it was rapidly condensing into one of those thick white mists which while stanier on its hill still basked in sunshine enveloped the lower ground it was annoying for he had still a mile to go before he struck the road and he hurried on to cover the ground as quickly as he could but before he had gone half that distance the mist thickened to so dense an opacity that it was impossible to see more than a yard or two ahead but before it closed down on him he had seen a gate some hundred yards in front which was clearly the outlet from this pasture in the direction of rye and he walked as he thought straight towards it presently he came to a stop instead of there being a gate in front of him there was a broad dyke he followed along this to the left but it seemed to run on indefinitely and retracing his steps he tried the other direction this brought him to the gate through which he passed and orientating himself from it he started off afresh but now he had no visible mark to guide him for the encompassing mists had closed their white walls impenetrably round him before long in this baffling dimness he knew he had lost his bearings altogether whether rye was to the left or right of him or straight ahead he had no idea he must just hope to find gates or footbridges across the dykes till he came to the road searching blindfold for them and it was growing dark the daylight of the clear air above the fog was fading he had passed ten minutes before a shepherds hut put up for lambing and now he determined to retrace his steps to this and see if there was anyone there from whom he could get guidance for at this season of the year the farmer or his shepherd often sat up all night as once old colin had done as a boy for the needs of midwifery but now he could not find the hut and giving up the search as vain he thought that he would again retrace the steps of his fruitless exploration and push on as best he might then with a sudden springing up of hope he saw a gate close ahead of him but when he came to it he found it familiar in some bewildering manner the staple was stiff just as was that of the last gate he had passed through and on the lowest bar of it was caught a piece of white sheeps wool which he had noticed before he must have come round in a circle to the point from which he had started when the mist grew thick this was all very uncomfortable and he paused wondering what to do next if he could not find his way across a mile of pasture it would be mere folly to attempt to go back on the course he had come it would have been infinitely better to have gone into that shepherds hut when he had the chance and waited for the mist to lift now the wisest thing would be to try again to find his way back there for it was somewhere close to this gate to which he had inadvertently returned he set off and now with a clearer recollection of his bearings he met with better success and presently he found the hut again there was no one there and there was no door to it but at any rate there was a roof to cover him and wooden walls for shelter and inside there was a pile of straw dry and plentiful into which he could burrow for warmth while he waited the moisture of the mist was thick on his clothes like dew on fleece and his face and hands were chilled and wet with it his long walk had tired him and the relief of finding shelter and rest was great and he sat down on the straw and made himself as comfortable as he could what time it was he had no idea for he was without matches and it was now so dark that he could not see his watch the doorless entrance was but a glimmering greyness against the blackness of the interior and he wondered whether even if the mist cleared he could find his way home before morning perhaps there was a moon but time alone would show that and his thoughts began to stray in other directions it was an odd adventure just so had old colin when a shepherd boy passed the night in some such hut as this probably within a few hundred yards of where he himself now sat and that certainly had been no unfortunate experience for him for on that night the splendid fortunes and prosperity of the house of which now he himself was head had been founded health and wealth and honour and all that his heart desired had been granted to his ancestor on that night of the legend into the inheritance of which he had entered by his love of evil and his hate of love and then the thought of dennis came up like a bubble to the surface of his mind dennis whom he hated and had tried to corrupt and who was the heir to all his splendours colin was getting drowsy in the warmth of his strawbed for a moment as token of that he thought he heard denniss voice and that roused him again but sleep was the most reasonable manner of passing these hours of waiting which might be long and it was certainly better than thinking about dennis thicker and thicker like the mists outside the dusk of sleep darkened round him he slept soundly and dreamlessly and woke after some interval of the length of which he had no idea into the full possession of his faculties so that he had no puzzled bewilderment as to where he was or how he had come here this waking consciousness dovetailed precisely into that which had preceded his sleep probably he had slept long for he woke alert and refreshed warm and comfortable under the straw that he had pulled over him but close on the heels of his waking there came the conviction that he was not alone here he had gone to sleep alone far away from the haunts of men in the isolation of the mist but while he slept someone had come he sat up and turning looked towards the blank doorway it was still faintly visible a dusky oblong in the blackness but now it framed the figure as of a man which stood there in the entry some shepherd was it who like himself sought shelter hullo who is that said colin i have lost my way and am sheltering here till the mist clears lord yardley from stanier there was silence then very quietly a voice spoke i know who you are it said colin felt his breath catch in his throat and a pulse beat there this was not the voice of a shepherd come here for the lambing or for shelter and a fantastic notion flashed into his head here was he sleeping in a remote hut in the marsh at lambingtime even as old colin had done and he asked himself whether some renewal or reenactment of the legend was at hand the idea scarcely seemed strange so intimately did the belief in the legend beat in his blood it was no shepherd who spoke that shape in the doorway seemed to him rather larger than it had been at first perhaps it had moved a silent step nearer him it had outlined itself a little more clearly now the shape of the shoulders and the head was more sharply defined round the head there was a faint luminousness like the halo the moonlight casts round a mans shadow on the grass in the silence that followed colin asked himself whether he was still asleep whether the whole adventure was a dream whether he would presently wake up and find himself in his bed at stanier and then the voice spoke again and he knew that whether he dreamed or whether indeed he was awake the substance of things unseen was in manifestation why did you save dennis asked the quiet voice the question was utterly unexpected but whoever this was he had no claim to be answered his lord and benefactor if it was he knew that his soul was set on evil and hate and what right had any other power in heaven or earth or in the dark places to question him why he answered at all he did not know his voice seemed to take it upon itself to do so i saved dennis he said just simply because i chose to it was my own business and my will is free you might easily have been drowned said the voice did you consider that i knew i was taking that risk said colin and did you consider what doom awaited you yes then why did you save dennis colin began to catch a glimpse of the purport of the question but nothing he determined should make him give the answer that he felt was required of him besides such an answer he told himself was not true he had been guilty at the most of a momentary weakness i saved him i tell you he said because i chose to he was my only son was it not reasonable that i should wish him to live and continue my line he was definitely uneasy now his uneasiness irritated him into flippancy perhaps you are a bachelor he said and so you cant be expected to understand that in any case i dont know what right you have to ask me and i have no other answer for you once more there was silence then the quiet voice spoke again why did you save dennis it asked the question was beginning to frighten him he felt as if he was on the rack and that each time the question came some lever was pulled some cog clicked and the ropes round his wrists and ankles were getting more taut he could just feel the strain of them which would presently increase why did you save dennis asked the voice again this time colin clenched his teeth whatever torture might be in store he would never answer that there was no actual pain yet only the anticipation of it but surely years had passed since he found his way through the mist into this shed it could not only have been last evening as the dusk of this present night began to fall that he had come here and covered himself up in the straw it was on that very spot that you let your brother raymond drown said the voice why did you let raymond drown without an effort to save him for a moment that relieved the tension because i hated raymond said colin because he stood between me and my inheritance but you hate dennis too will he not inherit all that is yours yes i hate dennis said colin of course you tried to corrupt him you tried to make him miserable you tried to kill his love for you we are agreed on that then you hate dennis the voice was silent again the figure surely had moved closer for now it towered above him the faint luminousness round its head was brighter he could see the boarding of the hut and the grey glimmer of the straw where he sat and then again the voice spoke colin knew what it was about to say why did you save dennis it asked at that the pain began some hot shooting stab of agony but he could bear that and worse than that every moment now seemed to have a quality it had never possessed before the seconds which he could hear his watch ticking out were not long exactly they were eternal the tension relaxed again you hated nino said the voice when he turned his back on you and your wickedness and let him die did you not hate nino yes i hated nino then said colin and you hated pamela you mocked her and drove her to her death you were never sorry it amused you did you not hate pamela yes i hated pamela said he and you hate violet you hate the whole world you hate the love which has been squandered on you do you not hate love yes i hate love again came the terrible pause and he bit his lip and tried to brace his muscles against the wrench that was coming why did you save dennis came the question the ropes were tight now and the pull made him gasp and cry out in gods name who are you that torture me he screamed you will know presently when i have broken you colin clenched his hands tight still utterly steadfast and untamed dont imagine youll do that he said if thats what you expect youre wasting your time again the silence of eternity fell do you believe in god colin stanier said the voice yes said he you know that and do you hate god with all your heart yes said colin the figure receded a little perhaps he thought now that he had made his final and complete repudiation which surely included all else the torture was over for the cruel wrench of that repeated question came no more and he sank back utterly exhausted on his strawbed and sleep or some such anodyne to sensation came over him then once more he came to himself alert and wholly awake outside the mist had cleared and he could see through the empty doorspace the pasture covered with thick dew and a few scattered sheep with their lambs beside them it must be close on dawn for in the east there was a long line of cloud flushed red with the sun that had not yet risen on the earth for the moment with a pang of exquisite relief he thought he was alone and that the inquisition of the night was over but how terribly real a dream could be dennis had known that when he woke from his nightmare and threw himself into his fathers arms for protection and this dream even though now he was awake had still that quality of eternity about it he sat up and then he saw that the figure was by him once more close to him now it was still a shadow dark and undecipherable in spite of the flushed twilight of the coming day why did you save dennis it asked the torture shot through him again more poignant than ever to his racked spirit he bowed his head and felt the drops of agony grow thick on his forehead but still he made no answer he raised his eyes as if in obedience to a command and saw the lines of cloud red in the dawn and the voice spoke see where christs blood streams in the firmament one drop would save your soul but you would never call on him colin because you hate him he could not answer so rending was the torture he waited writhing and stiffened against what was coming why did you save dennis asked the voice at that the full fierceness of mortal agony was let loose on him and that agony was eternal it had existed before ever time began the evil of all that he had done the utter depravity of his soul with its lust for hate and its hate of love was torn and wrenched by the inflexible power of that which had made him so lightly vault over the parapet of the sluice and strike out across the icy water towards dennis with all his force with all his will he resisted but his force faded his will faltered and collapsed and with a wail of pain he surrendered i saved him because i loved him he cried i give in you devil from the pit for christs sake dont torture me any more the rending agony in which he writhed ceased the strain relaxed blinded with sweat and tears he looked at the figure that stood close to him now but still it was no more than a shadow to him who are you he sobbed why have you tortured me like this are you my lord whom i have served so well who are you at that the shadow brightened into a beam that dimmed the lines of morning and filled the hut with a radiance on which he could not look and once more for the last time the quiet voice spoke i am love it said the end printed by the anchor press ltd tiptree essex england
