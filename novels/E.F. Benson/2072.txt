michael by e f benson chapter i though there was nothing visibly graceful about michael comber he apparently had the art of giving gracefully he had already told his cousin francis who sat on the arm of the sofa by his table that there was no earthly excuse for his having run into debt but now when the moment came for giving he wrote the cheque quickly and eagerly as if thoroughly enjoying it and passed it over to him with a smile that was extraordinarily pleasant there you are then francis he said and i take it from you that that will put you perfectly square again youve got to write to me remember in two days time saying that you have paid those bills and for the rest im delighted that you told me about it in fact i should have been rather hurt if you hadnt francis apparently had the art of accepting gracefully which is more difficult than the feat which michael had so successfully accomplished mike youre a brick he said but then you always are a brick thanks awfully michael got up and shuffled rather than walked across the room to the bell by the fireplace as long as he was sitting down his big arms and broad shoulders gave the impression of strength and you would have expected to find when he got up that he was tall and largely made but when he rose the extreme shortness of his legs manifested itself and he appeared almost deformed his hands hung nearly to his knees he was heavy short lumpish but its more blessed to give than to receive francis he said i have the best of you there well its pretty blessed to receive when you are in a tight place as i was he said laughing and i am so grateful yes i know you are and its that which makes me feel rather cheap because i dont miss what ive given you but thats distinctly not a reason for your doing it again youll have tea wont you why yes said francis getting up also and leaning his elbow on the chimneypiece which was nearly on a level with the top of michaels head and if michael had gracefulness only in the art of giving franciss gracefulness in receiving was clearly of a piece with the rest of him he was tall slim and alert with the quick soft movements of some wild animal his face brown with sunburn and pink with briskgoing blood was exceedingly handsome in a boyish and almost effeminate manner and though he was only eighteen months younger than his cousin he looked as if nine or ten years might have divided their ages but you are a brick mike he said again laying his long brown hand on his cousins shoulder i cant help saying it twice twice more than was necessary said michael finally dismissing the subject the room where they sat was in michaels flat in half moon street and high up in one of those tall discreetlooking houses the windows were wide open on this hot july afternoon and the bourdon hum of london where piccadilly poured by at the street end came in blended and blunted by distance but with the suggestion of heat of movement of hurrying affairs the room was very empty of furniture there was a rug or two on the parquet floor a long low bookcase taking up the end near the door a table a sofa three or four chairs and a piano everything was plain but equally obviously everything was expensive and the general impression given was that the owner had no desire to be surrounded by things he did not want but insisted on the superlative quality of the things he did the rugs for instance happened to be of silk the bookcase happened to be hepplewhite the piano bore the most eminent of makers names there were three mezzotints on the walls a dragonsblood vase on the high carved chimneypiece the whole bore the unmistakable stamp of a fine individual taste but theres something else i want to talk to you about francis said michael as presently afterwards they sat over their tea i cant say that i exactly want your advice but i should like your opinion ive done something in fact without asking anybody but now that its done i should like to know what you think about it francis laughed thats you all over michael he said you always do a thing first if you really mean to do itwhich i suppose is moral courageand then you go anxiously round afterwards to see if other people approve which i am afraid looks like moral cowardice i go on a different plan altogether i ascertain the opinion of so many people before i do anything that i end by forgetting what i wanted to do at least that seems a reasonable explanation for the fact that i so seldom do anything michael looked affectionately at the handsome boy who lounged longlegged in the chair opposite him like many very shy persons he had one friend with whom he was completely unreserved and that was this cousin of his for whose charm and insouciant brilliance he had so adoring an admiration he pointed a broad big finger at him yes but when you are like that he said you can just float along other people float you but i should sink heavily if i did nothing ive got to swim all the time well you are in the army said francis thats as much swimming as anyone expects of a fellow who has expectations in fact its i who have to swim all the time if you come to think of it you are somebody im not michael sat up and took a cigarette but im not in the army any longer he said thats just what i am wanting to tell you francis laughed what do you mean he asked have you been cashiered or shot or something i mean that i wrote and resigned my commission yesterday said michael if you had dined with me last nightas by the way you promised to doi should have told you then francis got up and leaned against the chimneypiece he was conscious of not thinking this abrupt news as important as he felt he ought to think it that was characteristic of him he floated as michael had lately told him finding the world an extremely pleasant place full of warm currents that took you gently forward without entailing the slightest exertion but michaels grave and expectant facethat michael who had been so eagerly kind about meeting his debts for himwarned him that however gossamerlike his own emotions were he must attempt to ballast himself over this are you speaking seriously he asked quite seriously i never did anything that was so serious and that is what you want my opinion about he asked if so you must tell me more mike i cant have an opinion unless you give me the reasons why you did it the thing itselfwell the thing itself doesnt seem to matter so immensely the significance of it is why you did it michaels big heavybrowed face lightened a moment for a fellow who never thinks he said you think uncommonly well but the reasons are obvious enough you can guess sufficient reasons to account for it lets hear them anyhow said francis michael clouded again surely they are obvious he said no one knows better than me unless it is you that im not like the rest of you my mind isnt the build of a guardsmans mind any more than my unfortunate body is half our work as you know quite well consists in being pleasant and in liking it well im not pleasant im not breezy and cordial i cant do it i make a task of what is a pastime to all of you and i only shuffle through my task im not popular im not liked its no earthly use saying i am i dont like the life it seems to me senseless and those who live it dont like me they think me heavyjust heavy and i have enough sensitiveness to know it michael need not have stated his reasons for his cousin could certainly have guessed them he could too have confessed to the truth of them michael had not the light hand which is so necessary when young men work together in a companionship of which the cordiality is an essential part of the work neither had he in the social side of life that particular and inimitable sort of easy selfconfidence which as he had said just now enables its owner to float except in years he was not young he could not manage to be clubable he was serious and awkward at a supper party he was altogether without the effervescence which is necessary in order to avoid flatness he did his work also in the same conscientious but leaden way officers and men alike felt it all this francis knew perfectly well but instead of acknowledging it he tried quite fruitlessly to smooth it over arent you exaggerating he asked michael shook his head oh dont tone it down francis he said even if i was exaggeratingwhich i dont for a moment admitthe effect on my general efficiency would be the same i think what i say is true francis became more practical but youve only been in the regiment three years he said it wont be very popular resigning after only three years i have nothing much to lose on the score of popularity remarked michael there was nothing pertinent that could be consoling here and have you told your father asked francis does uncle robert know yes i wrote to father this morning and im going down to ashbridge tomorrow i shall be very sorry if he disapproves then youll be sorry said francis i know but it wont make any difference to my action after all im twentyfive if i cant begin to manage my life now you may be sure i never shall but i know im right i would bet on my infallibility at present ive only told you half my reasons for resigning and already you agree with me francis did not contradict this lets hear the rest then he said you shall the rest is far more important and rather resembles a sermon francis appropriately sat down again well its this said michael im twentyfive and it is time that i began trying to be what perhaps i may be able to be instead of not trying very muchbecause its hopelessto be what i cant be im going to study music i believe that i could perhaps do something there and in any case i love it more than anything else and if you love a thing you have certainly a better chance of succeeding in it than in something that you dont love at all i was stuck into the army for no reason except that soldiering is among the few employments which it is considered proper for fellows in my positiongood lord how awful it soundsproper for me to adopt the other things that were open were that i should be a sailor or a member of parliament but the soldier was what father chose i looked round the picture gallery at home the other day there are twelve lord ashbridges in uniform so as i shall be lord ashbridge when father dies i was stuck into uniform too to be the illstarred thirteenth but what has it all come to if you think of it when did the majority of them wear their smart uniforms chiefly when they went on peaceful parades or to court balls or to the sir joshua reynolds of the period to be painted theyve been tin soldiers francis youre a tin soldier and ive just ceased to be a tin soldier if there was the smallest chance of being useful in the army by which i mean standing up and being shot at because i am english i would not dream of throwing it up but theres no such chance michael paused a moment in his sermon and beat out the ashes from his pipe against the grate anyhow the chance is too remote he said all the nations with armies and navies are too much afraid of each other to do more than growl also i happen to want to do something different with my life and you cant do anything unless you believe in what you are doing i want to leave behind me something more than the portrait of a tin soldier in the diningroom at ashbridge after all isnt an artistic profession the greatest there is for what counts what is of value in the world today greek statues the italian pictures the symphonies of beethoven the plays of shakespeare the people who have made beautiful things are they who are the benefactors of mankind at least so the people who love beautiful things think francis glanced at his cousin he knew this interesting vital side of michael he was aware too that had anybody except himself been in the room michael could not have shown it perhaps there might be people to whom he could show it but certainly they were not those among whom michaels life was passed go on he said encouragingly youre ripping mike well the nuisance of it is that the things i am ripping about appear to father to be a sort of indoor game its all right to play the piano if its too wet to play golf you can amuse yourself with painting if there arent any pheasants to shoot in fact he will think that my wanting to become a musician is much the same thing as if i wanted to become a billiardmarker and if he and i talked about it till we were a hundred years old he could never possibly appreciate my point of view michael got up and began walking up and down the room with his slow ponderous movement francis its a thousand pities that you and i cant change places he said you are exactly the son father would like to have and i should so much prefer being his nephew however you come next thats one comfort he paused a moment you see the fact is that he doesnt like me he said he has no sympathy whatever with my tastes nor with what i am im an awful trial to him and i dont see how to help it its pure waste of time my going on in the guards i do it badly and i hate it now youre made for it youre that sort and that sort is my fathers sort but im not no one knows that better than myself then theres the question of marriage too michael gave a mirthless laugh im twentyfive you see he said and its the family custom for the eldest son to marry at twentyfive just as hes baptised when hes a certain number of weeks old and confirmed when he is fifteen its part of the family plan and the medes and persians arent in it when the family plan is in question then again the lucky young woman has to be suitable that is to say she must be what my father calls one of us how i loathe that phrase so my mother has a list of the suitable and they come down to ashbridge in gloomy succession and she and i are sent out to play golf together or go on the river and when to our unutterable relief that is over we hurry back to the house and i escape to my piano and she goes and flirts with you if you are there dont deny it and then another one comes and she is drearier than the lastat least i am francis lay back and laughed at this dismal picture of the rejection of the fittest but youre so confoundedly hard to please mike he said there was an awfully nice girl down at ashbridge at easter when i was there who was simply pining to take you ive forgotten her name michael clicked his fingers in a summary manner there you are he said you and she flirted all the time and three months afterwards you dont even remember her name if you had only been me you would have married her as it was she and i bored each other stiff theres an irony for you but as for pining i ask you whether any girl in her senses could pine for me look at me and tell me or rather dont look at me i cant bear to be looked at here was one of michaels morbid sensitivenesses he seldom forgot his own physical appearance the fact of which was to him appalling his stumpy figure with its big body his broad bluntfeatured face his long arms his large hands and feet his clumsiness in movement were to him of the nature of a constant nightmare and it was only with francis and the ease that his solitary presence gave or when he was occupied with music that he wholly lost his selfconsciousness in this respect it seemed to him that he must be as repulsive to others as he was to himself which was a distorted view of the case plain without doubt he was and of heavy and ungainly build but his belief in the finality of his uncouthness was morbid and imaginary and half his inability to get on with his fellows no less than with the maidens who were brought down in single file to ashbridge was due to this he knew very well how lightheartedly they escaped to the geniality and attractiveness of francis and in the clutch of his own introspective temperament he could not free himself from the handicap of his own sensitiveness and like others take himself for granted he crushed his own power to please by the weight of his judgments on himself so theres another reason to complain of the irony of fate he said i dont want to marry anybody and god knows nobody wants to marry me but then its my duty to become the father of another lord ashbridge as if there had not been enough of them already and his mother must be a certain kind of girl with whom i have nothing in common so i say that if only we could have changed places you would have filled my niche so perfectly and i should have been free to bury myself in leipzig or munich and lived like the grub i certainly am and have drowned myself in a sea of music as it is goodness knows what my father will say to the letter i wrote him yesterday which he will have received this morning however that will soon be patent for i go down there tomorrow i wish you were coming with me cant you manage to for a day or two and help things along aunt barbara will be there francis consulted a small green morocco pocketbook cant tomorrow he said nor yet the day after but perhaps i could get a few days leave next week next weeks no use i go to baireuth next week baireuth whos baireuth asked francis oh a man i know his other name was wagner and he wrote some tunes francis nodded oh but ive heard of him he said theyre rather long tunes arent they at least i found them so when i went to the opera the other night go on with your plans mike what do you mean to do after that go on to munich and hear the same tunes over again after that i shall come back and settle down in town and study play the piano asked francis amiably trying to enter into his cousins schemes michael laughed no doubt that will come into it he said but its rather as if you told somebody you were a soldier and he said oh is that quick march so it is soldiering largely consists of quick march especially when its more than usually hot well i shall learn to play the piano said michael but you play so rippingly already said francis cordially you played all those songs the other night which you had never seen before if you can do that there is nothing more you want to learn with the piano is there you are talking rather as father will talk observed michael am i well i seem to be talking sense you werent doing what you seemed then ive got absolutely everything to learn about the piano francis rose then it is clear i dont understand anything about it he said nor i suppose does uncle robert but really i rather envy you mike anyhow you want to do and be something so much that you are gaily going to face unpleasantnesses with uncle robert about it now i wouldnt face unpleasantnesses with anybody about anything i wanted to do and i suppose the reason must be that i dont want to do anything enough the malady of not wanting quoted michael yes ive got that malady the ordinary things that one naturally does are all so pleasant and take all the time there is that i dont want anything particular especially now that youve been such a brick stop it said michael right i got it in rather cleverly i was saying that it must be rather nice to want a thing so much that youll go through a lot to get it most fellows arent like that a good many fellows are jellyfish observed michael i suppose so im one you know i drift and float but i dont think i sting what are you doing tonight by the way playing the piano i hope why only that two fellows are dining with me and i thought perhaps you would come aunt barbara sent me the ticket for a box at the gaiety too and we might look in there then theres a dance somewhere thanks very much but i think i wont said michael im rather looking forward to an evening alone and thats an odd thing to look forward to remarked francis not when you want to play the piano i shall have a chop here at eight and probably thump away till midnight francis looked round for his hat and stick i must go he said i ought to have gone long ago but i didnt want to the malady came in again most of the world have got it you know michael michael rose and stood by his tall cousin i think we english have got it he said at least the english you and i know have got it but i dont believe the germans for instance have theyre in deadly earnest about all sorts of thingsmusic among them which is the point that concerns me the music of the world is german you know francis demurred to this oh i dont think so he said this thing at the gaiety is ripping i believe do come and see michael resisted this chance of revising his opinion about the german origin of music and francis drifted out into piccadilly it was already getting on for seven oclock and the roadway and pavements were full of people who seemed rather to contradict michaels theory that the nation generally suffered from the malady of not wanting so eagerly and numerously were they on the quest for amusement already the street was a mass of taxicabs and private motors containing each one of them men and women in evening dress hurrying out to dine before the theatre or the opera bright eager faces peered out with sheen of silk and glitter of gems they all seemed alert and prosperous and keen for the daily hours of evening entertainment a crowd similar in spirit pervaded the pavements whiteshirted men with coat on arm stepped in and out of swinging club doors and the example set by the leisured class seemed copiously copied by those whom desks and shops had made prisoners all day the air of the whole town swarming with the nation that is supposed to make so grave an affair of its amusements was indescribably gay and lighthearted the whole city seemed set on enjoying itself the buses that boomed along were packed inside and out and each was placarded with advertisement of some popular piece at theatre or musichall inside the green park the grass was populous with lounging figures who unable to pay for indoor entertainment were making the most of what the coolness of sunset and grass supplied them with gratis the newsboards of itinerant sellers contained nothing of more serious import than the result of cricket matches and as the dusk began to fall street lamps and signs were lit like early rising stars so that no hint of the gathering night should be permitted to intrude on the perpetually illuminated city all that was sordid and sad all that was busy except on these gay errands of pleasure was shuffled away out of sight so that the pleasure seekers might be excused for believing that there was nothing in the world that could demand their attention except the need of amusing themselves successfully the workers toiled in order that when the working day was over the fruits of their labour might yield a harvest of a few hours enjoyment silkworms had spun so that from carriage windows might glimmer the wrappings made from their cocoons divers had been imperilled in deep seas so that the pearls they had won might embellish the necks of these fair wearers to francis this all seemed very natural and proper part of the recognised order of things that made up the series of sensations known to him as life he did not as he had said very particularly care about anything and it was undoubtedly true that there was no motive or conscious purpose in his life for which he would voluntarily have undergone any important stress of discomfort or annoyance it was true that in pursuance of his profession there was a certain amount of quick marching and drill to be done in the heat but that was incidental to the fact that he was in the guards and more than compensated for by the pleasures that were also naturally incidental to it he would have been quite unable to think of anything that he would sooner do than what he did and he had sufficient of the ingrained human tendency to do something of the sort which was a matter of routine rather than effort than have nothing whatever except the gratification of momentary whims to fill his day besides it was one of the conventions or even conditions of life that every boy on leaving school did something for a certain number of years some went into business in order to acquire the wealth that should procure them leisure some like himself became soldiers or sailors not because they liked guns and ships but because to boys of a certain class these professions supplied honourable employment and a pleasant time without being in any way slack in his regimental duties he performed them as many others did without the smallest grain of passion and without any imaginative forecast as to what fruit if any there might be to these hours spent in drill and discipline he was but one of a very large number who do their work without seriously bothering their heads about its possible meaning or application his particular job gave a young man a pleasant position and an easy path to general popularity given that he was willing to be sociable and amused he was extremely ready to be both the one and the other and there his philosophy of life stopped and indeed it seemed on this hot july evening that the streets were populated by philosophers like unto himself never had england generally been more prosperous more secure more comfortable the heavens of international politics were as serene as the evening sky not yet was the stormcloud that hung over ireland bigger than a mans hand east west north and south there brooded the peace of the close of a halcyon day and the amazing doings of the suffragettes but added a slight incentive to the perusal of the morning paper the arts flourished harvests prospered the world like a newlywound clock seemed to be in for a spell of serene and orderly ticking with an occasional chime just to show how the hours were passing london was an extraordinarily pleasant place people were friendly amusements beckoned on all sides and for francis as for so many others but a very moderate amount of work was necessary to win him an approved place in the scheme of things a seat in the slowwheeling sunshine it really was not necessary to want above all to undergo annoyances for the sake of what you wanted since so many pleasurable distractions enough to fill day and night twice over were so richly spread around some day he supposed he would marry settle down and become in time one of those men who presented a bald head in a club window to the gaze of passersby it was difficult perhaps to see how you could enjoy yourself or lead a life that paid its own way in pleasure at the age of forty but that he trusted that he would learn in time at present it was sufficient to know that in half an hour two excellent friends would come to dinner and that they would proceed in a spirit of amiable content to the gaiety after that there was a ball somewhere he had forgotten where but one of the others would be sure to know and tomorrow and tomorrow would be like unto today it was idle to ask questions of oneself when all went so well the time for asking questions was when there was matter for complaint and with him assuredly there was none the advantages of being twentythree years old gay and goodlooking without a care in the world now that he had michaels cheque in his pocket needed no comment still less complaint he like the crowd who had sufficient to pay for a sixpenny seat at a musichall was perfectly content with life in general tomorrow would be time enough to do a little more work and glean a little more pleasure it was indeed an admirable england where it was not necessary even to desire for there were so many things bright cheerful things to distract the mind from desire it was a day of dozing in the sun like the submerged scattered units or duets on the grass of the green park of behaving like the lilies of the field francis found he was rather late and proceeded hastily to his mothers house in savile row to array himself if not like one of these like an exceedingly welldressed young man who demanded of his tailor the utmost of his art with the prospect owing to michaels generosity of being paid tomorrow michael when his cousin had left him did not at once proceed to his evening by himself with his piano though an hour before he had longed to be alone with it and a pianoforte arrangement of the meistersingers of which he had promised himself a complete perusal that evening but franciss visit had already distracted him and he found now that franciss departure took him even farther away from his designed evening francis with his good looks and his gay spirits his easy friendships and perfect content except when a small matter of deficit and dunning letters obscured the sunlight for a moment was exactly all that he would have wished to be himself but the moment he formulated that wish in his mind he knew that he would not voluntarily have parted with one atom of his own individuality in order to be francis or anybody else he was aware how easy and pleasant life would become if he could look on it with franciss eyes and if the world would look on him as it looked on his cousin there would be no more bother in a moment he would by this exchange have parted with his own unhappy temperament his own deplorable body and have stepped into an amiable and prosperous little neutral kingdom that had no desires and no regrets he would have been free from all wants except such as could be gratified so easily by a little work and a great capacity for being amused he would have found himself excellently fitting the niche into which the rulers of birth and death had placed him an eldest son of a great territorial magnate who had what was called a stake in the country and desired nothing better willingly as he had said would he have changed circumstances with francis but he knew that he would not for any bait the world could draw in front of him have changed natures with him even when to all appearance the gain would so vastly have been on his side it was better to want and to miss than to be content even at this moment when francis had taken the sunshine out of the room with his departure michael clung to his own gloom and his own uncouthness if by getting rid of them he would also have been obliged to get rid of his own temperament unhappy as it was but yet capable of strong desire he did not want to be content he wanted to see always ahead of him a golden mist through which the shadows of unconjecturable shapes appeared he was willing and eager to get lost if only he might go wandering on groping with his big hands stumbling with his clumsy feet desiring there are the indications of a path visible to all who desire michael knew that his path the way that seemed to lead in the direction of the ultimate goal was music there somehow in that direction lay his destiny that was the route he was not like the majority of his sex and years who weave their physical and mental dreams in the loom of a girls face in her glance in the curves of her mouth deliberately owing chiefly to his morbid consciousness of his own physical defects he had long been accustomed to check the instincts natural to a young man in this regard he had seen too often the facility with which others more fortunate than he get delightedly lost in that golden haze he had experienced too often the absence of attractiveness in himself how could any girl of the london ballroom he had so frequently asked himself tolerate dancing or sitting out with him when there was francis and a hundred others like him so pleased to take his place nor so he told himself was his mind one whit more apt than his body it did not move lightly and agreeably with unconscious smiles and easy laughter by nature he was monkish he was celibate he could but cease to burn incense at such ineffectual altars and help as he had helped this afternoon to replenish the censers of more fortunate acolytes this was all familiar to him it passed through his head unbidden when francis had left him like the refrain of some wellknown song occurring spontaneously without need of an effort of memory it was a possession of his known by heart and it no longer except for momentary twinges had any bitterness for him this afternoon it is true there had been one such when francis gleeful with his cheque had gone out to his dinner and his theatre and his dance inviting him cheerfully to all of them in just that had been the bitternessnamely that francis had so overflowing a wellspring of content that he could be cordial in bidding him cast a certain gloom over these entertainments michael knew quite unerringly that francis and his friends would not enjoy themselves quite so much if he was with them there would be the restraint of polite conversation at dinner instead of completely idle babble there would be less outspoken normality at the gaiety a little more decorum about the whole of the boyish proceedings he knew all that so well so terribly well his servant had come in with the evening paper and the implied suggestion of the propriety of going to dress before he roused himself he decided not to dress as he was going to spend the evening alone and instead he seated himself at the piano with his copy of the meistersingers and mechanically at first with the ragged cloudfleeces of his reverie hanging about his brain banged away at the overture he had extraordinary dexterity of finger for one who had had so little training and his hands with their great stretch made light work of octaves and even tenths his knowledge of the music enabled him to wake the singing bird of memory in his head and before long flute and horn and string and woodwind began to make themselves heard in his inner ear twice his servant came in to tell him that his dinner was ready but michael had no heed for anything but the sounds which his flying fingers suggested to him francis his father his own failure in the life that had been thrust on him were all gone he was with the singers of nuremberg chapter ii the river ashe after a drowsy and meandering childhood passed peacefully among the sedges and marigolds of its water meadows suddenly and somewhat disconcertingly grows up and without any period of transition and adolescence becomes from being a mere girl of a rivulet a male and fullblooded estuary of the sea at coton for instance the tips of the sculls of a sauntering pleasureboat will almost span its entire width while but a mile farther down you will see stoneladen barges and tall redwinged sailing craft coming up with the tide and making fast to the grey wooden quay wall of ashbridge rough with barnacles for the reeds and meadowsweet of its margin are exchanged the brown and green growths of the sea with their sharp acrid odour instead of the damp fresh smell of meadow flowers and at low tide the podded bladders of brown weed and long strings of marine macaroni among which peevish crabs scuttle sideways take the place of the grass and spires of loosestrife and over the water instead of singing larks hang white companies of chiding seagulls here at high tide extends a sheet of water large enough when the wind blows up the estuary to breed waves that break in foam and spray against the barges while at the ebb acres of mud flats are disclosed on which the boats lean slanting till the flood lifts them again and makes them strain at the wheezing ropes that tie them to the quay a year before the flame of war went roaring through europe in unquenchable conflagration it would have seemed that nothing could possibly rouse ashbridge from its redbrick georgian repose there was never a town so inimitably drowsy or so sternly uncompetitive a hundred years ago it must have presented almost precisely the same appearance as it did in the summer of if we leave out of reckoning a few dozen of modern upstart villas that line its outskirts and the very inconspicuous railway station that hides itself behind the warehouses near the rivers bank most of the trains too quite ignore its existence and pass through it on their way to more rewarding stoppingplaces hardly recognising it even by a spurt of steam from their whistles and it is only if you travel by those that require the most frequent pauses in their progress that you will be enabled to alight at its thin and depopulated platform just outside the station there perennially waits a lowroofed and sanguine omnibus that under daily discouragement continues to hope that in the longdelayed fulness of time somebody will want to be driven somewhere this nobody ever does since the distance to any house is so small and a porter follows with luggage on a barrow it carries on its floor a quantity of fresh straw in the manner of the stage coaches in which the problematic passenger should he ever appear will no doubt bury his feet on its side just below the window that is not made to open it carries the legend that shows that it belongs to the comber arms a hostelry so selfeffacing that it is discoverable only by the sharpesteyed of pilgrims narrow roadways flanked by proportionately narrower pavements lie ribbonlike between huddled shops and squarelyspacious georgian houses and an air of leisure and content amounting almost to stupefaction is the moral atmosphere of the place on the outskirts of the town crowning the gentle hills that lie to the north and west villas in acre plots belonging to business men in the county town some ten miles distant prick their cockney ears and are strangely at variance with the sober gravity of the indigenous houses so too are the manners and customs of their owners who go to stoneborough every morning to their work and return by the train that brings them home in time for dinner they do other exotic and unsuitable things also like driving swiftly about in motors in playing golf on the other side of the river at coton and in having parties at each others houses but apart from them nobody ever seems to leave ashbridge though a stroll to the station about the time that the evening train arrives is a recognised diversion or in consequence ever to come back ashbridge in fact is selfcontained and desires neither to meddle with others nor to be meddled with the estuary opposite the town is some quarter of a mile broad at high tide and in order to cross to the other side where lie the woods and park of ashbridge house it is necessary to shout and make staccato prancings in order to attract the attention of the antique ferryman who is invariably at the other side of the river and generally asleep at the bottom of his boat if you are stronglunged and can prance and shout for a long time he may eventually stagger to his feet come across for you and row you over otherwise you will stand but little chance of arousing him from his slumbers and you will stop where you are unless you choose to walk round by the bridge at coton a mile above periodical attempts are made by the brisker inhabitants of ashbridge who do not understand its spirit to substitute for this aged and ineffectual charon someone who is occasionally awake but nothing ever results from these revolutionary moves and the requests addressed to the town council on the subject are never heard of again old george was ferryman there before any members of the town council were born and he seems to have established a right to go to sleep on the other side of the river which is now inalienable from him besides asleep or awake he is always perfectly sober which after all is really one of the first requirements for a suitable ferryman even the representations of lord ashbridge himself who when in residence frequently has occasion to use the ferry when crossing from his house to the town failed to produce the smallest effect and he was compelled to build a boathouse of his own on the farther bank and be paddled across by himself or one of the servants often he rowed himself for he used to be a fine oarsman and it was good for the lounger on the quay to see the foaming prow of his vigorous progress and the dignity of physical toil in all other respects except in this case of old george lord ashbridges wishes were law to the local authorities for in this tranquil eastcoast district the spirit of the feudal system with a beneficent lord and contented tenants strongly survived it had triumphed even over such modern innovations as railroads for lord ashbridge had the undoubted right to stop any train he pleased by signal at ashbridge station this he certainly enjoyed doing it fed his sense of the fitness of things to progress along the platform with his genial important tiptoe walk and elbows squarely stuck out to the carriage that was at once reserved for him to touch the brim of his grey tophat if travelling up to town to the obsequious guard and to observe the heads of passengers who wondered why their express was arrested thrust out of carriage windows to look at him a livened footman as well as a valet followed him bearing a coat and a rug and a morning or evening paper and a dispatchbox with a large gilt coronet on it and bestowed these solaces to a railway journey on the empty seats near him and not only his sense of fitness was hereby fed but that also of the stationmaster and the solitary porter and the newsboy and such inhabitants of ashbridge as happened to have strolled on to the platform for he was their earl of ashbridge kind courteous and dominant a local king it was all very pleasant but this arrest of express trains was a strictly personal privilege when lady ashbridge or michael travelled they always went in the slow train to stoneborough changed there and abided their time on the platform like ordinary mortals though he could undoubtedly have extended his rights to the stopping of a train for his wife or son he wisely reserved this for himself lest it should lose prestige there was sufficient glory already to probe his mind to the bottom for lady ashbridge in being his wife it was sufficient also for michael that he was his son it may be inferred that there was a touch of pomposity about this admirable gentleman who was so excellent a landlord and so hard working a member of the british aristocracy but pomposity would be far too superficial a word to apply to him it would not adequately connote his deepabiding and essential conviction that on one of the days of creation that probably on which the decree was made that there should be light there leaped into being the great landowners of england but lord ashbridge though himself a peer by no means accepted the peerage en bloc as representing the english aristocracy to be in his phrase one of us implied that you belonged to certain wellascertained families where brewers and distinguished soldiers had no place unless it was theirs already he was ready to pay all reasonable homage to those who were distinguished by their abilities their riches their exalted positions in church and state but his homage to such was transfused with a courteous condescension and he only treated as his equals and really revered those who belonged to the families that were one of us his wife of course was one of us since he would never have permitted himself to be allied to a woman who was not though for beauty and wisdom she might have been aphrodite and athene rolled compactly into one peerless identity as a matter of fact lady ashbridge had not the faintest resemblance to either of these effulgent goddesses in person she resembled a camel long and lean with a drooping mouth and tired patient eyes while in mind she was stunned no idea other than an obvious one ever had birth behind her high smooth forehead and she habitually brought conversation to a close by the dry enunciation of something indubitably true which had no direct relation to the point under discussion but she had faint ineradicable prejudices and instincts not quite dormant there was a large quantity of mild affection in her nature the quality of which may be illustrated by the fact that when her father died she cried a little every day after breakfast for about six weeks then she did not cry any more it was impossible not to like what there was of her but there was really very little to like for she belonged heart and soul to the generation and the breeding among which it is enough for a woman to be a lady and visit the keepers wife when she has a baby but though there was so little of her the balance was made up for by the fact that there was so much of her husband his large rather flamboyant person his big white face and curling brown beard his loud voice and his falsetto laugh his absolutely certain opinions above all the fervency of his consciousness of being lord ashbridge and all which that implied completely filled any place he happened to be in so that a room empty except for him gave the impression of being almost uncomfortably crowded this keen consciousness of his identity was naturally sufficient to make him very good humoured since he was himself a fine example of the type that he admired most probably only two persons in the world had the power of causing him annoyance but both of these by an irony of fate that it seemed scarcely possible to consider accidental were closely connected with him for one was his sister the other his only son the grounds of their potentiality in this respect can be easily stated barbara comber his sister and so one of us had married an extremely wealthy american who in lord ashbridges view could not be considered one of anybody at all in other words his imagination failed to picture a whole class of people who resembled anthony jerome he had hoped when his sister announced her intention of taking this deplorable step that his future brotherinlaw would at any rate prove to be a snobhe had a vague notion that all americans were snobsand that thus mr jerome would have the saving grace to admire and toady him but mr jerome showed no signs of doing anything of the sort he treated him with an austere and distant politeness that lord ashbridge could not construe as being founded on admiration and a sense of his own inferiority for it was so clearly founded on dislike that however did not annoy lord ashbridge for it was easy to suppose that poor mr jerome knew no better but barbara annoyed him for not only had she shown herself a renegade in marrying a man who was not one of us but with all the advantages she had enjoyed since birth of knowing what we were she gloried in her new relations saying without any proper reticence about the matter that they were real people whose character and wits vastly transcended anything that combers had to show michael was an even more vexatious case and in moments of depression his father thought that he would really turn in his grave at the dismal idea of michael having stepped into his honourable shoes physically he was utterly unlike a comber and his mind his general attitude towards life seemed to have diverged even farther from that healthy and unreflective pattern only this morning his father had received a letter from him that summed michael up that fulfilled all the doubts and fears that had hung about him for after three years in the guards he had without consultation with anybody resigned his commission on the inexplicable grounds that he wanted to do something with his life to begin with that was rankly heretical if you were a comber there was no need to do anything with your life life did everything for you and what this uncomberish young man wanted to do with his life was to be a musician that musicians artists actors had a right to exist lord ashbridge did not question they were no doubt or might be very excellent people in their way and as a matter of fact he often recognised their existence by going to the opera to the private view of the academy or to the play and he took a very considerable pride of proprietorship in his own admirable collection of family portraits but then those were pictures of combers reynolds and romney and the rest of them had enjoyed the privilege of perpetuating on their canvases these big fine men and charming women but that a comberand that one positively the next lord ashbridgeshould intend to devote his energies to an artistic calling and allude to that scheme as doing something with his life was a thing as unthinkable as if the butler had developed a fixed idea that he was one of us the blow was a recent one michaels letter had only reached his father this morning and at the present moment lord ashbridge was attempting over a cup of tea on the long south terrace overlooking the estuary to conveynot very successfullyto his wife something of his feelings on the subject she according to her custom was drinking a little hot water herself and providing her chinese pug with a mixture of cream and crumbled rusks though the dog was of undoubtedly high lineage lord ashbridge rather detested her a musical career he exclaimed referring to michaels letter what sort of a career for a comber is a musical career i shall tell michael pretty roundly when he arrives this evening what i think of it all we shall have francis next saying that he wants to resign too and become a dentist lady ashbridge considered this for a moment in her stunned mind dear me robert i hope not she said i do not think it the least likely that francis would do anything of the kind look petsy is better she has drunk her cream and rusks quite up i think it was only the heat he gave a little goodhumoured giggle of falsetto laughter i wish marion he said that you could manage to take your mind off your dog for a moment and attend to me and i must really ask you not to give your petsy any more cream or she will certainly be sick lady ashbridge gave a little sigh all gone petsy she said i am glad it has all gone said he and we will hope it wont return but about michael now lady ashbridge pulled herself together yes poor michael she said he is coming tonight is he not but just now you were speaking of francis and the fear of his wanting to be a dentist well i am now speaking of michaels wanting to be a musician of course that is utterly out of the question if as he says he has sent in his resignation he will just have to beg them to cancel it michael seems not to have the slightest idea of the duties which his birth and position entail on him unfitted for the life he now leads waste of time instead he proposes to go to baireuth in august and then to settle down in london to study lady ashbridge recollected the almanac that will be in september then she said i do not think i was ever in london in september i did not know that anybody was the point my dear is not how or where you have been accustomed to spend your septembers said her husband what we are talking about is yes dear i know quite well what we are talking about said she we are talking about michael not studying music all september lord ashbridge got up and began walking across the terrace opposite the teatable with his elbows stuck out and his feet lifted rather high michael doesnt seem to realise that he is not tom or dick or harry said he music indeed im musical myself all we combers are musical but michael is my only son and it really distresses me to see how little sense he has of his responsibilities amusements are all very well it is not that i want to cut him off his amusements but when it comes to a career lady ashbridge was surreptitiously engaged in pouring out a little more cream for petsy and her husband turning rather sooner than she had expected caught her in the act do not give petsy any more cream he said with some asperity i absolutely forbid it lady ashbridge quite composedly replaced the creamjug poor petsy she observed i ask you to attend to me marion he said but i am attending to you very well robert said she and i understand you perfectly you do not want michael to be a musician in september and wear long hair and perhaps play at concerts i am sure i quite agree with you for such a thing would be as unheard of in my family as in yours but how do you propose to stop it i shall use my authority he said stepping a little higher yes dear i am sure you will but what will happen if michael doesnt pay any attention to your authority you will be worse off than ever poor michael is very obedient when he is told to do anything he intends to do but when he doesnt agree it is difficult to do anything with him and you see he is quite independent of you with my mother having left him so much money poor mamma lord ashbridge felt strongly about this it was a most extraordinary disposition of her property for your mother to make he observed it has given michael an independence which i much deplore and she did it in direct opposition to my wishes this touched on one of the questions about which lady ashbridge had her convictions she had a mild but unalterable opinion that when anybody died all that they had previously done became absolutely flawless and laudable mamma did as she thought right with her property she said and it is not for us to question it she was conscientiousness itself you will have to excuse my listening to any criticism you may feel inclined to make about her robert certainly my dear i only want you to listen to me about michael you agree with me on the impossibility of his adopting a musical career i cannot at present think so ill of michael as to suppose that he will defy our joint authority michael has a great will of his own she remarked he gets that from you robert though he gets his money from his grandmother the futility of further discussion with his wife began to dawn on lord ashbridge as it dawned on everybody who had the privilege of conversing with her her mind was a blind alley that led nowhere it was clear that she had no idea to contribute to the subject except slightly pessimistic forebodings with which unfortunately he found himself secretly disposed to agree he had always felt that michael was an uncomfortable sort of boy in other words that he had the inconvenient habit of thinking things out for himself instead of blindly accepting the conclusions of other people much as lord ashbridge valued the sturdy independence of character which he himself enjoyed displaying he appreciated it rather less highly when it was manifested by people who were not sensible enough to agree with him he looked forward to michaels arrival that evening with the feeling that there was a rebellious standard hoisted against the calm blue of the evening sky and remembering the advent of his sister he wondered whether she would not join the insurgent barbara jerome as has been remarked often annoyed her brother she also genially laughed at him but lord ashbridge partly from affection partly from a loyal family sense of clanship always expected his sister to spend a fortnight with him in august and would have been much hurt had she refused to do so her husband however so far from spending a fortnight with his brotherinlaw never spent a minute in his presence if it could possibly be avoided an arrangement which everybody concerned considered to be wise and in the interests of cordiality and barbara comes this evening as well as michael does she not he said i hope she will not take michaels part in his absurd scheme i have given barbara the blue room said lady ashbridge after a little thought i am afraid she may bring her great dog with her i hope he will not quarrel with petsy petsy does not like other dogs the day had been very hot and lord ashbridge not having taken any exercise went off to have a round of golf with the professional of the links that lay not half a mile from the house he considered exercise an essential part of the true englishmans daily curriculum and as necessary a contribution to the traditional mode of life which made them all what they wereor should beas a bath in the morning or attendance at church on sunday he did not care so much about playing golf with a casual friend because the casual friend as a rule casually beat himthus putting him in an unenglish positionand preferred a game with this firstclass professional whose duty it wasin complete violation of his capacitiesto play just badly enough to be beaten towards the end of the round after an exciting match it required a good deal of cleverness and selfcontrol to accomplish this for lord ashbridge was a notably puerile performer but he generally managed it with tact and success by dint of missing absurdly easy putts and here his skill came in by pulling and slicing his ball into fardistant bunkers throughout the game it was his business to keep up a running fire of admiring ejaculations such as well driven my lord or a fine putt my lord ah dear me i wish i could putt like that though occasionally his chorus of praise betrayed him into error and from habit he found himself saying good shot my lord when my lord had just made an egregious mess of things but on the whole he devised so pleasantly sycophantic an atmosphere as to procure a substantial tip for himself and to make lord ashbridge conscious of being a very superior performer whether at the bottom of his heart he knew he could not play at all he probably did not inquire the result of his matches and his opponents skilfullyshowered praise was sufficient for him so now he left the discouraging companionship of his wife and petsy and walked swingingly across the garden and the park to the links there to seek in macphersons applause the selfconfidence that would enable him to encounter his republican sister and his musical son with an unyielding front his spirits mounted rapidly as he went it pleased him to go jauntily across the lawn and reflect that all this smooth turf was his to look at the wealth of welltended flowers in his garden and know that all this polychromatic loveliness was bred in lord ashbridges borders and was graciously thrown open to the gaze of the admiring public on sunday afternoon when they were begged to keep off the grass and that lord ashbridge was himself he liked reminding himself that the towering elms drew their leafy verdure from lord ashbridges soil that the rows of hencoops in the park populous and cheeping with infant pheasants belonged to the same fortunate gentleman who in november would so unerringly shoot them down as they rocketted swiftly over the highest of his treetops that to him also appertained the longfronted jacobean house which stood so commandingly upon the hilltop and glowed with all the mellowness of its threehundredyearsold bricks and his satisfaction was not wholly fatuous nor entirely personal all these spacious dignities were insignia temporarily conferred on him like some order and permanently conferred on his family of the splendid political constitution under which england had made herself mistress of an empire and the seas that guarded it probably he would have been proud of belonging to that even if he had not been one of us as it was the high position which he occupied in it caused that pride to be slightly mixed with the pride that was concerned with the notion of the empire belonging to him and his peers but though he was the most profound of tories he would truthfully have professed as indeed he practised in the management of his estates the most liberal opinions as to schemes for the amelioration of the lower classes only just as the music he was good enough to listen to had to be played for him so the tenants and farmers had to be his dependents he looked after them very well indeed conceiving this to be the prime duty of a great landlord but his interest in them was really proprietary it was of his bounty and of his complete knowledge of what his duties as one of us were that he did so and any legislation which compelled him to part with one pennyworth of his property for the sake of others less fortunate he resisted to the best of his ability as a theft of what was his the country in fact if it went to the dogs and certain recent legislation distinctly seemed to point kennelwards would go to the dogs because ignorant politicians who were most emphatically not of us forced him and others like him to recognise the rights of dependents instead of trusting to their instinctive fitness to dispense benefits not as rights but as acts of grace if england trusted to her aristocracy to put the matter in a nutshell all would be well with her in the future even as it had been in the past but any attempt to curtail their splendours must inevitably detract from the prestige and magnificence of the empire and he responded suitably to the obsequious salute of the professional and remembered that the entire golf links were his property and that the club paid a merely nominal rental to him just the tribute money of a penny which was due to caesar for the next hour or two after her husband had left her lady ashbridge occupied herself in the thoroughly ladylike pursuit of doing nothing whatever she just existed in her comfortable chair since barbara might come any moment and she would have to entertain her which she frequently did unawares but as barbara continued not to come she took up her perennial piece of needlework feeling rather busy and pressed and had hardly done so when her sisterinlaw arrived she was preceded by an enormous staghound who having been shut up in her motor all the way from london bounded delightedly with the sense of young limbs released on to the terrace and made wild leaps in a circle round the horrified petsy who had just received a second saucerful of cream once he dashed in close and with a single lick of his tongue swept the saucer dry of nutriment and with hoarse barkings proceeded again to dance corybantically about while lady ashbridge with faint cries of dismay waved her embroidery at him then seeing his mistress coming out of the french window from the drawingroom he bounded calflike towards her and petsy nearly sick with cream and horror was gathered to lady ashbridges bosom my dear barbara she said how upsetting your dog is poor petsys heart is beating terribly she does not like dogs but i am very pleased to see you and i have given you the blue room it was clearly suitable that barbara jerome should have a large dog for both in mind and body she was on the large scale herself she had a pleasant highcoloured face was very tall enormously stout and moved with great briskness and vigour she had something to say on any subject that came on the board and what was less usual in these days of universal knowledge there was invariably some point in what she said she had in the ordinary sense of the word no manners at all but essentially made up for this lack by her sincere and humourous kindliness she saw with acute vividness the ludicrous side of everybody herself included and to her mind the archhumourist of all was her brother whom she was quite unable to take seriously she dressed as if she had looted a milliners shop and had put on in a great hurry anything that came to hand she towered over her sisterinlaw as she kissed her and petsy safe in her citadel barked shrilly my dear which is the blue room she said i hope it is big enough for og and me yes that is og which is short for dog he takes two muttonchops for dinner and a little something during the night if he feels disposed because he is still growing tony drove down with me and is in the car now he would not come in for fear of seeing robert so i ventured to tell them to take him a cup of tea there which he will drink with the blinds down and then drive back to town again he has been made american ambassador by the way and will go in to dinner before robert my dear i can think of few things which robert is less fitted to bear than that however we all have our crosses even those of us who have our coronets also lady ashbridges hospitable instincts asserted themselves but your husband must come in she said i will go and tell him and robert has gone to play golf barbara laughed i am quite sure tony wont come in she said i promised him he shouldnt and he only drove down with me on the express stipulation that no risks were to be run about his seeing robert we must take no chances so let him have his tea quietly in the motor and then drive away again and who else is there anybody michael michael comes this evening i am glad i am particularly fond of michael also he will play to us after dinner and though i dont know one note from another it will relieve me of sitting in a stately circle watching robert cheat at patience i always find the evenings here rather trying they remind me of being in church i feel as if i were part of a corporate body which leads to misplaced decorum ah there is the sound of tonys retreating motor his strategic movement has come off and now give me some news if you can get in a word dear me there is robert coming back across the lawn what a mercy that tony did not leave the motor robert always walks as if he was dancing a minuet look there is og imitating him or is he stalking him thinking he is an enemy og come here she whistled shrilly on her fingers and rose to greet her brother whom og was still menacing as he advanced towards her with staccato steps barbara however got between og and his prey and threw her parasol at him my dear how are you she said and how did the golf go and did you beat the professional he suspected flippancy here and became markedly dignified an excellent match he said and macpherson tells me i played a very sound game i am delighted to see you barbara and did michael come down with you no i drove from town it saves time but not expense with your awful trains and you are well and mr jerome he asked he always called his brotherinlaw mr jerome to indicate the gulf between them barbara gave a little spurt of laughter yes his excellency is quite well she said you must call him excellency now my dear indeed that is a great step considering that tony began as an officeboy how richly rewarding you are my dear and shant i make an odd ambassadress i havent been to a court since the dark ages when i went to those beloved states we will practise after dinner dear and you and marion shall be the king and queen and i will try to walk backwards without tumbling on my head you will like being the king robert and then we will be ourselves again all except og who shall be tony and shall go out of the room before you he gave his treble little giggle for on the whole it answered better not to be dignified with barbara whenever he could remember not to be and lady ashbridge still nursing petsy threw a bombshell of the obvious to explode the conversation og has two muttonchops for his dinner she said and he is growing still fancy lord ashbridge took a refreshing glance at the broad stretch of country that all belonged to him i am rather glad to have this opportunity of talking to you my dear barbara he said before michael comes his train gets in half an hour before dinner said lady ashbridge he has to change at stoneborough quite so i heard from michael this morning saying that he has resigned his commission in the guards and is going to take up music seriously barbara gave a delighted exclamation but how perfectly splendid she said fancy a comber doing anything original michael and i are the only combers who ever have since combers arose from out the azure main in the year one i married an american thats something though its not up to michael that is not quite my view of it said he as for its being original it would be original enough if marion eloped with a patagonian lady ashbridge let fall her embroidery at this monstrous suggestion you are talking very wildly robert she said in a pained voice my dear get on with your sacred carpet said he i am talking to barbara i have already ascertained youryour lack of views on the subject i was saying barbara that mere originality is not a merit no you never said that remarked lady ashbridge i should have if you had allowed me to and as for your saying that he has done it barbara that is very wide of the mark and i intend shall continue to be so dear great bashaw that is just what you said to me when i told you i was going to marry his excellency but i did and i think it is a glorious move on michaels part it requires brain to find out what you like and character to go and do it combers havent got brains as a rule you see if they ever had any they have degenerated into conservative instincts he again refreshed himself with the landscape the roofs of ashbridge were visible in the clear sunset ashbridge paid its rents with remarkable regularity that may or may not be so he said forgetting for a moment the danger of being dignified but combers have position barbara controlled herself admirably a slight tremor shook her which he did not notice yes dear she said i allow that combers have had for many generations a sort of acquisitive cunning for all we possess has come to us by exceedingly prudent marriages they have alsoi am an exception herethe gift of not saying very much which certainly has an impressive effect even when it arises from not having very much to say they are sticky they attract wealth and they have the force called vis inertiae which means that they invest their money prudently you should hear tonywell perhaps you had better not hear tony but now here is michael showing that he has got tastes can you wonder that im delighted and not only has he got tastes but he has the strength of character to back them michael in the guards too it was a perfect farce and hes had the sense to see it he hated his duties and he hated his diversions now francis i am afraid michael has always been a little jealous of francis remarked his father this roused barbara she spoke quite seriously if you really think that my dear she said you have the distinction of being the worst possible judge of character that the world has ever known michael might be jealous of anybody else for the poor boy feels his physical awkwardness most sensitively but francis is just the one person he really worships he would do anything in the world for him the discussion with barbara was being even more fruitless than that with his wife and lord ashbridge rose all i can do then is to ask you not to back michael up he said my dear he wont need backing up hes a match for you by himself but if michael after thoroughly worsting you asks me my opinion i shall certainly give it him but he wont ask my opinion first he will strew your limbs robert over this delightful terrace michaels train is late said lady ashbridge hearing the stable clock strike he should have been here before this barbara had still a word to say and disregarded this quencher but dont think robert she said that because michael resists your wishes and authority he will be enjoying himself he will hate doing it but that will not stop him lord ashbridge was not a bully he had merely a profound sense of his own importance we will see about resistance he said barbara was not so successful on this occasion and exploded loudly you will dear indeed she said michael meantime had been travelling down from london without perturbing himself over the scene with his father which he knew lay before him this was quite characteristic of him he had a singular command over his imagination when he had made up his mind to anything and never indulged in the gratuitous pain of anticipation today he had an additional bulwark against such selfinflicted worries for he had spent his last two hours in town at the vocal recital of a singer who a month before had stirred the critics into rhapsody over her gift of lyric song up till now he had had no opportunity of hearing her and with the panegyrics that had been showered on her in his mind he had gone with the expectation of disappointment but now an hour afterwards the wheels of the train sang her songs and in the inward ear he could recapture with the vividness of an hallucination the timbre of that wonderful voice and also the sweet harmonies of the pianist who accompanied her the hall had been packed from end to end and he had barely got to his seat the only one vacant in the whole room when miss sylvia falbe appeared followed at once by her accompanist whose name occurred nowhere on the programme two neighbours however who chatted shrilly during the applause that greeted them informed him that this was hermann dear hermann there is no one like him but it occurred to michael that the singer was like him though she was fair and he dark but his perception of either of them visually was but vague he had come to hear and not to see neither she nor hermann had any music with them and hermann just glanced at the programme which he put down on the top of the piano which again unusually was open then without pause they began the set of german songsbrahms schubert schumannwith which the recital opened and for one moment before he lost himself in the ecstasy of hearing michael found himself registering the fact that sylvia falbe had one of the most charming faces he had ever seen the next he was swallowed up in melody she had the ease of the consummate artist and each note like the gates of the new jerusalem was a pearl round and smooth and luminous almost so that it was as if manycoloured light came from her lips nor was that all it seemed as if the accompaniment was made by the song itself coming into life with the freshness of the dawn of its creation it was impossible to believe that one mind directed the singer and another the pianist and if the voice was an example of art in excelsis not less exalted was the perfection of the player not for a moment through the song did he take his eyes off her he looked at her with an intensity of gaze that seemed to be reading the emotion with which the lovely melody filled her for herself she looked straight out over the hall with grey eyes halfclosed and mouth that in the pauses of her song was large and fulllipped generously curving and face that seemed lit with the light of the morning she sang of she was the song michael thought of her as just that and the pianist who watched and understood her so unerringly was the song too they had for him no identity of their own they were as remote from everyday life as the mind of schumann which they made so vivid it was then that they existed the last song of the group she sang in english for it was who is sylvia there was a buzz of smiles and whispers among the front row in the pause before it and regaining her own identity for a moment she smiled at a group of her friends among whom clearly it was a cliche species of joke that she should ask who sylvia was and enumerate her merits when all the time she was sylvia michael felt rather impatient at this she was not anybody just now but a singer and then came the divine inevitable simplicity of perfect words and the melody preordained for them the singer as he knew was german but she had no trace of foreign accent it seemed to him that this was just one miracle the more she had become english because she was singing what shakespeare wrote the next group consisting of modern french songs appeared to michael utterly unworthy of the singer and the echoing piano if you had it in you to give reality to great and simple things it was surely a waste to concern yourself with these little morbid melancholy manikins these marionettes but his emotions being unoccupied he attended more to the manner of the performance and in especial to the marvellous technique not so much of the singer but of the pianist who caused the rain to fall and the waters reflect the toneless grey skies he had never even when listening to the great masters heard so flawless a comprehension as this anonymous player incidentally known as hermann exhibited as far as mere manipulation went it was as might perhaps be expected entirely effortless but effortless no less was the understanding of the music it happened it was like that all of this so filled michaels mind as he travelled down that evening to ashbridge that he scarcely remembered the errand on which he went and when it occurred to him it instantly sank out of sight again lost in the recollection of the music which he had heard today and which belonged to the art that claimed the allegiance of his soul the rattle of the wheels was alchemised into song and as with halfclosed eyes he listened to it there swam across it now the full face of the singer now the profile of the pianist that had stood out white and intent against the dark panelling behind his head he had gleaned one fact at the boxoffice as he hurried out to catch his train this hermann was the singers brother a teacher of the piano in london and apparently highly thought of chapter iii michaels train as his mother had so infallibly pronounced was late and he had arrived only just in time to hurry to his room and dress quickly in order not to add to his crimes the additional one of unpunctuality for unpunctuality so lord ashbridge held was the politeness not only of kings but of all who had any pretence to decent breeding his father gave him a carefullyiced welcome his mother the tip of her long camellike lips and they waited solemnly for the appearance of aunt barbara who it would seem had forfeited her claims to family by her marriage a manservant and a half looked after each of them at dinner and the twelve lord ashbridges in uniform looked down from their illuminated frames on their degenerate descendant the only bright spot in this portentous banquet was aunt barbara who had chosen that evening with what intention may possibly be guessed to put on an immense diamond tiara and a breastplate of rubies while og after one futile attempt to play with the footmen yielded himself up to the chilling atmosphere of good breeding and ate his muttonchops with great composure but aunt barbara fortified by her gems ate an excellent dinner and talked all the time with occasional bursts of unexplained laughter afterwards when michael was left alone with his father he found that his best efforts at conversation elicited only monosyllabic replies and at last in the despairing desire to bring things to a head he asked him if he had received his letter an affirmative monosyllable followed by the hissing of lord ashbridges cigarette end as he dropped it into his coffee cup answered him and he perceived that the approaching storm was to be rendered duly impressive by the thundery stillness that preceded it then his father rose and as he passed michael who held the door open for him said if you can spare the time michael i would like to have a talk with you when your mother and aunt have gone to bed that was not very long delayed michael imagined that aunt barbara must have had a hint for before halfpast ten she announced with a skilfully suppressed laugh that she was about to retire and kissed michael affectionately both her laugh and her salute were encouraging he felt that he was being backed up then a procession of footmen came into the room bearing lemonade and soda water and whiskey and a plate of plain biscuits and the moment after he was alone with his father lord ashbridge rose and walked very tall and majestic to the fireplace where he stood for a moment with his back to his son then he turned round now about this nonsense of your resigning your commission michael he said i dont propose to argue about it and i am just going to tell you if as you have informed me you have actually sent it in you will write tomorrow with due apologies and ask that it may be withdrawn i will see your letter before you send it michael had intended to be as quiet and respectful as possible consistent with firmness but a sentence here gave him a spasm of anger i dont know what you mean sir he said by saying if i have sent it in you have received my letter in which i tell you that i have done so already even at the first words there was bad blood between them michaels face had clouded with that gloom which his father would certainly call sulky and for himself he resented the tone of michaels reply to make matters worse he gave his little falsetto cackle which no doubt was intended to convey the impression of confident good humour but there was it must be confessed very little good humour about it though he still felt no serious doubt about the result of this interview im afraid perhaps then that i did not take your letter quite seriously my dear michael he said in the bantering tone that froze michaels cordiality completely up i glanced through it i saw a lot of nonsenseor so it struck meabout your resigning your commission and studying music i think you mentioned baireuth and settling down in london afterwards yes i said all that said michael but you make a mistake if you do not see that it was written seriously his father glanced across at him where he sat with his heavy plain face his long arms and short legs and the sight merely irritated him with his passion for convention and one of the most important conventions was that combers should be fine strapping normal people he hated the thought that it was his son who presented that appearance and his sons mind seemed to him at this moment as ungainly as his person again very unwisely he laughed still thinking to carry this off by the high hand yes but i cant take that rubbish seriously he said i am asking your permission now to inquire without any nonsense into what you mean michael frowned he felt the insincerity of his fathers laugh and rebelled against the unfairness of it the question he knew well was sarcastically asked the flavour of irony in the permission to inquire was not there by accident to speak like that implied contempt of his opposition he felt that he was being treated like a child over some nursery rebellion in which subsequently there is no real possibility of disobedience he felt his anger rising in spite of himself if you refer to it as rubbish sir there is the end of the matter ah i thought we should soon agree said lord ashbridge chuckling you mistake me said michael there is the end of the matter because i wont discuss it any more if you treat me like this i will say good night if you intend to persist in the idea that you can just brush my resolves away like that this clearly took his father aback it was a perfectly dignified and proper attitude to take in the face of ridicule and lord ashbridge though somewhat an adept at the art of selfdeceptionas for instance when he habitually beat the golf professionalcould not disguise from himself that his policy had been to laugh and blow away michaels absurd ideas but it was abundantly clear at this moment that this apparently easy operation was out of his reach he got up with more amenity in his manner than he had yet shown and laid his hand on michaels shoulder as he stood in front of him evidently quite prepared to go away come my dear michael this wont do he said i thought it best to treat your absurd schemes with a certain lightness and i have only succeeded in irritating you michael was perfectly aware that he had scored and as his object was to score he made another criticism when you say absurd schemes sir he said with quiet respect are you not still laughing at them lord ashbridge again retreated strategically very well i withdraw absurd he said now sit down again and we will talk tell me what is in your mind michael made a great effort with himself he desired in the secret real michael to be reasonable and cordial to behave filially while all the time his nerves were on edge with his fathers ridicule and with his instinctive knowledge of his fathers distaste for him well its like this father he said im doing no good as i am i went into the guards as you know because it was the right thing to do a business mans son is put into business for the same reason and im not good at it michael paused a moment my heart isnt in it he said and i dislike it it seems to me useless were for show and my heart is quite entirely in music its the thing i care for more than anything else again he paused all that came so easily to his tongue when he was speaking to francis was congealed now when he felt the contempt with which though unexpressed he knew he inspired his father lord ashbridge waited with careful politeness his eyes fixed on the ceiling his large person completely filling his chair just as his atmosphere filled the room he said nothing at all until the silence rang in michaels ears that is all i can tell you he said at length lord ashbridge carefully conveyed the ash from his cigarette to the fireplace before he spoke he felt that the time had come for his most impressive effort very well then listen to me he said what you suffer from michael is a mere want of selfconfidence and from modesty you dont seem to graspi have often noticed thiswho you are and what your importance isan importance which everybody is willing to recognise if you will only assume it you have the privileges of your position which you dont sufficiently value but you have also the responsibilities of it which i am afraid you are inclined to shirk you havent got the large view you havent the sense of patriotism there are a great many things in my positionthe position into which you will stepwhich i would much sooner be without but we have received a tradition and we are bound to hand it on intact you may think that this has nothing to do with your being in the guards but it has weand he seemed to swell a littlewe are bound in honour to take the lead in the service of our country and we must do it whether we like it or not we have to till with our own efforts our goodly heritage you have to learn the meaning of such words as patriotism and caste and duty lord ashbridge thought that he was really putting this very well indeed and he had the sustaining consciousness of sincerity he entirely believed what he said and felt that it must carry conviction to anyone who listened to it with anything like an open mind the only thing that he did not allow for was that he personally immensely enjoyed his social and dominant position thinking it indeed the only position which was really worth having this naturally gave an aid to comprehension and he did not take into account that michael was not so blessed as he and indeed lacked this very superior individual enlightenment but his own words kindled the flame of this illumination and without noticing the blank stolidity of michaels face he went on with gathering confidence i am sure you are highminded my dear michael he said and it is to your highmindedness that iyes i dont mind saying itthat i appeal in a moment of unreflectiveness you have thrown overboard what i am sure is real to you the sense broadly speaking that you are english and of the highest english class and have intended to devote yourself to more selfish and pleasureloving aims and to dwell in a tinkle of pleasant sounds that please your ear and im sure i dont wonder because as your mother and i both know you play charmingly but i feel confident that your better mind does not really confuse the mere diversions of life with its serious issues michael suddenly rose to his feet father im afraid this is no use at all he said all that i feel and all that i cant say i know is unintelligible to you you have called it rubbish once and you think it is rubbish still lord ashbridges eloquence was suddenly arrested he had been cantering gleefully along and had the very distinct impression of having run up against a stone wall he dismounted hurt but in no way broken i am anxious to understand you michael he said yes father but you dont said he you have been explaining me all wrong for instance i dont regard music as a diversion that is the only explanation there is of me and as regards my wishes and my authority asked his father michael squared his shoulders and his mind i am exceedingly sorry to disappoint you in the matter of your wishes he said but in the matter of your authority i cant recognise it when the question of my whole life is at stake i know that i am your son and i want to be dutiful but i have my own individuality as well that only recognises the authority of my own conscience that seemed to lord ashbridge both tragic and ludicrous completely subservient himself to the conventions which he so much enjoyed it was like the defiance of a child to say such things he only just checked himself from laughing again i refuse to take that answer from you he said i have no other to give you said michael but i should like to say once more that i am sorry to disobey your wishes the repetition took away his desire to laugh in fact he could not have laughed i dont want to threaten you michael he said but you may know that i have a very free hand in the disposal of my property is that a threat asked michael it is a hint then father i can only say that i should be perfectly satisfied with anything you may do said michael i wish you could leave everything you have to francis i tell you in all sincerity that i wish he had been my elder brother you would have been far better pleased with him lord ashbridges anger rose he was naturally so selfcomplacent as to be seldom disposed to anger but its rarity was not due to kindliness of nature i have before now noticed your jealousy of your cousin he observed michaels face went white that is infamous and untrue father he said lord ashbridge turned on him apologise for that he said michael looked up at his high towering without a tremor i wait for the withdrawal of your accusation that i am jealous of francis he replied there was a dead silence lord ashbridge stood there in swollen and speechless indignation and michael faced him undismayed and then suddenly to the boy there came an impulse of pure pity for his fathers disappointment in having a son like himself he saw with the candour which was so real a part of him how hopeless it must be to a man of his fathers mind to have a millstone like himself unalterably bound round his neck fit to choke and drown him indeed i am not jealous of francis father he said and i speak quite truthfully when i say how i sympathise with you in having a son like me i dont want to vex you i want to make the best of myself lord ashbridge stood looking exactly like his statue in the marketplace at ashbridge if that is the case michael he said it is within your power you will write the letter i spoke about michael paused a moment as if waiting for more it did not seem to him possible that his appeal should bear no further fruit than that but it was soon clear that there was no more to come i will wish you good night father he said sunday was a day on which lord ashbridge was almost more himself than during the week so shining and public an example did he become of the british nobleman instead of having breakfast according to the middleclass custom rather later than usual that solid sausagy meal was half an hour earlier so that all the servants except those whose presence in the house was imperatively necessary for purposes of lunch should go to church thus old george and lord ashbridges private boat were exceedingly busy for the halfhour preceding church time the last boatload holding the family whose arrival was the signal for service to begin lady ashbridge however always went on earlier for she presided at the organ with the long camellike back turned towards the congregation and started playing a slow melancholy voluntary when the boy who blew the bellows said to her in an ecclesiastical whisper his lordship has arrived my lady those of the household who could sing singing being construed in the sense of making a loud and cheerful noise in the throat clustered in the choirpews near the organ while the family sat in a large square box with a stove in the centre amply supplied with prayerbooks of the time when even protestants might pray for queen caroline behind them separated from the rest of the church by an ornamental ironwork grille was the comber chapel in which antiquarians took nearly as much pleasure as lord ashbridge himself here reclined a glorious company of sixteenth century knights with their honourable ladies at their sides unyielding marble bolsters at their heads and grotesque dogs at their feet later when their peerage was conferred they lost a little of their yeoman simplicity and became peruked and robed and breeched one indeed in the age of george iii who was blessed with poetical aspirations appeared in bare feet and a roman toga with a scroll of manuscript in his hand while later again mere tablets on the walls commemorated their almost uncanny virtues and just on the other side of the grille but a step away sat the presentday representatives of the line while lady ashbridge finished the last bars of her voluntary lord ashbridge himself and his sister large and smart and comely and michael beside them short and heavy with his soul full of the aspirations his father neither could nor cared to understand according to his invariable custom lord ashbridge read the lessons in a loud sonorous voice his large white hands grasping the wingfeathers of the brass eagle and a great carnation in his buttonhole and when the time came for the offertory he put a sovereign in the open plate himself and proceeded with his minuetlike step to go round the church and collect the gifts of the encouraged congregation he followed all the prayers in his book he made the responses in a voice nearly as loud as that in which he read the lessons he sang the hymns with a curious buzzing sound and never for a moment did he lose sight of the fact that he was the head of the comber family doing his duty as the custom of the combers was and setting an example of godly piety afterwards as usual he would change his black coat eat a good lunch stroll round the gardens for he had nothing to say to golf on sunday and in the evening the clergyman would dine with him and would be requested to say grace both before and after the meal he knew exactly the proper mode of passing the sunday for the landlord on his country estate and when lord ashbridge knew that a thing was proper he did it with invariable precision michael of course was in disgrace his father pending some further course of action neither spoke to him nor looked at him indeed it seemed doubtful whether he would hand him the offertory plate and it was perhaps a pity that he unbent even to this extent for michael happened to have none of the symbols of thankfulness about his person and he saw a slight quiver pass through aunt barbaras hymnbook after a rather portentous lunch however there came some relief for his father did not ask his company on the usual sunday afternoon stroll and aunt barbara never walked at all unless she was obliged in consequence when the thunderstorm had stepped airily away across the park michael joined her on the terrace with the intention of talking the situation over with her aunt barbara was perfectly willing to do this and she opened the discussion very pleasantly with peals of laughter my dear i delight in you she said and altogether this is the most entertaining day i have ever spent here combers are supposed to be very serious solid people but for unconscious humour there isnt a family in england or even in the states to compare with them our lunch just now if you could put it into a satirical comedy called the aristocracy it would make the fortune of any theatre a dawning smile began to break through michaels tragedy face i suppose it was rather funny he said but really im wretched about it aunt barbara my dear what is there to be wretched about you might have been wretched if you had found you couldnt stand up to your father but i gather though i know nothing directly that you did at least your mother has said to me three times twice on the way to church and once coming back michael has vexed his father very much and the offertory plate my dear and as i was saying lunch i am in disgrace too because i said perfectly plainly yesterday that i was on your side and there we were at lunch with your father apparently unable to see either you or me and unconscious of our presence fancy pretending not to see me you cant help seeing me a large bright object like me and what will happen next thats what tickles me to death as they say on my side of the atlantic will he gradually begin to perceive us again like objects looming through a fog or shall we come into view suddenly as if going round a corner and you are just as funny my dear with your long face and air of depressed determination why be heavy michael so many people are heavy and none of them can tell you why it was impossible not to feel the unfreezing effect of this michael thawed to it as he would have thawed to francis perhaps they cant help it aunt barbara he said at least i know i cant i really wish i could learn how to ii dont see the funny side of things till it is pointed out i thought lunch a sort of hell you know of course it was funny his appearing not to see either of us but it stands for more than that it stands for his complete misunderstanding of me aunt barbara had the sense to see that the real michael was speaking when people were being unreal when they were pompous or adopting attitudes she could attend to nothing but their absurdity which engrossed her altogether but she never laughed at real things real things were not funny but were facts he quite misunderstands went on michael with the eagerness with which the shy welcome comprehension he thinks i can make my mind like his if i choose and if i dont choose or rather cant choose he thinks that his wishes his authority should be sufficient to make me act as if it was well i wont do that he may go onand that pleasant smile lit up michaels plain facehe may go on being unaware of my presence as long as he pleases i am very sorry it should be so but i cant help it and the worst of it is that opposition of that sorthis sortmakes me more determined than ever aunt barbara nodded and your friends she asked what will they think michael looked at her quite simply and directly friends he said i havent got any ah my dear thats nonsense she said i wish it was oh francis is a friend i know he thinks me an odd old thing but he likes me other people dont and i cant see why they should im sure its my fault its because im heavy you said i was yourself then i was a great ass remarked aunt barbara you wouldnt be heavy with people who understood you you arent heavy with me for instance but my dear lead isnt in it when you are with your father but what am i to do if im like that asked the boy she held up her large fat hand and marked the points off on her fingers three things she said firstly get away from people who dont understand you and whom incidentally you dont understand secondly try to see how ridiculous you and everybody else always are and thirdly which is much the most important dont think about yourself if i thought about myself i should consider how old and fat and ugly i am im not ugly really you neednt be foolish and tell me so i should spoil my life by trying to be young and only eating devilled codfish and drinking hot plumjuice or whatever is the accepted remedy for what we call obesity were all odd old things as you say we can only get away from that depressing fact by doing something and not thinking about ourselves we can all try not to be egoists egoism is the really heavy quality in the world she paused a moment in this inspired discourse and whistled to og who had stretched his weary limbs across a bed of particularly fine geraniums there she said pointing if your dog had done that you would be submerged in depression at the thought of how vexed your father would be that would be because you are thinking of the effect on yourself as its my dog that has done itdear me they do look squashed now he has got upyou dont really mind about your fathers vexation because you wont have to think about yourself that is wise of you if you were a little wiser still you would picture to yourself how ridiculous i shall look apologising for og kindly kick him michael he will understand naughty and as for your not having any friends that would be exceedingly sad if you had gone the right way to get them and failed but you havent you havent even gone among the people who could be your friends your friends broadly speaking must like the same sort of things as you there must be a common basis you cant even argue with somebody or disagree with somebody unless you have a common ground to start from if i say that black is white and you think it is blue we cant get on it leads nowhere and finally she turned round and faced him directly finally dont be so cross my dear she said but am i asked he yes you dont know it or else probably since you are a very decent fellow you wouldnt be you expect not to be liked and that is cross of you a goodhumoured person expects to be liked and almost always is you expect not to be understood and thats dreadfully cross you think your father doesnt understand you no more he does but dont go on thinking about it you think it is a great bore to be your fathers only son and wish francis was instead thats cross you may think its fine but it isnt and it is also ungrateful you can have great fun if you will only be goodtempered how did you know thatabout francis i mean asked michael does it happen to be true of course it does every cross young man wishes he was somebody else no not quite that began michael dont interrupt it is sufficiently accurate and you think about your appearance my dear it will do quite well you might have had two noses or only one eye whereas you have two rather jolly ones and do try to see the joke in other people michael you didnt see the joke in your interview last night with your father it must have been excruciatingly funny i dont say it wasnt sad and serious as well but it was funny too there were points michael shook his head i didnt see them he said but i should have and i should have been right all dignity is funny simply because it is sham when dignity is real you dont know its dignity but your father knew he was being dignified and you knew you were being dignified my dear what a pair of you michael frowned but is nothing serious then he asked surely it was serious enough last night there was i in rank rebellion to my father and it vexed him horribly it did more it grieved him she laid her hand on michaels knee as if i didnt know that she said were all sorry for that though i should have been much sorrier if you had given in and ceased to vex him but there it is accept that and then my dear swiftly apply yourself to perceive the humour of it and now about your plans i shall go to baireuth on wednesday and then on to munich began michael that of course perhaps you may find the humour of a channel crossing i look for it in vain yet i dont know the man who puts on a yachtingcap and asks if theres a bit of a sea on it proves to be the case and he is excessively unwell i must look out for him next time i cross and then then i shall settle in town and study oh heres my father coming home lord ashbridge approached down the terrace he stopped for a moment at the desecrated geranium bed saw the two sitting together and turned at right angles and went into the house almost immediately a footman came out with a long doglead and advanced hesitatingly to og og was convinced that he had come to play with him and crouched and growled and retreated and advanced with engaging affability out of the windows of the library looked lord ashbridges baleful face aunt barbara swayed out of her chair and laid a trembling hand on michaels shoulder i shall go and apologise for og she said i shall do it quite sincerely my dear but there are points chapter iv michael practised a certain mature and rather elderly precision in the ordinary affairs of daily life his habits were almost unduly tidy and punctual he answered letters by return of post he never mislaid things nor tore up documents which he particularly desired should be preserved he kept his gold in a purse and his change in a trouserspocket and in matters of travelling he always arrived at stations with plenty of time to spare and had such creature comforts as he desired for his journey in a neat gladstone bag above his head he never travelled firstclass for the very simple and adequate reason that though very well off he preferred to spend his money in ways that were more productive of usefulness or pleasure and thus when he took his place in the corner of a secondclass compartment of the doverostend express on the wednesday morning following he was the only occupant of it probably he had never felt so fully at liberty nor enjoyed a keener zest for life and the future for the first time he had asserted his own indisputable right to stand on his own feet and though he was genuinely sorry for his fathers chagrin at not being able to tuck him up in the family coach his own sense of independence could not but wave its banners there had been a second interview no less fruitless than the first and lord ashbridge had told him that when next his presence was desired at home he would be informed of the fact his mother had cried in a mild trickling fashion but it was quite obvious that in her heart of hearts she was more concerned with a bilious attack of peculiar intensity that had assailed petsy she wished michael would not be so disobedient and vex his father but she was quite sure that before long some formula in diplomatic phrase would be found on which reconciliation could be based whereas it was highly uncertain whether any formula could be found that would produce the desired effect on petsy whose illness she attributed to the shock of ogs sudden and disconcerting appearance on saturday when all petsys nervous force was required to digest the copious cream consequently though she threw reproachful glances at michael those directed at barbara who was the cause of the acuter tragedy were pointed with more penetrating blame indeed it is questionable whether lady ashbridge would have cried at all over michaels affairs had not petsys also been in so lamentable and critical a state just as the train began to move out of the station a young man rushed across the platform eluded the embrace of the guard who attempted to stop him with amazing agility and jumped into michaels compartment he slammed the door after him and leaned out apparently looking for someone whom he soon saw just caught it sylvia he shouted send on my luggage will you its in the taxi still i think and i havent paid the man goodbye darling he waved to her till the curving line took the platform out of sight and then sat down with a laugh and eyes of friendly interest for michael narrow squeak wasnt it he said gleefully i thought the guard had collared me and i should have missed parsifal michael had recognised him at once as he rushed across the platform his shouting to sylvia had but confirmed the recognition and here on the day of his entering into his new kingdom of liberty was one of its citizens almost thrown into his arms but for the moment his old invincible habit of shyness and sensitiveness forbade any responsive lightness of welcome and he was merely formal merely courteous and all your luggage left behind he said wont you be dreadfully uncomfortable uncomfortable why asked falbe i shall buy a handkerchief and a collar every day and a shirt and a pair of socks every other day till it arrives michael felt a sudden daring impulse he remembered aunt barbaras salutary remarks about crossness being the equivalent of thinking about oneself and the effort that it cost him may be taken as the measure of his solitary disposition but you neednt do that he said ifif you will be good enough to borrow of me till your things come he blurted it out awkwardly almost brusquely and falbe looked slightly amused at this wholly surprising offer of hospitality but thats awfully good of you he said laughing and saying nothing direct about his acceptance it implies too that you are going to baireuth we travel together then i hope for it is dismal work travelling alone isnt it my sister tells me that half my friends were picked up in railway carriages been there before michael felt himself lured from the ordinary aloofness of attitude and demeanour which had been somewhat accustomed to view all strangers with suspicion and yet though till this moment he had never spoken to him he could hardly regard falbe as a stranger for he had heard him say on the piano what his sister understood by the songs of brahms and schubert he could not help glancing at falbes hands as they busied themselves with the filling and lighting of a pipe and felt that he knew something of those long broadtipped fingers smooth and white and strong the man himself he found to be quite different to what he had expected he had seen him before eager and intent and anxiousfaced absorbed in the task of following another mind now he looked much younger much more boyish no its my first visit to baireuth he said and i cant tell you how excited i am about it ive been looking forward to it so much that i almost expect to be disappointed falbe blew out a cloud of smoke and laughter oh youre safe enough he said baireuth never disappoints its one of the factsa reliable fact and munich do you go to munich afterwards yes i hope so falbe clicked with his tongue lucky fellow he said how i wish i was but ive got to get back again after my week youll spend the mornings in the galleries and the afternoons and evenings at the opera o lord munich he came across from the other side of the carriage and sat next michael putting his feet up on the seat opposite talk of munich he said i was born in munich and i happen to know that its the heavenly jerusalem neither more nor less well the heavenly jerusalem is practically next door to baireuth said michael i know but it cant be managed however theres a week of unalloyed bliss between me now and the desolation of london in august what is so maddening is to think of all the people who could go to munich and dont michael held debate within himself he felt that he ought to tell his new acquaintance that he knew who he was that however trivial their conversation might be it somehow resembled eavesdropping to talk to a chance fellowpassenger as if he were a complete stranger but it required again a certain effort to make the announcement i think i had better tell you he said at length that i know you that ive listened to you at least at your sisters recital a few days ago falbe turned to him with the friendliest pleasure ah were you there he asked i hope you listened to her then not to me she sang well didnt she but divinely at the same time i did listen to you especially in the french songs there was less song you know falbe laughed and more accompaniment he said perhaps you play michael was seized with a fit of shyness at the idea of talking to falbe about himself oh i just strum he said throughout the journey their acquaintanceship ripened and casually in dropped remarks the two began to learn something about each other falbes command of english as well as his sisters which was so complete that it was impossible to believe that a foreigner was speaking was explained for it came out that his mother was english and that from infancy they had spoken german and english indiscriminately his father who had died some dozen years before had been a singer of some note in his native land but was distinguished more for his teaching than his practice and it was he who had taught his daughter hermann falbe himself had always intended to be a pianist but the poverty in which they were left at his fathers death had obliged him to give lessons rather than devote himself to his own career but now at the age of thirty he found himself within sight of the competence that would allow him to cut down his pupils and begin to be a pupil again himself his sister moreover for whom he had slaved for years in order that she might continue her own singing education unchecked was now more than able especially after these last three months in london where she had suddenly leaped into eminence to support herself and contributed to the expenses of their common home but there was still so michael gathered no great superabundance of money and he guessed that falbes inability to go to munich was due to the question of expense all this came out by inference and allusion rather than by direct information while michael naturally reticent and feeling that his own uneventful affairs could have no interest for anybody was less communicative and indeed while shunning the appearance of inquisitiveness he was far too eager to get hold of his new acquaintance to think of volunteering much himself here to him was this citizen of the new country who all his life had lived in the palace of art and that in no dilettante fashion but with set aim and serious purpose and falbe abounded in such topics he knew the singers and the musicians of the world and which was much more than that he was himself of them humble no doubt in circumstances and achievement as yet but clearly to michael of the blood royal of artistry that was the essential thing about him as regards his relations with his fellowtraveller though when next morning the spires of cologne and the swift river of his fatherland came into sight he burst out into a sort of rhapsody of patriotism that mockingly covered a great sincerity ah beloved land he cried soil of heaven and of divine harmony hail to thee hail to thee rhine rhine deep and true and steadfast and he waved his hat and sang the greeting of brunnhilde then he turned laughingly to michael i am sufficiently english to know how ridiculous that must seem to you he said for i love england also and the passengers on the boat would merely think me mad if i apostrophised the cliffs of dover and the mud of the english roads but here i am a german again and i would willingly kiss the soil you englishwe english i may say for i am as much english as germani believe have got the same feeling somewhere in our hearts but we lock it up and hide it away pray god i shall never have to choose to which nation i belong though for that matter there in no choice in it at all for i am certainly a german subject guten tag koln let us instantly have our coffee there is no coffee like german coffee though the french coffee is undeniably pleasanter to the mere superficial palate but it doesnt touch the heart as everything german touches my heart when i come back to the fatherland he chattered on in tremendous high spirits and to think that tonight we shall sleep in true german beds he said i allow that the duvet is not so convenient as blankets and that there is a watershed always up the middle of your bed so that during the night your person descends to one side while the duvet rolls down the other but it is german which makes up for any trifling inconvenience baireuth too perhaps it will strike you as a dull and stinking little town and so i dare say it is but after lunch we shall go up the hillside to where the theatre stands at the edge of the pinewoods and from the porch the trumpets will give out the motif of the grail and we shall pass out of the heat into the cool darkness of the theatre arent you thrilled comber doesnt a holy awe pervade you are you worthy do you think all this youthful unrestrained enthusiasm was a revelation to michael intentionally absurd as falbes rhapsody on the fatherland had been michael knew that it sprang from a solid sincerity which was not ashamed of expressing itself living as he had always done in the rather formal and reticent atmosphere of his class and environment he would have thought this fervour of patriotism in an english mouth ridiculous or if persevered in merely bad form yet when falbe hailed the rhine and the spires of cologne it was clear that there was no bad form about it at all he felt like that and indeed as michael was beginning to perceive he felt with a similar intensity on all subjects about which he felt at all there was something of the same vivid quality about aunt barbara but aunt barbaras vividness was chiefly devoted to the hunt of the absurdities of her friends and it was always the concretely ridiculous that she pursued but this handsome vital young man with his eagerness and his welcome for the world who had fallen with so delightful a cordiality into michaels company had already an attraction for him of a sort he had never felt before dimly as the days went by he began to conjecture that he who had never had a friend was being hailed and halloed to was being ordered if not by precept at any rate by example to come out of the shell of his reserve and let himself feel and let himself express he could see how utterly different was falbes general conception and practice of life from his own to michael it had always been a congregation of strangersfrancis exceptedwho moved about busy with each other and with affairs that had no allure for him and were though not uncivil wholly alien to him he was willing to grant that this alienation this absence of comradeship which he had missed all his life was of his own making in so far as his shyness and sensitiveness were the cause of it but in effect he had never yet had a friend because he had never yet taken his shutters down so to speak or thrown his front door open he had peeped out through chinks and felt how lonely he was but he had not given anyone a chance to get in falbe on the other hand lived at his window ready to hail the passerby even as he had hailed michael with cheerful words there he lounged in his shirtsleeves you might say with elbows on the windowsill and not from politeness but from good fellowship from the fact that he liked people was at home to everybody he liked people there was the key to it and michael however much he might be capable of liking people had up till now given them no sign of it it really was not their fault if they had not guessed it two days passed on the first of which parsifal was given and on the second meistersinger on the third there was no performance and the two young men had agreed to meet in the morning and drive out of the town to a neighbouring village among the hills and spend the day there in the woods michael had looked forward to this day with extraordinary pleasure but there was mingled with it a sort of agony of apprehension that falbe would find him a very boring companion but the precepts of aunt barbara came to his mind and he reflected that the certain and sure way of proving a bore was to be taken up with the idea that he might be and anyhow falbe had proposed the plan himself they lunched in a little restaurant near a forestenclosed lake and since the day was very hot did no more than stroll up the hill for a hundred yards where they would get some hint of breeze and disposed themselves at length on the carpet of pineneedles through the thick boughs overhead the sunlight reached them only in specks and flakes the wind was but as a distant sea in the branches and falbe rolled over on to his face and sniffed at the aromatic leaves with the gusto with which he enjoyed all that was to him enjoyable ah thats good thats good he said how i love smellsclean sharp smells like this but theyve got to be wild you cant tame a smell and put it on your handkerchief it takes the life out of it do you like smells comber ii really never thought about it said michael think now then and tell me said falbe if you consider you know such a lot about me and as a matter of fact i know nothing whatever about you i know you like musici know you like blue trout because you ate so many of them at lunch today but what else do i know about you i dont even know what you thought of parsifal no perhaps im wrong there because the fact that youve never mentioned it probably shows that you couldnt the symptom of not understanding anything about parsifal is to talk about it and say what a tremendous impression it has made on you ah youve guessed right there said michael i couldnt talk about it theres nothing to say about it except that it is parsifal thats true it becomes part of you and you cant talk of it any more than you can talk about your elbows and your knees its one of the things that makes you he turned over on to his back and laid his hands palm uppermost over his eyes thats part of the glory of it all he said that art and its emotions become part of you like the food you eat and the wine you drink art is always making us it enters into our character and destiny as long as you go on growing you assimilate and thank god ones mind or soul or whatever you like to call it goes on growing for a long time i suppose the moment comes to most people when they cease to grow when they become fixed and hard and that is what we mean by being old but till then you weave your destiny or rather people and beauty weave it for you as youll see the norns weaving and yet you never know what you are making you make what you are and you never are because you are always becoming you must excuse me but germans are always metaphysicians and they cant help it go on be german said michael lieber gott as if i could be anything else said falbe laughing we are the only nation which makes a science of experimentalism we try everything just as a puppy tries everything it tries mutton bones and matchboxes and soap and boots it tries to find out what its tail is for and bites it till it hurts on which it draws the conclusion that it is not meant to eat like all metaphysicians too and dealers in the abstract we are intensely practical our passion for experimentalism is dictated by the firm object of using the knowledge we acquire we are tremendously thorough we waste nothing not even time whereas the english have an absolute genius for wasting time look at all your games your sports your athleticsi am being quite german now and forgetting my mother bless herthey are merely devices for getting rid of the hours and so not having to think you hate thought as a nation and we live for it music is thought all art is thought commercial prosperity is thought soldiering is thought and we are a nation of idiots asked michael no i didnt say that i should say you are a nation of sensualists you value sensation above everything you pursue the enjoyable you are a nation of children who are always having a perpetual holiday you go straying all over the world for fun and annex it generally so that you can have tigershooting in india and lots of gold to pay for your tigershooting in africa and fur from canada for your coats but its all a game not one man in a thousand in england has any idea of empire oh i think you are wrong there said michael you believe that only because we dont talk about it itsits like what we agreed about parsifal we dont talk about it because it is so much part of us falbe sat up i deny it i deny it flatly he said i know where i get my power of foolish unthinking enjoyment from and its from my english blood i rejoice in my english blood because you are the happiest people on the face of the earth but you are happy because you dont think whereas the joy of being german is that you do think england is lying in the shade like us with a cigarette and a drinki wish i had oneand a golf ball or the world with which she has been playing her game but germany is sitting up all night thinking and every morning she gives an order or two michael supplied the cigarette do you mean she is thinking about englands golf ball asked michael why of course she is what else is there to think about oh its impossible that there should be a european war said michael for that is what it will mean and why is a european war impossible demanded falbe lighting his cigarette its simply unthinkable because you dont think he interrupted i can tell you that the thought of war is never absent for a single day from the average german mind we are all soldiers you see we start with that you start by being golfers and cricketers but der tag is never quite absent from the german mind i dont say that all you golfers and cricketers wouldnt make good soldiers but youve got to be made you cant be a golfer one day and a soldier the next michael laughed as for that he said i made an uncommonly bad soldier but i am an even worse golfer as for cricket falbe again interrupted ah then at last i know two things about you he said you were a soldier and you cant play golf i have never known so little about anybody after threefour days however what is our proverb live and learn but it takes longer to learn than to live eh what nonsense i talk he spoke with a sudden irritation and the laugh at the end of his speech was not one of amusement but rather of mockery to michael this mood was quite inexplicable but characteristically he looked about in himself for the possible explanation of it but whats the matter he asked have i annoyed you somehow im awfully sorry falbe did not reply for a moment no youve not annoyed me he said ive annoyed myself but thats the worst of living on ones nerves which is the penalty of baireuth there is no charge so to speak except for your ticket but a collection is made as happens at meetings and you pay with your nerves you must cancel my annoyance please if i showed it i did not mean to michael pondered over this but i cant leave it like that he said at length was it about the possibility of war which i said was unthinkable falbe laughed and turned on his elbow towards michael no my dear chap he said you may believe it to be unthinkable and i may believe it to be inevitable but what does it matter what either of us believes che sara sara it was quite another thing that caused me to annoy myself it does not matter michael lay back on the soft slope yet i insist on knowing he said that is i mean if it is not private falbe lay quietly with his long fingers in the sediment of pineneedles well then as it is not private and as you insist he said i will certainly tell you does it not strike you that you are behaving like an absolute stranger to me we have talked of me and my home and my plans all the time since we met at victoria station and you have kept complete silence about yourself i know nothing of you not who you are or what you are or what your flag is you fly no flag you proclaim no identity you may be a crossingsweeper or a grocer or a marquis for all i know of course that matters very little but what does matter is that never for a moment have you shown me not what you happen to be but what you are ive got the impression that you are something that theres a real you in your inside but you dont let me see it you send a polite servant to the door when i knock probably this sounds very weird and unenglish to you but to my mind it is much more weird to behave as you are behaving come out cant you lets look at you it was exactly thatthat brusque unsentimental appealthat michael needed he saw himself at that moment as falbe saw him a shelled and muffled figure intangible and withdrawn but observing as it were through eyeholes and giving nothing in exchange for what he saw im sorry he said its quite true what you tell me im like that but it really has never struck me that anybody cared to know falbe ceased digging his excavation in the pineneedles and looked up on michael good lord man he said people care if youll only allow them to the indifference of other people is a false term for the secretiveness of oneself how can they care unless you let them know what there is to care for but im completely uninteresting said michael yes ill judge of that said falbe slowly and with diffident pauses michael began to speak of himself feeling at first as if he was undressing in public but as he went on he became conscious of the welcome that his story received though that welcome only expressed itself in perfectly unemotional monosyllables he might be undressing but he was undressing in front of a fire he knew that he uncovered himself to no icy blast or contemptuous rain as he had felt when so few days before he had spoken of himself and what he was to his father there was here the common land of music to build upon whereas to lord ashbridge that same soil had been so to speak the territory of the enemy and even more than that there was the instinct the certain conviction that he was telling his tale to sympathetic ears to which the mere fact that he was speaking of himself presupposed a friendly hearing falbe he felt wanted to know about him regardless of the nature of his confessions had he said that he was an undetected kleptomaniac falbe would have liked to know have been pleased at any tidings provided only they were authentic this seemed to reveal itself to him even as he spoke it had been there waiting for him to claim it lying there as in a poste restante only ready for its owner at the end falbe gave a long sigh and why the devil didnt you give me any hint of it before he asked i didnt think it mattered said michael well then you are amazingly wrong good lord its about the most interesting thing ive ever heard i didnt know anybody could escape from that awful sort of prisonhouse in which ourim english nowin which our upper class immures itself yet youve done it i take it that the thing is done now im not going back into the prisonhouse again if you mean that said michael and will your father cut you off asked he oh i havent the least idea said michael arent you going to inquire michael hesitated no im sure im not he said i cant do that its his business i couldnt ask about what he had done or meant to do its a sort of pride i suppose he will do as he thinks proper and when he has thought perhaps he will tell me what he intends but then how will you live asked falbe oh i forgot to tell you that ive got some money quite a lot i mean from my grandmother in some ways i rather wish i hadnt it would have been a proof of sincerity to have become poor that wouldnt have made the smallest difference to my resolution falbe laughed and so you are rich and yet go secondclass he said if i were rich i would make myself exceedingly comfortable i like things that are good to eat and soft to touch but im bound to say that i get on quite excellently without them being poor does not make the smallest difference to ones happiness but only to the number of ones pleasures michael paused a moment and then found courage to say what for the last two days he had been longing to give utterance to i know but pleasures are very nice things he said and doesnt it seem obvious now that you are coming to munich with me its a purely selfish suggestion on my part after being with you it will be very stupid to be alone there but it would be so delightful if you would come falbe looked at him a moment without speaking but michael saw the light in his eyes and what if i have my pride too he said then i shall apologise for having made the proposal said michael simply for just a second more falbe hesitated then he held out his hand i thank you most awfully he said i accept with the greatest pleasure michael drew a long breath of relief i am glad he said so thats settled its really nice of you the heat of the day was passing off and over the sunbleached plain the coolness of evening was beginning to steal overhead the wind stirred more resonantly in the pines and in the bushes birds called to each other presently after they rose from where they had lain all the afternoon and strolled along the needled slope to where through a vista in the trees they looked down on the lake and the hamlet that clustered near it down the road that wound through the trees towards it passed labourers going homeward from their work with cheerful guttural cries to each other and a herd of cows sauntered by with bells melodiously chiming taking leisurely mouthfuls from the herbage of the wayside in the village lying low in the clear dusk scattered lights began to appear the smoke of evening fires to ascend and the aromatic odour of the burning wood strayed towards them up the wind falbe whose hand lay in the crook of michaels arm pointed downwards to the village that lay there sequestered and rural thats germany he said its that which lies at the back of every german heart there lie the springs of the rhine its out of that originally that there came all that germany stands for its music its poetry its philosophy its kultur all flowed from these quiet uplands it was here that the nation began to think and to dream to dreamt its out of dreams that all has sprung he laughed and then next week when we go to munich you will find me saying that this this athens of a town with its museums and its galleries and its music is germany i shall be right too out of much dreaming comes the need to make it is when the artists head and heart are full of his dreams that his hands itch for the palette or the piano nuremberg cannot we stop a few hours at least in nuremberg and see the meadow by the pegnitz where the meistersingers held their contest of song and the wooden gabled house where albrecht durer lived that will teach you germany too the bud of their dream was opening then and what flower even in the magnificence of its fullblowing is so lovely albrecht durer with his deep patient eyes and his patient hands with their unerring stroke or bach with the fugue flowing from his brain through his quick fingers making starsstars fixed forever in the heaven of harmony dont tell me that there is anything in the world more wonderful we may have invented a few more instruments we may have experimented with a few more combinations of notes but in the b minor mass or in the music of the passion all is said and all that came from the woods and the country and the quiet life in little towns when the artist did his work because he loved it and cared not one jot about what anybody else thought about it we are a nation of thinkers and dreamers michael hesitated a moment but you said not long ago that you were also the most practical nation he said you are a nation of soldiers also and who would not willingly give himself for such a fatherland said falbe if need be we will lay our lives down for that and die more willingly than we have lived god grant that the need comes not but should it come we are ready we are bound to be ready it would be a crime not to be readya crime against the fatherland we love peace but the peacelovers are just those who in war are most terrible for who are the backbone of war when war comes the women of the country my friend not the ministers not the generals and the admirals i dont say they make war but when war is made they are the spirit of it because more than men they love their homes there is not a woman in germany who will not send forth brother and husband and father and child should the day come but it will not come from our seeking he turned to michael his face illuminated by the red glow of the sinking sun germany will rise as one man if shes told to he said for that is what her unity and her discipline mean she is patient and peaceful but she is obedient he pointed northwards it is from there from prussia from berlin he said that the word will come if they who rule and govern us and in whose hands are all organisation and equipment tell us that our national existence compels us to fight they rule the prussians rule there is no doubt of that from germany have come the arts the sciences the philosophies of the world and not from there but they guard our national life it is they who watch by the rhine for us patient and awake should they beckon us one night on some peaceful august night like this when all seems so tranquil so secure we shall go the silent beckoning finger will be obeyed from one end of the land to the other from poland on the east to france on the west he turned away quickly it does not bear thinking of he said and yet there are many oh so many who night and day concern themselves with nothing else let us be english again and not think of anything serious or unpleasant already as you know i am half english there is something to build upon ah and this is the sentimental hour just when the sun begins to touch the horizon line of the stale weary old earth and turns it into rosy gold and heals its troubles and its weariness schon schon he stood for a moment bareheaded to the breeze and made a great florid salutation to the sun now only halfdisk above the horizon there i have said my evensong he remarked like a good german who always and always is ridiculous to the whole world except those who are german also oh i can see how we look to the rest of the world so well beer mug in one hand and mouth full of sausage and song and with the other hand perhaps fingering a revolver how unreal it must seem to you how affected and yet how in truth you miss it all scratch a russian they say and you find a tartar but scratch a german and you find two thingsa sentimentalist and a soldier lieber gott no i will say good god i am english again and if you scratch me you will find a golf ball he took michaels arm again well weve spent one day together he said and now we know something of who we are i put this day in the bank its mine or yours or both of ours i wont tell you how ive enjoyed it or you will say that i have enjoyed it because i have talked almost all the time but since its the sentimental hour i will tell you that you mistake i have enjoyed it because i believe i have found a friend chapter v hermann falbe had just gone back to his lodgings at the end of the richard wagner strasse late on the night of their last day at baireuth and michael who had leaned out of his window to remind him of the hour of their trains departure the next morning turned back into the room to begin his packing that was not an affair that would take much time but since on this sweltering august night it would certainly be a process that involved the production of much heat he made ready for bed first and went about his preparations in pyjamas the work of dropping things into a bag was soon over and finding it impossible to entertain the idea of sleep he drew one of the stiff plushcovered armchairs to the window and slipped the rein from his thoughts letting them gallop where they pleased in all his life he had never experienced so much sheer emotion as the last week had held for him he had enjoyed his first taste of liberty he had stripped himself naked to music he had found a friend any one of these would have been sufficient to saturate him and they had all in the decrees of fate come together his life hitherto had been like some dry sponge dusty and crackling now it was plunged in the waters of three seas all incomparably sweet he had gained his liberty and in that process he had forgotten about himself the self which up till now had been so intolerable a burden at school and even before when first the age of selfconsciousness dawned upon him he had seen himself as he believed others saw hima queer awkward illmade boy slow at his work shy with his fellows incapable at games walled up in this fortress of himself this gloomy and forbidding fastness he had altogether failed to find the means of access to others both to the normal english boys among whom his path lay and also to his teachers who not unnaturally found him sullen and unresponsive there was no key among the rather limited bunches at their command which unlocked him nor at home had anything been found which could fit his wards it had been the business of school to turn out boys of certain received types there was the clever boy the athletic boy the merely pleasant boy these and the combinations arrived at from these types were the output there was no use for others then had succeeded those three nightmare years in the guards where with his more mature power of observation he had become more actively conscious of his inability to take his place on any of the recognised platforms and all the time like an owl on his solitary perch he had gazed out lonelily while the other birds of day too polite to mock him had merely passed him by one such it is truehis cousinhad sat by him and the poor owls heart had gone out to him but even francis so he saw now had not understood he had but accepted the fact of him without repugnance had been fond of him as a queer sort of kind elder cousin then there was aunt barbara aunt barbara michael allowed had understood a good deal she had pointed out with her unerringly humourous finger the obstacles he had made for himself but could aunt barbara understand the rapture of living which this one week of liberty had given him that michael doubted she had only pointed out the disabilities he made for himself she did not know what he was capable of in the way of happiness but he thought though without selfconsciousness how delightful it would be to show himself the new unshelled self to aunt barbara again a laughing couple went tapping down the street below his window boy and girl with arms and waists interlaced they were laughing at nothing at all except that they were boy and girl together and it was all glorious fun but the sight of them gave michael a sudden spasm of envy with all this enlightenment that had come to him during this last week there had come no gleam of what that simplest and commonest aspect of human nature meant he had never felt towards a girl what that roundfaced german boy felt he was not sure but he thought he disliked girls they meant nothing to him anyhow and the mere thought of his arm round a girls waist only suggested a very embarrassing attitude he had nothing to say to them and the knowledge of his inability filled him with an uncomfortable sense of his want of normality just as did the consciousness of his long arms and stumpy legs there was a night he remembered when francis had insisted that he should go with him to a discreet little supper party after an evening at the musichall there were just four of themhe francis and two companionsand he played the role of sour gooseberry to his cousin who with the utmost gaiety had proved himself completely equal to the inauspicious occasion and had drank indiscriminately out of both the girls glasses and lit cigarettes for them and after seeing them both home had looked in on michael and gone into fits of laughter at his general incompatibility the steps and conversation passed round the corner and michael stretching his bare toes on to the cool balcony resumed his researchesthose joyful unegoistic researches into himself his liberty was bound up with his music the first gave the key to the second often as he had rested so to speak in oases of music in london they were but a pause from the desert of his uncongenial life into the desert again but now the desert was vanished and the oasis stretched illimitable to the horizon in front of him that was where for the future his life was to be passed not idly sitting under trees but in the eager pursuit of its unnumbered paths it was that aspect of it which as he knew so well his father for instance would never be able to understand to lord ashbridges mind music was vaguely connected with white waistcoats and opera glasses and large pink carnations he was congenitally incapable of viewing it in any other light than a diversion something that took place between nine and eleven oclock in the evening and in smaller quantities at church on sunday morning he would undoubtedly have said that handels messiah was the noblest example of music in the world because of its subject music did not exist for him as a separate definite and infinite factor of life and since it did not so exist for himself he could not imagine it existing for anybody else that michael correctly knew to be his fathers general demeanour towards life he wanted everybody in their respective spheres to be like what he was in his they must take their part as he undoubtedly did in the creationscheme when the british aristocracy came into being a fresh factor had come into michaels conception of music during these last seven days he had become aware that germany was music he had naturally known before that the vast proportion of music came from germany that almost all of that which meant music to him was of german origin but that was a very different affair from the conviction now borne in on his mind that there was not only no music apart from germany but that there was no germany apart from music but every moment he spent in this wayside puddle of a town for so baireuth seemed to an unbiased view he became more and more aware that music beat in the german blood even as sport beat in the blood of his own people during this festival week baireuth existed only because of that at other times baireuth was probably as nonexistent as any dull and minor town in the english midlands but owing to the fact of music being for these weeks resident in baireuth the sordid little townlet became the capital of the huge patient empire it existed just now simply for that reason tonight with the curtain of the last act of parsifal it had ceased to exist again it was not that a patriotic desire to honour one of the national heroes in the home where he had been established by the mad genius of a bavarian king that moved them it was because for the moment that baireuth to germans meant germany from berlin from dresden from frankfurt from luxemburg from a hundred towns those who were most typically german whether high or low rich or poor made their joyous pilgrimage joy and solemnity exultation and the yearning that could never be satisfied drew them here and even as music was in michaels heart so germany was there also they were the people who understood they did not go to the opera as a bediamonded interlude between a dinner and a dance they came to this dreadful little town the discomforts of which the utter provinciality of which was transformed into the air of the heavenly jerusalem as hermann falbe had said because their souls were fed here with wine and manna he would find the same thing at munich so falbe had told him the next week the loves and the tragedies of the great titanic forces that saw the making of the world the dreams and the deeds of the masters of nuremberg above all sacrifice and enlightenment and redemption of the soul how except by music could these be made manifest it was the first and only and final alchemy that could by its magic transformation give an answer to the tremendous riddles of consciousness that could lift you though tearing and making mincemeat of you to the serenity of the pisgahtop whence was seen the promised land it in itself was reality and the doorkeeper who admitted you into that enchanted realm was the spirit of germany not france with its little morbid shiverings and its meatmarket called love not italy with its melodious declamations and tawdry tunes not russia even with the wind of its impenetrable winters its sense of joys snatched from its eternal frosts gave admittance there but germany deep patient germany that sprang from upland hamlets and flowed down with everbroadening stream into the illimitable ocean here then were two of the initiations that had come with the swiftness of the spate in alpine valleys at the melting of the snow upon michael his own liberty namely and this new sense of music he had groped he felt now like a blind man in that direction guided only by his instinct and on a sudden the scales had fallen from his eyes and he knew that his instinct had guided him right but not less epochmaking had been the dawn of friendship throughout the week his intimacy with hermann falbe had developed shooting up like an aloe flower and rising into sunlight above the mists of his own selfoccupied shyness which had so darkly beset him all life long he had given the best that he knew of himself to his cousin but all the time there had never quite been absent from his mind his sense of inferiority a sort of aching wonder why he could not be more like francis more careless more capable of enjoyment more of a normal type but with falbe he was able for the first time to forget himself altogether he had met a man who did not recall him to himself but took him clean out of that tedious dwelling which he knew so well and indeed disliked so much he was rid for the first time of his morbid selfconsciousness his anchor had been taken up from its dragging in the sand and he rode free buoyed on waters and taken by tides it did not occur to him to wonder whether falbe thought him uncouth and awkward it did not occur to him to try to be pleasant a job over which poor michael had so often found himself dishearteningly incapable he let himself be himself in the consciousness that this was sufficient they had spent the morning together before this second performance of parsifal that closed their series in the woods above the theatre and michael no longer blurting out his speeches but speaking in the quiet orderly manner in which he thought discussed his plans i shall come back to london with you after munich he said and settle down to study i do know a certain amount about harmony already i have been mugging it up for the last three years but i must do something as well as learn something and as i told you im going to take up the piano seriously falbe was not attending particularly a fine instrument the piano he remarked there is certainly something to be done with a piano if you know how to do it i can strum a bit myself some keys are harder than othersthe black notes yes what of the black notes asked michael oh theyre black the rest are white i beg your pardon michael laughed when you have finished drivelling he said you might let me know i have finished drivelling michael i was thinking about something else not really really then it was impolite of you but you havent any manners i was talking about my career i want to do something and these large hands are really rather nimble but i must be taught the question is whether you will teach me falbe hesitated i cant tell you he said till i have heard you play its like this i cant teach you to play unless you know how and i cant tell if you know how until i have heard you if you have got that particular sort of temperament that can put itself into the notes out of the ends of your fingers i can teach you and i will but if you havent i shall feel bound to advise you to try the jews harp and see if you can get it out of your teeth im not mocking you i fancy you know that but some people however keenly and rightly they feel cannot bring their feelings out through their fingers others can it is a special gift if you havent got it i cant teach you anything and there is no use in wasting your time and mine you can teach yourself to be frightfully nimble with your fingers and all the people who dont know will say how divinely lord comber plays that sweet thing is it brahms or mendelssohn but i cant really help you towards that you can do that for yourself but if youve got the other i can and will teach you all that you really know already go on said michael thats just the devil with the piano said falbe its the easiest instrument of all to make a show on and it is the rarest sort of person who can play on it thats why all those years i have hated giving lessons if one has to as i have had to one must take any awful miss with a pigtail and make a sham pianist of her one can always do that but it would be waste of time for you and me you wouldnt want to be made a sham pianist and simply i wouldnt make you one michael turned round good lord he said the suspense is worse than i can bear isnt there a piano in your room cant we go down there and have it over yes if you wish i can tell at once if you are capable of playingat least whether i think you are capable of playingwhether i can teach you but i havent touched a piano for a week said michael it doesnt matter whether youve touched a piano for a year michael had not been prevented by the economy that made him travel secondclass from engaging a carriage by the day at baireuth since that clearly was worth while and they found it waiting for them by the theatre there was still time to drive to falbes lodging and get through this crucial ordeal before the opera and they went straight there a very venerable instrument which falbe had not yet opened stood against the wall and he struck a few notes on it completely out of tune he said but that doesnt matter now then but what am i to play asked michael anything you like he sat down at the far end of the room put his long legs up on to another chair and waited michael sent a despairing glance at that gay face suddenly grown grim and took his seat he felt a paralysing conviction that falbes judgment whatever that might turn out to be would be right and the knowledge turned his fingers stiff from the few notes that falbe had struck he guessed on what sort of instrument his ordeal was to take place and yet he knew that falbe himself would have been able to convey to him the sense that he could play though the piano was all out of tune and there might be dumb disconcerting notes in it there was justice in falbes dictum about the temperament that lay behind the player which would assert itself through any faultiness of instrument and through so he suspected any faultiness of execution he struck a chord and heard it jangle dissonantly oh its not fair he said get on said falbe in spite of germany there occurred to michael a chopin prelude at which he had worked a little during the last two months in london the notes he knew perfectly he had believed also that he had found a certain conception of it as a whole so that he could make something coherent out of it not merely adding bar to correct bar and he began the soft repetition of chordquavers with which it opened then after stumbling wretchedly through two lines of it he suddenly forgot himself and falbe and the squealing unresponsive notes he heard them no more absorbed in the knowledge of what he meant by them of the mood which they produced in him his great ungainly hands had all the gentleness and selfcontrol that strength gives and the fingerfilling chords were as light and as fine as the settling of some poised bird on a bough in the last few lines of the prelude a deep bass note had to be struck at the beginning of each bar this michael found was completely dumb but so clear and vivid was the effect of it in his mind that he scarcely noticed that it returned no answer to his finger at the end he sat without moving his hands dropped on to his knees falbe got up and coming over to the piano struck the bass note himself yes i knew it was dumb he said but you made me think it wasnt you got quite a good tone out of it he paused a moment again striking the dumb note as if to make sure that it was soundless yes ill teach you he said all the technique you have got you know is wrong from beginning to end and you mustnt mind unlearning all that but youve got the thing that matters all this stewed and seethed in michaels mind as he sat that night by the window looking out on to the silent and empty street his thoughts flowed without check or guide from his will wandering wherever their course happened to take them now lingering like the water of a river in some deep still pool when he thought of the friendship that had come into his life now excitedly plunging down the foam of swiftflowing rapids in the exhilaration of his newlyfound liberty now proceeding with steady current at the thought of the weeks of unremitting industry at a beloved task that lay in front of him he could form no definite image out of these which should represent his ordinary day it was all lost in a bright haze through which its shape was but faintly discernible but life lay in front of him with promise a thing to be embraced and greeted with welcome and eager hands instead of being a mere marsh through which he had to plod with labouring steps a business to be gone about without joy and without conviction in its being worth while he wondered for a moment as he rose to go to bed what his feelings would have been if at the end of his performance on the sorethroated and voiceless piano falbe had said im sorry but i cant do anything with you as he knew falbe intended for the future only to take a few pupils and chiefly devote himself to his own practice with a view to emerging as a concertgiver the next winter and as michael had sat down he remembered telling himself that there was really not the slightest chance of his friend accepting him as a pupil he did not intend that this rejection should make the smallest difference to his aim but he knew that he would start his work under the tremendous handicap of falbe not believing that he had it in him to play and under the disappointment of not enjoying the added intimacy which work with and for falbe would give him then he had engaged in this tussle with refractory notes till he quite lost himself in what he was playing and thought no more either of falbe or the piano but only of what the melody meant to him but at the end when he came to himself again and sat with dropped hands waiting for falbes verdict he remembered how his heart seemed to hang poised until it came he had rehearsed again to himself his fixed determination that he would play and could play whatever his friend might think about it but there was no doubt that he waited with a greater suspense than he had ever known in his life before for that verdict to be made known to him next day came their journey to munich and the installation in the best hotel in europe here michael was host and the economy which he practised when he had only himself to provide for and which made him go secondclass when travelling was as usual completely abandoned now that the pleasure of hospitality was his he engaged at once the best double suite of rooms that the hotel contained two bedrooms with bathrooms and an admirable sittingroom looking spaciously out on to the square and with brusque decision silenced falbes attempted remonstrance dont interfere with my show please he had said and proceeded to inquire about a piano to be sent in for the week then he turned to his friend again oh we are going to enjoy ourselves he said with an irresistible sincerity tristan und isolde was given on the third day of their stay there and falbe reading the morning german paper found news the kaiser has arrived he said theres a truce in the army manoeuvres for a couple of days and he has come to be present at tristan this evening hes travelled three hundred miles to get here and will go back tomorrow the reisekaiser you know michael looked up with some slight anxiety ought i to write my name or anything he asked he has stayed several times with my father has he but i dont suppose it matters the visit is a widelyadvertised incognito thats his way god be with the allhighest he added well i shant said michael but it would shock my father dreadfully if he knew the kaiser looks on him as the type and model of the english nobleman michael crunched one of the inimitable breakfast rusks in his teeth lord what a day we had when he was at ashbridge last year he said we began at eight with a review of the suffolk yeomanry then we had a pheasant shoot from eleven till three then the emperor had out a steam launch and careered up and down the river till six asking a thousand questions about the tides and the currents and the navigable channels then he lectured us on the family portraits till dinner after dinner there was a concert at which he conducted the song to aegir and then there was a torchlight fandango by the tenants on the lawn he was on his holiday you must remember i heard the song to aegir once remarked falbe with a perfectly level intonation i waserluckier said michael politely because on that occasion i heard it twice it was encored and what did it sound like the second time asked falbe much as before said michael the advent of the emperor had put the whole town in a ferment though the visit was quite incognito an enormous military staff which had been poured into the town might have led the thoughtful to suspect the kaisers presence even if it had not been announced in the largest type in the papers and marchings and countermarchings of troops and sudden bursts of national airs proclaimed the august presence he held an informal review of certain bavarian troops not out for manoeuvres in the morning visited the sculpture gallery and pinacothek in the afternoon and when hermann and michael went up to the theatre they found rows of soldiers drawn up and inside unusual decorations over a section of stalls which had been removed and was converted into an enormous box this was in the centre of the first tier nearly at right angles to where they sat in the front row of the same tier and when with military punctuality the procession of uniforms headed by the emperor filed in the whole of the crowded house stood up and broke into a roar of recognition and loyalty for a minute or perhaps more the emperor stood facing the house with his hand raised in salute a figure the uprightness of which made him look tall his brilliant uniform was ablaze with decorations he seemed every inch a soldier and a leader of men for that minute he stood looking neither to the right nor left stern and almost frowning with no shadow of a smile playing on the tightlydrawn lips above which his moustache was brushed upwards in two stiff protuberances towards his eyes he was there just then not to see but to be seen his incognito was momentarily in abeyance and he stood forth the supreme head of his people the allhighest war lord who had come that day from the field to which he would return across half germany tomorrow it was an impressive and dignified moment and michael heard falbe say to himself kaiserlich kaiserlich then it was over the emperor sat down beckoned to two of his officers who had stood in a group far at the back of the box to join him and with one on each side he looked about the house and chatted to them he had taken out his operaglass which he adjusted using his right hand only and looked this way and that as if incognito again he was looking for friends in the house once michael thought that he looked rather long and fixedly in his direction and then putting down his glass he said something to one of the officers this time clearly pointing towards michael then he gave some signal just raising his hand towards the orchestra and immediately the lights were put down the whole house plunged in darkness except where the lamps in the sunk orchestra faintly illuminated the base of the curtain and the first longing unsatisfied notes of the prelude began the next hour passed for michael in one unbroken mood of absorption the supreme moment of knowing the music intimately and of never having seen the opera before was his and all that he had dreamed of or imagined as to the possibilities of music was flooded and drowned in the thing itself you could not say that it was more gigantic than the ring more human than the meistersingers more emotional than parsifal but it was utterly and wholly different to anything else he had ever seen or conjectured falbe he himself the thronged and silent theatre the emperor munich germany were all blotted out of his consciousness he just watched as if discarnate the unrolling of the decrees of fate which were to bring so simple and overpowering a tragedy on the two who drained the lovepotion together and at the end he fell back in his seat feeling thrilled and tired exhilarated and exhausted oh hermann he said what years ive wasted falbe laughed youve wasted more than you know yet he said hallo a very resplendent officer had come clanking down the gangway next them he put his heels together and bowed lord comber i think he said in excellent english michael roused himself yes he said his imperial majesty has done me the honour to desire you to come and speak to him he said now said michael if you will be so good and he stood aside for michael to pass up the stairs in front of him in the wide corridor behind he joined him again allow me to introduce myself as count von bergmann he said and one of his majestys aidesdecamp the kaiser always speaks with great pleasure of the visits he has paid to your father and he saw you immediately he came into the theatre if you will permit me i would advise you to bow but not very low respecting his majestys incognito to seat yourself as soon as he desires it and to remain till he gives you some speech of dismissal forgive me for going in front of you here i have to introduce you to his majestys presence michael followed him down the steps to the front of the box lord comber allhighest he said and instantly stood back the emperor rose and held out his hand and michael bowing over it as he took it felt himself seized in the famous grip of steel of which its owner as well as its recipient was so conscious i am much pleased to see you lord comber said he i could not resist the pleasure of a little chat with you about our beloved england and your excellent father how is he he indicated a chair to michael who as advised instantly took it though the emperor remained a moment longer standing i left him in very good health your majesty said michael ah i am glad to hear it i desire you to convey to him my friendliest greetings and to your mother also i well remember my last visit to his house above the tidal estuary at ashbridge and i hope it may not be very long before i have the opportunity to be in england again he spoke in a voice that seemed rather hoarse and tired but his manner expressed the most courteous cordiality his face which had been as still as a statues when he showed himself to the house was now never in repose for a moment he kept turning his head which he carried very upright this way and that as he spoke now he would catch sight of someone in the audience to whom he directed his glance now he would peer over the edge of the low balustrade now look at the group of officers who stood apart at the back of the box his whole demeanour suggested a nervous highlystrung condition the restlessness of it was that of a man overstrained who had lost the capability of being tranquil now he frowned now he smiled but never for a moment was he quiet then he launched a perfect hailstorm of questions at michael to the answers to which there was scarcely time for more than a monosyllable in reply he listened with an eager and a suspicious attention they were concerned at first with all sorts of subjects inquired if michael had been at baireuth what he was going to do after the munich festival was over if he had english friends here he inquired falbes name looked at him for a moment through his glasses and desired to know more about him then learning he was a teacher of the piano in england and had a sister who sang he expressed great satisfaction i like to see my subjects when there is no need for their services at home he said learning about other lands and bringing also to other lands the culture of the fatherland even as it always gives me pleasure to see the english here strengthening by the study of the arts the bonds that bind our two great nations together you english must learn to understand us and our great mission just as we must learn to understand you then the questions became more specialised and concerned the state of things in england he laughed over the disturbances created by the suffragettes was eager to hear what politicians thought about the state of things in ireland made specific inquiries about the territorial force asked about the navy the state of the drama in london the coal strike which was threatened in yorkshire then suddenly he put a series of personal questions and you you are in the guards i think he said no sir i have just resigned my commission said michael why why is that have many of your officers been resigning i am studying music your majesty said michael i am glad to see you came to germany to do it berlin you ought to spend a couple of months in berlin perhaps you are thinking of doing so he turned round quickly to one of his staff who had approached him well what is it he said count von bergmann bowed low the herrdirector he said humbly craves to know whether it is your majestys pleasure that the opera shall proceed the kaiser laughed there lord comber he said you see how i am ordered about they wish to cut short my conversation with you yes bergmann we will go on you will remain with me lord comber for this act immediately after the lights were lowered again the curtain rose and a most distracting hour began for michael his neighbour was never still for a single moment now he would shift in his chair now with his hand he would beat time on the red velvet balustrade in front of him and a stream of whispered appreciation and criticism flowed from him they are taking the opening scene a little too slow he said i shall call the directors attention to that but that crescendo is well done yes that is most effective the shawlobserve the beautiful lines into which the shawl falls as she waves it that is wonderfula very impressive entry ah but they should not cross the stage yet it is more effective if they remain longer there brangane sings finely she warns them that the doom is near he gave a little giggle which reminded michael of his father brangane is playing gooseberry as you say in england he said a big gooseberry is she not ah bravo bravo wunderschon yes enter king mark from his hunting very fine say i was particularly pleased with the entry of king mark bergmann a wonderful act wagner never touched greater heights at the end the emperor rose and again held out his hand i am pleased to have seen you lord comber he said do not forget my message to your father and take my advice and come to berlin in the winter we are always pleased to see the english in germany as michael left the box he ran into the herrdirector who had been summoned to get a few hints he went back to join falbe in a state of republican irritation which the honour that had been done him did not at all assuage there was an hours interval before the third act and the two drove back to their hotel to dine there but michael found his friend wholly unsympathetic with his chagrin to him it was quite clear the disappointment of not having been able to attend very closely to the second act of tristan was negligible compared to the cause that had occasioned it it was possible for the ordinary mortal to see tristan over and over again but to converse with the kaiser was a thing outside the range of the average man and again in this interval as during the act itself michael was bombarded with questions what did the kaiser say did he remember ashbridge did michael twice receive the iron grip did the allhighest say anything about the manoeuvres did he look tired or was it only the light above his head that made him appear so haggard even his opinion about the opera was of interest did he express approval this was too much for michael my dear hermann he said we alluded very cautiously to the song to aegir this morning and delicately remarked that you had heard it once and i twice how can you care what his opinion of this opera is falbe shook his handsome head and gesticulated with his fine hands you dont understand he said you have just been talking to him himself i long to hear his every word and intonation there is the personality which to us means so much in which is summed up all germany it is as if i had spoken to rule britannia herself would you not be interested there is no one in the world who is to his country what the kaiser is to us when you told me he had stayed at ashbridge i was thrilled but i was ashamed lest you should think me snobbish which indeed i am not but now i am past being ashamed he poured out a glass of wine and drank it with a hoch in his hand lies peace and war he said it is as he pleases the emperor and his chancellor can make germany do exactly what they choose and if the chancellor does not agree with the emperor the emperor can appoint one who does that is what it comes to that is why he is as vast as germany itself the reichstag but advises where he is concerned have you no imagination michael europe lies in the hand that shook yours michael laughed i suppose i must have no imagination he said i dont picture it even now when you point it out falbe pointed an impressive forefinger but for him he said england and germany would have been at each others throats over the business at agadir he held the warhounds in leashhe their master who made them oh he made them anyhow said michael naturally it is his business to be ready for any attack on the part of those who are jealous at our power the whole fatherland is a sword in his hand which he sheathes it would long ago have leaped from the scabbard but for him against whom asked michael who is the enemy falbe hesitated there is no enemy at present he said but the enemy potentially is any who tries to thwart our peaceful expansion suddenly the whole subject tasted bitter to michael he recalled instinctively the emperors great curiosity to be informed on english topics by the ordinary englishman with whom he had acquaintance oh lets drop it he said i really didnt come to munich to talk politics of which i know nothing whatever falbe nodded that is what i have said to you before he remarked you are the most happygolucky of the nations did he speak of england yes of his beloved england said michael he was extremely cordial about our relations good i like that said falbe briskly and he recommended me to spend two months in berlin in the winter added michael sliding off on to other topics falbe smiled i like that less he said since that will mean you will not be in london but i didnt commit myself said michael smiling back though i can say beloved germany with equal sincerity falbe got up i would wish thatthat you were kaiser of england he said god forbid said michael i should not have time to play the piano during the next day or two michael often found himself chipping at the bedrock so to speak of this conversation and falbes revealed attitude towards his country and in particular towards its supreme head it seemed to him a wonderful and an enviable thing that anyone could be so thoroughly english as falbe certainly was in his ordinary everyday life and that yet at the back of this there should lie so profound a patriotism towards another country and so profound a reverence to its ruler in his general outlook on life his friend appeared to be entirely of one blood with himself yet now on two or three occasions a chance spark had lit up this teutonic beacon to michael this mixture of nationalities seemed to be a wonderful gift it implied a widening of ones sympathies and outlook a larger comprehension of life than was possible to any of undiluted blood for himself like most young englishmen of his day he was not conscious of any tremendous sense of patriotism like this somewhere deep down in him he supposed there might be a source a well of english waters which some explosion in his nature might cause to flood him entirely but such an idea was purely hypothetical he did not in fact look forward to such a bouleversement as being a possible contingency but with falbe it was different quite a small cause like the sight of the rhine at cologne or a bavarian village at sunset or the fact of a friend having talked with the emperor was sufficient to make his innate patriotism find outlet in impassioned speech he wondered vaguely whether falbes explanation of thisnamely that nationally the english were prosperous comfortable and insouciantwas perhaps sound it seemed that the notion was not wholly foundationless chapter vi michael had been practising all the morning of a dark november day had eaten a couple of sandwiches standing in front of his fire and observed with some secret satisfaction that the fog which had lifted for an hour had come down on the town again in earnest and that it was only reasonable to dismiss the possibility of going out and spend the afternoon as he had spent the morning but he permitted himself a few minutes relaxation as he smoked his cigarette and sat down by the window looking out in lucretian mood on to the very dispiriting conditions that prevailed in the street though it was still only between one and two in the afternoon the densest gloom prevailed so that it was impossible to see the outlines even of the houses across the street and the only evidence that he was not in some desert spot lay in the fact of a few twinkling lights looking incredibly remote from the windows opposite and the gaslamps below traffic seemed to be at a standstill the accustomed roar from piccadilly was dumb and he looked out on to a silent and vapourswathed world this isolation from all his fellows and from the chances of being disturbed it may be added gave him a sense of extreme satisfaction he wanted his piano but no intrusive presence he liked the sensation of being shut up in his own industrious citadel secure from interruption during the last two months and a half since his return from munich he had experienced greater happiness had burned with a stronger zest for life than during the whole of his previous existence not only had he been working at that which he believed he was fitted for and which gave him the stimulus which one way or another is essential to all good work but he had been thrown among people who were similarly employed with whom he had this great common ground of kinship in ambition and aim no more were the days too long from being but halffilled with work with which he had no sympathy and diversions that gave him no pleasure none held sufficient hours for all that he wanted to put into it and in this busy atmosphere where his own studies took so much of his time and energy and where everybody else was in some way similarly employed that dismal selfconsciousness which so drearily looked on himself shuffling along through fruitless uncongenial days was cracking off him as the chestnut husk cracks when the kernel within swells and ripens apart from his work the centre of his life was certainly the household of the falbes where the brother and sister lived with their mother she turned out to be in a rather remote manner one of us and had about her very faint and dim like an antique lavender bag the odour of ashbridge she lived like the lilies of the field without toiling or spinning either literally or with the more figurative work of the mind indeed she can scarcely be said to have had any mind at all for as with drugs she had sapped it away by a practically unremitting perusal of all the fiction that makes the average reader wonder why it was written in fact she supplied the answer to that perplexing question since it was clearly written for her she was not in the least excited by these tales any more than the human race are excited by the oxygen in the air but she could not live without them she subscribed to three lending libraries which by this time had probably learned her tastes for if she ever by illchance embarked on a volume which ever so faintly adumbrated the realities of life she instantly returned it as she found it painful and naturally she did not wish to be pained this did not however prevent her reading those that dealt with amiable young men who fell in love with amiable young women and were for the moment sundered by redhaired adventuresses or blackhaired moneylenders for those she found not painful but powerful and could often remember where she had got to in them which otherwise was not usually the case she wore a good deal of lace spoke in a tired voice and must certainly have been of the type called sweetly pretty some quarter of a century ago she drank hot water with her meals and continually reminded michael of his own mother sylvia and hermann certainly did all that could be done for her in other words they invariably saw that her water was hot and her stock of novels replenished but when that was accomplished there really appeared to be little more that could be done for her her presence in a room counted for about as much as a rather powerful shadow on the wall unexplained by any solid object which could have made it appear there but most of the day she spent in her own room which was furnished exactly in accordance with her twilight existence there was a writingtable there which she never used several low armchairs one of which she was always using by each of which was a small table on to which she could put the book that she was at the moment engaged on lace hangings of the sort that prevent anybody either seeing in or out obscured the windows and for decoration there were china figures on the chimneypiece plushrimmed plates on the walls and a couple of easels draped with chiffon on which stood enlarged photographs of her husband and her children there was it may be added nothing in the least pathetic about her for as far as could be ascertained she had everything she wanted in fact from the standpoint of commonsense hers was the most successful existence for knowing what she liked she passed her entire life in its accomplishment the only thing that caused her emotion was the energy and vitality of her two children and even then that emotion was but a mild surprise when she recollected how tremendous a worker and boisterous a gourmand of life was her late husband on the anniversary of whose death she always sat all day without reading any novels at all but devoted what was left of her mind to the contemplation of nothing at all she had married him because for some inscrutable reason he insisted on it and she had been resigned to his death as to everything else that had ever happened to her all her life in fact she had been of that unchangeable drab quality in emotional affairs which is characteristic of advanced middleage when there are no great joys or sorrows to look back on and no expectation for the future she had always had something of the indestructible quality of frail things like thistledown or cottonwool violence and explosion that would blow strong and distinct organisms to atoms only puffed her a yard or two away where she alighted again without shock instead of injuring or annihilating her yet in the inexplicable ways of love sylvia and her brother not only did what could be done for her but regarded her with the tenderest affection what that love lived on what was its daily food would be hard to guess were it not that love lives on itself the rest of the house apart from the vacuum of mrs falbes rooms conducted itself so it seemed to michael at the highest possible pressure sylvia and her brother were both far too busy to be restless and if on the one hand mrs falbes remote impenetrable life was inexplicable not less inexplicable was the rage for living that possessed the other two from morning till night and on sundays from night till morning life proceeded at top speed as regards household arrangements which were all in sylvias hands there were three fixed points in the day that is to say that there was lunch for mrs falbe and anybody else who happened to be there at halfpast one tea in mrs falbes wellliked sittingroom at five and dinner at eight these mealsmrs falbe always breakfasted in her bedroomwere served with quiet decorum apart from them anybody who required anything consulted the cook personally hermann for instance would have spent the morning at his piano in the vast studio at the back of their house in maidstone crescent and not arrived at the fact that it was lunch time till perhaps three in the afternoon unless then he settled to do without lunch altogether he must forage for himself or sylvia having to sing at a concert at eight would return famished and exultant about ten she would then proceed to provide herself unless she supped elsewhere with a plate of eggs and bacon or anything else that was easily accessible it was not from preference that these haphazard methods were adopted but since they only kept two servants it was clear that a couple of women however willing could not possibly cope with so irregular a commissariat in addition to the series of fixed hours and the rest of the household work as it was two splendidly efficient persons one german the other english had filled the posts of parlourmaid and cook for the last eight years and regarded themselves and were regarded as members of the family lucas the parlourmaid indeed from the intense interest she took in the conversation at table could not always resist joining in it and was apt to correct hermann or his sister if she detected an inaccuracy in their statements no miss sylvia she would say it was on thursday not wednesday and then recollecting herself would add beg your pardon miss in this milieu as new to michael as some suddenly discovered country he found himself at once plunged and treated with instant friendly intimacy hermann so he supposed must have given him a good character for he was made welcome before he could have had time to make any impression for himself as hermanns friend on the first occasion of his visiting the house for the purpose of his music lesson he had stopped to lunch afterwards where he met sylvia and was in the presence of you could hardly call it more than that their mother mrs falbe had faded away in some mistlike fashion soon after but it was evident that he was intended to do no such thing and they had gone into the studio already comrades and michael had chiefly listened while the other two had violent and friendly discussions on every subject under the sun then hermann happened to sit down at the piano and played a chopin etude pianissimo prestissimo with fingertips that just made the notes to sound and no more and sylvia told him that he was getting it better and then sylvia sang who is sylvia and hermann told her that she shouldnt have eaten so much lunch or shouldnt have sung and then by transitions that michael could not recollect they played the hailstone chorus out of israel in egypt or at any rate reproduced the spirit of it and both sang at the top of their voices then as usually happened in the afternoon two or three friends dropped in and though these were all intimate with their hosts michael had no impression of being out in the cold or among strangers and when he left he felt as if he had been stretching out chilly hands to the fire and that the fire was always burning there ready for him to heat himself at with its welcoming flames and core of sincere warmth whenever he felt so disposed at first he had let himself do this much less often than he would have liked for the shyness of years his oversensitive modesty at his own want of charm and lightness was a selferected barrier in his way he was in spite of his intimacy with hermann desperately afraid of being tiresome of checking by his presence as he had so often felt himself do before the ease and high spirits of others but by degrees this broke down he realised that he was now among those with whom he had that kinship of the mind and of tastes which makes the foundation on which friendship and whatever friendship may ripen into is securely built never did the simplicity and sincerity of their welcome fail the cordiality which greeted him was always his he felt that it was intended that he should be at home there just as much as he cared to be the six working days of the week however were as a rule too full both for the falbes and for michael to do more than have apart from the music lessons flying glimpses of each other for the day was taken up with work concerts and opera occurred often in the evening and the shuttles of london took their threads in divergent directions but on sunday the house at maidstone crescent ceased as hermann said to be a junction and became a temporary terminus we burst from our chrysalis in fact he said if you find it clearer to understand this way we burst from our chrysalis and become a caterpillar do chrysalides become caterpillars we do anyhow if you come about eight you will find food if you come later you will also find food of a sketchier kind people have a habit of dropping in on sunday evening theres music if anyone feels inclined to make any and if they dont they are made to some people come early others late and they stop to breakfast if they wish its a gaudeamus you know a jolly a jamboree one has to relax sometimes michael felt all his old unfitness for dreadful crowds return to him oh im so bad at that sort of thing he said i am a frightful killjoy hermann hermann sat down on the treble part of his piano thats the most conceited thing ive heard you say yet he remarked nobody will pay any attention to you you wont kill anybodys joy also its rather rude of you i didnt mean to be rude said michael then we must suppose you were rude by accident that is the worst sort of rudeness im sorry ill come said michael thats right you might even find yourself enjoying it by accident you know if you dont you can go away theres music sylvia sings quite seriously sometimes and other people sing or bring violins and those who dont like it talkand then we get less serious have a try michael see if you cant be less serious too michael slipped despairingly from his seat if only i knew how he said i believe my nurse never taught me to play only to remember that i was a little gentleman all the same when i am with you or with my cousin francis i can manage it to a certain extent falbe looked at him encouragingly oh youre getting on he said you take yourself more for granted than you used to i remember you when you used to be polite on purpose its doing things on purpose that makes one serious if you ever play the fool on purpose you instantly cease playing the fool is that it said michael yes of course so come on sunday and forget all about it except coming and now do you mind going away i want to put in a couple of hours before lunch you know what to practise till tuesday dont you that was the first sunday evening that michael had spent with his friends after that up till this present date in november he had not missed a single one of those gatherings they consisted almost entirely of men and of the men there were many types and many ages actors and artists musicians and authors were indiscriminately mingled it was the strangest conglomeration of diverse interests but one interest so it seemed to michael bound them all together they were all doing in their different lives the things they most delighted in doing there was the key that unlocked all the locksnamely the enjoyment that inspired their work the freemasonry of art and the freemasonry of the eager mind that looks out without verdict but with only expectation and delight in experiment passed like an open secret among them secret because none spoke of it open because it was so transparently obvious and since this was so every member of that heterogeneous community had a respect for his companions the fact that they were there together showed that they had all passed this initiation and knew what for them life meant very soon after dinner all sitting accommodation other than the floor was occupied but then the floor held the later comers and the smoke from many cigarettes and the babble of many voices made a constantlyascending incense before the altar dedicated to the gods that inspire all enjoyable endeavour then sylvia sang and both those who cared to hear exquisite singing and those who did not were alike silent for this was a prayer to the gods they all worshipped and falbe played and there was a quartet of strings after that less serious affairs held the rooms an eminent actor was pleased to parody another eminent actor who was also present this led to a scene in which each caricatured the other and a french poet did gymnastic feats on the floor and upset a tray of sodawater and a german conductor fluffed out his hair and died like marguerite and when in the earlier hours of the morning part of the guests had gone away and part were broiling ham in the kitchen sylvia sang again quite seriously and michael in hermanns absence volunteered to play her accompaniment for her she stood behind him and by a finger on his shoulder directed him in the way she would have him go michael found himself suddenly and inexplicably understanding this her finger by its pressure or its light tapping seemed to him to speak in a language that he found himself familiar with and he slowed down stroking the notes or quickened with staccato touch as she wordlessly directed him out of all these things which were but trivialities pleasant unthinking hours for all else concerned several points stood out for michael points new and illuminating the first was the simplicity of it all the spontaneousness with which pleasure was born if only you took off your clothes so to speak and left them on the bank while you jumped in all his life he had buttoned his jacket and crammed his hat on to his head the second was the sense indefinable but certain that hermann and sylvia between them were the high priests of this memorable orgie he himself had met at dreadful solemn evenings when lady ashbridge and his father stood at the head of the stairs the two eminent actors who had romped tonight and found them exceedingly stately personages just as no doubt they had found him an icy and awkward young man but they like him had taken their note on those different occasions from their environment perhaps if his father and mother came here but michaels imagination quailed before such a supposition the third point which gradually through these weeks began to haunt him more and more was the personality of sylvia he had never come across a girl who in the least resembled her probably because he had not attempted even to find in a girl or to display in himself the signals winked across from one to the other of human companionship always he had found a difficulty in talking to a girl because he had in his selfconsciousness thought about what he should say there had been the cabalistic question of sex ever in front of him a thing that troubled and deterred him but sylvia with her hand on his shoulder absorbed in her singing and directing him only as she would have pressed the pedal of the piano if she had been playing to herself was no more agitating than if she had been a man she was just singing just using him to help her singing and even while michael registered to himself this charming annihilation of sex which allowed her to be to him no more than her brother wasless in fact but on the same planeshe had come to the end of her song patted him on the back as she would have patted anybody else with a word of thanks and for him suddenly leaped into significance it was not only a singer who had sung but an individual one called sylvia falbe she took her place at present a most inconspicuous one on the backcloth before which michaels life was acted towards which when no action so to speak was taking place his eyes naturally turned themselves his father and mother were there francis also and aunt barbara and of course larger than the rest hermann now sylvia was discernible and as the days went by and their meetings multiplied she became bigger walked into a nearer perspective it did not occur to michael rightly to imagine himself at all in love with her for he was not only she had asserted herself on his consciousness not yet had she begun to trouble him and there was no sign either external or intimate in his mind that he was sickening with the splendid malady indeed the significance she held for him was rather that though she was a girl she presented none of the embarrassments which that sex had always held for him she grew in comradeship he found himself as much at ease with her as with her brother and her charm was just that which had so quickly and strongly attracted michael to hermann she was vivid in the same way as he was she had the same warm welcoming kindlinessthe same complete absence of pose you knew where you were with her and hitherto when michael was with one of the young ladies brought down to ashbridge to be looked at he only wished that wherever he was he was somewhere else but with sylvia he had none of this selfconsciousness she was bonne camarade for him in exactly the same way as she was bonne camarade to the rest of the multitude which thronged the sunday evenings perfectly at ease with them as they with her in relationship entirely unsentimental but through these weeks up to this foggy november afternoon michaels most conscious preoccupation was his music falbes principles in teaching were entirely heretical according to the traditional school he gave michael no scale to play no dismal fingerexercise to fill the hours what is the good of them he asked they can only give you nimbleness and strength well you shall acquire your nimbleness and strength by playing what is worth playing take good music take chopin or bach or beethoven and practise one particular etude or fugue or sonata you may choose anything you like and learn your nimbleness and strength that way read too read for a couple of hours every day the written language of music must become so familiar to you that it is to you precisely what a book or a newspaper is so that whether you read it aloudwhich is playingor sit in your armchair with your feet on the fender reading it not aloud on the piano but to yourself it conveys its definite meaning to you at your lessons you will have to read aloud to me but when you are reading to yourself never pass over a bar that you dont understand it has got to sound in your head just as the words you read in a printed book really sound in your head if you read carefully and listen for them you know exactly what they would be like if you said them aloud can you read by the way have a try falbe got down a volume of bach and opened it at random there he said begin at the top of the page but i cant said michael i shall have to spell it out thats just what you mustnt do go ahead and dont pause till you get to the bottom of the page count start each bar when it comes to its turn and play as many notes as you can in it this was a dismal experience michael hitherto had gone on the painstaking and thorough plan of spelling out his notes with laborious care now falbes inexorable voice counted for him until it was lost in inextinguishable laughter go on go on he shouted i thought it was bach and it is clearly strausss don quixote michael flushed and determined with grave set mouth ploughed his way through amazing dissonances and at the end joined falbes laughter oh dear he said very funny but dont laugh so at me hermann falbe dried his eyes and what was it he said i declare it was the fourth fugue an entirely different conception of it a thoroughly original view now what youve got to do is to repeat thatnot the same murder i mean but other murdersfor a couple of hours a day by degreesyou wont believe ityou will find you are not murdering any longer but only mortally wounding after six months i dare say you wont even be hurting your victims all the same you can begin with less muscular ones in this way michaels musical horizons were infinitely extended not only did this system of falbes of flying at new music and going recklessly and regardlessly on give quickness to his brain and finger make his wits alert to pick up the new language he was learning but it gloriously extended his vision and his range of country he ran joyfully though with a thousand falls and tumbles through these new and wonderful vistas he worshipped at the grave gothic sanctuaries of beethoven he roamed through the enchanted garden of chopin he felt the icy and eternal frosts of russia and saw in the northern sky the great auroras spread themselves in spear and sword of fire he listened to the wisdom of brahms and passed through the noble and smiling country of bach all this so to speak was holiday travel and between his journeys he applied himself with the same eager industry to the learning of his art so that he might reproduce for himself and others true pictures of the scenes through which he scampered here falbe was not so easily moved to laughter he was as severe with michael as he was with himself when it was the question of learning some piece with a view to really playing it there was no lighthearted hurrying on through blurred runs and false notes slurred phrases and incomplete chords among these pieces which had to be properly learned was the th prelude of chopin on hearing which at baireuth on the tuneless and catarrhed piano falbe had agreed to take michael as a pupil but when it was played again on falbes great steinway as a professed performance a very different standard was required falbe stopped him at the end of the first two lines this wont do michael he said you played it before for me to see whether you could play you can but it wont do to sketch it every note has got to be there chopin didnt write them by accident he knew quite well what he was about begin again please this time michael got not quite so far when he was stopped again he was playing without notes and falbe got up from his chair where he had the book open and put it on the piano do you find difficulty in memorising he asked this was discouraging michael believed that he remembered easily he also believed that he had long known this by heart no i thought i knew it he said try again this time falbe stood by him and suddenly put his finger down into the middle of michaels hands striking a note you left out that f sharp he said go on now you are leaving out that e natural try to get it better by thursday and remember this that playing and all that differentiates playing from strumming only begins when you can play all the notes that are put down for you to play without fail youre beginning at the wrong end you have admirable feeling about that prelude but you neednt think about feeling till youve got all the notes at your fingers ends then and not till then you may begin to remember that you want to be a pianist now whats the next thing michael felt somewhat squashed and discouraged he had thought he had really worked successfully at the thing he knew so well by sight his heavy eyebrows drew together you told me to harmonise that christmas carol he remarked rather shortly falbe put his hand on his shoulder look here michael he said youre vexed with me now theres nothing to be vexed at you know quite well you were leaving out lots of notes from those jolly fat chords and that you werent playing cleanly now im taking you seriously and i wont have from you anything but the best you can do youre not doing your best when you dont even play what is written you cant begin to work at this till you do that michael had a moments severe tussle with his temper he felt vexed and disappointed that hermann should have sent him back like a schoolboy with his exercise torn over not immediately did he confess to himself that he was completely in the wrong im doing the best i can he said its rather discouraging he moved his big shoulders slightly as if to indicate that hermanns hand was not wanted there hermann kept it there it might be discouraging he said if you were doing your best michaels illtemper oozed from him im wrong he said turning round with the smile that made his ugly face so pleasant and im sorry both that i have been slack and that ive been sulky will that do falbe laughed very well indeed he said now for good king wenceslas wasnt it yes i got awfully interested over it hermann i thought i would try and work it up into a few variations lets hear said falbe this was a vastly different affair michael had shown both ingenuity and a great sense of harmonic beauty in the arrangement of the very simple little tune that falbe had made him exercise his ear over and the halfdozen variations that followed showed a wonderfully mature handling the air which he dealt with haunted them as a sort of unseen presence it moved in a tiny gavotte or looked on at a minuet measure it wailed yet without being positively heard in a little dirge of itself it broadened into a march it shouted in a bravura of rapid octaves and finally asserted itself heard once more over a great scale base of bells falbe as was his habit when interested sat absolutely still but receptive and alert instead of jerking and fidgeting as he had done over michaels fiasco in the chopin prelude and at the end he jumped up with a certain excitement do you know what youve done he said youve done something thats really good faults yes millions but theres a firstrate imagination at the bottom of it how did it happen michael flushed with pleasure oh they sang themselves he said and i learned them but will it really do is there anything in it yes old boy theres king wenceslas in it and youve dressed him up well play that last one again the last one was taxing to the fingers but michaels big hands banged out the octave scale in the bass with wonderful ease and falbe gave a great guffaw of pleasure at the rollicking conclusion write them all down he said and try if you can hear it singing half a dozen more if you can write them down also and give me leave to play the lot at my concert in january michael gasped you dont mean that he said certainly i do its a fine bit of stuff it was with these variations now on the point of completion that michael meant to spend his solitary and rapturous evening the spirits of the airwhatever those melodious sprites may behad for the last month made themselves very audible to him and the halfdozen further variations that hermann had demanded had rung all day in his head now as they neared completion he found that they ceased their singing their work of dictation was done he had to this extent expressed himself and they haunted him no longer at present he had but jotted down the skeleton of bars that could be filled in afterwards and it gave him enormous pleasure to see the roles reversed and himself out of his own brain setting falbe his task but he felt much more than this he had done something michael the dumb awkward michael was somehow revealed on those eight pages of music all his twentyfive years he had stood wistfully inarticulate unable so it had seemed to him to show himself to let himself out and not till now when he had found this means of access did he know how passionately he had desired it nor how immensely in the process of so doing his desire had grown he must find out more ways other channels of projecting himself the need for that as of a diver throwing himself into the empty air and the laughing waters below him suddenly took hold of him he took a clean sheet of music paper into which he placed his pages and with a pleasurable sense of pomp wrote in the centre of it variations on an air by michael comber he paused a moment then took up his pen again dedicated to sylvia falbe he wrote at the top chapter vii michael had been so engrossingly employed since his return to london in the autumn that the existence of other ties and other people apart from those immediately connected with his work had worn a very shadowlike aspect he had it is true written with some regularity to his mother finding somewhat to his dismay how very slight the common ground between them was for purposes of correspondence he could outline the facts that he had been to several concerts that he had seen much of his musicmaster that he had been diligent at his work but he realised that there was nothing in detail about those things that could possibly interest her and that nothing except them really interested him she on her side had little to say except to record the welfare of petsy to remark on the beauty of october and tell him how many shooting parties they had had his correspondence with his father had been less frequent and absolutely onesided since lord ashbridge took no notice at all of his letters michael regretted this as showing that he was still outcast but it cannot be said to have come between him and the sunshine for he had begun to manufacture the sunshine within that internal happiness which his environment and way of life produced which seemed to be independent of all that was not directly connected with it but a letter which he received next morning from his mother stated in addition to the fact that petsy had another of her tiresome bilious attacks poor lamb that his father and she thought it right that he should come down to ashbridge for christmas it conveyed the sense that at this joyful season a truce probably limited in duration and even while it lasted of the nature of a stronglyarmed neutrality was proclaimed but the prospect was not wholly encouraging for lady ashbridge added that she hoped michael would not go on vexing his father what precisely michael was expected to do in order to fulfil that wish was not further stated but he wrote dutifully enough to say that he would come down at christmas but the letter rekindled his dormant sense of there being other people in the world beside his immediate circle also indefinably it gave him the sense that his mother wanted him that should be so then and sequentially he remembered with a pang of selfreproach that he had not as much as indicated his presence in london to aunt barbara or set eyes on her since their meeting in august he knew she was in london since he had seen her name in some paragraph in the papers not long before and instantly wrote to ask her to dine with him at a near date her answer was characteristic of course ill dine with you my dear she wrote it will be delightful and what has happened to you your letter actually conveyed a sense of cordiality you never used to be cordial and i wish to meet some of your nice friends ask one or two pleasea prima donna of some kind and a pianist i think i want them weird and originalthe prima donna with short hair and the pianist with long in tonys new station in life i never see anybody except the sort of people whom your father likes are you forgiven yet by the way michael found himself on the grin at the thought of aunt barbara suddenly encountering the two magnificent falbes prima donna and pianist exactly as she had desired as representing the weird sort of people whom she pictured his living among and the result quite came up to his expectations as usual aunt barbara was late and came in talking rapidly about the various causes that had detained her which her fruitful imagination had suggested to her as she dressed in order perhaps to suit herself to the circle in which she would pass the evening she had put on or rather it looked as if her maid had thrown at her a very awful sort of teagown brown and pricklylooking and adapted to bohemian circles she with the same lively imagination had pictured michael in a velveteen coat and soft shirt the pianist as very small with spectacles and long hair and the prima donna a fullblown kind of barmaid with roman pearls yes my dear i know i am late she began before she was inside the door but og had so much to say and there was a block at hyde park corner my dear michael how smart you look she came round the corner of the screen and the falbes burst upon her hermann and sylvia standing by the fire for the short spectacled pianist there was this very tall englishlooking young man upright and soldierly with his handsome boyish face and wellfitting clothes that was bad enough but infinitely worse was she who was to have been the fullblown barmaid instead was this magnificent girl nearly as tall as her brother with her small oval face crowning the column of her neck her eyes merry her mouth laughing at some brotherly retort that hermann had just made aunt barbara took her in with one seconds surveyher face her neck her beautiful dress her whole air of ease and goodbreeding and gave a despairing glance at her own prickly teagown for the moment amiably accustomed as she was to laugh at herself she did not find it humourous miss sylvia falbe aunt barbara said michael with a little tremor in his voice and mr hermann falbe lady barbara jerome he added rather as if he expected nobody to believe it aunt barbara made the best of it shook hands in her jolly manner and burst into laughter michael i could slay you she said but before i do that i must tell your friends all about it this horrible nephew of mine miss falbe promised me two weird musicians and i expectedi really cant tell you what i expectedbut there were to be spectacles and velveteen coats and the general air of an afternoon concert at clapham junction but it is nice to be made such a fool of i feel precisely like an elderly and sour governess who has been ordered to come down to dinner so that there shant be thirteen give me your arm mr falbe and take me in to dinner at once where i may drown my embarrassment in soup or does michael go in first go on wretch presently they were seated at dinner and aunt barbara could not help enlarging a little on her own discomfiture it is all your fault michael she said you have been in london all these weeks without letting me know anything about you or your friends or what you were doing so naturally i supposed you were leading some obscure kind of existence instead of which i find this sort of thing my dear what good soup i shall see if i cant induce your cook to leave you but bachelors always have the best of everything now tell me about your visit to germany which was the point where we partedbaireuth wasnt it i would not go to baireuth with anybody i went with mr falbe said michael ah mr falbe has not asked me yet i may have to revise what i say said aunt barbara daringly i didnt ask michael said hermann i got into his carriage as the train was moving and my luggage was left behind i was left behind said sylvia which was worse but i sent hermanns luggage so expeditiously that it arrived the day before we left for munich remarked hermann and thats all the gratitude i get but in the interval you lived upon lord comber i do still in the money i earn by giving him music lessons mike have you finished the variations yet variationswhat are variations asked aunt barbara yes two days ago variations are all the things you think about on the piano aunt barbara when you are playing a tune made by somebody else should i like them will mr falbe play them to me asked she i daresay he will if he can but i thought you loathed music it certainly depends on who makes it said aunt barbara i dont like ordinary music because the person who made it doesnt matter to me but if so to speak it sounds like somebody i know it is a different matter michael turned to sylvia i want to ask your leave for something i have already done he said and if i dont give it you then i shant tell you what it is sylvia looked at him with her candid friendly eyes her brother always told her that she never looked at anybody except her friends if she was engaged in conversation with a man she did not like she looked at his shirtstud or at a point slightly above his head then of course i give in she said i must give you leave if otherwise i shant know what you have done but its a mean trick tell me at once ive dedicated the variations to you he said sylvia flushed with pleasure oh but thats absolutely darling of you she said have you really do you mean it if youll allow me allow you hermann the variations are mine isnt it too lovely it was at this moment that aunt barbara happened to glance at michael and it suddenly struck her that it was a perfectly new michael whom she looked at she knew and was secretly amused at the fiasco that always attended the introduction of amiable young ladies to ashbridge and had warned her sisterinlaw that michael when he chose the girl he wanted would certainly do it on his own initiative now she felt sure that michael though he might not be aware of it himself was even if he had not chosen beginning to choose there was that in his eyes which none of the importations to ashbridge had ever seen there that eager deferential attention which shows that a young man is interested because it is a girl he is talking to that she knew had never been characteristic of michael indeed it would not have been far from the truth to say that the fact that he was talking to a girl was sufficient to make his countenance wear an expression of polite boredom then for a while as dinner progressed she doubted the validity of her conclusion for the michael who was entertaining her tonight was wholly different from the michael she had known and liked and pitied she felt that she did not know this new one yet but she was certain that she liked him and equally sure that she did not pity him at all he had found his place he had found his work he evidently fitted into his life which after all is the surest ground of happiness and it might be that it was only general joy so to speak that kindled that pleasant fire in his face and then once more she went back to her first conclusion for talking to michael herself she saw as a woman so infallibly sees that he gave her but the most superficial attentionsufficient indeed to allow him to answer intelligently and laugh at the proper places but his mind was not in the least occupied with her if sylvia moved his glance flickered across in her direction it was she who gave him his alertness aunt barbara felt that she could have told him truthfully that he was in love with her and she rather thought that it would be news to him probably he did not know it yet himself and she wondered what his father would say when he knew it and then munich she said violently recalling michaels attention towards her munich i could have borne better than baireuth and when mr falbe asks me there i shall probably go your uncle tony was in germany then by the way he went over at the invitation of the emperor to the manoeuvres did he the emperor came to munich for a day during them he was at the opera said michael you didnt speak to him i suppose she asked yes he sent for me and talked a lot in fact he talked too much because i didnt hear a note of the second act aunt barbara became infinitely more interested tell me all about it michael she said what did he talk about everything as far as i can remember england ashbridge armies navies music hermann says he cast pearls before swine and his tone his attitude she asked towards ustowards england immensely friendly and most inquisitive i was never asked so many questions in so short a time aunt barbara suddenly turned to falbe and you she asked were you with michael no lady barbara i had no pearls and are you naturalised english she asked no i am german she slid swiftly off the topic do you wonder i ask with your talking english so perfectly she said you should hear me talking french when we are entertaining ambassadors and that sort of persons i talk it so fast that nobody can understand a word i say that is a defensive measure you must observe because even if i talked it quite slowly they would understand just as little but they think it is the pace that stupefies them and they leave me in a curious dazed condition and now miss falbe and i are going to leave you two be rather a long time dear michael so that mr falbe can tell you what he thinks of me and his sister shall tell me what she thinks of you afterwards you and i will tell each other if it is not too fearful this did not express quite accurately lady barbaras intentions for she chiefly wanted to find out what she thought of sylvia and you are great friends you three she said as they settled themselves for the prolonged absence of the two men sylvia smiled she smiled aunt barbara noticed almost entirely with her eyes using her mouth only when it came to laughing but her eyes smiled quite charmingly thats always rather a rash thing to pronounce on she said i can tell you for certain that hermann and i are both very fond of him but it is presumptuous for us to say that he is equally devoted to us my dear there is no call for modesty about it said barbara between youfor i imagine it is you who have done itbetween you you have made a perfectly different creature of the boy youve made him flower sylvia became quite grave oh i do hope he likes us she said he is so likable himself barbara nodded and youve had the good sense to find that out she said its astonishing how few people knew it but then as i said michael hadnt flowered no one understood him or was interested then he suddenly made up his mind last summer what he wanted to do and be and immediately did and was it i think he told hermann said she his father didnt approve did he approve my dear if you knew my brother you would know that the only things he approves of are those which michael isnt sylvia spread her fine hands out to the blaze warming them and shading her face michael always seems to us she began ah i called him michael by mistake then do it on purpose next time remarked barbara what does michael seem ah but dont let him know i called him michael said sylvia in some horror there is nothing so awful as to speak of people formally to their faces and intimately behind their backs but hermann is always talking of him as michael and michael always seems oh yes he always seems to me to have been part of us of hermann and me for years hes there if you know what i mean and so few people are there they walk about your life and go in and out so to speak but michael stops i suppose its because he is so natural aunt barbara had been a diplomatist long before her husband and fearful of appearing inquisitive about sylvias impression of michael which she really wanted to inquire into instantly changed the subject ah everybody who has got definite things to do is natural she said it is only the idle people who have leisure to look at themselves in the glass and pose and i feel sure that you have definite things to do and plenty of them my dear what are they oh i sing a little said sylvia that is the first unnatural thing you have said i somehow feel that you sing a great deal aunt barbara suddenly got up my dear you are not the miss falbe are you who drove london crazy with delight last summer dont tell me you are the miss falbe sylvia laughed do you know im afraid i must be she said isnt it dreadful to have to say that after your description aunt barbara sat down again in a sort of calm despair if there are any more shocks coming for me tonight she said i think i had better go home i have encountered a perfectly new nephew michael i have dressed myself like a suburban housekeeper to meet a poiret so dont deny it and having humourously told michael i wished to see a prima donna and a pianist he takes me at my word and produces the miss falbe im glad i knew that in time i should infallibly have asked you to sing and if you had done soyou are probably goodnatured enough to have done even thati should have given the drawingroom gasp at the end and told your brother that i thought you sang very prettily sylvia laughed but really it wasnt my fault lady barbara she said when we met i couldnt have said beware i am the miss falbe no my dear but i think you ought somehow to have conveyed the impression that you were a tremendous swell you didnt i have been thinking of you as a charming girl and nothing more but thats quite good enough for me said sylvia the two young men joined them after this and hermann speedily became engrossed in reading the finished variations some of these pleased him mightily one he altogether demurred to its just a crib mike he said the critics would say i had forgotten it and put in instead what i could remember of a variation out of the handel theme that next ones oh great fun but i wish you would remember that we all havent got great orangoutang paws like you aunt barbara stopped in the middle of her sentence she knew michaels old sensitiveness about these physical disabilities and she had a moments cold horror at the thought of falbe having said so miserably tactless a thing to him but the horror was of infinitesimal duration for she heard michaels laugh as they leaned over the top of the piano together i wish you had hermann he said i know youll bungle those tenths falbe moved to the pianoseat oh lets have a shot at it he said if lady barbara wont mind play that one through to me first mike oh presently hermann he said it makes such an infernal row that you cant hear anything else afterwards do sing miss sylvia my aunt wont really mindwill you aunt barbara michael i have just learned that this is the miss falbe she said i am suffering from shock do let me suffer from coals of fire too michael gently edged hermann away from the musicstool much as he enjoyed his masters accompaniment he was perfectly sure that he preferred if possible to play for sylvia himself than have the pleasure of listening to anybody else and may i play for you miss sylvia he asked yes will you thanks lord comber hermann moved away and so mr hermann sits down by lady barbara while lord comber plays for miss sylvia he observed with emphasis on the titles a sudden amazing boldness seized michael sylvia then he said all right michael answered the girl laughing she came and stood on the left of the piano slightly behind him and what are we going to have asked michael it must be something we both know for ive brought no music said she michael began playing the introduction to the hugo wolff song which he had accompanied for her one sunday night at their house he knew it perfectly by heart but stumbled a little over the difficult syncopated time this was not done without purpose for the next moment he felt her hand on his shoulder marking it for him yes thats right she said now youve got it and michael smiled sweetly at his own amazing ingenuity hermann put down the variations which he still had in his hand when sylvias voice began unaccustomed as she was to her accompanist his trained ear told him that she was singing perfectly at ease and was completely at home with her player occasionally she gave michael some little indication as she had done before but for the most part her fingers rested immobile on his shoulder and he seemed to understand her perfectly somehow this was a surprise to him he had not known that michael possessed that sort of secondsight that unerringly feels and translates into the keys the singers mood for himself he always had to attend most closely when he was playing for his sister but familiar as he was with her singing he felt that michael divined her certainly as well as himself and he listened to the piano more than to the voice you extraordinary creature he said when the song was over where did you learn to accompany suddenly michael felt an access of shyness as if he had been surprised when he thought himself private oh ive played it before for missi mean for sylvia he said then he turned to the girl thanks awfully he said and im greedy may we have one more he slid into the opening bars of who is sylvia that song since he had heard her sing it at her recital in the summer had grown in significance to him even as she had it had seemed part of her then but then she was a stranger tonight it was even more intimately part of her and she was a friend hermann strolled across to the fireplace at the end of this and lit a cigarette my sisters a blatant egoist lady barbara he said she loves singing about herself and she lays it on pretty thick too doesnt she now sylvia if youve finishedquite finished i meando come and sit down and let me try these variations shall we surrender michael asked the girl or shall we stick to the piano now weve got it if hermann once sits down you know we shant get him away for the rest of the evening i cant sing any more but we might play a duet to keep him out hermann rushed to the piano took his sister by the shoulders and pushed her into a chair you sit there he said and listen to something not about yourself michael if you dont come away from that piano i shall take sylvia home at once now you may all talk as much as you like you wont interrupt me one atombut youll have to talk loud in certain parts then a feat of marvellous execution began michael had taken an evil pleasure in giving his master for whom he slaved with so unwearied a diligence something that should tax his powers and he gave a great crash of laughter when for a moment hermann was brought to a complete standstill in an octave passage of triplets against quavers and the performer exultantly joined in it as he pushed his hair back from his forehead and made a second attempt it isnt decent to ask a fellow to read that he shouted its a crime its a scandal my dear nobody asked you to read it said sylvia silence you chit mike come here a minute sit down one second and play that promise to get up again though immediately just these three barsyes i see an orangoutang apparently can do it so why not i am i not much better than they go away please or rather stop there and turn over why couldnt you have finished the page with the last act and started this one fresh instead of making this godforsaken arrangement now a very simple little minuet measure followed this outrageous passage and hermanns exquisite lightness of touch made it sound strangely remote as if from a mile away or a hundred years ago some graceful echo was evoked again then the little dirge wept for the memories of something that had never happened and leaving out the number he disapproved of as reminiscent of the handel theme hermann gathered himself up again for the assertion of the original tune with its bars of scale octaves the contagious jollity of it all seized the others and sylvia with full voice and aunt barbara in a strange hooting sang to it then hermann banged out the last chord and jumped up from his seat rolling up the music i go straight home he said and have a peaceful hour with it michael old boy how did you do it youve been studying seriously for a few months only and so this must all have been in you before and youve come to the age you are without letting any of it out i suppose thats why it has come with a rush you knew it all along while you were wasting your time over drilling your toy soldiers come on sylvia or i shall go without you good night lady barbara halfpast ten tomorrow michael protest was clearly useless and having seen the two off michael came upstairs again to aunt barbara who had no intention of going away just yet and so these are the people you have been living with she said no wonder you had not time to come and see me do they always go that sort of paceit is quicker than when i talk french michael sank into a chair oh yes thats hermann all over he said butbut just think what it means to me hes going to play my tunes at his concert michael comber op o lord o lord and you just met him in the train said aunt barbara yes second class victoria station with sylvia on the platform i didnt much notice sylvia then this and the inference that naturally followed was as much as could be expected and aunt barbara did not appear to wait for anything more on the subject of sylvia she had seen sufficient of the situation to know where michael was most certainly bound for yet the very fact of sylvias outspoken friendliness with him made her wonder a little as to what his reception would be she would hardly have said so plainly that she and her brother were devoted to him if she had been devoted to him with that secret tenderness which in its essentials is reticent about itself her halfhours conversation with the girl had given her a certain insight into her still more had her attitude when she stood by michael as he played for her and put her hand on his shoulder precisely as she would have done if it had been another girl who was seated at the piano without doubt michael had a real existence for her but there was no sign whatever that she hailed it as a girl so unmistakably does when she sees it as part of herself more about them she said what are they who are they he outlined for her giving the halfenglish halfgerman parentage the shadowlike mother the bavarian father sylvias sudden and cometlike rising in the musical heaven while her brother seven years her senior had spent his time in earning in order to give her the chance which she had so brilliantly taken now it was to be his turn the shackles of his drudgery no longer impeded him and he so michael radiantly prophesied was to have his rocketlike leap to the zenith also and hes german she asked yes wasnt he rude about my being a toy soldier but thats the natural german point of view i suppose michael strolled to the fireplace hermanns so funny he said for days and weeks together you would think he was entirely english and then a word slips from him like that which shows he is entirely german he was like that in munich when the emperor appeared and sent for me aunt barbara drew her chair a little nearer the fire and sat up i want to hear about that she said but ive told you he was tremendously friendly in a national manner and that seemed to you real she asked michael considered i dont know that it did he said it all seemed to me rather feverish i think and he asked quantities of questions i think you said hundreds he was just like what he was when he came to ashbridge he reviewed the yeomanry and shot pheasants and spent the afternoon in a steam launch apparently studying the deepwater channel of the river where it goes underneath my fathers place and then in the evening there was a concert aunt barbara did not heed the concert do you mean the channel up from harwich she asked of which the admiralty have the secret chart i fancy they have said michael and then after the concert there was the torchlight procession with the bonfire on the top of the hill i wasnt there what else i think thats all said michael but what are you driving at aunt barbara she was silent a moment im driving at this she said the germans are accumulating a vast quantity of knowledge about england tony for instance has a german valet and when he went down to portsmouth the other day to see the american ship that was there he took him with him and the man took a camera and was found photographing where no photography is allowed did you see anything of a camera when the emperor came to ashbridge michael thought yes one of his staff was clicking away all day he said he sent a lot of them to my mother and we may presume kept some copies himself remarked aunt barbara drily really for childish simplicity the english are the biggest fools in creation but do you mean i mean that the germans are a very knowledgeseeking people and that we gratify their desires in a very simple fashion do you think they are so friendly michael do you know for instance what is a very common toast in german regimental messes they do not drink it when there are foreigners there but one night during the manoeuvres an officer in a mess where tony was dining got slightly on as you may say and suddenly drank to der tag that means the day said michael confidently it does and what day the day when germany thinks that all is ripe for a war with us der tag will dawn suddenly from a quiet peaceful night when they think we are all asleep and when they have got all the information they think is accessible war my dear michael had never in his life seen his aunt so serious and he was amazed at her gravity there are hundreds and hundreds of their spies all over england she said and hundreds of their agents all over america deep patient germany as carlyle said shes as patient as god and as deep as the sea they are working working while our toy soldiers play golf i agree with that adorable pianist and whats more i believe they think that der tag is near to dawn tony says that their manoeuvres this year were like nothing that has ever been seen before germany is a fighting machine without parallel in the history of the world she got up and stood with michael near the fireplace and they think their opportunity is at hand she said though not for a moment do they relax their preparations we are their real enemy dont you see they can fight france with one hand and russia with the other and in a few months time now they expect we shall be in the throes of an internal revolution over this irish business they may be right but there is just the possibility that they may be astoundingly wrong the fact of the great foreign perilthis nightmare this armageddon of european warmay be exactly that which will pull us together but their diplomatists anyhow are studying the irish question very closely and german gold without any doubt at all is helping the home rule party as a nation we are fast asleep i wonder what we shall be like when we wake shall we find ourselves already fettered when we wake or will there be one moment just one moment in which we can spring up at any rate hitherto the english have always been at their best not their worst in desperate positions they hate exciting themselves and refuse to do it until the crisis is actually on them but then they become disconcertingly serious and coolheaded and you think the emperor began michael i think the emperor is the hardest worker in all germany said barbara i believe he is trying and admirably succeeding to make us trust his professions of friendship he has a great eye for detail too it seemed to him worth while to assure you even my dear michael of his regard and affection for england he was always impressing on tony the same thing though to him of course he said that if there was any country nearer to his heart than england it was america stuff and nonsense my dear all this though struck in a more serious key than was usual with aunt barbara was quite characteristic of her she had the quality of mind which when occupied with one idea is occupied with it to the exclusion of all others she worked at full power over anything she took up but now she dismissed it altogether you see what a diplomatist i have become she said it is a fascinating business one lives in an atmosphere that is charged with secret affairs and it infects one like the influenza you catch it somehow and have a feverish cold of your own and i am quite useful to him you see i am such a chatterbox that people think i let out things by accident which i never do i let out what i want to let out on purpose and they think they are pumping me i had a long conversation the other day with one of the german embassy all about irish affairs they are hugely interested about irish affairs and i just make a note of that but they can make as many notes as they please about what i say and no one will be any the wiser in fact they will be the foolisher and now i suppose i had better take myself away dont do anything of the kind said michael but i must and if when you are down at ashbridge at christmas you find strangers hanging about the deepwater reach you might just let me know its no use telling your father because he will certainly think they have come to get a glimpse of him as he plays golf but i expect youll be too busy thinking about that new friend of yours and perhaps his sister what did she tell me we had got to do to her garlands let us bring was it not you and i will both send wreaths michael though not for her funeral now dont be a hermit any more but come and see me you shall take your garland girl into dinner if she will come too and her brother shall certainly sit next me i am so glad you have become yourself at last go on being yourself more and more my dear it suits you chapter viii some fortnight later and not long before michael was leaving town for his christmas visit to ashbridge sylvia and her brother were lingering in the big studio from which the last of their sunday evening guests had just departed the usual joyous chaos consequent on those entertainments reigned the top of the piano was covered with the plates and glasses of those who had made an alfresco supper or breakfast of fried bacon and beer before leaving a circle of cushions were ranged on the floor round the fire for it was a bitterly cold night and since for some reason a series of charades had been spontaneously generated there was lying about an astonishing collection of pillowcases rugs and tablecloths and such articles of domestic and household use as could be converted into clothes for this purpose but the event of the evening had undoubtedly been hermanns performance of the wenceslas variations these he had now learned and as he had promised michael was going to play them at his concert in the steinway hall in january tonight a good many musician friends had attended the sunday evening gathering and there had been no two opinions about the success of them i was talking to arthur lagden about them said falbe naming a prominent critic of the day and he would hardly believe that they were an opus i or that michael had not been studying music technically for years instead of six months but thats the odd thing about mike hes so mature it was not unusual for the brother and sister to sit up like this till any hour after their guests had gone and sylvia collected a bundle of cushions and lay full length on the floor with her feet towards the fire for both of them the week was too busy on six days for them to indulge that companionship sometimes full of talk sometimes consisting of those dropped words and long silences on which intimacy lives and they both enjoyed above all hours in the week this time that lay between the friendly riot of sunday evening and the starting of work again on monday there was between them that bond which can scarcely exist between husband and wife since it almost necessarily implies the close consanguinity of brother and sister and postulates a certain sort of essential community of nature founded not on tastes nor even on affection but on the fact that the same blood beats in the two here an intense affection too strong to be ever demonstrative fortified it and both brother and sister talked to each other as if they were speaking to some physically independent piece of themselves sylvia had nothing apparently to add on the subject of michaels maturity instead she just raised her head which was not quite high enough stuff another cushion under my head hermann she said thanks now im completely comfortable you will be relieved to hear hermann gazed at the fire in silence thats a weight off my mind he said about michael now hes been suppressed all his life you know and instead of being dwarfed he has just gone on growing inside good lord i wish somebody would suppress me for a year or two what a lot there would be when i took the cork out again we dissipate too much sylvia both you and i she gave a little grunt which from his knowledge of her inarticulate expressions he took to mean dissent i suppose you mean we dont he remarked yes how much one dissipates is determined for one just as is the shape of your nose or the colour of your eyes by the way i fell madly in love with that cousin of michaels who came with him tonight hes the most attractive creature i ever saw in my life of course hes too beautiful no boy ought to be as beautiful as that you flirted with him remarked hermann mike will probably murder him on the way home sylvia moved her feet a little farther from the blaze funny she asked instantly falbe knew that her mind was occupied with exactly the same question as his no not funny at all he said quite serious do you want to talk about it or not she gave a little groan no i dont want to but ive got to she said aunt barbarawe became sylvia and aunt barbara an hour or two ago and shes a dearaunt barbara has been talking to me about it already and what did aunt barbara say just what you are going to said sylvia namely that i had better make up my mind what i mean to say when michael says what he means to say she shifted round so as to face her brother as he stood in front of the fire and pulled his trouserleg more neatly over the top of his shoe but whats to happen if i cant make up my mind she said i neednt tell you how much i like michael i believe i like him as much as i possibly can but i dont know if that is enough hermann is it enough you ought to know theres no use in you unless you know about me she put out her arm and clasped his two legs in the crook of her elbow that expressed their attitude what they were to each other as absolutely as any physical demonstration allowed had there not been the difference of sex which severed them she could never have got the sense of support that this physical contact gave her had there not been her sisterhood to chaperon her so to speak she could never have been so at ease with a man the two were loverlike without the physical apexes and limitations that physical love must always bring with it the complement of sex that brought them so close annihilated the very existence of sex they loved as only brother and sister can love without trouble the closer contact of his firewarmed trousers to the calf of his leg made hermann step out of her encircling arm without any question of hurting her feelings i wont be burned he said sorry but i wont be burned it seems to me sylvia that you ought to like michael a little more and a little less its no use saying what i ought to do she said the idea of what i ought doesnt come in i like him just as much as i like him neither more nor less he clawed some more cushions together and sat down on the floor by her she raised herself a little and rested her body against his folded knees whats the trouble sylvia he said just what ive been trying to tell you be more concrete then youre definite enough when you sing she sighed and gave a little melancholy laugh thats just it she said people like you and me and michael too for that matter are most entirely ourselves when we are at our music when michael plays for me i can sing my soul at him while he and i are in music if you understandand of course you dowe belong to each other do you know hermann he finds me when im singing without the slightest effort and even you as you have so often told me have to search and be on the lookout and then the song is over and as somebody says when the feast is finished and the lamps expire thenwell the lamps expire and he isnt me any longer but michael with thethe ugly face andoh isnt it horrible of methe long arms and the little stumpy legsif only he was rather different in things that dont matter that cant matter butbut hermann if only michael was rather like you and you like michael i should love you exactly as much as ever and i should love michael too she was leaning forward and with both hands was very carefully tying and untying one of hermanns shoelaces oh thank goodness there is somebody in the world to whom i can say just whatever i feel and know he understands she said and i know this tooand follow me here hermanni know that all that doesnt really matter i am sure it doesnt i like michael far too well to let it matter but there are other things which i dont see my way through and they are much more real she was silent again so long that hermann reached out for a cigarette lit it and threw away the match before she spoke there is michaels position she said when michael asks me if i will have him as we both know he is going to do i shall have to make conditions i wont give up my career i must go on workingin other words singingwhether i marry him or not i dont call it singing in my sense of the word to sing the banks of allan water to michael and his father and mother at ashbridge any more than it is being a politician to read the morning papers and argue about the irish question with you to have a career in politics means that you must be a member of parliamenti daresay the house of lords would doand make speeches and stand the racket in the same way to be a singer doesnt mean to sing after dinner or to go squawking anyhow in a workhouse but it means to get up on a platform before critical people and if you dont do your very best be damned by them if i marry michael i must go on singing as a professional singer and not become an amateurthe viscountess comber who sings so charmingly i refuse to sing charmingly i will either sing properly or not at all and i couldnt not sing i shall have to continue being miss falbe so to speak you say you insist on it said hermann but whether you did or not there is nothing more certain than that michael would i am sure he would but by so doing he would certainly quarrel irrevocably with his people even aunt barbara who after all is very liberally minded sees that they can none of them not even she who are born to a certain tradition imagine that there are other traditions quite as stiffnecked michael it is true was born to one tradition but he has got the other as he has shown very clearly by refusing to disobey it he will certainly as you say insist on my endorsing the resolution he has made for himself what it comes to is this that i cant marry him without his fathers complete consent to all that i have told you i cant have my career disregarded covered up with awkward silences alluded to as a painful subject and as i say even aunt barbara seemed to take it for granted that if i became lady comber i should cease to be miss falbe well there shes wrong my dear i shall continue to be miss falbe whether im lady comber or lady ashbridge or the duchess of anything you please andhere the difficulty really comes inthey must all see how right i am difficulty did i say its more like an impossibility hermann threw the end of his cigarette into the ashes of the dying fire its clear then he said you have made up your mind not to marry him she shook her head oh hermann you fail me she said if i had made up my mind not to i shouldnt have kept you up an hour talking about it he stretched his hands out towards the embers already coated with grey ash then its like that with you he said pointing if there is the fire in you it is covered up with ashes she did not reply for a moment i think youve hit it there she said i believe there is the fire when as i said he plays for me i know there is but the ashes what are they and who shall disperse them for me she stood up swiftly drawing herself to her full height and stretching her arms out theres something bigger than we know coming she said whether its storm or sunshine i have no idea but there will be something that shall utterly sever michael and me or utterly unite us do you care which it is he asked yes i care said she he held out his hands to her and she pulled him up to his feet what are you going to say then when he asks you he said tell him he must wait he went round the room putting out the electric lamps and opening the big skylight in the roof there was a curtain in front of this which he pulled aside and from the frosty cloudless heavens the starshine of a thousand constellations filtered down thats a lot to ask of any man he said if you care you care and if you were a girl you would know exactly what i mean she said they may know they care but unless they are marrying for perfectly different reasons they have to feel to the end of their fingers that they care before they can say yes he opened the door for her to pass out and they walked up the passage together arminarm well perhaps michael wont ask you he said in which case all bother will be saved and we shall have sat up talking tillsylvia did you know it is nearly threesat up talking for nothing sylvia considered this fiddlesticks she said and hermann was inclined to agree with her this view of the case found confirmation next day for michael after his music lesson lingered so firmly and determinedly when the three chatted together over the fire that in the end hermann found nothing to do but to leave them together sylvia had given him no sign as to whether she wished him to absent himself or not and he concluded since she did not put an end to things by going away herself that she intended michael to have his say the latter rose as the door closed behind hermann and came and stood in front of her and at the moment sylvia could notice nothing of him except his heaviness his plainness all the things that she had told herself before did not really matter now her sensation contradicted that she was conscious that the ash somehow had vastly accumulated over her fire that all her affection and regard for him were suddenly eclipsed this was a complete surprise to her for the moment she found michaels presence and his proximity to her simply distasteful i thought hermann was never going he said for a second or two she did not reply it was clearly no use to continue the ordinary banter of conversation to suggest that as the room was hermanns he might conceivably be conceded the right to stop there if he chose there was no transition possible between the affairs of every day and the affair for which michael had stopped to speak she gave up all attempt to make one instead she just helped him what is it michael she asked then to her at any rate michaels face completely changed there burned in it all of a sudden the full glow of that of which she had only seen glimpses you know he said his shyness his awkwardness had all vanished the time had come for him to offer to her all that he had to offer and he did it with the charm of perfect manliness and simplicity whether you can accept me or not he said i have just to tell you that i am entirely yours is there any chance for me sylvia he stood quite still making no movement towards her she on her side found all her distaste of him suddenly vanished in the mere solemnity of the occasion his very quietness told her better than any protestations could have done of the quality of what he offered and that quality vastly transcended all that she had known or guessed of him i dont know michael she said at length she came a step forward and without any sense of embarrassment found that she without conscious intention had put her hands on his shoulders the moment that was done she was conscious of the impulse that made her do it it expressed what she felt yes i feel like that to you she said youre a dear i expect you know how fond i am of you and if you dont i assure you of it now but i have got to give you more than that michael looked up at her yes sylvia he said much more than that a few minutes ago only she had not liked him at all now she liked him immensely but how michael she asked how can i find it oh its i who have got to find it for you he said that is to say if you want it to be found do you she looked at him gravely without the tremor of a smile in her eyes what does that mean exactly she said it is very simple do you want to love me she did not move her hands they still rested on his shoulders like things at ease like things at home yes i suppose i want to she said and is that the most you can do for me at present he asked that reached her again all the time the plain words the plain face the quiet of him stabbed her with daggers of which he had no idea she was dismayed at the recollection of her talk with her brother the evening before of the ease and certitude with which she had laid down her conditions of not giving up her career of remaining the famous miss falbe of refusing to take a dishonoured place in the sacred circle of the combers now when she was face to face with his love so ineloquently expressed so radically a part of him she knew that there was nothing in the world external to him and her that could enter into their reckonings but into their reckonings there had not entered the one thing essential she gave him sympathy liking friendliness but she did not want him with her blood and though it was not humanly possible that she could want him with more than that it was not possible that she could take him with less yes that is the most i can do for you at present she said still quite quietly he moved away from her so that he stood free of her hands i have been constantly here all these last months he said now that you know what i have told you do you want not to see me that stabbed her again have i implied that she asked not directly but i can easily understand its being a bore to you i dont want to bore you that would be a very stupid way of trying to make you care for me as i said that is my job i havent accomplished it as yet but i mean to i only ask you for a hint she understood her own feeling better than he she understood at least that she was dealing with things that were necessarily incalculable i cant give you a hint she said i cant make any plans about it if you were a woman perhaps you would understand love is or it isnt that is all i know about it but michael persisted i only know what you have taught me he said but you must know that in a flash she became aware that it would be impossible for her to behave to michael as she had behaved to him for several months past she could not any longer put a hand on his shoulder beat time with her fingers on his arm knowing that the physical contact meant nothing to her and allall to him the rejection of him as a lover rendered the sisterly attitude impossible and not only must she revise her conduct but she must revise the mental attitude of which it was the physical counterpart up till this moment she had looked at the situation from her own side only had felt that no plans could be made that the natural thing was to go on as before with the intimacy that she liked and the familiarity that was the obvious expression of it but now she began to see the question from his side she could not go on doing that which meant nothing particular to her if that insouciance meant something so very particular to him she realised that if she had loved him the touch of his hand the proximity of his face would have had significance for her a significance that would have been intolerable unless there was something mutual and secret between them it had seemed so easy in anticipation to tell him that he must wait so simple for him justwell just to wait until she could make up her mind she believed as she had told her brother that she cared for michael or as she had told him that she wanted tothe two were to the girls mind identical though expressed to each in the only terms that were possiblebut until she came face to face with the picture of the future that to her wore the same outline and colour as the past she had not known the impossibility of such a presentment the desire of the lover on michaels part rendered unthinkable the sisterly attitude on hers that her instinct told her but her reason revolted against it cant we go on as we were michael she said he looked at her incredulously oh no of course not that he said she moved a step towards him i cant think of you in any other way she said as if making an appeal he stood absolutely unresponsive something within him longed that she should advance a step more that he should again have the touch of her hands on his shoulders but another instinct stronger than that made him revoke his desire and if she had moved again he would certainly have fallen back before her it may seem ridiculous to you he said since you do not care but i cant do that does that seem absurd to you i i am afraid it does but that is because you dont understand by all means let us be what they call excellent friends but there are certain little things which seem nothing to you and they mean so much to me i cant explain its just the brotherly relation which i cant stand its no use suggesting that we should be as we were before she understood well enough for his purposes i see she said michael paused for a moment i think ill be going now he said i am off to ashbridge in two days give hermann my love and a jolly christmas to you both ill let you know when i am back in town she had no reply to this she saw its justice and acquiesced goodbye then said michael he walked home from chelsea in that utterly blank and unfeeling consciousness which almost invariably is the sequel of any event that brings with it a change of attitude towards life generally not for a moment did he tell himself that he had been awakened from a dream or abandon his conviction that his dream was to be made real the rare quiet determination that had made him give up his stereotyped mode of life in the summer and take to music was still completely his and if anything it had been reinforced by sylvias emphatic statement that she wanted to care only her imagining that their old relations could go on showed him how far she was from knowing what to care meant at first without knowing it but with a gradually increasing keenness of consciousness he had become aware that this sisterly attitude of hers towards him had meant so infinitely much because he had taken it to be the prelude to something more now he saw that it was so to speak a piece complete in itself it bore no relation to what he had imagined it would lead into no curtain went up when the prelude was over the curtain remained inexorably hanging there not acknowledging the prelude at all not for a moment did he accuse her of encouraging him to have thought so she had but given him a frankness of comradeship that meant to her exactly what it expressed but he had thought otherwise he had imagined that it would grow towards a culmination all that and here was the change that made his mind blank and unfeeling had to be cut away and with it all the budding branches that his imagination had pictured as springing from it he could not be comrade to her as he was to her brotherthe inexorable demands of sex forbade it he went briskly enough through the clean dry streets the frost of last night had held throughout the morning and the sunlight sparkled with a rare and seasonable brightness of a traditional christmas weather hecatombs of turkeys hung in the poulterers windows among sprigs of holly and shops were bright with childrens toys the briskness of the day had flushed the colour into the faces of the passengers in the street and the festive air of the imminent holiday was abroad all this michael noticed with a sense of detachment what had happened had caused a veil to fall between himself and external things it was as if he was sealed into some glass cage and had no contact with what passed round him this lasted throughout his walk and when he let himself into his flat it was with the same sense of alienation that he found his cousin francis gracefully reclining on the sofa that he had pulled up in front of the fire francis was inclined to be querulous i was just wondering whether i should give you up he said the hour that you named for lunch was halfpast one and i have almost forgotten what your clock sounded like when it struck two this also seemed to matter very little did i ask you to lunch he said i really quite forgot i cant even remember doing it now but there will be lunch asked francis rather anxiously of course itll be ready in ten minutes michael came and stood in front of the fire and looked with a sudden spasm of envy on the handsome boy who lay there if he himself had been anything like that i was distinctly chippy this morning remarked francis and so i didnt so much mind waiting for lunch i attribute it to too much beer and bacon last night at your friends house i enjoyed iti mean the evening and for that matter the baconat the time it really was extremely pleasant he yawned largely and openly i had no idea you could frolic like that mike he said it was quite a new light on your character how did you learn to do it its quite a new accomplishment here again the veil was drawn was it last night only that falbe had played the variations and that they had acted charades francis proceeded in bland unconsciousness i didnt know germans could be so jolly he continued as a rule i dont like germans when they try to be jolly they generally only succeed in being topheavy but of course your friend is halfenglish cant he play too and to think of your having written those ripping tunes his sister toono wonder we havent seen much of you mike if thats where youve been spending your time shes rather like the new girl at the gaiety but handsomer i like big girls dont you oh i forgot you dont like girls much anyhow but are you learning your mistake mike you looked last night as if you were getting more sensible michael moved away impatiently oh shut it francis he observed francis raised himself on his elbow why whats up he asked wont she turn a favourable eye michael wheeled round savagely please remember you are talking about a lady and not a gaiety lady he remarked this brought francis to his feet sorry he said i was only indulging in badinage until lunch was ready michael could not make up his mind to tell his cousin what had happened but he was aware of having spoken more strongly than the situation as francis knew of it justified lets have lunch then he said we shall be better after lunch as ones nurse used to say and are you coming to ashbridge francis yes ive been talking to aunt bar about it this morning were both coming the family is going to rally round you mike and defend you from uncle robert theres sure to be some duck shooting too isnt there this was a considerable relief to michael oh thats ripping he said you and aunt barbara always make me feel that theres a good deal of amusement to be extracted from the world to be sure there is isnt that what the world is for lunch and amusement and dinner and amusement aunt bar told me she dined with you the other night and had a quantity of amusement as well as an excellent dinner she hinted oh aunt barbaras always hinting said michael i know after all everything that isnt hints is obvious and so theres nothing to say about it tell me more about the falbes mike will they let me go there again do you think was i popular dont tell me if i wasnt michael smiled at this egoism that could not help being charming would you care if you werent he asked very much one naturally wants to please delightful people and i think they are both delightful especially the girl but then she starts with the tremendous advantage of beingof being a girl i believe you are in love with her mike just as i am its that which makes you so grumpy but then you never do fall in love its a pity you miss a lot of jolly trouble michael felt a sudden overwhelming desire to make francis stop this maddening twaddle also the events of the morning were beginning to take on an air of reality and as this grew he felt the need of sympathy of some kind francis might not be able to give him anything that was of any use but it would do no harm to see if his cousins buoyant unconscious philosophy which made life so exciting and pleasant a thing to him would in any way help besides he must stop this light banter which was like drawing plaster off a sore and unhealed wound youre quite right he said i am in love with her furthermore i asked her to marry me this morning this certainly had an effect good lord said francis and do you mean to say she refused you she didnt accept me said michael wewe adjourned but why on earth didnt she take you asked francis all michaels old sensitiveness his selfconsciousness of his plainness his awkwardness his big hands his short legs came back to him i should think you could see well enough if you look at me he said without my telling you oh that silly old rot said francis cheerfully i thought you had forgotten all about it i almost hadin fact i quite had until this morning said michael if i had remembered it i shouldnt have asked her he corrected himself no i dont think thats true he said i should have asked her anyhow but i should have been prepared for her not to take me as a matter of fact i wasnt francis turned sideways to the table throwing one leg over the other thats nonsense he said it doesnt matter whether a mans ugly or not it doesnt as long as he is not remarked michael grimly it doesnt matter much in any case were all ugly compared to girls and why ever they should consent to marry any of us awful hairy things smelling of smoke and drink is more than i can make out but as a matter of fact they do they dont mind what we look like what they care about is whether we want them of course there are exceptions you see one said michael no i dont good lord youve only asked her once youve got to make yourself felt youre not intending to give up are you i couldnt give up well then just hold on she likes you doesnt she certainly said michael without hesitation but thats a long way from the other thing its on the same road michael got up it may be he said but it strikes me its round the corner you cant even see one from the other possibly not but you never know how near the corner really is go for her mike full speed ahead but how oh there are hundreds of ways im not sure that one of the best isnt to keep away for a bit even if she doesnt want you just now when you are there she may get to want you when you arent i dont think i should go on the mournful byronic plan if i were you i dont think it would suit your style youre too heavily built to stand leaning against the chimneypiece gazing at her and dishevelling your hair michael could not help laughing oh for gods sake dont make a joke of it he said why not it isnt a tragedy yet it wont be a tragedy till she marries somebody else or definitely says no and until a thing is proved to be tragic the best way to deal with it is to treat it like a comedy which is going to end well its only the second act now you see when everything gets into a mess by the merciful decrees of providence you see girls on the whole want us as much as we want them thats what makes it all so jolly michael went down next day to ashbridge where aunt barbara and francis were to follow the day after and found after the freedom and interests of the last six months that the pompous formal life was more intolerable than ever he was clearly in disgrace still as was made quite clear to him by his fathers icy and awful politeness when it was necessary to speak to him and by his utter unconsciousness of his presence when it was not this he had expected christmas had ushered in a truce in which no guns were discharged but remained sighted and pointed ready to fire but though there was no change in his father his mother seemed to michael to be curiously altered her mind which as has been already noticed was usually in a stunned condition seemed to have awakened like a child from its sleep and to have begun vaguely crying in an inarticulate discomfort it was true that petsy was no more having succumbed to a bilious attack of unusual severity but a second petsy had already taken her place and lady ashbridge sat with himit was a gentleman petsy this timein her lap as before and occasionally shed a tear or two over petsy ii in memory of petsy i but this did not seem to account for the wakening up of her mind and emotions into this state of depression and anxiety it was as if all her life she had been quietly dozing in the sun and that the place where she sat had passed into the shade and she had awoke cold and shivering from a bitter wind she had become far more talkative and though she had by no means abandoned her habit of upsetting any conversation by the extreme obviousness of her remarks she asked many more questions and as michael noticed often repeated a question to which she had received an answer only a few minutes before during dinner michael constantly found her looking at him in a shy and eager manner removing her gaze when she found it was observed and when later after a silent cigarette with his father in the smokingroom during which lord ashbridge with some ostentation studied an army list michael went to his bedroom he was utterly astonished when he gave a come in to a tapping at his door to see his mother enter her maid was standing behind her holding the inevitable petsy and she herself hovered hesitatingly in the doorway i heard you come up michael she said and i wondered if it would annoy you if i came in to have a little talk with you but i wont come in if it would annoy you i only thought i should like a little chat with you quietly secure from interruptions michael instantly got up from the chair in front of his fire in which he had already begun to see images of sylvia this intrusion of his mothers was a thing utterly unprecedented and somehow he at once connected its innovation with the strange manner he had remarked already but there was complete cordiality in his welcome and he wheeled up a chair for her but by all means come in mother he said i was not going to bed yet lady ashbridge looked round for her maid and will petsy not annoy you if he sits quietly on my knee she asked of course not lady ashbridge took the dog there that is nice she said i told them to see you had a good fire on this cold night has it been very cold in london this question had already been asked and answered twice now for the third time michael admitted the severity of the weather i hope you wrap up well she said i should be sorry if you caught cold and so i am sure your father would be i wish you could make up your mind not to vex him any more but go back into the guards im afraid thats impossible mother he said well if its impossible there is no use in saying anything more about it but it vexed him very much he is still vexed with you i wish he was not vexed it is a sad thing when father and son fall out but you do wrap up i hope in the cold weather michael felt a sudden pang of anxiety and alarm each separate thing that his mother said was sensible enough but in the sum they were nonsense you have been in london since september she went on that is a long time to be in london tell me about your life there do you work hard not too hard i hope no hard enough to keep me busy he said tell me about it all i am afraid i have not been a very good mother to you i have not entered into your life enough i want to do so now but i dont think you ever wanted to confide in me it is sad when sons dont confide in their mothers but i daresay it was my fault and now i know so little about you she paused a moment stroking her dogs ears which twitched under her touch i hope you are happy michael she said i dont think i am so happy as i used to be but dont tell your father i feel sure he does not notice it and it would vex him but i want you to be happy you used not to be when you were little you were always sensitive and queer but you do seem happier now and thats a good thing here again this was all sensible when taken in bits but its aspect was different when considered together she looked at michael anxiously a moment and then drew her chair closer to him laying her thin veined hand sparkling with many rings on his knee but it wasnt i who made you happier she said and thats so dreadful i never made anybody happy your father always made himself happy and he liked being himself but i suspect you havent liked being yourself poor michael but now that youre living the life you chose which vexes your father is it better with you the shyness had gone from the gaze that he had seen her direct at him at dinner which fugitively fluttered away when she saw that it was observed and now that it was bent so unwaveringly on him he saw shining through it what he had never seen before namely the motherlove which he had missed all his life now for the first time he saw it recognising it as by divination when with ray serene and untroubled it burst through the mists that seemed to hang about his mothers mind before noticing her change of manner her restless questions he had been vaguely alarmed and as they went on the alarm had become more pronounced but at this moment when there shone forth the motherinstinct which had never come out or blossomed in her life but had been overlaid completely with routine and conventionality rendering it too indolent to put forth petals michael had no thought but for that which she had never given him yet and which now it began to expand before him he knew he had missed all his life she took up his big hand that lay on his knee and began timidly stroking it since you have been away she said and since your father has been vexed with you i have begun to see how lonely you must have been what taught me that i am afraid was only that i have begun to feel lonely too nobody wants me even petsy when she died didnt want me to be near her and then it began to strike me that perhaps you might want me there was no one else and who should want me if my son did not i never gave you the chance before god forgive me and now perhaps it is too late you have learned to do without me that was bitterly true the truth of it stabbed michael on his side as he knew he had made no effort either or if he had they had been but childish efforts easily repulsed he had not troubled about it and if she was to blame the blame was his also she had been slow to show the motherinstinct but he had been just as wanting in the tenderness of the son he was profoundly touched by this humble timidity by the sincerity vague but unquestionable that lay behind it its never too late is it he said bending down and kissing the thin white hands that held his we are in time after all arent we she gave a little shiver oh dont kiss my hands michael she said it hurts me that you should do that but it is sweet of you to say that i am not too late after all michael may i just take you in my armsmay i he half rose oh mother how can you ask he said then let me do it no my darling dont move just sit still as you are and let me just get my arms about you and put my head on your shoulder and hold me close like that for a moment so that i can realise that i am not too late she got up and leaning over him held him so for a moment pressing her cheek close to his and kissing him on the eyes and on the mouth ah that is nice she said it makes my loneliness fall away from me i am not quite alone any more and now if you are not tired will you let me talk to you a little more and learn a little more about you she pulled her chair again nearer him so that sitting there she could clasp his arm i want your happiness dear she said but there is so little now that i can do to secure it i must put that into other hands you are twentyfive michael you are old enough to get married all combers marry when they are twentyfive dont they isnt there some girl you would like to be yours but you must love her you know you must want her you mustnt be able to do without her it wont do to marry just because you are twentyfive it would no more have entered into michaels head this morning to tell to his mother about sylvia than to have discussed counterpoint with her but then this morning he had not been really aware that he had a mother but to tell her now was not unthinkable but inevitable yes there is a girl whom i cant do without he said lady ashbridges face lit up ah tell me about hertell me about her she said you want her you cant do without her that is the right wife for you michael caught at his mothers hand as it stroked his sleeve but she is not sure that she can do with me he said her face was not dimmed at this oh you may be sure she doesnt know her own mind she said girls so often dont you must not be downhearted about it who is she tell me about her shes the sister of my great friend hermann falbe he said who teaches me music this time the gladness faded from her oh my dear it will vex your father again she said that you should want to marry the sister of a musicteacher it will never do to vex him again is she not a lady michael laughed but certainly she is he said her father was german her mother was a tracy just as wellborn as you or i how odd then that her brother should have taken to giving music lessons that does not sound good perhaps they are poor and certainly there is no disgrace in being poor and what is her name sylvia said michael you have probably heard of her she is the miss falbe who made such a sensation in london last season by her singing the old outlook the old traditions were beginning to come to the surface again in poor lady ashbridges mind oh my dear she said a singer that would vex your father terribly fancy the daughter of a miss tracy becoming a singer and yet you want herthat seems to me to matter most of all then came a step at the door it opened an inch or two and michael heard his fathers voice is your mother with you michael he asked at that lady ashbridge got up for one second she clung to her son and then disengaging herself froze up like the sudden congealment of a spring yes robert she said i was having a little talk to michael may i come in its our secret she whispered to michael yes come in father he said lord ashbridge stood towering in the doorway come my dear he said not unkindly its time for you to go to bed she had become the mask of herself again yes robert she said i suppose it must be late i will come oh theres petsy will you ring michael then fedden will come and take him to bed he sleeps with fedden chapter ix michael in desperate conversational efforts next morning at breakfast mentioned the fact that the german emperor had engaged him in a substantial talk at munich and had recommended him to pass the winter at berlin it was immediately obvious that he rose in his fathers estimation for though no doubt primarily the fact that michael was his son was the cause of this interest it gave michael a sort of testimonial also to his respectability if the emperor had thought that his taking up a musical career was indelibly disgracefulas lord ashbridge himself had donehe would certainly not have made himself so agreeable on anyone of lord ashbridges essential and deeprooted snobbishness this could not fail to make a certain effect his chilly politeness to michael sensibly thawed you might almost have detected a certain cordiality in his desire to learn as much as possible of this gratifying occurrence and you mean to go to berlin he asked im afraid i shant be able to said michael my master is in london i should be inclined to reconsider that michael said the father the emperor knows what he is talking about on the subject of music lady ashbridge looked up from the breakfast she was giving petsy ii his dietary was rather less rich than that of the defunct and she was afraid sometimes that his food was not nourishing enough i remember the concert we had here she said we had the song to aegir twice lord ashbridge gave her a quick glance michael felt he would not have noticed it the evening before your memory is very good my dear he said with encouragement and then we had a torchlight procession she remarked quite so you remember it perfectly and about his visit here michael did he talk about that yes very warmly also about our international relations lord ashbridge gave a little giggle i must tell barbara that he said she has become a sort of cassandra since she became a diplomatist and sits on her tripod and prophesies woe she asked me about it said michael i dont think she believes in his sincerity he giggled again thats because i didnt ask her down for his visit he said he rose and what are you going to do my dear he said to his wife she looked across to michael perhaps michael will come for a stroll with me she said no doubt he will i shall have a round of golf i think on this fine morning i should like to have a word with you michael when youve finished your breakfast the moment he had gone her whole manner changed it was suffused with the glow that had lit her last night and we shall have another talk dear she said it was tiresome being interrupted last night but your father was better pleased with you this morning michaels understanding of the situation grew clearer whatever was the change in his mother whatever perhaps it portended it was certainly accompanied by two symptoms the one the late dawning of motherlove for himself the other a certain fear of her husband for all her married life she had been completely dominated by him and had lived but in a twilight of her own now into that twilight was beginning to steal a dread of him his pleasure or his vexation had begun to affect her emotionally instead of being as before merely recorded in her mind as she might have recorded an object quite exterior to herself and seen out of the window now it was in the room with her even as michael left her to speak with him the consciousness of him rose again in her making her face anxious and youll try not to vex him wont you she said his father was in the smokingroom standing enormously in front of the fire and for the first time the sense of his colossal fatuity struck michael there are several things i want to tell you about he said your career first of all i take it that you have no intention of deferring to my wishes on the subject no father i am afraid not said michael i want you to understand then that though i shall not speak to you again about it my wishes are no less strong than they were it is something to me to know that a man whom i respect so much as the emperor doesnt feel as i do about it but that doesnt alter my view i understand said michael the next is about your mother he said do you notice any change in her yes said michael can you describe it at all michael hesitated she shows quite a new affection for myself he said she came and talked to me last night in a way she had never done before the irritation which michaels mere presence produced on his father was beginning to make itself felt the fact that michael was squat and longarmed and ugly had always a sideblow to deal at lord ashbridge in the reminder that he was his father he tried to disregard thishe tried to bring his mind into an impartial attitude without seeing for a moment the bitter irony of considering impartiality the ideal quality when dealing with his son he tried to be fair and michael was perfectly conscious of the effort it cost him i had noticed something of the sort he said your mother was always asking after you you have not been writing very regularly michael we know little about your life i have written to my mother every week said michael the magical effects of the emperors interest were dying out lord ashbridge became more keenly aware of the disappointment that michael was to him i have not been so fortunate then he said michael remembered his mothers anxious face but he could not let this pass no sir he said but you never answered any of my letters i thought it quite probable that it displeased you to hear from me i should have expressed my displeasure if i had felt it said his father with all the pomposity that was natural to him that had not occurred to me said michael i am afraid i took your silence to mean that my letters didnt interest you he paused a moment and his rebellion against the whole of his fathers attitude flared up besides i had nothing particular to say he said my life is passed in the pursuit of which you entirely disapprove he felt himself back in boyhood again with this stifling and leaden atmosphere of authority and disapproval to breathe he knew that francis in his place would have done somehow differently he could almost hear aunt barbara laughing at the pomposity of the situation that had suddenly erected itself monstrously in front of him the fact that he was michael comber vexed his fatherthere was no statement of the case so succinctly true lord ashbridge moved away towards the window turning his back on michael even his back his homespun norfolk jacket his loose knickerbockers his stalwart calves expressed disapproval but when his father spoke again he realised that he had moved away like that and obscured his face for a different reason have you noticed anything else about your mother he asked that made michael understand yes father he said i daresay i am wrong about it naturally i may not agree with you but i should like to know what it is shes afraid of you said michael lord ashbridge continued looking out of the window a little longer letting his eyes dwell on his own garden and his own fields where towered the leafless elms and the red roofs of the little town which had given him his own name and continued to give him so satisfactory an income there presented itself to his mind his own picture painted and framed and glazed and hung up by himself the beneficent nobleman the conscientious landlord the essential vertebra of englands backbone it was really impossible to impute blame to such a fine fellow he turned round into the room again braced and refreshed and saw michael thus it is quite true what you say he said with a certain pride in his own impartiality she has developed an extraordinary timidity towards me i have continually noticed that she is nervous and agitated in my presencei am quite unable to account for it in fact there is no accounting for it but i am thinking of going up to london before long and making her see some good doctor a little tonic i daresay though i dont suppose she has taken a dozen doses of medicine in as many years i expect she will be glad to go up for she will be near you the one delusionfor it is no less than thatis as strange as the other he drew himself up to his full magnificent height i do not mean that it is not very natural she should be devoted to her son he said with a tremendous air what he did mean was therefore uncertain and again he changed the subject there is a third thing he said this concerns you you are of the age when we combers usually marry i should wish you to marry michael during this last year your mother has asked half a dozen girls down here all of whom she and i consider perfectly suitable and no doubt you have met more in london i should like to know definitely if you have considered the question and if you have not i ask you to set about it at once michael was suddenly aware that never for a moment had sylvia been away from his mind even when his mother was talking to him last night sylvia had sat at the back in the inmost place throned and secure and now she stepped forward apart from the impossibility of not acknowledging her he wished to do it he wanted to wear her publicly though she was not his he wanted to take his allegiance oath though his sovereign heeded not i have considered the question he said and i have quite made up my mind whom i want to marry she is miss falbe miss sylvia falbe of whom you may have heard as a singer she is the sister of my musicmaster and i can certainly marry nobody else it was not merely defiance of the dreadful old tradition which lord ashbridge had announced in the manner of moses stepping down from sinai that prompted this appalling statement of the case it was the joy in the profession of his love it had to be flung out like that lord ashbridge looked at him a moment in dead silence i have not the honour of knowing missmiss falbe is it he said nor shall i have that honour michael got up there was that in his fathers tone that stung him to fury it is very likely that you will not he said since when i proposed to her yesterday she did not accept me somehow lord ashbridge felt that as an insult to himself indeed it was a double insult michael had proposed to this singer and this singer had not instantly clutched him he gave his dreadful little treble giggle and i am to bind up your broken heart he asked michael drew himself up to his full height this was an indiscretion for it but made his father recognise how short he was it brought farce into the tragic situation oh by no means he said my heart is not going to break yet i dont give up hope then in a flash he thought of his mothers pale anxious face her desire that he should not vex his father i am sorry he said but that is the case i wishi wish you would try to understand me i find you incomprehensible said lord ashbridge and left the room with his high walk and his swinging elbows well it was done now and michael felt that there were no new vexations to be sprung on his father it was bound to happen he supposed sooner or later and he was not sorry that it had happened sooner than he expected or intended sylvia so held sway in him that he could not help acknowledging her his announcement had broken from him irresistibly in spite of his mothers whispered word to him last night this is our secret it could not be secret when his father spoke like that and then with a flare of illumination he perceived how intensely his father disliked him nothing but sheer basic antipathy could have been responsible for that miserable retort am i to bind up your broken heart anger no doubt was the immediate cause but so utterly ungenerous a rejoinder to michaels announcement could not have been conceived except in a heart that thoroughly and rootedly disliked him that he was a continual monument of disappointment to his father he knew well but never before had it been quite plainly shown him how essential an object of dislike he was and the grounds of the dislike were now equally plainhis father disliked him exactly because he was his father on the other hand the last twentyfour hours had shown him that his mother loved him exactly because he was her son when these two new and undeniable facts were put side by side michael felt that he was an infinite gainer he went rather drearily to the window far off across the field below the garden he could see lord ashbridge walking airily along on his way to the links with his head held high his stick swinging in his hand his two retrievers at his heels no doubt already the soothing influences of nature were at worknature of course standing for the portion of trees and earth and houses that belonged to himand were expunging the depressing reflection that his wife and only son inspired in him and indeed such was actually the case lord ashbridge in his amazing fatuity could not long continue being himself without being cheered and invigorated by that fact and though when he set out his big white hands were positively trembling with passion he carried his balsam always with him but he had registered to himself even as michael had registered the fact that he found his son a most intolerable person and what vexed him most of all what made him clang the gate at the end of the field so violently that it hit one of his retrievers shrewdly on the nose was the sense of his own impotence he knew perfectly well that in point of view of determination that quality which in himself was firmness and in those who opposed him obstinacy michael was his match and the annoying thing was that as his wife had once told him michael undoubtedly inherited that quality from him it was as inalienable as the estates of which he had threatened to deprive his son and which as he knew quite well were absolutely entailed michael in this regard seemed no better than a common but successful thief he had annexed his fathers firmness and at his death would certainly annex all his pictures and trees and acres and the red roofs of ashbridge michael saw the gate so imperially slammed he heard the despairing howl of robin and though he was sorry for robin he could not help laughing he remembered also a ludicrous sight he had seen at the zoological gardens a few days ago two seals sitting bolt upright quarrelling with each other and making the most absurd grimaces and noises they neither of them quite dared to attack the other and so sat with their faces close together saying the rudest things aunt barbara would certainly have seen how inimitably his father and he had in their interview just now resembled the two seals and then he became aware that all the time au fond he had thought about nothing but sylvia and of sylvia not as the subject of quarrel but as just sylvia the singing sylvia with a hand on his shoulder the winter sun was warm on the south terrace of the house when an hour later he strolled out according to arrangement with his mother it had melted the rime of the night before that lay now on the grass in threads of minute diamonds though below the terrace wall and on the sunk rims of the empty garden beds it still persisted in outline of white heraldry a few monthly roses weak pink blossoms weary with the toil of keeping hope alive till the coming of spring hung dejected heads in the sunk garden where the hornbeam hedge that carried its russet leaves unfallen shaded them from the wind here too a few bulbs had pricked their way above ground and stood with stout erect horns daintily capped with rime all these things which for years had been presented to lady ashbridges notice without attracting her attention now filled her with minute childlike pleasure they were discoveries as entrancing and as magical as the first finding of the oval pieces of blue sky that a child sees one morning in a hedgesparrows nest now that she was alone with her son all her secret restlessness and anxiety had vanished and she remarked almost with glee that her husband had telephoned from the golf links to say that he would not be back for lunch then remembering that michael had gone to talk to his father after breakfast she asked him about the interview michael had already made up his mind as to what to say here knowing that his father was anxious about her he felt it highly unlikely that he would tell her anything to distress her and so he represented the interview as having gone off in perfect amity later in the day on his fathers return he had made up his mind to propose a truce between them as far as his mother was concerned whether that would be accepted or not he could not certainly tell but in the interval there was nothing to be gained by grieving her a great weight was lifted off her mind ah my dear that is good she said i was anxious so now perhaps we shall have a peaceful christmas i am glad your aunt barbara and francis are coming for though your aunt always laughs at your father she does it kindly does she not and as for francismy dear if god had given me two sons i should have liked the other to be like francis and shall we walk a little farther this way and see poor petsys grave petsys grave proved rather agitating there were doleful little stories of the last days to be related and petsy ii was tiresome and insisted on defying the world generally with shrill barkings from the top of the small mound conscious perhaps that his helpless predecessor slept below then their walk brought them to the band of trees that separated the links from the house from which lady ashbridge retreated fearful as she vaguely phrased it of being seen and by whom there was no need for her to explain then across the field came a group of children scampering home from school they ceased their shouting and their games as the others came near and demurely curtsied and took off their caps to lady ashbridge nice wellbehaved children said she a merry christmas to you all i hope you are all good children to your mothers as my son is to me she pressed his arm nodded and smiled at the children and walked on with him and michael felt the lump in his throat the arrival of aunt barbara and francis that afternoon did something by the mere addition of numbers to the party to relieve the tension of the situation lord ashbridge said little but ate largely and during the intervals of empty plates directed an impartial gaze at the portraits of his ancestors while wholly ignoring his descendant but michael was too wise to put himself into places where he could be pointedly ignored and the resplendent dinner with its six footmen and its silver service was not really more joyless than usual but his fathers majestic displeasure was more apparent when the three men sat alone afterwards and it was in dead silence that port was pushed round and cigarettes handed francis it is true made a couple of efforts to enliven things but his remarks produced no response whatever from his uncle and he subsided into himself thinking with regret of what an amusing evening he would have had if he had only stopped in town but when they rose michael signed to his cousin to go on and planted himself firmly in the path to the door it was evident that his father did not mean to speak to him but he could not push by him or walk over him there is one thing i want to say to you father said he i have told my mother that our interview this morning was quite amicable i do not see why she should be distressed by knowing that it was not his fathers face softened a moment yes i agree to that he said as far as that went the compact was observed and whenever lady ashbridge was present her husband made a point of addressing a few remarks to michael but there their intercourse ended michael found opportunity to explain to aunt barbara what had happened suggesting as a consolatory simile the domestic difficulties of the seals at the zoological gardens and was pleased to find her recognise the aptness of this description but heaviest of all on the spirits of the whole party sat the anxiety about lady ashbridge there could be no doubt that some cerebral degeneration was occurring and lady barbaras urgent representation to her brother had the effect of making him promise to take her up to london without delay after christmas and let a specialist see her for the present the pious fraud practised on her that michael and his father had had a good talk together and were excellent friends sufficed to render her happy and cheerful she had long dim talks full of repetition with michael whose presence appeared to make her completely content and when he was out or away from her she would sit eagerly waiting for his return petsy to the great benefit of his health got somewhat neglected by her her whole nature and instincts were alight with the motherlove that had burnt so late into flame with this tragic accompaniment of derangement she seemed to be groping her way back to the days when michael was a little boy and she was a young woman often she would seat herself at her piano if michael was not there to play to her and in a thin quavering voice sing the songs of twenty years ago she would listen to his playing beating time to his music and most of all she loved the hour when the day was drawing in and the first shadow and flame of dusk and firelight then with her hand in his sitting in her room where they would not be interrupted she would whisper fresh inquiries about sylvia offering to go herself to the girl and tell her how lovable her suitor was she lived in a dim subaqueous sort of consciousness physically quite well and mentally serene in the knowledge that michael was in the house and would presently come and talk to her for the others it was dismal enough this shadow that was to her a watery sunlight lay over them allthis and the further quarrel unknown to her between michael and his father when they all met as at meal times there was the miserable pretence of friendliness and comfortable ease kept up for fear of distressing lady ashbridge it was dreary work for all concerned but luckily not difficult of accomplishment a little chatter about the weather the merest small change of conversation especially if that conversation was held between michael and his father was sufficient to wreathe her in smiles and she would according to habit break in with some wrecking remark that entailed starting this talk all afresh but when she left the room a glowering silence would fall lord ashbridge would pick up a book or leave the room with his highstepping walk and erect head the picture of insulted dignity of the three he was far most to be pitied although the situation was the direct result of his own arrogance and selfimportance but arrogance and selfimportance were as essential ingredients of his character as was humour of aunt barbaras they were very awkward and tiresome qualities but this particular lord ashbridge would have no existence without them he was deeply and mortally offended with michael that alone was sufficient to make a sultry and stifling atmosphere and in addition to that he had the burden of his anxiety about his wife here came an extra sting for in common humanity he had by appearing to be friends with michael to secure her serenity and this could only be done by the continued profanation of his own highly proper and necessary attitude towards his son he had to address friendly words to michael that really almost choked him he had to practise cordiality with this wretch who wanted to marry the sister of a musicmaster michael had pulled up all the old traditions that carefullytended and pompous flowergarden as if they had been weeds and thrown them in his fathers face it was indeed no wonder that in his wifes absence he almost burst with indignation over the desecrated beds more than that his own selfesteem was hurt by his wifes fear of him just as if he had been a hard and unkind husband to her which he had not been but merely a very selfabsorbed and dominant one while the one person who could make her quite happy was his despised son michaels person michaels tastes michaels whole presence and character were repugnant to him and yet michael had the power which to do lord ashbridge justice he would have given much to be possessed of himself of bringing comfort and serenity to his wife on the afternoon of the day following christmas the two cousins had been across the estuary to ashbridge together francis who in spite of his habitual easiness of disposition and general good temper had found the conditions of anger and anxiety quite intolerable had settled to leave next day instead of stopping till the end of the week and michael acquiesced in this without any sense of desertion he had really only wondered why francis had stopped three nights instead of finding urgent private business in town after one he realised also somewhat with surprise that francis was no good when there was trouble about there was no one so delightful when there was so to speak a contest of who should enjoy himself the most and francis invariably won but if the subject of the contest was changed and the prize given for the individual who under depressing circumstances should contrive to show the greatest serenity of aspect francis would have lost with an even greater margin michael in fact was rather relieved than otherwise at his cousins immediate departure for it helped nobody to see the martyred st sebastian and it was merely odious for st sebastian himself in fact at this moment when michael was rowing them back across the fullflooded estuary francis was explaining this with his customary lucidity i dont do any good here mike he said uncle robert doesnt speak to me any more than he does to you except when aunt marion is there and theres nothing going on is there i practically asked if i might go duckshooting today and uncle robert merely looked out of the window but if anybody specially you wanted me to stop why of course i would but i dont said michael thanks awfully gosh look at those ducks theyre just wanting to be shot but there it is then certainly uncle robert doesnt want me nor aunt marion i say what do they think is the matter with her michael looked round then took rather too late another pull on his oars and the boat gently grated on the pebbly mud at the side of the landingplace franciss question the goodhumoured insouciance of it grated on his mind in rather similar fashion we dont know yet he said i expect we shall all go back to town in a couple of days so that she may see somebody francis jumped out briskly and gracefully and stood with his hands in his pockets while michael pushed off again and brought the boat into its shed i do hope its nothing serious he said she looks quite well doesnt she i daresay its nothing but shes been alone hasnt she with uncle robert all these weeks that would give her the hump too michael felt a sudden spasm of impatience at these elegant and consoling reflections but now in the light of his own increasing maturity he saw how hopeless it was to feel franciss deficiencies his entire lack of deep feeling he was made like that and if you were fond of anybody the only possible way of living up to your affection was to attach yourself to their qualities they strolled a little way in silence and why did you tell uncle robert about sylvia falbe asked francis i cant understand that for the present anyhow she had refused you there was nothing to tell him about if i was fond of a girl like that i should say nothing about it if i knew my people would disapprove until i had got her michael laughed oh yes you would he said if you were to use your own words fond of her like that you couldnt help it at least i couldnt itsits such a glory to be fond like that he stopped we wont talk about it he saidor rather i cant talk about it if you dont understand but she had refused you said the sensible francis that makes no difference she shines through everything through the infernal awfulness of these days through my fathers anger and my mothers illness whatever it proves to bei think about them really with all my might and at the end i find ive been thinking about sylvia everything is shethe woods the tideoh i cant explain they had walked across the marshy land at the edge of the estuary and now in front of them was the steep and direct path up to the house and the longer way through the woods at this point the estuary made a sudden turn to the left sweeping directly seawards and round the corner immediately in front of them was the long reach of deep water up which even when the tide was at its lowest an oceangoing steamer could penetrate if it knew the windings of the channel today in the windless cold calm of midwinter though the sun was brilliant in a blue sky overhead an opaque mist thick as cottonwool lay over the surface of the water and taking the winding road through the woods which following the estuary turned the point they presently found themselves as they mounted quite clear of the mist that lay below them on the river their steps were noiseless on the mossy path and almost immediately after they had turned the corner as francis paused to light a cigarette they heard from just below them the creaking of oars in their rowlocks it caught the ears of them both and without conscious curiosity they listened on the moment the sound of rowing ceased and from the dense mist just below them there came a sound which was quite unmistakable namely the plop of something heavy dropped into the water that sound by some remote form of association suddenly recalled to michaels mind certain questions aunt barbara had asked him about the emperors stay at ashbridge and his own recollection of his having gone up and down the river in a launch there was something further which he did not immediately recollect yes it was the request that if when he was here at christmas he found strangers hanging about the deepwater reach of which the chart was known only to the admiralty he should let her know here at this moment they were overlooking the mistswathed water and here at this moment unseen was a boat rowing stealthily stopping and perhaps making soundings he laid his hand on franciss arm with a gesture for silence then invisible below someone said fifteen fathoms and again the oars creaked audibly in the rowlocks michael took a step towards his cousin so that he could whisper to him come back to the boat he said i want to row round and see who that is wait a moment though the oars below made some halfdozen strokes and then were still again once more there came the sound of something heavy dropped into the water someone is making soundings in the channel there he said come they went very quietly till they were round the point then quickened their steps and michael spoke thats the uncharted channel he said at least only the admiralty have the soundings the waters deep enough right across for a ship of moderate draught to come up but there is a channel up which any manofwar can pass of course it may be an admiralty boat making fresh soundings but not likely on boxing day what are you going to do asked francis striding easily along by michaels short steps just see if we can find out who it is aunt barbara asked me about it ill tell you afterwards now the tides going out we can drop down with it and we shant be heard ill row just enough to keep her head straight sit in the bow francis and keep a sharp lookout foot by foot they dropped down the river and soon came into the thick mist that lay beyond the point it was impossible to see more than a yard or two ahead but the same dense obscurity would prevent any further range of vision from the other boat and if it was still at its work the sound of its oars or of voices michael reflected might guide him to it from the lisp of little wavelets lapping on the shore below the woods he knew he was quite close in to the bank and close also to the place where the invisible boat had been ten minutes before then in the bewildering unlocalised manner in which sound without the corrective guidance of sight comes to the ears he heard as before the creaking of invisible oars somewhere quite close at hand next moment the dark prow of a rowingboat suddenly loomed into sight on their starboard and he took a rapid stroke with his righthand scull to bring them up to it but at the same moment while yet the occupants of the other boat were but shadows in the mist they saw him and a quick word of command rang out rowrow hard it cried and with a frenzied churning of oars in the water the other boat shot by them making down the estuary next moment it had quite vanished in the mist leaving behind it knots of swirling water from its oarblades michael started in vain pursuit his craft was heavy and clumsy and from the retreating and faintgrowing sound of the other it was clear that he could get no pace to match still less to overtake them soon he pantingly desisted but an admiralty boat wouldnt have run away he said theyd have asked us who the devil we were but who else was it asked francis michael mopped his forehead aunt barbara would tell you he said she would tell you that they were german spies francis laughed or timbuctoo niggers he remarked and that would be an odd thing too said michael but at that moment he felt the first chill of the shadow that menaced if by chance aunt barbara was right and if already the clear tranquillity of the sky was growing dim as with the mist that lay that afternoon on the waters of the deep reach and covered mysterious movements which were going on below it england and germanythere was so much of his life and his heart there music and song and sylvia chapter x michael had heard the verdict of the brain specialist who yesterday had seen his mother and was sitting in his room beside his unopened piano quietly assimilating it and without making plans of his own initiative contemplating the forms into which the future was beginning to fall mapping itself out below him outlining itself as when objects in a room as the light of morning steals in take shape again and even as they take the familiar shapes so already he felt that he had guessed all this in that week down at ashbridge from which he had returned with his father and mother a couple of days before she was suffering without doubt from some softening of the brain nothing of remedial nature could possibly be done to arrest or cure the progress of the disease and all that lay in human power was to secure for her as much content and serenity as possible in her present condition there was no question of putting her under restraint nor indeed could she be certified by any doctor as insane she would have to have a trained attendant she would live a secluded life from which must be kept as far as possible anything that could agitate or distress her and after that there was nothing more that could be done except to wait for the inevitable development of her malady this might come quickly or slowly there was no means of forecasting that though the rapid deterioration of her brain which had taken place during those last two months made it on the whole likely that the progress of the disease would be swift it was quite possible on the other hand that it might remain stationary for months and in answer to a question of michaels sir james had looked at him a moment in silence then he answered both for her sake and for the sake of all of you he had said one hopes that it will be swift lord ashbridge had just telephoned that he was coming round to see michael a message that considerably astonished him since it would have been more in his manner in the unlikely event of his wishing to see his son to have summoned him to the house in curzon street however he had announced his advent and thus waiting for him and not much concerning himself about that michael let the future map itself already it was sharply defined its boundaries and limits were clear and though it was yet untravelled it presented to him a familiar aspect and he felt that he could find his allotted road without fail though he had never yet traversed it it was strongly marked there could be no difficulty or question about it indeed a week ago when first the recognition of his mothers condition with the symptoms attached to it was known to him he had seen the signpost that directed him into the future lord ashbridge made his usual flamboyant entry prancing and swinging his elbows whatever happened he would still be lord ashbridge with his grey tophat and his large carnation and his enviable position you will have heard what sir jamess opinion is about your poor mother he said it was in consequence of what he recommended when he talked over the future with me that i came to see you michael guessed very well what this recommendation was but with a certain stubbornness and sense of what was due to himself he let his father proceed with the not very welcome task of telling him in fact michael he said i have a favour to ask of you the fact of his being lord ashbridge and the fact of michael being his unsatisfactory son stiffened him and he had to qualify the favour perhaps i should not say i am about to ask you a favour he corrected himself but rather to point out to you what is your obvious duty suddenly it struck michael that his father was not thinking about lady ashbridge at all nor about him but in the main about himself all had to be done from the dominant standpoint he owed it to himself to alleviate the conditions under which his wife must live he owed it to himself that his son should do his part as a comber there was no longer any possible doubt as to what this favour or this direction of duty must be but still michael chose that his father should state it he pushed a chair forward for him wont you sit down he said thank you i would rather stand yes it is not so much a favour as the indication of your duty i do not know if you will see it in the same light as i you have shown me before now that we do not take the same view michael felt himself bristling his father certainly had the effect of drawing out in him all the feelings that were better suppressed i think we need not talk of that now sir he remarked certainly it is not the subject of my interview with you now the fact is this in some way your presence gives a certain serenity and content to your mother i noticed that at ashbridge and indeed there has been some trouble with her this morning because i could not take her to come to see you with me i ask you therefore for her sake to be with us as much as you can in short to come and live with us michael nodded saluting so to speak the signpost into the future as he passed it i had already determined to do that he said i had determined at any rate to ask your permission to do so it is clear that my mother wants me and no other consideration can weigh with that lord ashbridge still remained completely selfsufficient i am glad you take that view of it he said i think that is all i have to say now michael was an adept at giving as indicated before when he gave he gave nobly and he could not only outwardly disregard but he inwardly cancelled the wonderful ungenerosity with which his father received that did not concern him i will make arrangements to come at once he said if you can receive me today that will hardly be worth while will it i am taking your mother back to ashbridge tomorrow michael got up in silence after all this gift of himself of his time of his liberty of all that constituted life to him was made not to his father but to his mother it was made as his heart knew not ungrudgingly only but eagerly and if it had been recommended by the doctor that she should go to ashbridge he would have entirely disregarded the large additional sacrifice on himself which it entailed thus it was not owing to any retraction of his gift or reconsideration of it that he demurred i hope you willwill meet me halfway about this sir he said you must remember that all my work lies in london i want naturally to continue that as far as i can if you go to ashbridge it is completely interrupted my friends are here too everything i have is here his father seemed to swell a little he appeared to fill the room and all my duties lie at ashbridge he said as you know i am not of the type of absentee landlords it is quite impossible that i should spend these months in idleness in town i have never done such a thing yet nor i may say would our class hold the position they do if we did we shall come up to town after easter should your mothers health permit it but till then i could not dream of neglecting my duties in the country now michael knew perfectly well what his fathers duties on that excellently managed estate were they consisted of a biweekly interview in the businessroom an abode of files and stags heads in which lord ashbridge received various reports of building schemes and repairs of a round of golf every afternoon and of reading the lessons and handing the offertorybox on sunday that at least was the sumtotal as it presented itself to him and on which he framed his conclusions but he left out altogether the moral effect of the big landlord living on his own land and being surrounded by his own dependents which his father on the other hand so vastly overestimated it was clear that there was not likely to be much accord between them on this subject but could you not go down there perhaps once or twice a week and get bailey to come and consult you here he asked lord ashbridge held his head very high that would be completely out of the question he said all this michael felt had nothing to do with the problem of his mother and himself it was outside it altogether and concerned only his fathers convenience he was willing to press this point as far as possible i had imagined you would stop in london he said supposing under these circumstances i refuse to live with you i should draw my own conclusion as to the sincerity of your profession of duty towards your mother and practically what would you do asked michael your mother and i would go to ashbridge tomorrow all the same another alternative suddenly suggested itself to michael which he was almost ashamed of proposing for it implied that his father put his own convenience as outweighing any other consideration but he saw that if only lord ashbridge was selfish enough to consent to it it had manifest merits his mother would be alone with him free of the presence that so disconcerted her i propose then he said that she and i should remain in town as you want to be at ashbridge he had been almost ashamed of suggesting it but no such shame was reflected in his fathers mind this would relieve him of the perpetual embarrassment of his wifes presence and the perpetual irritation of michaels he had persuaded himself that he was making a tremendous personal sacrifice in proposing that michael should live with them and this relieved him of the necessity upon my word michael he said with the first hint of cordiality that he had displayed that is very well thought of let us consider it is certainly the case that this derangement in your poor mothers mind has caused her to take what i might almost call a dislike to me i mentioned that to sir james though it was very painful for me to do so and he said that it was a common and most distressing symptom of brain disease that the sufferer often turned against those he loved best your plan would have the effect of removing that he paused a moment and became even more sublimely fatuous you too he said it would obviate the interruption of your work about which you feel so keenly you would be able to go on with it of myself i dont think at all i shall be lonely no doubt at ashbridge but my own personal feelings must not be taken into account yes it seems to me a very sensible notion we shall have to see what your mother says to it she might not like me to be away from her in spite of her apparenterdislike of me it must all depend on her attitude but for my part i think very well of your scheme thank you michael for suggesting it he left immediately after this to ascertain lady ashbridges feelings about it and walked home with a complete resumption of his usual exuberance it indeed seemed an admirable plan it relieved him from the nightmare of his wifes continual presence and this he expressed to himself by thinking that it relieved her from his it was not that he was deficient in sympathy for her for in his selfcentred way he was fond of her but he could sympathise with her just as well at ashbridge he could do no good to her and he had not for her that instinct of love which would make it impossible for him to leave her he would also be spared the constant irritation of having michael in the house and this he expressed to himself by saying that michael disliked him and would be far more at his ease without him furthermore michael would be able to continue his studies of this too in spite of the fact that he had always done his best to discourage them he made a selflaudatory translation by telling himself that he was very glad not to have to cause michael to discontinue them in fine he persuaded himself without any difficulty that he was a very fine fellow in consenting to a plan that suited him so admirably and only wondered that he had not thought of it himself there was nothing after his wife had expressed her joyful acceptance of it to detain him in town and he left for ashbridge that afternoon while michael moved into the house in curzon street michael entered upon his new life without the smallest sense of having done anything exceptional or even creditable it was so perfectly obvious to him that he had to be with his mother that he had no inclination to regard himself at all in the matter the thing was as simple as it had been to him to help francis out of financial difficulties with a gift of money there was no effort of will no sense of sacrifice about it it was merely the assertion of a paramount instinct the life limited his freedom for for a great part of the day he was with his mother and between his music and his attendance on her he had but little leisure occasionally he went out to see his friends but any prolonged absence on his part always made her uneasy and he would often find her on his return sitting in the hall waiting for him so as to enjoy his presence from the first moment that he reentered the house but though he found no food for reflection in himself aunt barbara who came to see them some few days after michael had been installed here found a good deal they had all had tea together and afterwards lady ashbridges nurse had come down to fetch her upstairs to rest and then aunt barbara surprised michael for she came across the room to him with her kind eyes full of tears and kissed him my dear i must say it once she said and then you will know that it is always in my mind you have behaved nobly michael its a big word but i know no other as for your father michael interrupted her oh i dont understand him he said at least thats the best way to look at it lets leave him out he paused a moment after all it is a much better plan than our living all three of us at ashbridge its better for my mother and for me and for him i know but how he could consent to the better plan she said well let us leave him out poor robert he and his golf my dear your father is a very ludicrous person you know but about you michael do you think you can stand it he smiled at her why of course i can he said indeed i dont think ill accept that statement of it itsits such a score to be able to be of use you know i can make my mother happy nobody else can i think im getting rather conceited about it yes dear i find you insufferable remarked aunt barbara parenthetically then you must just bear it the thing ismichael took a moment to find the words he searched forthe thing is i want to be wanted well its no light thing to be wanted by your mother even if he sat down on the sofa by his aunt aunt barbara how ironically gifts come he said this was rather a sinister way of giving that my mother should want me like this just as her brain was failing and yet that failure doesnt affect the quality of her love is it something that shines through the poor tattered fabric anyhow it has nothing to do with her brain it is she herself somehow not anything of hers that wants me and you ask if i can stand it michael with his ugly face and his kind eyes and his simple heart seemed extraordinarily charming just then to aunt barbara she wished that sylvia could have seen him then in all the unconsciousness of what he was doing so unquestioningly or that she could have seen him as she had with his mother during the last hour lady ashbridge had insisted on sitting close to him and holding his hand whenever she could possess herself of it of plying him with a hundred repeated questions and never once had she made michael either ridiculous or selfconscious and this she reflected went on most of the day and for how many days it would go on none knew yet michael could not consider even whether he could stand it he rejected the expression as meaningless and your friends she said do you manage to see them oh yes occasionally said michael they dont come here for the presence of strangers makes my mother agitated she thinks they have some design of taking her or me away but she wants to see sylvia she knows aboutabout her and me and i cant make up my mind what to do about it she is always asking if i cant take her to see sylvia or get her to come here and why not sylvia knows about your mother i suppose i expect so i told hermann but i am afraid my mother willwell you cant call it arguingbut will try to persuade her to have me i cant let sylvia in for that nor if it comes to that can i let myself in for that cant you impress on your mother that she mustnt michael leaned forward to the fire pondering this and stretching out his big hands to the blaze yes i might he said i should love to see sylvia again just see her you know we settled that the old terms we were on couldnt continue at least i settled that and she understood sylvia is a gaby remarked aunt barbara im rather glad you think so oh get her to come said she im sure your mother will do as you tell her ill be here too if you like if that will do any good by the way i see your hermanns piano recital comes off tomorrow i know my mother wants to go to that and i think i shall take her will you come too aunt barbara and sit on the other side of her my variations are going to be played if they are a success hermann tells me i shall be dragged screaming on to the platform and have to bow lord and if theyre not well lord also yes my dear of course ill come let me see i shall have to lie as i have another engagement but a little thing like that doesnt bother me suddenly she clapped her hands together my dear i quite forgot she said michael such excitement you remember the boat you heard taking soundings on the deepwater reach of course you do well i sent that information to the proper quarter and since then watch has been kept in the woods just above it last night only the coastguard police caught four men at itall germans they tried to escape as they did before by rowing down the river but there was a steam launch below which intercepted them they had on them a chart of the reach with soundings nearly complete and when they searched their housesthey are all tenants of your astute father who merely laughed at usthey found a very decent map of certain private areas at harwich oh im not such a fool as i look they thanked me my dear for my information and i very gracefully said that my information was chiefly got by you but did those men live in ashbridge asked michael yes and your father will have four decorous houses on his hands i am glad he should not have laughed at us it will teach him i hope and now my dear i must go she stood up and put her hand on michaels arm and you know what i think of you she said tomorrow evening then i hate music usually but then i adore mr hermann i only wish he wasnt a german cant you get him to naturalise himself and his sister you wouldnt ask that if you had seen him in munich said michael i suppose not patriotism is such a degrading emotion when it is not english michaels variations came some halfway down the programme next evening and as the moment for them approached lady ashbridge got more and more excited i hope he knows them by heart properly dear she whispered to michael i shall be so nervous for fear hell forget them in the middle which is so liable to happen if you play without your notes michael laid his hand on his mothers hush mother he said you mustnt talk while hes playing well i was only whispering but if you tell me i mustnt the hall was crammed from end to end for not only was hermann a person of innumerable friends but he had already a considerable reputation and being a german all musical england went to hear him and tonight he was playing superbly after a couple of days of miserable nervousness over his debut as a pianist but his temperament was one of those that are strung up to their highest pitch by such nervous agonies he required just that to make him do full justice to his own personality and long before he came to the variations michael felt quite at ease about his success there was no question about it any more the whole audience knew that they were listening to a master in the row immediately behind michaels party were sitting sylvia and her mother who had not quite been torn away from her novels since she had sought the love of hermione hogarth underneath her cloak and read it furtively in pauses they had come in after michael and until the interval between the classical and the modern section of the concert he was unaware of their presence then idly turning round to look at the crowded hall he found himself face to face with the girl i had no idea you were there he said hermann will do wont he i think and then suddenly the words of commonplace failed him and he looked at her in silence i knew you were back she said hermann told me abouteverything michael glanced sideways indicating his mother who sat next him and was talking to barbara i wondered whether perhaps you would come and see my mother and me he said may i write she looked at him with the friendliness of her smiling eyes and her grave mouth is it necessary to ask she said michael turned back to his seat for his mother had had quite enough of her sisterinlaw and wanted him again she looked over her shoulder for a moment to see whom michael was talking to im enjoying my concert dear she said and who is that nice young lady is she a friend of yours the interval was over and hermann returned to the platform and waiting for a moment for the buzz of conversation to die down gave out without any preliminary excursion on the keys the text of michaels variations then he began to tell them with light and flying fingers what that simple tune had suggested to michael how he imagined himself looking on at an oldfashioned dance and while the dancers moved to the graceful measure of a minuet or daintily in a gavotte the tune of good king wenceslas still rang in his head or how in the joy of the sunlight of a spring morning it still haunted him it lay behind a cascade of foaming waters that leaping roared into a ravine it marched with flying banners on some day of victorious entry it watched a funeral procession wind by with tapers and the smell of incense it heard as it got nearer back to itself again the peals of christmas bells and stood forth again in its own person decorated and emblazoned hermann had already captured his audience now he held them tame in the hollow of his hand twice he bowed and then in answer to the demand just beckoned with his finger to michael who rose for a moment his mother wished to detain him youre not going to leave me my dear are you she asked anxiously he waited to explain to her quietly left her and feeling rather dazed made his way round to the back and saw the open door on to the platform confronting him he felt that no power on earth could make him step into the naked publicity there but at the moment hermann appeared in the doorway come on mike he said laughing thank the pretty ladies and gentlemen lord isnt it all a lark michael advanced with him stared and hoped he smiled properly though he felt that he was nailing some hideous grimace to his face and then just below him he saw his mother eagerly pointing him out to a total stranger with gesticulation and just behind her sylvia looking at her and not at him with such tenderness such kindly pity there were the two most intimately bound into his life the mother who wanted him the girl whom he wanted and by his side was hermann who as michael always knew had thrown open the gates of life to him all the rest even including aunt barbara seemed of no significance in that moment afterwards no doubt he would be glad they were pleased be proud of having pleased them but just now even when for the first time in his life that intoxicating wine of appreciation was given him he stood with it bubbling and yellow in his hand not drinking of it michael had prepared the way of sylvias coming by telling his mother the identity of the nice young lady at the concert he had also impressed on her the paramount importance of not saying anything with regard to him that could possibly embarrass the nice young lady and when sylvia came to tea a few days later he was quite without any uneasiness while for himself he was only conscious of that thirst for her physical presence the desire as he had said to aunt barbara just to see her nor was there the slightest embarrassment in their meeting it was clear that there was not the least difficulty either for him or her in being natural which as usually happens was the complete solution that is good of you to come he said meeting her almost at the door my mother has been looking forward to your visit mother dear here is miss falbe lady ashbridge was pathetically eager to be what she called good michael had made it clear to her that it was his wish that miss falbe should not be embarrassed and any wish just now expressed by michael was of the nature of a divine command to her well this is a pleasure she said looking across to michael with the eyes of a dog on a beloved master and we are not strangers quite are we miss falbe we sat so near each other to listen to your brother who i am sure plays beautifully and the music which michael made havent i got a clever son and such a good one sylvia was unerring michael had known she would be indeed you have she said sitting down by her and michael mustnt hear what we say about him must he or hell be getting conceited lady ashbridge laughed and that would never do would it she said still retaining sylvias hand then a little dim ripple of compunction broke in her mind michael she said we are only joking about your getting conceited miss falbe and i are only joking andand wont you take off your hat miss falbe for you are not going to hurry away are you you are going to pay us a long visit michael had not time to remind his mother that ladies who come to tea do not usually take their hats off for on the word sylvias hands were busy with her hatpins im so glad you suggested that she said i always want to take my hat off i dont know who invented hats but i wish he hadnt lady ashbridge looked at her masses of bright hair and could not help telegraphing a note of admiration as it were to michael now thats more comfortable she said you look as if you werent going away next minute when i like to see people i hate their going away im afraid sometimes that michael will go away but he tells me he wont and you liked michaels music miss falbe was it not clever of him to think of all that out of one simple little tune and he tells me you sing so nicely perhaps you would sing to us when weve had tea oh and here is my sisterinlaw do you know herlady barbara my dear what is your husbands name seeing sylvia uncovered lady barbara with a tact that was creditable to her but strangely unsuccessful also began taking off her hat her sisterinlaw was too polite to interfere but as a matter of fact she did not take much pleasure in the notion that barbara was going to stay a very long time too she was fond of her but it was not barbara whom michael wanted she turned her attention to the girl again my husbands away she said confidentially he is very busy down at ashbridge and i daresay he wont find time to come up to town for many weeks yet but you know michael and i do very well without him very well indeed and it would never do to take him away from his dutieswould it michael here was a shoal to be avoided no you mustnt think of tempting him to come up to town said michael give me some tea for aunt barbara this answer entranced lady ashbridge she had to nudge michael several times to show that she understood the brilliance of it and put lump after lump of sugar into barbaras cup in her rapt appreciation of it but very soon she turned to sylvia again and your brother is a friend of michaels too isnt he she said some day perhaps he will come to see me we dont see many people michael and i for we find ourselves very well content alone but perhaps some day he will come and play his concert over again to us and then perhaps if you ask me i will sing to you i used to sing a great deal when i was younger michaelwhere has michael gone michael had just left the room to bring some cigarettes in from next door and lady ashbridge ran after him calling him she found him in the hall and brought him back triumphantly now we will all sit and talk for a long time she said you one side of me miss falbe and michael the other or would you be so kind as to sing for us michael will play for you and would it annoy you if i came and turned over the pages it would give me a great deal of pleasure to turn over for you if you will just nod each time when you are ready sylvia got up why of course she said what have you got michael i havent anything with me michael found a volume of schubert and once again as on the first time he had seen her she sang who is sylvia while he played and lady ashbridge had her eyes fixed now on one and now on the other of them waiting for their nod to do her part and then she wanted to sing herself and with some faroff remembrance of the airs and graces of twentyfive years ago she put her handkerchief and her rings on the top of the piano and playing for herself emitted faint treble sounds which they knew to be the soldiers farewell then presently her nurse came for her to lie down before dinner and she was inclined to be tearful and refuse to go till michael made it clear that it was his express and sovereign will that she should do so then very audibly she whispered to him may i ask her to give me a kiss she said she looks so kind michael i dont think she would mind sylvia went back home with a little heartache for michael wondering if she was in his place if her mother instead of being absorbed in her novels demanded such incessant attentions whether she had sufficient love in her heart to render them with the exquisite simplicity the tender patience that michael showed well as she knew him greatly as she liked him she had not imagined that he or indeed any man could have behaved quite like that there seemed no effort at all about it he was not trying to be patient he had the sense of patiences perfect work natural to him he did not seem to have to remind himself that his mother was ill and thus he must be gentle with her he was gentle with her because he was in himself gentle and yet though his behaviour was no effort to him she guessed how wearying must be the continual strain of the situation itself she felt that she would get cross from mere fatigue however excellent her intentions might be however willing the spirit and no one so she had understood from barbara could take michaels place in his occasional absences his mother was fretful and miserable and day by day michael left her less she would sit close to him when he was practisinga thing that to her or to hermann would have rendered practice impossibleand if he wrestled with one hand over a difficult bar she would take the other into hers would ask him if he was not getting tired would recommend him to rest for a little and yet michael who last summer had so stubbornly insisted on leading his own life and had put his determination into effect in the teeth of all domestic opposition now with more than cheerfulness laid his own life aside in order to look after his mother sylvia felt that the real heroisms of life were not so much the fine heady deeds which are so obviously admirable as such serene steadfastness such unvarying patience as that which she had just seen her whole soul applauded michael and yet below her applause was this heartache for him the desire to be able to help him to bear the burden which must be so heavy though he bore it so blithely but in the very nature of things there was but one way in which she could help him and in that she was powerless she could not give him what he wanted but she longed to be able to chapter xi it was a morning of early march and michael looking out from the diningroom window at the house in curzon street where he had just breakfasted alone was smitten with wonder and a secret ecstasy for he suddenly saw and felt that it was winter no longer but that spring had come for the last week the skies had screamed with outrageous winds and had been populous with flocks of sullen clouds that discharged themselves in sleet and snowy rain and half last night for he had slept very badly he had heard the dashing of showers as of winddriven spray against the windowpanes and had listened to the fierce rattling of the frames towards morning he had slept and during those hours it seemed that a new heaven and a new earth had come into being vitally and essentially the world was a different affair altogether at the back of the house on to which these windows looked was a garden of some half acre a square of somewhat sooty grass bounded by high walls with a few trees at the further end into it too had the message that thrilled through his bones penetrated and this little oasis of doubtful grass and blackened shrubs had a totally different aspect today from that which it had worn all those weeks the sparrows that had sat with fluffedup feathers in corners sheltered from the gales were suddenly busy and shrilly vocal chirruping and dragging about straws and flying from limb to limb of the trees with twigs in their beaks for the first time he noticed that little verdant cabochons of folded leaf had globed themselves on the lilac bushes below the window crocuses had budded and in the garden beds had shot up the pushing spikes of bulbs while in the sooty grass he could see specks and patches of vivid green the first growth of the year he opened the window and strolled out the whole taste and savour of the air was changed and borne on the primrosecoloured sunshine came the smell of damp earth no longer dead and reeking of the decay of autumn but redolent with some new element something fertile and fecund something daintily indefinably laden with the secret of life and restoration the grey lumpy clouds were gone and instead chariots of dazzling white bowled along the infinite blue expanse harnessed to the southwest wind but above all the sparrows dragged straws to and fro loudly chirruping all spring was indexed there for a moment michael was entranced with the exquisite moment and stood sunning his soul in spring but then he felt the fetters of his own individual winter heavy on him again and he could only see what was happening without feeling it for that moment he had felt the leap in his blood but the next he was conscious again of the immense fatigue that for weeks had been growing on him the task which he had voluntarily taken on himself had become no lighter with habit the incessant attendance on his mother and the strain of it got heavier day by day for some time now her childlike content in his presence had been clouded and instead she was constantly depressed and constantly querulous with him finding fault with his words and his silences and in her confused and muffled manner blaming him and affixing sinister motives to his most innocent actions but she was still entirely dependent on him and if he left her for an hour or two she would wait in an agony of anxiety for his return and when he came back overwhelmed him with tearful caresses and the exaction of promises not to go away again then feeling certain of him once more she would start again on complaints and reproaches her doctor had warned him that it looked as if some new phase of her illness was approaching which might necessitate the complete curtailment of her liberty but day had succeeded to day and she still remained in the same condition neither better nor worse but making every moment a burden to michael it had been necessary that sylvia should discontinue her visits for some weeks ago lady ashbridge had suddenly taken a dislike to her and when she came would sit in silent and lofty displeasure speaking to her as little as possible and treating her with a chilling and awful politeness michael had enough influence with his mother to prevent her telling the girl what her crime had been which was her refusal to marry him but when he was alone with his mother he had to listen to torrents of these complaints lady ashbridge with a wealth of language that had lain dormant in her all her life sarcastically supposed that miss falbe was a princess in disguise very impenetrable disguise for im sure she reminds me of a barmaid more than a princess and thought that such a marriage would be beneath her or another time she hinted that miss falbe might be already married indeed this seemed a very plausible explanation of her attitude she desired in fact that sylvia should not come to see her any more and now when she did not there was scarcely a day in which lady ashbridge would not talk in a pointed manner about pretended friends who leave you alone and wont even take the trouble to take a twopenny bus if they are so poor as all that to come from chelsea to curzon street michael knew that his mothers steps were getting nearer and nearer to that border line which separates the sane from the insane and with all the wearing strain of the days as they passed had but the one desire in his heart namely to keep her on the right side for as long as was humanly possible but something might happen some new symptom develop which would make it impossible for her to go on living with him as she did now and the dread of that moment haunted his waking hours and his dreams two months ago her doctor had told him that for the sake of everyone concerned it was to be hoped that the progress of her disease would be swift but for his part michael passionately disclaimed such a wish in spite of her constant complaints and strictures she was still possessed of her love for him and wearing though every day was he grudged the passing of the hours that brought her nearer to the awful boundary line had a deed been presented to him for his signature which bound him indefinitely to his mothers service on the condition that she got no worse his pen would have spluttered with his eagerness to sign in consequence of his mothers dislike to sylvia michael had hardly seen her during this last month once when owing to some small physical disturbance lady ashbridge had gone to bed early on a sunday evening he had gone to one of the falbes weekly parties and had tried to fling himself with enjoyment into the friendly welcoming atmosphere but for the present he felt himself detached from it all for this life with his mother was close round him with a sort of nightmare obsession through which outside influence and desire could only faintly trickle he knew that the other life was there he knew that in his heart he longed for sylvia as much as ever but in his present detachment his desire for her was a drowsy ache a remote emptiness and the veil that lay over his mother seemed to lie over him also once indeed during the evening when he had played for her the veil had lifted and for the drowsy ache he had the sunlit stabbing pang but as he left the veil dropped again and he let himself into the big mute house sorry that he had left it in the same way too his music was in abeyance he could not concentrate himself or find it worth while to make the effort to absorb himself in it and he knew that short of that there was neither profit nor pleasure for him in his piano everything seemed remote compared with the immediate foreground there was a gap a gulf between it and all the rest of the world his father wrote to him from time to time laying stress on the extreme importance of all he was doing in the country and giving no hint of his coming up to town at present but he faintly adumbrated the time when in the natural course of events he would have to attend to his national duties in the house of lords and wondered whether it would not about then be good for his wife to have a change and enjoy the country when the weather became more propitious michael with an excusable unfilialness did not answer these amazing epistles but having basked in their unconscious humour sent them on to aunt barbara weekly reports were sent by lady ashbridges nurse to his father and michael had nothing whatever to add to these his fear of him had given place to a quiet contempt which he did not care to think about and certainly did not care to express every now and then lady ashbridge had what michael thought of as a good hour or two when she went back to her content and childlike joy in his presence and it was clear when presently she came downstairs as he still lingered in the garden reading the daily paper in the sun that one of these better intervals had visited her she too it appeared felt the waving of the magic wand of spring and she noted the signs of it with a joy that was infinitely pathetic my dear she said what a beautiful morning is it wise to sit out of doors without your hat michael shall not i go and fetch it for you no then let us sit here and talk it is spring is it not look how the birds are collecting twigs for their nests i wonder how they know that the time has come round again sweet little birds how bold and merry they are she edged her way a little nearer him so that her shoulder leaned on his arm my dear i wish you were going to nest too she said i wonderdo you think i have been illnatured and unkind to your sylvia and that makes her not come to see me now i do remember being vexed at her for not wanting to marry you and perhaps i talked unkindly about her i am sorry for my being cross to her will do no good it will only make her more unwilling than ever to marry a man who has such an unpleasant mamma will she come to see me again do you think if i ask her these good hours were too rare in their appearances and swift in their vanishings to warrant the certainty that she would feel the same this afternoon and michael tried to turn the subject ah we shall have to think about that mother he said look there is a quarrel going on between those two sparrows they both want the same straw she followed his pointing finger easily diverted oh i wish they would not quarrel she said it is so sad and stupid to quarrel instead of being agreeable and pleasant i do not like them to do that there one has flown away and see the crocuses are coming up indeed it is spring i should like to see the country today if you are not busy michael would you take me out into the country we might go to richmond park perhaps for that is in the opposite direction from ashbridge and look at the deer and the budding trees oh michael might we take lunch with us and eat it out of doors i want to enjoy as much as i can of this spring day she clung closer to michael everything seems so fragile dear she whispered everything may break sometimes i am frightened the little expedition was soon moving after a slight altercation between lady ashbridge and her nurse whom she wished to leave behind in order to enjoy michaels undiluted society but miss baker who had already spoken to michael telling him she was not quite happy in her mind about her patient was firm about accompanying them though she obligingly effaced herself as far as possible by taking the boxseat by the chauffeur as they drove down and when they arrived and michael and his mother strolled about in the warm sunshine before lunch keeping carefully in the background just ready to come if she was wanted but indeed it seemed as if no such precautions were necessary for never had lady ashbridge been more amenable more blissfully content in her sons companionship the vernal hour that first smell of the rejuvenated earth as it stirred and awoke from its winter sleep had reached her no less than it had reached the springing grass and the heart of buried bulbs and never perhaps in all her life had she been happier than on that balmy morning of early march here the stir of spring that had crept across miles of smoky houses to the gardens behind curzon street was more actively effervescent and the bare leafless choirs of the trees which had been empty of song all winter were once more resonant with feathered worshippers through the tussocks of the grey grass of last year were pricking the vivid shoots of green and over the grove of young birches and hazel the dim purple veil of spring hung mistlike down by the wateredge of the penn ponds they strayed where moorhens scuttled out of rhododendron bushes that overhung the lake and hurried across the surface of the water half swimming half flying for the shelter of some securer retreat there too they found a plantation of willows already in bud with soft moleskin buttons and a tortoiseshell butterfly evoked by the sun from its hibernation settled on one of the twigs opening and shutting its diapered wings and spreading them to the warmth to thaw out the stiffness and inaction of winter blackbirds fluted in the busy thickets a lark shot up near them soaring and singing till it became invisible in the luminous air a suspended carol in the blue and bold male chaffinches seeking their mates with twittered songs fluttered with burr of throbbing wings all the promise of spring was theredim fragile but sure on this day of days this pearl that emerged from the darkness and the stress of winter iridescent with the tender colours of the dawning year they lunched in the open motor miss baker again obligingly removing herself to the box seat and spreading rugs on the grass sat in the sunshine while lady ashbridge talked or silently watched michael as he smoked but always with a smile the one little note of sadness which she had sounded when she said she was frightened lest everything should break had not rung again and yet all day michael heard it echoing somewhere dimly behind the song of the wind and the birds and the shoots of growing trees it lurked in the thickets just eluding him and not presenting itself to his direct gaze but he felt that he saw it out of the corner of his eye only to lose it when he looked at it and yet for weeks his mother had never seemed so well the cloud had lifted off her this morning and but for some vague presage of trouble that somehow haunted his mind refusing to be disentangled he could have believed that after all medical opinion might be at fault and that instead of her passing more deeply into the shadows as he had been warned was inevitable she might at least maintain the level to which she had returned today all day she had been as she was before the darkness and discontent of those last weeks had come upon her he who knew her now so well could certainly have affirmed that she had recovered the serenity of a month ago it was so much so tremendously much that she should do this and if only she could remain as she had been all day she would at any rate be happy happier perhaps than she had consciously been in all the stifled years which had preceded this nothing else at the moment seemed to matter except the preservation to her of such content and how eagerly would he have given all the service that his young manhood had to offer if by that he could keep her from going further into the bewildering darkness that he had been told awaited her there was some little trouble though no more than the shadow of a passing cloud when at last he said that they must be getting back to town for the afternoon was beginning to wane she besought him for five minutes more of sitting here in the sunshine that was still warm and when those minutes were over she begged for yet another postponement but then the quiet imposition of his will suddenly conquered her and she got up my dear you shall do what you like with me she said for you have given me such a happy day will you remember that michael it has been a nice day and might we do you think ask miss falbe to come to tea with us when we get back she can but say no and if she comes i will be very good and not vex her as she got back into the motor she stood up for a moment her vague blue eyes scanning the sky the trees the stretch of sunlit park goodbye lake happy lake and moorhens she said goodbye trees and grass that are growing green again goodbye all pretty peaceful things michael had no hesitation in telephoning to sylvia when they got back to town asking her if she could come and have tea with his mother for the gentle affectionate mood of the morning still lasted and her eagerness to see sylvia was only equalled by her eagerness to be agreeable to her he was greedy whenever it could be done to secure a pleasure for his mother and this one seemed in her present mood a perfectly safe one added to that impulse in itself sufficient there was his own longing to see her again that thirst that never left him and soon after they had got back to curzon street sylvia was with them and as before in preparation for a long visit she had taken off her hat today she divested herself of it without any suggestion on lady ashbridges part and this immensely pleased her look michael she said miss falbe means to stop a long time that is sweet of her is it not she is not in such a hurry to get away today sugar miss falbe yes i remember you take sugar and milk but no cream well i do think this is nice sylvia had seen neither mother nor son for a couple of weeks and her eyes coming fresh to them noticed much change in them both in lady ashbridge this change though marked was indefinable enough she seemed to the girl to have somehow gone much further off than she had been before she had faded become indistinct it was evident that she found except when she was talking to michael a far greater difficulty in expressing herself the channels of communication as it were were getting choked with michael the change was easily stated he looked terribly tired and it was evident that the strain of these weeks was telling heavily on him and yet as sylvia noticed with a sudden sense of personal pride in him not one jot of his patient tenderness for his mother was abated tired as he was nervous on edge whenever he dealt with her either talking to her or watching for any little attention she might need his face was alert with love but she noticed that when the footman brought in tea and in arranging the cups let a spoon slip jangling from its saucer michael jumped as if a bomb had gone off and under his breath said to the man you clumsy fool little as the incident was she knowing michaels courtesy and politeness found it significant as bearing on the evidence of his tired face then next moment his mother said something to him and instantly his love transformed and irradiated it today more than ever before lady ashbridge seemed to exist only through him as sylvia knew she had been for the last few weeks constantly disagreeable to him but she wondered whether this exacting meticulous affection was not harder to bear yet michael in spite of the nervous strain which now showed itself so clearly seemed to find no difficulty at all in responding to it it might have worn his nerves to tatters but the tenderness and love of him passed unhampered through the frayed communications for it was he himself who was brought into play it was of that michael now more and more triumphantly revealed that sylvia felt so proud as if he had been a possession an achievement wholly personal to her he was her michaelit was just that which was becoming evident since nothing else would account for her claim of him unconsciously whispered by herself to herself it was not long before lady ashbridges nurse appeared to take her upstairs to rest at that her patient became suddenly and unaccountably agitated all the happy content of the day was wiped off her mind she clung to michael no no michael she said they mustnt take me away i know they are going to take me away from you altogether you mustnt leave me nurse baker came towards her now my lady you mustnt behave like that she said you know you are only going upstairs to rest as usual before dinner you will see lord comber again then she shrank from her shielding herself behind michaels shoulder no michael no she repeated im going to be taken away from you and look missah my dear i have forgotten your namelook she has got no hat on she was going to stop with me a long time michael must i go michael saw the nurse looking at her watching her with that quiet eye of the trained attendant then she spoke to michael well if lord comber will just step outside with me she said well see if we can arrange for you to stop a little longer and youll come back michael said she michael saw that the nurse wanted to say something to him and with infinite gentleness disentangled the clinging of lady ashbridges hand why of course i will he said and wont you give miss falbe another cup of tea lady ashbridge hesitated a moment yes ill do that she said and by the time ive done that you will be back again wont you michael followed the nurse from the room who closed the door without shutting it theres something i dont like about her this evening she said all day i have been rather anxious she must be watched very carefully now i want you to get her to come upstairs and ill try to make her go to bed michael felt his mouth go suddenly dry what do you expect he said i dont expect anything but we must be prepared a change comes very quickly michael nodded and they went back together now mother darling he said up you go with nurse baker youve been out all day and you must have a good rest before dinner shall i come up and see you soon a curious sly look came into lady ashbridges face yes but where am i going to she said how do i know nurse baker will take me to my own room because i promise you she will said michael that instantly reassured her mood after mood as michael saw were passing like shadows over her mind ah thats enough she said goodbye missthere the names gone again but wont you sit here and have a talk to michael and let him show you over the house to see if you like it against the timeoh michael said i mustnt worry you about that and wont you stop and have dinner with us and afterwards we can sing michael put his arm around her well talk about that while youre resting he said dont keep nurse baker waiting any longer mother she nodded and smiled no no mustnt keep anybody waiting she said your father taught me to be punctual when they had left the room together sylvia turned to michael michael my dear she said i think you arewell i think you are michael she saw that at the moment he was not thinking of her at all and her heart honoured him for that im anxious about my mother tonight he said she has been soi suppose you must call itwell all day but the nurse isnt easy about her suddenly all his fears and his fatigue and his trouble looked out of his eyes im frightened he said and its so unutterably feeble of me and im tired you dont know how tired and try as i may i feel that all the time it is no use my mother is slipping slipping away but my dear no wonder you are tired she said michael cant anybody help it isnt right you should do everything he shook his head smiling they cant help he said im the only person who can help her and i he stood up bracing mind and body and im so brutally proud of it he said she wants me well thats a lot for a son to be able to say sylvia i would give anything to keep her still he was not thinking of her and knowing that she came close to him and put her arm in his she longed to give him some feeling of comradeship she could be sisterly to him over this without suggesting to him what she could not be to him her instinct had divined right and she felt the answering pressure of his elbow that acknowledged her sympathy welcomed it and thought no more about it you are giving everything to keep her she said you are giving yourself what further gift is there michael he kept her arm close pressed by him and she knew by the frankness of that holding caress he was thinking of her still either not at all or she hoped as a comrade who could perhaps be of assistance to courage and clearsightedness in difficult hours she wanted to be no more than that to him just now it was the most she could do for him but with a desire the most acute she had ever felt for him she wanted him to accept thatto take her comradeship as he would have surely taken her brothers once in the last intimate moments they had had together he had refused to accept that attitude from herhad felt it a relationship altogether impossible she had seen his point of view and recognised the justice of the embarrassment now very simply but very eagerly she hoped as with some tugging strain that he would not reject it she knew she had missed this brother who had refused to be brother to her but he had been about his own business and he had been doing his own business with a quiet splendour that drew her eyes to him and as they stood there thus linked she wondered if her heart was following she had seen last december how reasonable it was of him to refuse this domestic sort of intimacy with her now she found herself intensely longing that he would not persist in his refusal suddenly michael awoke to the fact of her presence and abruptly he moved away from her thanks sylvia he said i know i have youryour good wishes butwell i am sure you understand she understood perfectly well and the understanding of it cut her to the quick have you got any right to behave like that to me michael she asked what have i done that you should treat me quite like that he looked at her completely recalled in mind to her alone all the hopes and desires of the autumn smote him with encompassing blows yes every right he said i wasnt heeding you i only thought of my mother and the fact that there was a very dear friend by me and then i came to myself i remembered who the friend was they stood there in silence apart for a moment then michael came closer the desire for human sympathy and that the sympathy he most longed for gripped him again im a brute he said it was awfully nice of you toto offer me that i accept it so gladly im wretchedly anxious he looked up at her take my arm again he said she felt the crook of his elbow tighten again on her wrist she had not known before how much she prized that but are you sure you are right in being anxious mike she asked isnt it perhaps your own tired nerves that make you anxious i dont think so he said ive been tired a long time you see and i never felt about my mother like this she has been so bright and content all day and yet there were little lapses if you understand it was as if she knew she said goodbye to the lake and the jolly moorhens and the grass and her nurse thinks so too she called me out of the room just now to tell me that i dont know why i should tell you these depressing things dont you she asked but i do its because you know i care otherwise you wouldnt tell me you couldnt for a moment the balance quavered in his mind between sylvia the beloved and sylvia the friend it inclined to the friend yes thats why he said and i reproach myself you know all these years i might if i had tried harder have been something to my mother i might have managed it i thoughtat least i feltthat she didnt encourage me but i was a beast to have been discouraged and now her wanting me has come just when it isnt her unclouded self that wants me its as ifas if it had been raining all day and just on sunset there comes a gleam in the west and so soon after its night you made the gleam said sylvia but so late so awfully late suddenly he stood stiff listening to some sound which at present she did not hear it sounded a little louder and her ears caught the running of footsteps on the stairs outside next moment the door opened and lady ashbridges maid put in a pale face will you go to her ladyship my lord she said her nurse wants you she told me to telephone to sir james sylvia moved with him not disengaging her arm towards the door michael may i wait she said you might want me you know please let me wait lady ashbridges room was on the floor above and michael ran up the intervening stairs three at a time he knocked and entered and wondered why he had been sent for for she was sitting quietly on her sofa near the window but he noticed that nurse baker stood very close to her otherwise there was nothing that was in any way out of the ordinary and here he is said the nurse reassuringly as he entered lady ashbridge turned towards the door as michael came in and when he met her eyes he knew why he had been sent for why at this moment sir james was being summoned for she looked at him not with the clouded eyes of affection not with the motherspirit striving to break through the shrouding trouble of her brain but with eyes of blank nonrecognition she saw him with the bodily organs of her vision but the picture of him was conveyed no further there was a blank wall behind her eyes michael did not hesitate it was possible that he still might be something to her that he his presence might penetrate but you are not resting mother he said why are you sitting up i came to talk to you as i said i would while you rested suddenly into those blank irresponsive eyes there leaped recognition he saw the pupils contract as they focused themselves on him and hand in hand with recognition there leaped into them hate instantly that was veiled again but it had been there and now it was not banished it lurked behind in the shadows crouching and waiting she answered him at once but in a voice that was quite toneless it seemed like that of a child repeating a lesson which it had learned by heart and could be pronounced while it was thinking of something quite different i was waiting till you came my dear she said now i will lie down come and sit by me michael she watched him narrowly while she spoke then gave a quick glance at her nurse as if to see that they were not making signals to each other there was an easy chair just behind her head and as michael wheeled it up near her sofa he looked at the nurse she moved her hand slightly towards the left and interpreting this he moved the chair a little to the left so that he would not sit as he had intended quite close to the sofa and you enjoyed your day in the country mother asked michael she looked at him sideways and slowly then again as if recollecting a task she had committed to memory she answered yes so much she said all the trees and the birds and the sunshine i enjoyed them so much she paused a moment bring your chair a little closer my darling she said you are so far off and why do you wait nurse i will call you if i want you michael felt one moment of sickening spiritual terror he understood quite plainly why nurse baker did not want him to go near to his mother and the reason of it gave him this pang not of nervousness but of black horror that the sane and the sensitive must always feel when they are brought intimately in contact with some blind derangement of instinct in those most nearly allied to them physically on the material plane he had no fear at all he made a movement grasping the arm of his chair as if to wheel it closer but he came actually no nearer her why dont you go away nurse said lady ashbridge and leave my son and me to talk about our nice day in the country nurse baker answered quite naturally i want to talk too my lady she said i went with you and lord comber we all enjoyed it together it seemed to michael that his mother made some violent effort towards selfcontrol he saw one of her hands that were lying on her knee clench itself so that the knuckles stood out white yes we will all talk together then she said orershall i have a little doze first i am rather sleepy with so much pleasant air and you are sleepy too are you not michael yes i see you look sleepy shall we have a little nap as i often do after tea then when i am fresh again you shall come back nurse and we will talk over our pleasant day when he entered the room michael had not quite closed the door and now as half an hour before he heard steps on the stairs a moment afterwards his mother heard them too what is that she said who is coming now to disturb me just when i wanted to have a nap there came a knock at the door nurse baker did not move her head but continued watching her patient with hands ready to act come in she said not looking round lady ashbridges face was towards the door as sir james entered she suddenly sprang up and in her right hand that lay beside her was a knife which she had no doubt taken from the teatable when she came upstairs she turned swiftly towards michael and stabbed at him with it its a trap she cried youve led me into a trap they are going to take me away michael had thrown up his arm to shield his head the blow fell between shoulder and elbow and he felt the edge of the knife grate on his bone and from deep in his heart sprang the leaping fountains of compassion and love and yearning pity chapter xii michael was sitting in the big studio at the falbes house late one afternoon at the end of june and the warmth and murmur of the fullblown summer filled the air the day had so far declined that the rays of the sun level in its setting poured slantingly in through the big window to the north and shining through the foliage of the planetrees outside made a diaper of rosy illuminated spots and angled shadows on the whitewashed wall as the leaves stirred in the evening breeze this pattern shifted and twinkled now as the wind blew aside a bunch of foliage a lake of rosy gold would spring up on the wall then as the breath of movement died the green shadows grew thicker again faintly stirring through the window to the south which hermann had caused to be cut there since the studio was not used for painting purposes michael could see into the patch of highwalled garden where mrs falbe was sitting in a low basket chair completely absorbed in a book of highborn and ludicrous adventures she had made a mild attempt when she found that michael intended to wait for sylvias return to entertain him till she came but with a little oblique encouragement remarking on the beauty and warmth of the evening and the pleasure of sitting out of doors michael had induced her to go out again and leave him alone in the studio free to live over again that which twentyfour hours ago had changed life for him he reconstructed it as he sat on the sofa and dwelt on the pearlmoments of it just this time yesterday he had come in and found sylvia alone she had got up he remembered to give him greeting and just opposite the fireplace they had come face to face she held in her hand a small white rose which she had plucked in the tiny garden here in the middle of london it was not a very fine specimen but it was a rose and she had said in answer to his depreciatory glance but you must see it when i have washed it one has to wash london flowers then the miracle happened michael with the hand that had just taken hers stroked a petal of this prized vegetable with no thought in his mind stronger than the thoughts that had been indigenous there since christmas as his finger first touched the rim of the townbred petals undersized yet not quite lacking in rosequality he had intended nothing more than to salute the flower as sylvia made her apology for it one has to wash london flowers but as he touched it he looked up at her and the quiet usual song of his thoughts towards her grew suddenly loud and stupefyingly sweet it was as if from the vacant hivedoor the bees swarmed in her eyes as they met his he thought he saw an expectancy a welcome and his hand instead of stroking the rosepetals closed on the rose and on the hand that held it and kept them close imprisoned and strongly gripped he could not remember if he had spoken any word but he had seen that in her face which rendered all speech unnecessary and knowing in the bones and the blood of him that he was right he kissed her and then she had said yes michael his hand still was tight on hers that held the crumpled rose and when he opened it loverlike to stroke and kiss it there was a spot of blood in the palm of it where a rosethorn had pricked her just one drop of sylvias blood as he kissed it he had wiped it away with the tip of his tongue between his lips and she smiling had said oh michael how silly they had sat together on the sofa where this afternoon he sat alone waiting for her every moment of that half hour was as distinct as the outline of trees and hills just before a storm and yet it was still entirely dreamlike he knew it had happened for nothing but the happening of it would account now for the fact of himself but though there was nothing in the world so true there was nothing so incredible yet it was all as cleancut in his mind as etched lines and round each line sprang flowers and singing birds for a long space there was silence after they had sat down and then she said i think i always loved you michael only i didnt know it thereafter foolish love talk he had claimed a superiority there for he had always loved her and had always known it much time had been wasted owing to her ignorance she ought to have known but all the time that existed was theirs now in all the world there was no more time than what they had the crumpled rose had its petals rehabilitated the thorn that had pricked her was peeled off they wondered if hermann had come in yet then by some vague process of locomotion they found themselves at the piano and with her arm around his neck sylvia has whispered half a verse of the song of herself they became a little more definite over loverconfessions michael had so to speak nothing to confess he had loved all alonghe had wanted her all along there never had been the least pretence or nonsense about it her path was a little more difficult to trace but once it had been traversed it was clear enough she had liked him always she had felt sisterlike from the moment when hermann brought him to the house and sisterlike she had continued to feel even when michael had definitely declared there was no thoroughfare there she had missed that relationship when it stopped she did not mind telling him that now since it was abandoned by them both but not for the world would she have confessed before that she had missed it she had loved being asked to come and see his mother and it was during those visits that she had helped to pile the barricade across the sisterthoroughfare with her own hands she began to share michaels sense of the impossibility of that road they could not walk down it together for they had to be either more or less to each other than that and during these visits she had begun to understand and her face a little hid itself what michaels love meant she saw it manifested towards his mother she was taught by it she learned it and she supposed she loved it anyhow having seen it she could not want michael as a brother any longer and if he still wanted anything else she supposed so she supposed that some time he would mention that fact yes she began to hope that he would not be very long about it michael went over this very deliberately as he sat waiting for her twentyfour hours later he rehearsed this moment and that over and over again in mind he followed himself and sylvia across to the piano not hurrying their steps and going through the verse of the song she sang at the pace at which she actually sang it and as he dreamed and recollected he heard a little stir in the quiet house and sylvia came they met just as they met yesterday in front of the fireplace oh michael have you been waiting long she said yes hours or perhaps a couple of minutes i dont know ah but which if hours i shall apologise and then excuse myself by saying that you must have come earlier than you intended if minutes i shall praise myself for being so exceedingly punctual minutes then said he ill praise you instead praise is more convincing if somebody else does it yes but you arent somebody else now be sensible have you done all the things you told me you were going to do yes sylvia released her hands from his tell me then she said youve seen your father there was no cloud on michaels face there was such sunlight where his soul sat that no shadow could fall across it oh yes i saw him he said he captured sylvias hand again and what is more he saw me so to speak he said he realised that i had an existence independent of him i used to be aa sort of clock to him he could put its hands to point to any hour he chose well he has realisedhe has reallythat i am ticking along on my own account he was quite respectful not only to me which doesnt matter but to youwhich does michael laughed as he plaited his fingers in with hers my father is so comic he said and unlike most great humourists his humour is absolutely unconscious he was perfectly well aware that i meant to marry you for i told him that last christmas adding that you did not mean to marry me so since then i think hes got used to you used to youfancy getting used to you especially since he had never seen me said the girl that makes it less odd getting used to you after seeing you would be much more incredible i was saying that in a way he had got used to you just as hes got used to my being a person and not a clock on his chimneypiece and what seems to have made so much difference is what aunt barbara told him last night namely that your mother was a tracy sylvia dont let it be too much for you but in a certain faraway manner he realises that you are one of us isnt he a comic hes going to make the best of you it appears to make the best of you you cant beat that you know in fact he told me to ask if he might come and pay his respects to your mother tomorrow and what about my singing my career she asked michael laughed again he was funny about that also he said my father took it absolutely for granted that having made this tremendous social advance you would bury your past all but the tracy part of it as if it had been something disgraceful which the exalted comber family agreed to overlook and what did you say i oh i told him that of course you would do as you pleased about that but that for my part i should urge you most strongly to do nothing of the kind and he he got four inches taller what is so odd is that as long as i never opposed my fathers wishes as long as i was the clock on the chimney piece i was terrified at him the thought of opposing myself to him made my knees quake but the moment i began doing so i found there was nothing to be frightened at sylvia got up and began walking up and down the long room but what am i to do about it michael she asked oh i blush when i think of a conversation i had with hermann about you just before christmas when i knew you were going to propose to me i said that i could never give up my singing can you picture the selfimportance of that why it doesnt seem to me to matter two straws whether i do or not naturally i dont want to earn my living by it any more but whether i sing or not doesnt matter and even as the words are in my mouth i try to imagine myself not singing any more and i cant its become part of me and while i blush to think of what i said to hermann i wonder whether its not true she came and sat down by him again i believe you have got enough artistic instinct to understand that michael she said and to know what a tremendous help it is to ones art to be a professional and to be judged seriously i suppose that ideally if one loves music as i do one ought to be able to do ones very best whether one is singing professionally or not but it is hardly possible why the whole difference between amateurs and professionals is that amateurs sing charmingly and professionals just sing only they sing as well as they possibly can not only because they love it but because if they dont they will be dropped on to and if they continue not singing their best will lose their place which they have so hardly won i can see myself perhaps not singing at all literally never opening my lips in song again but i cant see myself coming down to the drill hall at brixton extremely beautifully dressed with rows of pearls and arriving rather late and just singing charmingly its such a spur to know that serious musicians judge ones performance by the highest possible standard its so relaxing to think that one can easily sing well enough that one can delight ninetynine hundredths of the audience without any real effort i could sing the lost chord and move the whole drill hall at brixton to tears but there might be one man there who knew you or hermann or some other and at the end he would just shrug his shoulders ever so slightly and i would wish i had never been born she paused a moment ill not sing any more at all ever she said or i must sing to those who will take me seriously and judge me ruthlessly to sing just well enough to please isnt possible ill do either you like mrs falbe strayed in at this moment with her finger in her book but otherwise as purposeless as a wandering mist i was afraid it might be going to get chilly she remarked after a hot day there is often a cool evening will you stop and dine lordi mean michael please certainly said michael then i hope there will be something for you to eat sylvia is there something to eat no doubt you will see to that darling i shall just rest upstairs for a little before dinner and perhaps finish my book so pleased you are stopping she drifted towards the studio door in thistledown fashion catching at corners a little and then moving smoothly on again talking gently half to herself half to the others and hermanns not in yet but if lordi mean michael is going to stop here till dinnertime it wont matter whether hermann comes in in time to dress or not as michael is not dressed either oh there is the postmans knock what a noise i am not expecting any letters the knock in question however proved to be hermann who as was generally the case had forgotten his latchkey he ran into his mother at the studio door and came and sat down regardless of whether he was wanted or not between the two on the sofa and took an arm of each i probably intrude he said but such is my intention ive just seen lady barbara who says that the shock has not been too much for mikes father that is a good thing she says he is taking nourishment much as usual i suppose i oughtnt to jest on so serious a subject but i took my cue from lady barbara it appears that we have blue blood too sylvia and we must behave more like aristocrats a tracy in the time of king john flirted if no more with a comber and what about your career sylvia are you going to continue to urge your wild career or not i ask with a purpose as blackiston proposes we should give a concert together in the third week in july the queens hall is vacant one afternoon and he thinks we might sing and play to them im on if you are it will be about the last concert of the season too so we shall have to do our best otherwise we or i anyhow will start again in the autumn with a black mark by the way are you going to start again in the autumn it wouldnt surprise me one bit to hear that you and mike had been talking about just that dont be too clever to live hermann said sylvia i dont propose to die if you mean that oh blackiston had another suggestion also he wanted to know if we would consider making a short tour in germany in the autumn he says that the beloved fatherland is rather disposed to be interested in us he thinks we should have good audiences at leipzig and so on theres a tendency he says to recognise poor england a cordial intention anyhow i said that in your case there might be domestic considerations whichbut i think i shall go in any case lord fancy playing in germany to germans again fancy being listened to by a german audience fancy if they approved michael leaned forward putting his elbow into hermanns chest early december had already been mentioned as a date for their marriage and as a prenuptial journey this seemed to him a plan ecstatically ideal yes sylvia he said the answer is yes i shall come with you you know i can see it a triumphal procession you two making noises and me listening a months tour hermann middle of october till middle of november yes yes all his tremendous pride in her singing dormant for the moment under the wonder of his love rose to the surface he knew what her singing meant to her and from their conversation together just now how keen was her eagerness for the strict judgment of those who knew how she loved that austere pinnacle of daylight here was an ideal opportunity never yet since she had won her place as a singer had she sung in germany that mecca of the musical artist and in her case the land from which she sprung had the scheme implied a postponement of their marriage he would still have declared himself for it for he unerringly felt for her in this he knew intuitively what delicious beckoning this held for her yes yes he repeated i must have you do that sylvia i dont care what hermann wants or what you want i want it yes but whos to do the playing and the singing asked hermann isnt it a question perhaps for michael felt quite secure about the feelings of the other two and rudely interrupted no he said its a question for me when the fatherland hears that i am there it will no doubt ask me to play and sing instead of you two lord fancy marrying into such a distinguished family i burst with pride it required then little debate since all three were agreed before hermann was empowered with authority to make arrangements and they remained simultaneously talking till mrs falbe again drifting in announced that the bell for dinner had sounded some minutes before she had her finger in the last chapter of lady ursulas ordeal and laid it face downwards on the table to resume again at the earliest possible moment this opportunity was granted her when at the close of dinner coffee and the evening paper came in together this hermann opened at the middle page hallo he said thats horrible the heir apparent of the austrian emperor has been murdered at serajevo servian plot apparently oh what a dreadful thing said mrs falbe opening her book poor man what had he done hermann took a cigarette frowning it may be a match he began mrs falbe diverted her attention from lady ursula for a moment they are on the chimneypiece dear she said thinking he spoke of material matches michael felt that hermann saw something or conjectured something ominous in this news for he sat with knitted brow reading and letting the match burn down yes it seems that servian officers are implicated he said and there are materials enough already for a row between austria and servia without this those tiresome balkan states said mrs falbe slowly immersing herself like a diving submarine in her book they are always quarrelling why doesnt austria conquer them all and have done with it this simple and striking solution of the whole balkan question was her final contribution to the topic for at this moment she became completely submerged and cut off so to speak from the outer world in the lucent depths of lady ursula hermann glanced through the other pages and let the paper slide to the floor what will austria do he said supposing she threatens servia in some outrageous way and russia says she wont stand it what then michael looked across to sylvia he was much more interested in the way she dabbled the tips of her hands in the cool water of her finger bowl than in what hermann was saying her fingers had an extraordinary life of their own just now they were like a group of maidens by a fountain but hermann repeated the question to him personally oh i suppose there will be a lot of telegraphing he said and perhaps a board of arbitration after all one expected a european conflagration over the war in the balkan states and again over their row with turkey i dont believe in european conflagrations we are all too much afraid of each other we walk round each other like collie dogs on the tips of their toes gently growling and then quietly get back to our own territories and lie down again hermann laughed thank god theres that wonderful fireengine in germany ready to turn the hose on conflagrations what fireengine asked michael the emperor of course we should have been at war ten times over but for him sylvia dried her fingertips one by one lady barbara doesnt quite take that view of him does she mike she asked michael suddenly remembered how one night in the flat aunt barbara had suddenly turned the conversation from the discussion of cognate topics on hearing that the falbes were germans only to resume it again when they had gone i dont fancy she does he said but then as you know aunt barbara has original views on every subject hermann did not take the possible hint here conveyed to drop the matter well then what do you think about him he asked michael laughed my dear hermann he said how often have you told me that we english dont pay the smallest attention to international politics i am aware that i dont i know nothing whatever about them hermann shook off the cloud of preoccupation that so unaccountably to michaels thinking had descended on him and walked across to the window well long may ignorance be bliss he said lord what a divine evening uber allen gipfeln ist ruhe at least there is peace on the only summits visible which are house roofs theres not a breath of wind in the trees and chimneypots and its hot its really hot i was afraid there was going to be a chill at sunset remarked mrs falbe subaqueously then you were afraid even where no fear was mother darling said he and if you would like to sit out in the garden ill take a chair out for you and a table and candles lets all sit out its a divine hour this hour after sunset there are but a score of days in the whole year when the hour after sunset is warm like this its such a pity to waste one indoors the young peopleand he pointed to sylvia and michaelwill gaze into each others hearts and mammas will beat in unison with lady ursulas and i will sit and look at the sky and become profoundly sentimental like a good german hermann and michael bestirred themselves and presently the whole little party had encamped on chairs placed in an oasis of rugs this was done at the special request of mrs falbe since lady ursula had caught a chill that developed into consumption in the small highwalled garden beyond at the bottom lay the road along the embankment and the greyblue thames and the dim woods of battersea park across the river when they came out sparrows were still chirping in the ivy on the studio wall and in the tall angleleaved planes at the bottom of the little plot discussing no doubt the domestic arrangements for their comfort during the night but presently a sudden hush fell upon them and their shrillness was sharp no more against the drowsy hum of the city the sky overhead was of veiled blue growing gradually more toneless as the light faded and was unflecked by any cloud except where high in the zenith a fleece of rosy vapour still caught the light of the sunken sun and flamed with the soft radiance of some snowsummit near it there burned a molten planet growing momentarily brighter as the night gathered and presently beginning to be dimmed again as a tawny moon three days past the full rose in the east above the low river horizon occasionally a steamer hooted from the thames and the noise of churned waters sounded or the crunch of a motors wheels or the tapping of the heels of a foot passenger on the pavement below the garden wall but such evidence of outside seemed but to accentuate the perfect peace of this secluded little garden where the four sat the hour and the place were cut off from all turmoil and activities for a moment the stream of all their lives had flowed into a backwater where it rested immobile before the travel that was yet to come so it seemed to michael then and so years afterwards it seemed to him as vividly as on this evening when the tawny moon grew golden as it climbed the empty heavens dimming the stars around it what they talked of even though it was sylvia who spoke seemed external to the spirit of the hour they seemed to have reached a point some momentary haltingplace where speech and thought even lay outside and the need of the spirit was merely to exist and be conscious of its existence sometimes for a moment his past life with its selfrepression its mute yearnings its chrysalis stirrings formed a mist that dispersed again sometimes for a moment in wonder at what the future held what joys and troubles what achings perhaps and anguishes the unknown knocked stealthily at the door of his mind but then stole away unanswered and unwelcome and for that hour while mrs falbe finished with lady ursula while hermann smoked and sighed like a sentimental german and while he and sylvia sat speaking occasionally but more often silent he was in some kind of nirvana for which its own existence was everything movement had ceased he held his breath while that divine pause lasted when it was broken there was no shattering of it it simply died away like a longdrawn chord as mrs falbe closed her book she died she said i knew she would hermann gave a great shout of laughter darling mother im ever so much obliged he said we had to return to earth somehow where has everybody else been michael stirred in his chair ive been here he said how dull oh i suppose thats not polite to sylvia ive been in leipzig and in frankfort and in munich you and sylvia have been there too i may tell you but ive also been here its jolly here his sentimentalism had apparently not quite passed from him ah weve stolen this hour he said weve taken it out of the hurlyburly and had it to ourselves its been ripping but im back from the rim of the world oh ive been there too and looked out over the immortal sea lieber gott what a sea where we all come from and where we all go to were just playing on the sand where the waves have cast us up for one little hour oh the pleasant warm sand and the play how i love it he got out of his chair stretching himself as mrs falbe passed into the house and gave a hand on each side to michael and sylvia ah it was a good thing i just caught that train at victoria nearly a year ago he said if i had been five seconds later i should have missed it and so i should have missed my friend and sylvia would have missed hers and mike would have missed his as it is here we all are behold the last remnant of my german sentimentality evaporates but i am filled with a german desire for beer let us come into the studio liebe kinder and have beer and music and laughter we cannot recapture this hour or prolong it but it was good oh so good i thank god for this hour sylvia put her hand on her brothers arm looking at him with just a shade of anxiety nothing wrong hermann she asked wrong there is nothing wrong unless it is wrong to be happy but we have to go forward my only quarrel with life is that i would stop it now if i could so that time should not run on and we should stay just as we are ah what does the future hold i am glad i do not know sylvia laughed the immediate future holds beer apparently she said it also hold a great deal of work for you and me if it is to hold leipzig and frankfort and munich oh hermann what glorious days they walked together into the studio and as they entered hermann looked back over her into the dim garden then he pulled down the blind with a rattle move on there said the policeman he remarked and so they moved on the news about the murder of the austrian grand duke which for that moment at dinner had caused hermann to peer with apprehension into the veil of the future was taken quietly enough by the public in general in england it was a nasty incident no doubt and the murder having been committed on servian soil the pundits of the press gave themselves an opportunity for subsequently saying that they were right by conjecturing that austria might insist on a strict inquiry into the circumstances and the due punishment of not only the actual culprits but of those also who perhaps were privy to the plot but three days afterwards there was but little uneasiness the stock exchanges of the european capitalsthose highly sensitive barometers of coming stormwere but slightly affected for the moment and within a week had steadied themselves again from austria there came no sign of any unreasonable demand which might lead to trouble with servia and so with slavonic feeling generally and by degrees that threatening of storm that sudden lightning on the horizon passed out of the mind of the public there had been that one flash no more and even that had not been answered by any growl of thunder the storm did not at once move up and the heavens above were still clear and sunny by day and starrykirtled at night but here and there were those who like hermann on the first announcement of the catastrophe scented trouble and michael going to see aunt barbara one afternoon early in the second week of july found that she was one of them i distrust it all my dear she said to him i am full of uneasiness and what makes me more uneasy is that they are taking it so quietly at the austrian embassy and at the german i dined at one embassy last night and at the other only a few nights ago and i cant get anybodynot even the most indiscreet of the secretariesto say a word about it but perhaps there isnt a word to be said suggested michael i cant believe that austria cannot possibly let an incident of that sort pass there is mischief brewing if she was merely intending to insistas she has every right to doon an inquiry being held that should satisfy reasonable demands for justice she would have insisted on that long ago but a fortnight has passed now and still she makes no sign i feel sure that something is being arranged dear me i quite forgot tony asked me not to talk about it but it doesnt matter with you but what do you mean by something being arranged asked michael she looked round as if to assure herself that she and michael were alone i mean this that austria is being persuaded to make some outrageous demand some demand that no independent country could possibly grant but who is persuading her asked michael my dear youlike all the rest of englandare fast asleep who but germany and that dangerous monomaniac who rules germany she has long been wanting war and she has only been delaying the dawning of der tag till all her preparations were complete and she was ready to hurl her armies and her fleet too east and west and north mark my words she is about ready now and i believe she is going to take advantage of her opportunity she leaned forward in her chair it is such an opportunity as has never occurred before she said and in a hundred years none so fit may occur again here are weenglandon the brink of civil war with ireland and the home rulers our hands are tied or rather are occupied with our own troubles anyhow germany thinks so that i know for a fact among so much that is only conjecture and perhaps she is right who knows whether she may not be right and that if she forces on war whether we shall range ourselves with our allies michael laughed but arent you piling up a european conflagration rather in a hurry aunt barbara he asked there will be hurry enough for us for france and russia and perhaps england but not for germany she is never in a hurry she waits till she is ready a servant brought in tea and lady barbara waited till he had left the room again it is as simple as an addition sum she said if you grant the first step that austria is going to make some outrageous demand of servia what follows servia refuses that demand and austria begins mobilisation in order to enforce it servia appeals to russia invokes the bond of blood and russia remonstrates with austria her representations will be of no use you may stake all you have on that and eventually since she will be unable to draw back she too will begin in her slow cumbrous manner hampered by those immense distances and her imperfect railway system to mobilise also then will germany already quite prepared show her hand she will demand that russia shall cease mobilisation and again will russia refuse that will set the military machinery of france going all the time the governments of europe will be working for peace all that is except one which is situated at berlin michael felt inclined to laugh at this rapid and disastrous sequence of ominous forebodings it was so completely characteristic of aunt barbara to take the most violent possible view of the situation which no doubt had its dangers and what michael felt was felt by the enormous majority of english people dear aunt barbara you do get on quick he said it will happen quickly she said there is that little cloud in the east like a mans hand today and rather like that mailed fist which our sweet peaceful friend in germany is so fond of talking about but it will spread over the sky i tell you like some tropical storm france is unready russia is unready only germany and her marionette austria the strings of which she pulls is ready go on prophesying said michael i wish i could ever since that sarajevo murder i have thought of nothing else day and night but how events will develop then i cant imagine what will england do who knows i only know what germany thinks she will do and that is stand aside because she cant stir with this irish millstone round her neck if germany thought otherwise she is perfectly capable of sending a dozen submarines over to our naval manoeuvres and torpedoing our battleships right and left michael laughed outright at this while a fleet of zeppelins hovers over london and drops bombs on the war office and the admiralty he suggested but aunt barbara was not in the least diverted by this and if england stands aside she said der tag will only dawn a little later when germany has settled with france and russia we shall live to see der tag michael unless we are run over by motorbuses and pray god we shall see it soon for the sooner the better your adorable falbes now sylvia and hermann what do they think of it hermann was certainly ratherrather upset when he read of the sarajevo murders he said but he pins his faith on the german emperor whom he alluded to as a fireengine which would put out any conflagration aunt barbara rose in violent incredulity pish and bosh she remarked if he had alluded to him as an incendiary bomb there would have been more sense in his simile anyhow he and sylvia are planning a musical tour in germany in the autumn said michael its a long long way to tipperary remarked aunt barbara enigmatically why tipperary asked michael oh its just a song i heard at a musichall the other night theres a jolly catchy tune to it which has rung in my head ever since thats the sort of music i like something you can carry away with you and your music michael rather in abeyance there areother things to think about aunt barbara got up ah tell me more about them she said i want to get this nightmare out of my head sylvia now sylvia is a good cure for the nightmare is she kind as she is fair michael michael was silent for a moment then he turned a quiet radiant face to her i cant talk about it he said i cant get accustomed to the wonder of it that will do thats a completely satisfactory account but go on michael laughed how can i he asked theres no end and no beginning i cant go on as you order me about a thing like that there is sylvia there is me i must be content with that then she said smiling we are said michael lady barbara waited a moment without speaking and your mother she asked he shook his head she still refuses to see me he said she still thinks it was i who made the plot to take her away and shut her up she is often angry with me poor darling butbut you see it isnt she who is angry its just her malady yes my dear said lady barbara i am so glad you see it like that how else could i see it it was my real mother whom i began to know last christmas and whom i was with in town for the three months that followed thats how i think of her i cant think of her as anything else and how is she otherwise again he shook his head she is wretched though they say that all she feels is dim and veiled that we mustnt think of her as actually unhappy sometimes there are good days when she takes a certain pleasure in her walks and in looking after a little plot of ground where she gardens and thank god that sudden outburst when she tried to kill me seems to have entirely passed from her mind they dont think she remembers it at all but then the good days are rare and are growing rarer and often now she sits doing nothing at all but crying aunt barbara laid her hand on him oh my dear she said michael paused for a moment his brown eyes shining if only she could come back just for a little to what she was in january he said she was happier then i think than she ever was before i cant help wondering if anyhow i could have prolonged those days by giving myself up to her more completely my dear you neednt wonder about that said aunt barbara sir james told me that it was your love and nothing else at all that gave her those days michaels lips quivered i cant tell you what they were to me he said for she and i found each other then and we both felt we had missed each other so much and so long she was happy then and i too and now everything has been taken from her and still in spite of that my cup is full to overflowing thats how she would have it michael said barbara yes i know that i remind myself of that again he paused they dont think she will live very long he said she is getting physically much weaker but during this last week or two she has been less unhappy they think they say some new change may come any time it may be only the great changei mean her death but it is possible before that that her mind will clear again sir james told me that occasionally happened likelike a ray of sunlight after a stormy day it would be good if that happened i would give almost anything to feel that she and i were together again as we were barbara childless felt something of motherhood michaels simplicity and his sincerity were already known to her but she had never yet known the strength of him you could lean on michael in his quiet undemonstrative way he supported you completely as a son should there was no possibility of insecurity god bless you my dear she said chapter xiii one close thundery morning about a week later michael was sitting at his piano in his shirtsleeves busy practising he was aware that at the other end of the room the telephone was calling for him but it seemed to be of far greater importance at the minute to finish the last page of one of the bach fugues than to attend to what anybody else might have to say to him then it suddenly flashed across him that it might be sylvia who wanted to speak to him or that there might be news about his mother and his fingers leaped from the piano in the middle of a bar and he ran and slid across the parquet floor but it was neither of these and compared to them it was a case of only hermann who wanted to see him but hermann it appeared wanted to see him urgently and if he was in which he was would be with him in ten minutes but the bach thread was broken and michael since it was not worth while trying to mend it for the sake of these few minutes sat down by the open window and idly took up the morning paper which as yet he had not opened since he had hurried over breakfast in order to get to his piano the music announcements on the outside page first detained him and seeing that the concert by the falbes which was to take place in five or six days was advertised he wondered vaguely whether it was about that that hermann wanted to see him and if so why he could not have said whatever he had to say on the telephone instead of cutting things short with the curt statement that he wished to see him urgently and would come round at once then remembering that francis had been playing cricket for the guards yesterday he turned briskly over to the last page of sporting news and found that his cousin had distinguished himself by making no runs at all but by missing two expensive catches in the deep field from there after a slight inspection of a couple of advertisement columns he worked back to the middle leaf where were leaders and the news of nations and the movements of kings all this last week he had scanned such items with a growing sense of amusement in the recollection of hermanns disquiet over the sarajevo murders and aunt barbaras more detailed and vivid prognostications of coming danger for nothing more had happened and he supposedvaguely only since the affair had begun to fade from his mindthat austria had made inquiries and that since she was satisfied there was no public pronouncement to be made the hot breeze from the window made the paper a little unmanageable for a moment but presently he got it satisfactorily folded and a big black headline met his eye a halfcolumn below it contained the demands which austria had made in the note addressed to the servian government a glance was sufficient to show that they were framed in the most truculent and threatening manner possible to imagine they were not the reasonable proposals that one state had a perfect right to make of another on whose soil and with the connivance of whose subjects the murders had been committed they were a piece of arbitrary dictation a threat levelled against a dependent and an inferior michael had read them through twice with a growing sense of uneasiness at the thought of how lady barbaras first anticipations had been fulfilled when hermann came in he pointed to the paper michael held ah you have seen it he said perhaps you can guess what i wanted to see you about connected with the austrian note asked michael yes i have not the vaguest idea hermann sat down on the arm of his chair mike im going back to germany today he said now do you understand im german you mean that germany is at the back of this it is obvious isnt it those demands couldnt have been made without the consent of austrias ally and they wont be granted servia will appeal to russia and and then god knows what may happen in the event of that happening i must be in my fatherland ready to serve if necessary you mean you think it possible you will go to war with russia asked michael yes i think it possible and if i am right if there is that possibility i cant be away from my country but the emperor the fireengine whom you said would quench any conflagration he is away yachting he went off after the visit of the british fleet to kiel who knows whether before he gets back things may have gone too far cant you see that i must go wouldnt you go if you were me suppose you were in germany now wouldnt you hurry home michael was silent and hermann spoke again and if there is trouble with russia france i take it is bound to join her and if france joins her what will england do the great shadow of the approaching storm fell over michael even as outside the sultry stillness of the morning grew darker ah you think that asked michael hermann put his hand on michaels shoulder mike youre the best friend i have he said and soon please god you are going to marry the girl who is everything else in the world to me you two make up my world reallyyou two and my mother anyhow no other individual counts or is in the same class you know that i expect but there is one other thing and thats my nationality it counts first nothing nobody not even sylvia or my mother or you can stand between me and that i expect you know that also for you saw nearly a year ago what germany is to me perhaps i may be quite wrong about it allabout the gravity i mean of the situation and perhaps in a few days i may come racing home again yes i said home didnt i well that shows you just how i am torn in two but i cant help going hermanns hand remained on his shoulder gently patting it to michael the world life the whole spirit of things had suddenly grown sinister of the quality of nightmare it was true that all the ground of this ominous depression which had darkened round him was conjectural and speculative that diplomacy backed by the horror of war which surely all civilised nations and responsible govermnents must share had so far from saying its last not yet said its first word that the wits of all the cabinets of europe were at this moment only just beginning to stir themselves so as to secure a peaceful solution but in spite of this the darkness and the nightmare grew in intensity but as to hermanns determination to go to germany which made this so terribly real since it was beginning to enter into practical everyday life he had neither means nor indeed desire to combat it he saw perfectly clearly that hermann must go i dont want to dissuade you he said not only because it would be useless but because i am with you you couldnt do otherwise hermann i dont see that i could sylvia agrees too a terrible conjecture flashed through michaels mind and she he asked she cant leave my mother of course said hermann and after all i may be on a wild goose chase but i cant risk being unable to get to germany ifif the worst happens the ghost of a smile played round his mouth for a moment and im not sure that she could leave you mike he added somehow this though it gave michael a moment of intensest relief to know that sylvia remained made the shadow grow deeper accentuated the lines of the storm which had begun to spread over the sky he began to see as nightmare no longer but as stern and possible realities something of the unutterable woe the divisions the heartbreaks which menaced hermann what do you think will happen he said it is incredible unfaceable the gentle patting on his shoulder that suddenly and poignantly reminded him of when sylvias hand was there ceased for a moment and then was resumed mike old boy said hermann weve got to face the unfaceable and believe that the incredible is possible i may be all wrong about it and as i say in a few days time i may come racing back but on the other hand this may be our last talk together for i go off this afternoon so lets face it he paused a moment it may be that before long i shall be fighting for my fatherland he said and if there is to be fighting it may be that germany will before long be fighting england there i shall be on one side and since naturally you will go back into the guards you will be fighting on the other i shall be doing my best to kill englishmen whom i love and they will be doing their best to kill me and those of my blood theres the horror of it and its that we must face if we met in a bayonet charge mike i should have to do my best to run you through and yet i shouldnt love you one bit the less and you must know that or if you ran me through i shall have to die loving you just the same as before and hoping you would live happy for ever and ever as the storybooks say with sylvia hermann dont go said michael suddenly mike you didnt mean that he said michael looked at him for a moment in silence no it is unsaid he replied hermann looked round as the clock on the chimneypiece chimed i must be going he said i neednt say anything to you about sylvia because all i could say is in your heart already well weve met in this jolly world mike and weve been great friends neither you nor i could find a greater friend than weve been to each other i bless god for this last year its been the happiest in my life now what else is there your music dont ever be lazy about your music its worth while taking all the pains you can about it lord do you remember the evening when i first tried your variations let me play the last one now i want something jubilant lets see how does it go he held his hands those long slimfingered hands poised for a moment above the keys then plunged into the glorious riot of the full chords and scales till the room rang with it the last chord he held for a moment and then sprang up ah thats good he said and now im going to say goodbye and go without looking round but might i see you off this afternoon asked michael no please dont station partings are fussy and disagreeable i want to say goodbye to you here in your quiet room just as i shall say goodbye to sylvia at home ah mike yes both hands and smiling may god give us other meetings and talks and companionship and years of love my best of friends goodbye then as he had said he walked to the door without looking round and next moment it had closed behind him throughout the next week the tension of the situation grew ever greater strained towards the snappingpoint while the little cloud the mans hand which had arisen above the eastern horizon grew and overspread the heavens in a pall that became ever more black and threatening for a few days yet it seemed that perhaps even now the cataclysm might be averted but gradually in spite of all the efforts of diplomacy to loosen the knot it became clear that the ends of the cord were held in hands that did not mean to release their hold till it was pulled tight servia yielded to such demands as it was possible for her to grant as an independent state but the inflexible fingers never abated one jot of their strangling pressure she appealed to russia and russias remonstrance fell on deaf ears or rather on ears that had determined not to hear from london and paris came proposals for conference for arbitration with welcome for any suggestion from the other side which might lead to a peaceful solution of the disputed demands already recognised by europe as a firebrand wantonly flung into the midst of dangerous and inflammable material over that burning firebrand preventing and warding off all the eager hands that were stretched to put it out stood the figure of the nation at whose bidding it had been flung there gradually out of the thunderclouds and gathering darkness vaguely at first and then in definite and menacing outline emerged the inexorable flintlike face of germany whose figure was clad in the shining armour so well known in the flamboyant utterances of her war lord which had been treated hitherto as mere irresponsible utterances to be greeted with a laugh and a shrugged shoulder deep and patient she had always been and now she believed that the time had come for her patience to do its perfect work she had bided long for the time when she could best fling that lighted brand into the midst of civilisation and she believed she had calculated well she cared nothing for servia nor for her ally on both her frontiers she was ready and now on the east she heeded not the remonstrance of russia nor her sincere and cordial invitation to friendly discussion she but waited for the step that she had made inevitable and on the first sign of russian mobilisation she with her mobilisation ready to be completed in a few days peremptorily demanded that it should cease on the western frontier behind the rhine she was ready also her armies were prepared cannon fodder in uncountable store of shells and cartridges was prepared and in endless battalions of men waiting to be discharged in one bulllike rush to overrun france and holding the french armies shattered and dispersed with a mere handful of her troops to hurl the rest at russia the whole campaign was mathematically thought out in a few months at the outside france would be lying trampled down and bleeding russia would be overrun already she would be mistress of europe and prepared to attack the only country that stood between her and worldwide dominion whose allies she would already have reduced to impotence here she staked on an uncertainty she could not absolutely tell what englands attitude would be but she had the strongest reason for hoping that distracted by the imminence of civil strife she would be unable to come to the help of her allies until the allies were past helping for a moment only were seen those set stern features mad for war then with a snap germany shut down her visor and stood with sword unsheathed waiting for the horror of the stupendous bloodshed which she had made inevitable her legions gathered on the eastern front threatening war on russia and thus pulling france into the spreading conflagration and into the midst of the flame she stood ready to cast the tornup fragments of the treaty that bound her to respect the neutrality of belgium all this week while the flames of the flung firebrand began to spread the english public waited incredulous of the inevitable michael among them found himself unable to believe even then that the bugles were already sounding and that the piles of shells in their wickerbaskets were being loaded on to the military ammunition trains but all the ordinary interests in life all the things that busily and contentedly occupied his day one only excepted had become without savour a dozen times in the morning he would sit down to his piano only to find that he could not think it worth while to make his hands produce these meaningless tinkling sounds and he would jump up to read the paper over again or watch for fresh headlines to appear on the boards of newsvendors in the street and send out for any fresh edition or he would walk round to his club and spend an hour reading the tape news and waiting for fresh slips to be pinned up but through all the nightmare of suspense and slowlydying hope sylvia remained real and after he had received his daily report from the establishment where his mother was with the invariable message that there was no marked change of any kind and that it was useless for him to think of coming to see her he would go off to maidstone crescent and spend the greater part of the day with the girl once during this week he had received a note from hermann written at munich and on the same day she also had heard from him he had gone back to his regiment which was mobilised as a private and was very busy with drill and duties feeling in germany he said was elated and triumphant it was considered certain that england would stand aside as the quarrel was none of hers and the nation generally looked forward to a short and brilliant campaign with the occupation of paris to be made in september at the latest but as a postscript in his note to sylvia he had added you dont think there is the faintest chance of england coming in do you please write to me fully and get mike to write i have heard from neither of you and as i am sure you must have written i conclude that letters are stopped i went to the theatre last night there was a tremendous scene of patriotism the people are warmad since then nothing had been heard from him and today as michael drove down to see sylvia he saw on the newsboards that belgium had appealed to england against the violation of her territory by the german armies en route for france overtures had been made asking for leave to pass through the neutral territory these belgium had rejected this was given as official news there came also the report that the belgian remonstrances would be disregarded should she refuse passage to the german battalions that could make no difference since it was a matter of life and death to invade france by that route sylvia was out in the garden where hardly a month ago they had spent that evening of silent peace and she got up quickly as michael came out ah my dear she said i am glad you have come i have got the horrors you saw the latest news yes and have you heard again from hermann no i have not had a word he kissed her and sat down no i have not heard either he said i expect he is right letters have been stopped and what do you think will be the result of belgiums appeal she asked who can tell the prime minister is going to make a statement on monday there have been cabinet meetings going on all day she looked at him in silence and what do you think she asked quite suddenly at her question michael found himself facing it even as when the final catastrophe was more remote he had faced it with falbe all this week he knew he had been looking away from it telling himself that it was incredible now he discovered that the one thing he dreaded more than that england should go to war was that she should not the consciousness of national honour the thing which with religion englishmen are most shy of speaking about suddenly asserted itself and he found on the moment that it was bigger than anything else in the world i think we shall go to war he said i dont see personally how we can exist any more as a nation if we dont wewe shall be damned if we dont damned for ever and ever its moral extinction not to she kindled at that yes i know she said thats what i have been telling myself but oh mike theres some dreadful cowardly part of me that wont listen when i think of hermann and she broke off a moment michael she said what will you do if there is war he took up her hand that lay on the arm of his chair my darling how can you ask he said of course i shall go back to the army for one moment she gave way no no she said you mustnt do that and then suddenly she stopped my dear i ask your pardon she said of course you will i know that really its only this stupid cowardly part of me thatthat interrupted i am ashamed of it im not as bad as that all through i dont make excuses for myself but ah mike when i think of what germany is to me and what hermann is and when i think what england is to me and what you are it shant appear again or if it does you will make allowance wont you at least i can agree with you utterly utterly its the flesh thats weak or rather that is so strong but ive got it under she sat there in silence a little mopping her eyes how i hate girls who cry she said it is so dreadfully feeble look mike there are some roses on that tree from which i plucked the one you didnt think much of do you remember you crushed it up in my hand and made it bleed he smiled i have got some faint recollection of it he said sylvia had got hold of her courage again have you she asked what a wonderful memory and that quiet evening out here next day perhaps you remember that too that was real that was a possession that we shant ever part with she pointed with her finger you and i sat there and hermann there she said and mother satwhy there she is mother darling lets have tea out here shall we i will go and tell them mrs falbe had drifted out in her usual thistledown style and shook hands with michael what an upset it all is she said with all these dreadful rumours going about that we shall be at war i fell asleep i think a little after lunch when i could not attend to my book for thinking about war isnt the book interesting asked michael no not very it is rather painful i do not know why people write about painful things when there are so many pleasant and interesting things to write about it seems to me very morbid michael heard something cried in the streets and at the same moment he heard sylvias step quickly crossing the studio to the side door that opened on to it in a minute she returned with a fresh edition of an evening paper they are preparing to cross the rhine she said mrs falbe gave a little sigh i dont know i am sure she said what you are in such a state about sylvia of course the germans want to get into france the easiest and quickest way at least im sure i should it is very foolish of belgium not to give them leave as they are so much the strongest mother darling you dont understand one syllable about it said sylvia very likely not dear but i am very glad we are an island and that nobody can come marching here but it is all a dreadful upset lordi mean michael what with hermann in germany and the concert tour abandoned still if everything is quiet again by the middle of october as i daresay it will be it might come off after all he will be on the spot and you and michael can join him though im not quite sure if that would be proper but we might arrange something he might meet you at ostend im afraid it doesnt look very likely remarked michael mildly oh and are you pessimistic too like sylvia pray dont be pessimistic there is a dreadful pessimist in my book who always thinks the worst is going to happen and does it asked michael as far as i have got it does which makes it all the worse of course i am very anxious about hermann but i feel sure he will come back safe to us i daresay france will give in when she sees germany is in earnest mrs falbe pulled the shattered remnants of her mind together in her heart of hearts she knew she did not care one atom what might happen to armies and navies and nations provided only that she had a quantity of novels to read and meals at regular hours the fact of being on an island was an immense consolation to her since it was quite certain that whatever happened german armies or french or soudanese for that matter could not march here and enter her sittingroom and take her books away from her for years past she had asked nothing more of the world than that she should be comfortable in it and it really seemed not an unreasonable request considering at how small an outlay of money all the comfort she wanted could be secured to her the thought of war had upset her a good deal already she had been unable to attend to her book when she awoke from her afterlunch nap and now when she hoped to have her tea in peace and find her attention restored by it she found the general atmosphere of her two companions vaguely disquieting she became a little more loquacious than usual with the idea of talking herself back into a tranquil frame of mind and reassuring to herself the promise of a peaceful future such a blessing we have a good fleet she said that will make us safe wont it i declare i almost hate the germans though my dear husband was one himself for making such a disturbance the papers all say it is germanys fault so i suppose it must be the papers know better than anybody dont they because they have foreign correspondents that must be a great expense sylvia felt she could not endure this any longer it was like having a raw wound stroked mother you dont understand she said you dont appreciate what is happening in a day or two england will be at war with germany mrs falbes book had slipped from her knee she picked it up and flapped the cover once or twice to get rid of dust that might have settled there but what then she said it is very dreadful no doubt to think of dear hermann being with the german army but we are getting used to that are we not besides he told me it was his duty to go i do not think for a moment that france will be able to stand against germany germany will be in paris in no time and i daresay hermanns next letter will be to say that he has been walking down the boulevards of course war is very dreadful i know that and then germany will be at war with russia too but she will have austria to help her and as for germany being at war with england that does not make me nervous think of our fleet and how safe we feel with that i see that we have twice as many boats as the germans with two to one we must win and they wont be able to send any of their armies here i feel quite comfortable again now that i have talked it over sylvia caught michaels eye for a moment over the teaurn she felt he acquiesced in what she was intending to say that is good then she said i am glad you feel comfortable about it mother dear now will you read your book out here why not if i fetch you a shawl in case you feel cold mrs falbe turned a questioning eye to the motionless trees and the unclouded sky i dont think i shall even want a shawl dear she said listen how the newsboys are calling is it something fresh do you think a moments listening attention was sufficient to make it known that the news shouted outside was concerned only with the result of a county cricket match and michael as well as sylvia was conscious of a certain relief to know that at the immediate present there was no fresh clang of the bell that was beating out the seconds of peace that still remained just for now for this hour on saturday afternoon there was a respite no new link was forged in the intolerable sequence of events but even as he drew breath in that knowledge there came the counterstroke in the sense that those whose business it was to disseminate the news that would cause their papers to sell had just a cricket match to advertise their wares now when the country and when europe were on the brink of a bloodier war than all the annals of history contained they who presumably knew what the public desired to be informed on thought that the news which would sell best was that concerned with wooden bats and leather balls and strong young men in flannels michael had heard with a sort of tender incredulity mrs falbes optimistic reflections and had been more than content to let her rest secure in them but was the country the heart of england like her did it care more for cricket matches as she for her book than for the maintenance of the nations honour whatever that championship might cost and the cry went on past the gardenwalk fine innings by horsfield result of the oval match and yet he had just had his tea as usual and eaten a slice of cake and was now smoking a cigarette it was natural to do that not to make a fuss and refuse food and drink and it was natural that people should still be interested in cricket and at the moment his attitude towards mrs falbe changed instead of pity and irritation at her normality he was suddenly taken with a sense of gratitude to her it was restful to suspense and jangled nerves to see someone who went on as usual the sun shone the leaves of the planetrees did not wither mrs falbe read her book the evening paper was full of cricket news and then the reaction from that seized him again supposing all the nation was like that supposing nobody cared and the tension of suspense strained more tightly than ever for the next fortyeight hours while day and night the telegraph wires of europe tingled with momentous questions and grave replies while ministers and ambassadors met and parted and met again rumours flew this way and that like flocks of wildfowl driven backwards and forwards settling for a moment with a stir and splash and then with rush of wings speeding back and on again a huge coal strike in the northern counties fostered and financed by german gold was supposed to be imminent and this would put out of the countrys power the ability to interfere the irish home rule party under the same suasion was said to have refused to call a truce a letter had been received in high quarters from the german emperor avowing his fixed determination to preserve peace and this was honey to lord ashbridge then in turn each of these was contradicted all thought of the coal strike in this crisis of national affairs was abandoned the irish party as well as the conservatives were of one mind in backing up the government no matter what postponement of questions that were vital a month ago their cohesion entailed the emperor had written no letter at all but through the nebulous mists of hearsay there fell solid the first drops of the imminent storm even before michael had left sylvia that afternoon germany had declared war on russia on sunday belgium received a note from berlin definitely stating that should their government not grant the passage to the german battalions a way should be forced for them on monday finally germany declared war on france also the country held its breath in suspense at what the decision of the government which should be announced that afternoon should be one fact only was publicly known and that was that the english fleet only lately dismissed from its manoeuvres and naval review had vanished there were guard ships old cruisers and what not at certain ports torpedoboats roamed the horizons of deal and portsmouth but the great fleet the swift forts of seapower had gone disappearing no one knew where into the fine weather haze that brooded over the midsummer sea there perhaps was an indication of what the decision would be yet there was no certainty at home there was official silence and from abroad apart from the three vital facts came but the quacking of rumour report after report each contradicting the other then suddenly came certainty a rainbow set in the intolerable cloud on monday afternoon when the house of commons met all parties were known to have sunk their private differences and to be agreed on one point that should take precedence of all other questions germany should not with englands consent violate the neutrality of belgium as far as england was concerned all negotiations were at an end diplomacy had said its last word and germany was given twentyfour hours in which to reply should a satisfactory answer not be forthcoming england would uphold the neutrality she with others had sworn to respect by force of arms and at that one immense sigh of relief went up from the whole country whatever now might happen in whatever horrors of longdrawn and bloody war the nation might be involved the nightmare of possible neutrality of englands repudiating the debt of honour was removed the one thing worse than war need no longer be dreaded and for the moment the future hideous and heartrending though it would surely be smiled like a land of promise michael woke on the morning of tuesday the fourth of august with the feeling of something having suddenly roused him and in a few seconds he knew that this was so for the telephone bell in the room next door sent out another summons he got straight out of bed and went to it with a hundred vague shadows of expectation crossing his mind then he learned that his mother was gravely ill and that he was wanted at once and in less than half an hour he was on his way driving swiftly through the serene warmth of the early morning to the private asylum where she had been removed after her sudden homicidal outburst in march chapter xiv michael was sitting that same afternoon by his mothers bedside he had learned the little there was to be told him on his arrival in the morning how that half an hour before he had been summoned she had had an attack of heart failure and since then after recovering from the acute and immediate danger she had lain there all day with closed eyes in a state of but semiconscious exhaustion once or twice only and that but for a moment she had shown signs of increasing vitality and then sank back into this stupor again but in those rare short intervals she had opened her eyes and had seemed to see and recognise him and michael thought that once she had smiled at him but at present she had spoken no word all the morning lord ashbridge had waited there too but since there was no change he had gone away saying that he would return again later and asking to be telephoned for if his wife regained consciousness so but for the nurse and the occasional visits of the doctor michael was alone with his mother in this long period of inactive waiting when there was nothing to be done michael did not seem to himself to be feeling very vividly and but for one desire namely that before the end his mother would come back to him even if only for a moment his mind felt drugged and stupefied sometimes for a little it would sluggishly turn over thoughts about his father wondering with a sort of blunt remote contempt how it was possible for him not to be here too but except for the one great longing that his mother should cleave to him once more in conscious mind he observed rather than felt the thought of sylvia even was dim he knew that she was somewhere in the world but she had become for the present like some picture painted in his mind without reality dim too was the tension of those last days somewhere in europe was a country called germany where was his best friend drilling in the ranks to which he had returned or perhaps already on his way to bloodier battlefields than the world had ever dreamed of and somewhere set in the seas was germanys archfoe who already stood in her path with open cannon mouths pointing but all this had no real connection with him from the moment when he had come into this quiet orderly room and saw his mother lying on the bed nothing beyond those four walls really concerned him but though the emotional side of his mind lay drugged and insensitive to anything outside he found himself observing the details of the room where he waited with a curious vividness there was a big window opening down to the ground in the manner of a door on to the garden outside where a smooth lawn set with croquet hoops and edged with bright flowerbeds dozed in the haze of the august heat beyond was a row of tall elms against which a copper beech glowed metallically and somewhere out of sight a mowingmachine was being used for michael heard the click of its cropping journey growing fainter as it receded followed by the pause as it turned and its gradual crescendo as it approached again otherwise everything outside was strangely silent as the hot hours of midday and early afternoon went by there was no note of birdmusic nor any sound of wind in the elmtops just a little breeze stirred from time to time enough to make the slats of the halfdrawn venetian blind rattle faintly earlier in the day there had come in from the window the smell of dewdamp earth but now that had been sucked up by the sun close beside the window with her back to the light and facing the bed which projected from one of the side walls out into the room sat lady ashbridges nurse she was reading and the rustle of the turned page was regular but regular and constant also were her glances towards the bed where her patient lay at intervals she put down her book marking the place with a slip of paper and came to watch by the bed for a moment looking at lady ashbridges face and listening to her breathing her eye met michaels always as she did this and in answer to his mute question each time she gave him a little headshake or perhaps a whispered word or two that told him there was no change opposite the bed was the empty fireplace and at the foot of it a table on which stood a vase of roses michael was conscious of the scent of these every now and then and at intervals of the faint rather sickly smell of ether a japan screen ornamented with storks in gold thread stood near the door and halfconcealed the washingstand there was a chest of drawers on one side of the fireplace a wardrobe with a lookingglass door on the other a dressingtable to one side of the window a few prints on the plain blue walls and a dark blue drugget carpet on the floor and all these ordinary appurtenances of a bedroom etched themselves into michaels mind biting their way into it by the acid of his own suspense finally there was the bed where his mother lay the coverlet of blue silk upon it he knew was somehow familiar to him and after fitful gropings in his mind to establish the association he remembered that it had been on the bed in her room in curzon street and supposed that it had been brought here with others of her personal belongings a little core of light focused on one of the brass balls at the head of the bed caught his eye and he saw that the sun beginning to decline came in under the venetian blind the nurse sitting in the window noticed this also and lowered it the thought of sylvia crossed his brain for a moment then he thought of his father but every train of reflection dissolved almost as soon as it was formed and he came back again and again to his mothers face it was perfectly peaceful and strangely younglooking as if the cool soothing hand of death which presently would quiet all trouble for her had been already at work there erasing the marks that the years had graven upon it and yet it was not so much young as ageless it seemed to have passed beyond the register and limitations of time sometimes for a moment it was like the face of a stranger and then suddenly it would become beloved and familiar again it was just so she had looked when she came so timidly into his room one night at ashbridge asking him if it would be troublesome to him if she sat and talked with him for a little the mouth was a little parted for her slow even breathing the corners of it smiled and yet he was not sure if they smiled it was hard to tell for she lay there quite flat without pillows and he looked at her from an unusual angle sometimes he felt as if he had been sitting there watching for uncounted years and then again the hours that he had been here appeared to have lasted but for a moment as if he had but looked once at her as the day declined the breeze of evening awoke rattling the blind by now the sun had swung farther west and the nurse pulled the blind up outside in the bushes in the garden the call of birds to each other had begun and a thrush came close to the window and sang a liquid phrase and then repeated it michael glanced there and saw the bird specklebreasted with throat that throbbed with the notes and then looking back to the bed he saw that his mothers eyes were open she looked vaguely about the room for a moment as if she had awoke from some deep sleep and found herself in an unfamiliar place then turning her head slightly she saw him and there was no longer any question as to whether her mouth smiled for all her face was flooded with deep serene joy he bent towards her and her lips parted michael my dear she said gently michael heard the rustle of the nurses dress as she got up and came to the bedside he slipped from his chair on to his knees so that his face was near his mothers he felt in his heart that the moment he had so longed for was to be granted him that she had come back to him not only as he had known her during the weeks that they had lived alone together when his presence made her so content but in a manner infinitely more real and more embracing have you been sitting here all the time while i slept dear she asked have you been waiting for me to come back to you yes and you have come he said she looked at him and the motherlove which before had been veiled and clouded came out with all the tender radiance of evening sun with the clear shining after rain i knew you wouldnt fail me my darling she said you were so patient with me in the trouble i have been through it was a nightmare but it has gone michael bent forward and kissed her yes mother he said it has all gone she was silent a moment is your father here she said no but he will come at once if you would like to see him yes send for him dear if it would not vex him to come she said or get somebody else to send i dont want you to leave me im not going to said he the nurse went to the door gave some message and presently returned to the other side of the bed then lady ashbridge spoke again is this death she asked michael raised his eyes to the figure standing by the bed she nodded to him he bent forward again yes dear mother he said for a moment her eyes dilated then grew quiet again and the smile returned to her mouth im not frightened michael she said with you there it isnt lonely or terrible she raised her head my son she said in a voice loud and triumphant then her head fell back again and she lay with face close to his and her eyelids quivered and shut her breath came slow and regular as if she slept then he heard that she missed a breath and soon after another then without struggle at all her breathing ceased and outside on the lawn close by the open window the thrush still sang it was an hour later when michael left having waited for his fathers arrival and drove to town through the clear falling dusk he was conscious of no feeling of grief at all only of a complete pervading happiness he could not have imagined so perfect a close nor could he have desired anything different from that imperishable moment when his mother all trouble past had come back to him in the serene calm of love as he entered london he saw the newsboards all placarded with one fact england had declared war on germany he went not to his own flat but straight to maidstone crescent with those few minutes in which his mother had known him the stupor that had beset his emotions all day passed off and he felt himself longing as he had never longed before for sylvias presence long ago he had given her all that he knew of as himself now there was a fresh gift he had to give her all that those moments had taught him even as already they were knitted into him made part of him so must they be to her and when they had shared that when like water gushing from a spring she flooded him there was that other news which he had seen on the newsboards that they had to share together sylvia had been alone all day with her mother but before michael arrived mrs falbe after a few more encouraging remarks about war in general to the effect that germany would soon beat france and what a blessing it was that england was an island had taken her book up to her room and sylvia was sitting alone in the deep dusk of the evening she did not even trouble to turn on the light for she felt unable to apply herself to any practical task and she could think and take hold of herself better in the dark all day she had longed for michael to come to her though she had not cared to see anybody else and several times she had rung him up only to find that he was still out supposedly with his mother for he had been summoned to her early that morning and since then no news had come of him just before dinner had arrived the announcement of the declaration of war and sylvia sat now trying to find some escape from the encompassing nightmare she felt confused and distracted with it she could not think consecutively but only contemplate shudderingly the series of pictures that presented themselves to her mind somewhere now in the hosts of the fatherland which was hers also was hermann the brother who was part of herself when she thought of him she seemed to be with him to see the glint of his rifle to feel her heart on his heart big with passionate patriotism she had no doubt that patriotism formed the essence of his consciousness and yet by now probably he knew that the land beloved by him where he had made his home was at war with his own she could not but know how often his thoughts dwelled here in the dark quiet studio where she sat and where so many days of happiness had been passed she knew what she was to him she and her mother and michael and the hosts of friends in this land which had become his foe would he have gone she asked herself if he had guessed that there would be war between the two she thought he would though she knew that for herself she would have made it as hard as possible for him to do so she would have used every argument she could think of to dissuade him and yet she felt that her entreaties would have beaten in vain against the granite of his and her nationality dimly she had foreseen this contingency when a few days ago she had asked michael what he would do if england went to war and now that contingency was realised and hermann was even now perhaps on his way to violate the neutrality of the country for the sake of which england had gone to war on the other side was michael into whose keeping she had given herself and her love and on which side was she it was then that the nightmare came close to her she could not tell she was utterly unable to decide her heart was michaels her heart was her brothers also the one personified germany for her the other england it was as if she saw hermann and michael with bayonet and rifle stalking each other across some land of sanddunes and hollows creeping closer to each other always closer she felt as if she would have gladly given herself over to an eternity of torment if only they could have had one hour more all three of them together here as on that night of stars and peace when first there came the news which for the moment had disquieted hermann she longed as with thirst for michael to come and as her solitude became more and more intolerable a hundred hideous fancies obsessed her what if some accident had happened to michael or what if in this tremendous breaking of ties that the war entailed he felt that he could not see her she knew that was an impossibility but the whole world had become impossible and there was no escape somehow she had to adjust herself to the unthinkable somehow her relations both with hermann and michael had to remain absolutely unshaken even that was not enough they had to be strengthened made impregnable then came a knock on the side door of the studio that led into the street michael often came that way without passing through the house and with a sense of relief she ran to it and unlocked it and even as he stepped in before any word of greeting had been exchanged she flung herself on him with fingers eager for the touch of his solidity oh my dear she said i have longed for you just longed for you i never wanted you so much i have been sitting in the dark desolatedesolate and oh my darling what a beast i am to think of nothing but myself i am ashamed what of your mother michael she turned on the light as they walked back across the studio and michael saw that her eyes which were a little dazzled by the change from the dark into the light were dim with unshed tears and her hands clung to him as never before had they clung she needed him now with that imperative need which in trouble can only turn to love for comfort she wanted that only the fact of him with her in this land in which she had suddenly become an alien an enemy though all her friends except hermann were here and instantaneously as a baby at the breast she found that all his strength and serenity were hers they sat down on the sofa by the piano side by side with hands intertwined before michael answered he looked up at her as he spoke and in his eyes was the quiet of love and death my mother died an hour ago he said i was with her and as i had longed might happen she came back to me before she died for two or three minutes she was herself and then she said to me my son and soon she ceased breathing oh michael she said and for a little while there was silence and in turn it was her presence that he clung to presently he spoke again sylvia im so frightfully hungry he said i dont think ive eaten anything since breakfast may we go and forage oh you poor thing she cried yes lets go and see what there is instantly she busied herself hermann left the cellar key on the chimneypiece michael she said get some wine out dear mother and i dont drink any and theres some ham i know while you are getting wine ill broil some and there were some strawberries i shall have some supper with you what a good thought and you must be famished as they ate they talked perfectly simply and naturally of the hundred associations which this studio meal at the end of the evening called up concerning the sunday night parties there was an occasion on which hermann tried to recollect how to mull beer with results that smelled like a brickfield there was another when a poached egg had fallen exploding softly as it fell into the piano there was the occasion the first on which michael had been present when two eminent actors imitated each other another when francis came and made himself so immensely agreeable it was after that one that sylvia and hermann had sat and talked in front of the stove discussing as sylvia laughed to remember what she would say when michael proposed to her then had come the break in michaels attendances and as sylvia allowed a certain fallingoff in gaiety but it was really hermann and i who made you gay originally she said we take a wonderful deal of credit for that all this was as completely natural for them as was the impromptu meal and soon without effort michael spoke of his mother again and presently afterwards of the news of war but with him by her side sylvia found her courage come back to her the news itself all that it certainly implied and all the horror that it held no longer filled her with the sense that it was impossibly terrible michael did not diminish the awfulness of it but he gave her the power of looking out bravely at it nor did he shrink from speaking of all that had been to her so grim a nightmare you havent heard from hermann he asked no and i suppose we cant hear now he is with his regiment thats all nor shall we hear of him till there is peace again she came a little closer to him michael i have to face it that i may never see hermann again she said mother doesnt fear it you know shethe darlingshe lives in a sort of dream i dont want her to wake from it but how can i get accustomed to the thought that perhaps i shant see hermann again i must get accustomed to it ive got to live with it and not quarrel with it he took up her hand enclosing it in his but one doesnt quarrel with the big things of life he said isnt it so we havent any quarrel with things like death and duty dear me im afraid im preaching preach then she said well its just that we dont quarrel with them they manage themselves hermanns going managed itself it had to be her voice quivered as she spoke now are you going she asked will that have to be michael looked at her a moment with infinite tenderness oh my dear of course it will he said of course one doesnt know yet what the war office will do about the army i suppose its possible that they will send troops to france all that concerns me is that i shall rejoin again if they call up the reserves and they will yes i should think that is inevitable and you know theres something big about it im not warlike you know but i could not fail to be a soldier under these new conditions any more than i could continue being a soldier when all it meant was to be ornamental hermann in bursts of pride and patriotism used to call us toysoldiers but hes wrong now were not going to be toysoldiers any more she did not answer him but he felt her hand press close in the palm of his i cant tell you how i dreaded we shouldnt go to war he said that has been a nightmare if you like it would have been the end of us if we had stood aside and seen germany violate a solemn treaty even with michael close to her the call of her blood made itself audible to sylvia instinctively she withdrew her hand from his ah you dont understand germany at all she said hermann always felt that too he told me he felt he was talking gibberish to you when he spoke of it it is clearly life and death to germany to move against france as quickly as possible but theres a direct frontier between the two said he no doubt but an impossible one michael frowned drawing his big eyebrows together but nothing can justify the violation of a national oath he said thats the basis of civilisation a thing like that but if its a necessity if a nations existence depends on it she asked oh michael i dont know i dont know for a little i am entirely english and then something calls to me from beyond the rhine theres the hopelessness of it for me and such as me you are english theres no question about it for you but for us i love england i neednt tell you that but can one ever forget the land of ones birth can i help feeling the necessity germany is under i cant believe that she has wantonly provoked war with you but consider said he she got up suddenly i cant argue about it she said i am english and i am german you must make the best of me as i am but do be sorry for me and never never forget that i love you entirely thats the root fact between us i cant go deeper than that because that reaches to the very bottom of my soul shall we leave it so michael and not ever talk of it again wouldnt that be best there was no question of choice for michael in accepting that appeal he knew with the inmost fibre of his being that sylvia being sylvia nothing that she could say or do or feel could possibly part him from her when he looked at it directly and simply like that there was nothing that could blur the verity of it but the truth of what she said the reality of that call of the blood seemed to cast a shadow over it he knew beyond all other knowledge that it was there only it looked out at him with a shadow faint but unmistakable fallen across it but the sense of that made him the more eagerly accept her suggestion yes darling well never speak of it again he said that would be much wisest lady ashbridges funeral took place three days afterwards down in suffolk and those hours detached themselves in michaels mind from all that had gone before and all that might follow like a little piece of blue sky in the midst of storm clouds the limitations of mans consciousness which forbid him to think poignantly about two things at once hedged that day in with an impenetrable barrier so that while it lasted and afterwards for ever in memory it was unflecked by trouble or anxiety and hung between heaven and earth in a serenity of its own the coffin lay that night in his mothers bedroom which was next to michaels and when he went up to bed he found himself listening for any sound that came from there it seemed but yesterday when he had gone rather early upstairs and after sitting a minute or two in front of his fire had heard that timid knock on the door which had meant the opening of a mothers heart to him he felt it would scarcely be strange if that knock came again and if she entered once more to be with him from the moment he came upstairs the rest of the world was shut down to him he entered his bedroom as if he entered a sanctuary that was scented with the incense of her love he knew exactly how her knock had sounded when she came in here that night when first it burned for him his ears were alert for it to come again once his blind tapped against the frame of his open window and though knowing it was that he heard himself whisperfor she could hear his whispercome in mother and sat up in his deep chair looking towards the door but only the blind tapped again and outside in the moonlit dusk an owl hooted he remembered she liked owls once when they lived alone in curzon street some noise outside reminded her of the owls that hooted at ashbridgeshe had imitated their note saying it sounded like sleep she had sat in a chintzcovered chair close to him when at christmas she paid him that visit and now he again drew it close to his own and laid his hand on its arm petsy ii had come in with her and she had hoped that he would not annoy michael there were steps in the passage outside his room and he heard a little shrill bark he opened his door and found his mothers maid there trying to entice petsy away from the room next to his the little dog was curled up against it and now and then he turned round scratching at it asking to enter he wont come away my lord said the maid hes gone back a dozen times to the door michael bent down come petsy he said come to bed in my room the dog looked at him for a moment as if weighing his trustworthiness then he got up and with grotesque chinese highstepping walk came to him hell be all right with me he said to the maid he took petsy into his room next door and laid him on the chair in which his mother had sat the dog moved round in a circle once or twice and then settled himself down to sleep michael went to bed also and lay awake about a couple of minutes not thinking but only being while the owls hooted outside he awoke into complete consciousness knowing that something had aroused him even as three days ago when the telephone rang to summon him to his mothers deathbed then he did not know what had awakened him but now he was sure that there had been a tapping on his door and after he had sat up in bed completely awake he heard petsy give a little welcoming bark then came the noise of his small soft tail beating against the cushion in the chair michael had no feeling of fright at all only of longing for something that physically could not be and longing only longing once more he said come in mother he believed he heard the door whisper on the carpet but he saw nothing only the room was full of his mothers presence it seemed to him that in obedience to her he lay down completely satisfied he felt no curiosity to see or hear more she was there and that was enough he woke again a little after dawn petsy between the window and the door had jumped on to his bed to get out of the draught of the morning wind for the door was opened that morning the coffin was carried down the long winding path above the deepwater reach where michael and francis at christmas had heard the sound of stealthy rowing and on to the boat that awaited it to ferry it across to the church there was high tide and as they passed over the estuary the stillness of supreme noon bore to them the tolling of the bell the mourners from the house followed just three of them lord ashbridge michael and aunt barbara for the rest were to assemble at the church but of all that one moment stood out for michael above all others when as they entered the graveyard someone whom he could not see said i am the resurrection and the life and he heard that his father by whom he walked suddenly caught his breath in a sob all that day there persisted that sense of complete detachment from all but her whose body they had laid to rest on the windy hill overlooking the broad water his father aunt barbara the cousins and relations who thronged the church were no more than inanimate shadows compared with her whose presence had come last night into his room and had not left him since the affairs of the world drums and the torch of war had passed for those hours from his knowledge as at the centre of a cyclone there was a windless calm tomorrow he knew he would pass out into the tumult again and the minutes slipped like pearls from a string dropping into the dim gulf where the tempest raged he went back to town next morning after a short interview with his father who was coming up later in the day when he told him that he intended to go back to his regiment as soon as possible but knowing that he meant to go by the slow midday train his father proposed to stop the express for him that went through a few minutes before michael could hardly believe his ears chapter xv it was but a day or two after the outbreak of the war that it was believed that an expeditionary force was to be sent to france to help in arresting the teutonic tide that was now breaking over belgium but no public and authoritative news came till after the first draft of the force had actually set foot on french soil from the regiment of the guards which michael had rejoined francis was among the first batch of officers to go and that evening michael took down the news to sylvia already stories of german barbarity were rife of women violated of defenceless civilians being shot down for no object except to terrorise and to bring home to the belgians the unwisdom of presuming to cross the will of the sovereign people tonight in the evening papers there had been a fresh batch of these revolting stories and when michael entered the studio where sylvia and her mother were sitting he saw the girl let drop behind the sofa the paper she had been reading he guessed what she must have found there for he had already seen the paper himself and her silence her distraction and the misery of her face confirmed his conjecture ive brought you a little news tonight he said the first draft from the regiment went off today mrs falbe put down her book marking the place well that does look like business then she said though i must say i should feel safer if they didnt send our soldiers away where have they gone to destination unknown said michael but its france my cousin has gone francis asked sylvia oh how wicked to send boys like that michael saw that her nerves were sharply on edge she had given him no greeting and now as he sat down she moved a little away from him she seemed utterly unlike herself mother has been told that every englishman is as brave as two germans she said she likes that yes dear observed mrs falbe placidly it makes one feel safer i saw it in the paper though i read it sylvia turned on michael have you seen the evening paper she asked michael knew what was in her mind i just looked at it he said there didnt seem to be much news no only reports rumours lies said sylvia mrs falbe got up it was her habit to leave the two alone together since she was sure they preferred that incidentally also she got on better with her book for she found conversation rather distracting but tonight sylvia stopped her oh dont go yet mother she said it is very early it was clear that for some reason she did not want to be left alone with michael for never had she done this before nor did it avail anything now for mrs falbe who was quite determined to pursue her reading without delay moved towards the door but i am sure michael wants to talk to you dear she said and you have not seen him all day i think i shall go up to bed sylvia made no further effort to detain her but when she had gone the silence in which they had so often sat together had taken on a perfectly different quality and what have you been doing she said tell me about your day no dont i know it has all been concerned with war and i dont want to hear about it i dined with aunt barbara said michael she sent you her love she also wondered why you hadnt been to see her for so long sylvia gave a short laugh which had no touch of merriment in it did she really she asked i should have thought she could have guessed she set every nerve in my body jangling last time i saw her by the way she talked about germans and then suddenly she pulled herself up and apologised saying she had forgotten that made it worse michael when you are unhappy kindness is even more intolerable than unkindness i would sooner have lady barbara abusing my people than saying how sorry she is for me dont lets talk about it lets do something will you play or shall i sing lets employ ourselves michael followed her lead ah do sing he said its weeks since i have heard you sing she went quickly over to the bookcase of music by the piano come then lets sing and forget she said hermann always said the artist was of no nationality lets begin quick these are all german songs dont lets have those ah and these too whats to be done all our songs seem to be german michael laughed but weve just settled that artists have no nationality so i suppose art hasnt either he said sylvia pulled herself together conscious of a want of control and laid her hand on michaels shoulder oh michael what should i do without you she said and yetwell let me sing she had placed a volume of schubert on the musicstand and opening it at random he found du bist die ruhe she sang the first verse but in the middle of the second she stopped i cant she said its no use he turned round to her oh im so sorry he said but you know that she moved away from him and walked down to the empty fireplace i cant keep silence she said though i know we settled not to talk of those things when necessarily we cannot feel absolutely at one but just before you came in i was reading the evening paper michael how can the english be so wicked as to print and i suppose to believe those awful things i find there you told me you had glanced at it well did you glance at the lies they tell about german atrocities yes i saw them said michael but its no use talking about them but arent you indignant she said doesnt your blood boil to read of such infamous falsehoods you dont know germans but i do and it is impossible that such things can have happened michael felt profoundly uncomfortable some of these stories which sylvia called lies were vouched for apparently by respectable testimony why talk about them he said im sure we were wise when we settled not to she shook her head well i cant live up to that wisdom she said when i think of this war day and night and night and day how can i prevent talking to you about it and those lies germans couldnt do such things its a campaign of hate against us set up by the english press i daresay the german press is no better said michael if that is so i should be just as indignant about the german press said she but it is only your guess that it is so suddenly she stopped and came a couple of steps nearer him michael it isnt possible that you believe those things of us she said he got up ah do leave it alone sylvia he said i know no more of the truth or falsity of it than you i have seen just what you have seen in the papers you dont feel the impossibility of it then she asked no i dont there seems to have been sworn testimony war is a cruel thing i hate it as much as you when men are maddened with war you cant tell what they would do they are not the germans you know nor the germans i know who did such thingsnot the people i saw when i was with hermann in baireuth and munich a year ago they are no more the same than a drunken man is the same as that man when he is sober they are two different people drink has made them different and war has done the same for germany he held out his hand to her she moved a step back from him then you think i suppose that hermann may be concerned in those atrocities she said michael looked at her in amazement you are talking sheer nonsense sylvia he said not at all it is a logical inference just an application of the principle you have stated michaels instinct was just to take her in his arms and make the final appeal saying we love each other thats all but his reason prevented him sylvia had said a monstrous thing in cold blood when she suggested that he thought hermann might be concerned in these deeds and in cold blood not by appealing to her emotions must she withdraw that im not going to argue about it he said i want you to tell me at once that i am right that it was sheer nonsense to put no other name to it when you suggested that i thought that of hermann oh pray put another name to it she said very well it was a wanton falsehood said michael and you know it truly this hellish nightmare of war and hate which had arisen brought with it a brood not less terrible a day ago an hour ago he would have merely laughed at the possibility of such a situation between sylvia and himself yet here it was they were in the middle of it now she looked up at him flashing with indignation and a retort as stinging as his rose to her lips and then quite suddenly all her anger went from her as her heart told her in a voice that would not be silenced the complete justice of what he had said and the appeal that michael refrained from making was made by her to herself remorse held her on its spikes for her abominable suggestion and with it came a sense of utter desolation and misery of hatred for herself in having thus quietly and deliberately said what she had said she could not account for it nor excuse herself on the plea that she had spoken in passion for she had spoken as he felt in cold blood hence came the misery in the knowledge that she must have wounded michael intolerably her lips so quivered that when she first tried to speak no words would come that she was truly ashamed brought no relief no ease to her surrender for she knew that it was her real self who had spoken thus incredibly but she could at least disown that part of her i beg your pardon michael she said i was atrocious will you forgive me because i am so miserable he had nothing but love for her love and its kinsman pity oh my dear fancy you asking that he said just for the moment of their reconciliation it seemed to both that they came closer to each other than they had ever been before and the chance of the need of any such another reconciliation was impossible to the verge of laughableness so that before five minutes were past he could make the smile break through her tears at the absurdity of the moment that now seemed quite unreal yet that which was at the root of their temporary antagonism was not removed by the reconciliation at most they had succeeded in cutting off the poisonous shoot that had suddenly sprouted from it the truth of this in the days that followed was horribly demonstrated it was not that they ever again came to the spoken bitterness of words for the sharpness of them once experienced was shunned by each of them but times without number they had to sheer off and not approach the ground where these poisoned tendrils trailed and in that sense of having to take care to be watchful lest a chance word should bring the peril close to them the atmosphere of complete ease and confidence in which alone love can flourish was tainted love was there but its flowers could not expand it could not grow in the midst of this bitter air and what made the situation more and increasingly difficult was the fact that next to their love for each other the emotion that most filled the mind of each was this sense of raceantagonism it was impossible that the news of the war should not be mentioned for that would have created an intolerable unreality and all that was in their power was to avoid all discussion to suppress from speech all the feelings with which the news filled them every day too there came fresh stories of german abominations committed on the belgians and each knew that the other had seen them and yet neither could mention them for while sylvia could not believe them michael could not help doing so and thus there was no common ground on which they could speak of them often mrs falbe in whose blood it would seem no sense of race beat at all would add to the embarrassment by childlike comments saying at one time in reference to such things that she made a point of not believing all she saw in the newspapers or at another ejaculating well the germans do seem to have behaved very cruelly again but no emotion appeared to colour these speeches while all the emotion of the world surged and bubbled behind the silence of the other two then followed the darkest days that england perhaps had ever known when the german armies having overcome the resistance of belgium suddenly swept forward again across france pushing before them like the jetsam and flotsam on the rim of the advancing tide the allied armies often in these appalling weeks michael would hesitate as to whether he should go to see sylvia or not so unbearable seemed the fact that she did not and could not feel or understand what england was going through so far from blaming her for it he knew that it could not be otherwise for her blood called to her even as his to him while somewhere in the onrush of those advancing and devouring waves was her brother with whom so it had often seemed to him she was one soul thus while in that his whole sympathy and whole comprehension of her love was with him there was as well all that deep silent english patriotism of which till now he had scarcely been conscious praying with mute entreaty that disaster and destruction and defeat might overwhelm those advancing hordes once when the anxiety and peril were at their height he made up his mind not to see her that day and spent the evening by himself but later when he was actually on his way to bed he knew he could not keep away from her and though it was already midnight he drove down to chelsea and found her sitting up waiting for the chance of his coming for a moment as she greeted him and he kissed her silently they escaped from the encompassing horror ah you have come she said i thought perhaps you might i have wanted you dreadfully the roar of artillery the internecine strife were still just for a few seconds there was nothing in the world for him but her nor for her anything but him i couldnt go to bed without just seeing you he said i wont keep you up they stood with hands clasped but if you hadnt come michael she said i should have understood and then the roar and the horror began again her words were the simplest the most directly spoken to him yet could not but evoke the spectres that for the moment had vanished she had meant to let her love for him speak it had spoken and instantly through the momentary sunlight of it there loomed the fierce and enormous shadow it could not be banished from their most secret hearts even when the doors were shut and they were alone together thus it made its entrance ghostlike terrible and all loves bolts and bars could not keep it out here was the tragedy of it that they could not stand embraced with clasped hands and look at it together and so rob it of its terrors for at the sight of it their hands were loosened from each others and in its presence they were forced to stand apart in his heart as surely as he knew her love michael knew that this great shadow under which england lay was shot with sunlight for sylvia that the anxiety the awful suspense that made his fingers cold as he opened the daily papers brought into it to her an echo of victorious music that beat to the tramp of advancing feet that marched ever forward leaving the glittering rhine leagues upon leagues in their rear the bavarian corps in which hermann served was known to be somewhere on the western front for the emperor had addressed them ten days before on their departure from munich and sylvia and michael were both aware of that but they who loved hermann best could not speak of it to each other and the knowledge of it had to be hidden in silence as if it had been some guilty secret in which they were the terrified accomplices instead of its being a bond of love which bound them both to hermann in addition to the national anxiety there was the suspense of those whose sons and husbands and fathers were in the fighting line columns of casualty lists were published and each name appearing there was a sword that pierced a home one such list published early in september was seen by michael as he drove down on sunday morning to spend the rest of the day with sylvia and the first name that he read there was that of francis for a moment as he remembered afterwards the print had danced before his eyes as if seen through the quiver of hot air then it settled down and he saw it clearly he turned and drove back to his rooms in half moon street feeling that strange craving for loneliness that shuns any companionship he must for a little sit alone with the fact face it adjust himself to it till that moment when the dancing print grew still again he had not in all the anxiety and suspense of those days thought of franciss death as a possibility even he had heard from him only two mornings before in a letter thoroughly characteristic that saw as francis always saw the pleasant and agreeable side of things washing he had announced was a delusion after a week without it you began to wonder why you had ever made a habit of it they had had a lot of marching always in the wrong direction but everyone knew that would soon be over wasnt london very beastly in august would michael see if he could get some proper cigarettes out to him here there was nothing but little black french affairs and not many of them which tied a knot in the throat of the smoker and now francis with all his gaiety and his affection and his light pleasant dealings with life lay dead somewhere on the sunny plains of france killed in action by shell or bullet in the midst of his youth and strength and joy in life to gratify the damned dreams of the man who had been the honoured guest at ashbridge and those who had advised and flattered and at the end perhaps just used him as their dupe to their insensate greed and swollenheaded lust for worldpower was this hecatomb of sweet and pleasant lives offered and in their onward course through the vines and corn of france they waded through the blood of the slain whose only crime was that they had dared to oppose the will of germany as voiced by the war lord and as milestones along the way they had come were set the records of their infamy in rapine and ruthless slaughter of the innocent just at first as he sat alone in his room michael but contemplated images that seemed to form in his mind without his volition and emotionnumb from the shock they seemed external to him sometimes he had a vision of francis lying without mark or wound or violence on him in some vineyard on the hillside with face as quiet as in sleep turned towards a moonlit sky then came another picture and francis was walking across the terrace at ashbridge with his gun over his shoulder towards lord ashbridge and the emperor who stood together just as michael had seen the three of them when they came in from the shootingparty as francis came near the emperor put a cartridge into his gun and shot him yes that was it that was what had happened the marvellous peacemaker of europe the fireengine who as hermann had said was ready to put out all conflagrations the fatuous mountebank who pretended to be a friend to england who conducted his own balderdash which he called music had changed his role and shown his black heart and was out to kill wild panoramas like these streamed through michaels head as if projected there by some magic lantern and while they lasted he was conscious of no grief at all but only of a devouring hate for the mad lawless butchers who had caused franciss death and willingly at that moment if he could have gone out into the night and killed a german and met his death himself in the doing of it he would have gone to his doom as to a bridalbed but by degrees as the stress of these unsought imaginings abated his thoughts turned to francis himself again who through all his boyhood and early manhood had been to him a sort of ideal and inspiration how he had loved and admired him yet never with a touch of jealousy and francis whose letter lay open by him on the table lay dead on the battlefields of france there was the envelope with the red square mark of the censor upon it and the sheet with its gay scrawl in pencil asking for proper cigarettes and with a pang of remorse all the more vivid because it concerned so trivial a thing michael recollected that he had not sent them he had meant to do so yesterday afternoon but something had put it out of his head never again would francis ask him to send out cigarettes michael laid his head on his arms so that his face was close to that pencilled note and the relief of tears came to him soon he raised himself again not ashamed of his sorrow but somehow ashamed of the black hate that before had filled him that was gone for the present anyhow and michael was glad to find it vanished instead there was an aching pity not for francis alone nor for himself but for all those concerned in this hideous business a hundred and a thousand homes thrown suddenly today into mourning were there no doubt there were houses in that bavarian village in the pine woods above which he and hermann had spent the day when there was no opera at baireuth where a son or a brother or a father were mourned and in the kinship of sorrow he found himself at peace with all who had suffered loss with all who were living through days of deadly suspense there was nothing effeminate or sentimental about it he had never been manlier than in this moment when he claimed his right to be one with them it was right to pause like this with his hand clasped in the hands of friends and foes alike but without disowning that he knew that franciss death which had brought that home to him had made him eager also for his own turn to come when he would go out to help in the grim work that lay in front of him he was perfectly ready to die if necessary and if not to kill as many germans as possible and somehow the two aspects of it all the pity and the desire to kill existed side by side neither overlapping nor contradicting one another his servant came into the room with a pencilled note which he opened it was from sylvia oh michael i have just called and am waiting to know if you will see me i have seen the news and i want to tell you how sorry i am but if you dont care to see me i know you will say so wont you though an hour before he had turned back on his way to go to sylvia he did not hesitate now yes ask miss falbe to come up he said she came up immediately and once again as they met the world and the war stood apart from them i did not expect you to come michael she said when i saw the news i did not mean to come here myself butbut i had to i had just to find out whether you wouldnt see me and let me tell you how sorry i am he smiled at her as they stood facing each other thank you for coming he said im so glad you came but i had to be alone just a little i didnt do wrong she asked indeed you didnt i did wrong not to come to you i loved francis you see already the shadow threatened again it was just the fact that he loved francis that had made it impossible for him to go to her and he could not explain that and as the shadow began to fall she gave a little shudder oh michael i know you did she said its just that which concerns us that and my sympathy for you he was such a dear i only saw him i know once or twice but from that i can guess what he was to you he was a brother to youaahermann michael felt with sylvias hand in his they were both running desperately away from the shadow that pursued them desperately he tried with her to evade it but every word spoken between them seemed but to bring it nearer to them i only came to say that she said i had to tell you myself to see you as i told you so that you could know how sincere how heartfelt she stopped suddenly thats all my dearest she added i will go away again now across that shadow that had again fallen between them they looked and yearned for each other no dont godont go he said i want you more than ever we are here here and now you and i and what else matters in comparison of that i loved francis as you know and i love hermann but there is our love the greatest thing of all weve got itits here oh sylvia we must be wise and simple we must separate things sort them out not let them get mixed with one another we can do it i know we can theres nothing outside us nothing mattersnothing matters there was just that ray of sun peering over the black cloud that illumined their faces to each other while already the sharp peaked shadow of it had come between them for that second while he spoke it seemed possible that in the middle of welter and chaos and death and enmity these two souls could stand apart in the passionate serene of love and the moment lasted for just as long as she flung herself into his arms and then even while her face was pressed to his and while the riotous blood of their pressed lips sang to them the shadow fell across them even as he asserted the inviolability of the sanctuary in which they stood he knew it to be an impossible utopiathat he should find with her the peace that should secure them from the raging storm the cold shadowand the loosening of her arms about his neck but endorsed the message of his own heart for such heavenly security cannot come except to those who have been through the ultimate bitterness that the world can bring it is not arrived at but through complete surrender to the trial of fire and as yet in spite of their opposed patriotism in spite of her sincerest sympathy with michaels loss the assault on the most intimate lines of the fortress had not yet been delivered before they could reach the peace that passed understanding a fiercer attack had to be repulsed they had to stand and look at each other unembittered across waves and billows of a salter marah than this but still they clung while in their eyes there passed backwards and forwards the message that said it is not yet it is not thus they had been like two children springing together at the report of some thunderclap not knowing in the presence of what elemental outpouring of force they hid their faces together as yet it but boomed on the horizon though messages of its havoc reached them and the test would come when it roared and lightened overhead already the tension of the approaching tempest had so wrought on them that for a month past they had been unreal to each other wanting ease wanting confidence and now when the first real shock had come though for a moment it threw them into each others arms this was not as they knew the real the final reconciliation the touchstone that proved the gold franciss death the cousin whom michael loved at the hands of one of the nation to whom sylvia belonged had momentarily made them feel that all else but their love was but external circumstance and even in the moment of their feeling this the shadow fell again and left them chilly and shivering for a moment they still held each other round the neck and shoulder then the hold slipped to the elbow and soon their hands parted as yet no word had been said since michael asserted that nothing else mattered and in the silence of their gradual estrangement the sanguine falsity of that grew and grew and grew i know what you feel she said at length and i feel it also her voice broke and her hands felt for his again michael where are you she cried no dont touch me i didnt mean that lets face it for all we know hermann might have killed francis whether he did or not doesnt matter it might have been its like that a minute before michael in soul and blood and mind and bones had said that nothing but sylvia and himself had any real existence he had clung to her even as she to him hoping that this individual love would prove itself capable of overriding all else that existed but it had not needed that she should speak to show him how pathetically he had erred before she had made a concrete instance he knew how hopeless his wish had been the silence the loosening of hands had told him that and when she spoke there was a brutality in what she said and worse than the brutality there was a plain unvarnished truth there was no question now of her going away at once as she had proposed any more than a boat in the rapids roared round by breakers can propose to start again they were in the middle of it and so short a way ahead was the cataract that ran with blood on each side at present were fine green landingplaces he at the oar she at the tiller could if they were of one mind still put ashore could run their boat in declining the passage of the cataract with all its risks its river of blood there was but a stroke of the oar to be made a pull on a rope of the rudder and a step ashore here was a way out of the storm and the rapids a moment before when by their physical parting they had realised the strength of the bonds that held them apart this solution had not occurred to sylvia now critically and forlornly hopeful it flashed on her she felt she almost feltfor the ultimate decision rested with himthat with him she would throw everything else aside and escape just escape if so he willed it into some haven of neutrality where he and she would be together leaving the rest of the world her country and his to fight over these irreconcilable quarrels it did not seem to matter what happened to anybody else provided only she and michael were together out of risk out of harm other lives might be precious other ideals and patriotisms might be at stake but she wanted to be with him and nothing else at all no tie counted compared to that there was but one life given to man and woman and now that her individual happiness the individual joy of her love was at stake she felt even as michael had said that nothing else mattered that they would be right to realise themselves at any cost she took his hands again listen to me michael she said i cant bear any longer that these horrors should keep rising up between us and while we are here in the middle of it all it cant be otherwise i ask you then to come away with me to leave it all behind it is not our quarrel already hermann has gone i cant lose you too she looked up at him for a moment and then quickly away again for she felt her case which seemed to her just now so imperative slipping away from her in that glance she got of his eyes that for all the love that burned there were blank with astonishment she must convince him but her own convictions were weak when she looked at him dont answer me yet she said hear what i have to say dont you see that while we are like this we are lost to each other and as you yourself said just now nothing matters in comparison to our love i want you to take me away out of it all so that we can find each other again these horrors thwart and warp us they spoil the best thing that the world holds for us my patriotism is just as sound as yours but i throw it away to get you do the same then you can get out of your service somehow and then her voice began to falter if you loved me you would do it she said if and then suddenly she found she could say no more at all she had hoped that when she stated these things she would convince him and behold all she had done was to shake her own convictions so that they fell clattering round her like an unstable cardhouse desperately she looked again at him wondering if she had convinced him at all and then again she looked wondering if she should see contempt in his eyes after that she stood still and silent and her face flamed do you despise me michael she said he gave a little sigh of utter content oh my dear how i love you for suggesting such a sweet impossibility he said but how you would despise me if i consented she did not answer wouldnt you he repeated she gave a sorrowful semblance of a laugh i suppose i should she said and i know you would you would contrast me in your mind whether you wished to or not with hermann with poor francis sorely to my disadvantage they sat silent a little but there was another question sylvia had to ask for which she had to collect her courage at last it came have they told you yet when you are going she said not for certain butit will be before many days are passed and the question ariseswill you marry me before i go she hid her face on his shoulder i will do what you wish she said but i want to know your wish she clung closer to him michael i dont think i could bear to part with you if we were married she said it would be worse i think than its going to be but i intend to do exactly what you wish you must tell me im going to obey you before i am your wife as well as after michael had long debated this in his mind it seemed to him that if he came back as might easily happen hopelessly crippled incurably invalid it would be placing sylvia in an unfairly difficult position if she was already his wife he might be hideously disfigured she would be bound to but a wreck of a man he might be utterly unfit to be her husband and yet she would be tied to him he had already talked the question over with his father who with that curious posthumous anxiety to have a further direct heir had urged that the marriage should take place at once but with his own feeling on the subject as well as sylvias he at once made up his mind i agree with you he said we will settle it so then she smiled at him how dreadfully businesslike she said with an attempt at lightness i know its rather a good thing one has got to be businesslike when that failed also and he drew her to him and kissed her chapter xvi michael was sitting in the kitchen of a french farmhouse just outside the village of laires some three miles behind the english front the kitchen door was open and on the flagged floor was cast an oblong of primrosecoloured november sunshine warm and pleasant so that the bluebottle flies buzzed hopefully about it settling occasionally on the cracked green door where they cleaned their wings and generally furbished themselves up as if the warmth was that of a spring day that promised summer to follow they were there in considerable numbers for just outside in the cobbled yard was a heap of manure where they hungrily congregated against the whitewashed wall of the house there lay a fat sow basking contentedly and snorting in her dreams the yard bounded on two sides by the house walls was shut in on the third by a row of farmsheds and the fourth was open just outside it stood a small copse half flooded with the brimming water of a sluggish stream that meandered by the side of the farmroad leading out of the yard which turned to the left and soon joined the highway this farmroad was partly under water though not deeply so that by skirting along its raised banks it was possible to go dryshod to the highway underneath which the stream passed in a brick culvert through the kitchen window set opposite the door could be seen a broad stretch of country of the fenland type flat and bare and intersected with dykes where sedges stirred slightly in the southerly breeze here and there were pools of overflowed rivulets and here and there were plantations of stunted hornbeam the russet leaves of which still clung thickly to them but in the main it was a bare and empty land featureless and stolid just below the kitchen window there was a plot of cultivated ground thriftily and economically used for the growing of vegetables concession however was made to the sense of brightness and beauty for on each side of the path leading up to the door ran a row of michaelmas daisies rather battered by the fortnight of rain which had preceded this day of still warm sun but struggling bravely to shake off the effect of the adverse conditions under which they had laboured the kitchen itself was extremely clean and orderly its flagged floor was still damp and brown in patches from the washing it had received two hours before but the draught between open window and open door was fast drying it down the centre of the room was a deal table without a cloth on which were laid some halfdozen places each marked with a knife and fork and spoon and a thick glass ready for the serving of the midday meal on the whitewashed walls hung two photographs of family groups in one of which appeared the father and mother and three little children in the other the same personages some ten years later and a lithograph of the blessed virgin on each side of the table was a deal bench at the head and foot two wooden armchairs a dresser stood against the wall on the floor by the oven was a frayed rug and most important of all to michaels mind was a big stewpot that stood on the top of the oven from time to time a fat comfortable frenchwoman bustled in and took off the lid of this to stir it or placed on the dresser a plate of cheese or a loaf of freshly cooked brown bread two or three of michaels brotherofficers were there one sitting in the patch of sunlight with his back against the green door another on the step outside the post had come in not long before and all of them michael included were occupied with letters and papers today there happened to be no letters for michael and the paper which he glanced at seemed a very feeble effort in the way of entertainment there was no news in it except news about the war which here out at the front did not interest him in the least perhaps in england people liked to know that a hundred yards of trenches had been taken at one place and that three german attacks had failed at another but when you were actually engaged or had been or would soon again be in taking part in those things it seemed a waste of paper and compositors time to record them there was a column of letters also from indignant britons using violent language about the crimes and treachery of germany that also was uninteresting and farfetched nothing that germany had done mattered the least there was no use in arguing and slinging wild expressions about it was a stale subject altogether when you were within earshot of that incessant booming of guns all the morning that had gone on without break and no doubt they would get news of what had happened before they set out again that evening for another spell in the trenches but in all probability nothing particular had happened probably the london papers would record it next day a further tediousness on their part it would be much more interesting to hear what was going on there whether there were any new plays whether there had been any fresh concerts what the weather was like or even who had been lunching at princes or dining at the carlton he put down his uninteresting paper and strolled out into the farmyard stepping over the legs of the junior officer who blocked the doorway and did not attempt to move on the doorstep was sitting a major of his regiment who more politely shifted his place a little so that michael should pass outside the smell of manure was acrid but not unpleasant the old sow grunted in her sleep and one of the green shutters outside the upper windows slowly blew to there was someone inside the room apparently for the moment after a hand and arm bare to the elbow were protruded and fastened the latch of the shutter so that it should not move again a little further on was a rail that separated the copse from the roadway and here out of the wind michael sat down and lit a cigarette to stop his yearning for the bubbling stewpot which would not be broached for half an hour yet the day he believed was wednesday but the whole quiet of the place apart from that drowsy booming on the eastern horizon made it feel like sunday nobody but the fat frenchwoman who bustled about had anything to do there was a sabbath leisure about everything about the dozing sow the buzzing flies the lounging figures that read letters and papers when last they were here it is true there were rather more of them eight officers had been billeted here last week before they had been in the trenches and now there were but six this evening they would set out again for another fortyeight hours in that hellish inferno but tomorrow a fresh draft was arriving so that when next they foregathered here whatever had happened in the interval there would probably be at least six of them it did not seem to matter much what six there would be or whether there would be more than six or less all that mattered at this moment as he inhaled the first incense of his cigarette was that the rain was over for the present that the sun shone from a blue sky that he felt extraordinarily well and tranquil and that dinner would soon be ready but of all these agreeable things what pleased him most was the tranquillity to be alive here with the manure heap steaming in the sun and the sow asleep by the house wall and swallows settling on the eaves was paradise enow somewhere deep down in him were streams of yearning and of horror flowing like an underground river in the dark he yearned for sylvia he thought with horror of the two days in the trenches that had preceded this rest in the whitewashed farmhouse and with horror he thought of the days and nights that would succeed it but both horror and yearnings were stupefied by the content that flooded the present moment no doubt it was reaction from what had gone before but the reaction was complete just now he asked for nothing but to sit in the sun and smoke his cigarette and wait for dinner as far as he knew he did not think of anything particular he just existed in the sun the wind must have shifted a little for before long it came round the corner of the house and slightly spoiled the mellow warmth of the sunshine this would never do the epicurean in him revolted at the idea of losing a moment of this complete wellbeing and arguing that if the wind blew here it must be dead calm below the kitchen window on the other side of the house he got off his rail and walked along the slippery bank at the edge of the flooded road in order to go there it was hard to keep his footing here and his progress was slow but he felt he would take any amount of trouble to avoid getting his feet wet in the flooded road then there was a patch of kitchengarden to cross where the mud clung rather annoyingly to his instep and having gained the garden path he very carefully wiped his boots and with a fallen twig dug away the clots of soil that stuck to the instep he found that he had been quite right in supposing that the air would be windless here and full of great content he sat down with his back to the house wall a tortoiseshell butterfly encouraged by the warmth was flitting about among the michaelmas daisies that bordered the path and settling on them opening its wings to the genial sun two or three bees buzzed there also the summerlike tranquillity inserted into the middle of november squalls and rain deluded them as well as michael into living completely in the present hour gnats hovered about one settled on michaels hand where he instantly killed it and was sorry he had done so for the time the booming of guns which had sounded incessantly all the morning to the east stopped altogether and absolute quiet reigned had he not been so hungry and so unable to get the idea of the stewpot out of his head michael would have been content to sit with his back to the sunwarmed wall for ever the highroad raised and embanked above the lowlying fields ran eastwards in an undeviating straight line just opposite the farm were the last outlying huts of the village and from there onwards it lay untenanted but before many minutes were passed the quiet of the autumn noon began to be overscored by distant humming faint at first and then quickly growing louder and he saw far away a little brown speck coming swiftly towards him it turned out to be a dispatchrider mounted on a motorbicycle who with a hoot of his horn roared westward through the village immediately afterwards another humming steadier and more sonorous grew louder and michael recognising it looked up instinctively into the blue sky overhead as an english aeroplane flying low came from somewhere behind and passed directly over him going eastwards before long it stopped its direct course and began to mount in spirals and when at a sufficient height it resumed its onward journey towards the german lines then three or four privates billeted in the village and now resting after duty in the trenches strolled along the road laughing and talking they sat down not a hundred yards from michael and one began to whistle tipperary another and another took it up until all four were engaged on it it was not precisely in tune nor were the performers in unison but it produced a vaguely pleasant effect and if not in tune with the notes as the composer wrote them the sight and sound of those four whistling and idle soldiers was in tune with the air of security of sunday morning something far down the road caught michaels eye some moving line of brown wagons as they came nearer he saw that they were the motorambulances of the red cross moving slowly along the ruts and holes which the traffic had worn so that the occupants should suffer as little jolting as was possible they carried no doubt the wounded who had been taken from the trenches last night and now after calling for them at the first dressing station in the rear of the lines were removing them to hospital as they passed the four men sitting by the roadside one of them shouted cheer oh mates and then they fell to whistling tipperary again then oh blessed moment the fat frenchwoman looked out of the kitchen window just above his head diner msieu she said and michael without another thought of ambulance or aeroplane scrambled to his feet somewhere in the middle distance of his mind he was sorry that this tranquil morning was over just as below in the darkness of it there ran those streams of yearning and of horror but all his ordinary workaday self was occupied with the immediate prospect of the stewpot it was some sort of a ragout he knew and he lusted for it red wine of the country would be there and cheese and new brown bread it surprised him to find how completely his bodily needs and the pleasure of their gratification had possession of him they were under orders to go back to the trenches shortly after sunset and when their meal was over there remained but an hour or two before they had to start the warmth and glory of the day was already gone and streamers of cloud were beginning to form over the open sky all afternoon these thickened till a dull layer of grey had thickly overspread the heavens and below that arch of vapour that cut off the sun the wind was blowing chilly with that change in the weather michaels mood changed also and the horror of the return to the trenches began to come to the surface he was not as yet aware of any physical fear of death or of wound rather the feeling was one of some mental and spiritual shrinking from the whole of this vast business of murder where hundreds and thousands of men along the battle front that stretched halfway across europe were employed day and night without having any quarrel with each other in the unsleeping vigilant work of killing most of them in all probability were quite decent fellows like those four who had whistled tipperary together and yet they were spending months of young sweet life up to the knees in water in foul and illsmelling trenches in order to kill others whom they had never seen except as specks on the sights of their rifles somewhere behind that gruesome business as he knew there stood the cause calm and serene like some great statue which made this insensate murdering necessary but just for an hour today as he waited till they had to be on the move again he found himself unable to make real to his own mind the existence of that cause and could not see beyond the bloody and hideous things that resulted from it then in this inaction of waiting an attack of mere physical cowardice seized him and he found himself imagining the mutilation and torture that perhaps awaited him personally in those deathly ditches he tried to busy himself with the preparation of the few things that he would take with him he tried to encourage himself by remembering that in his previous experiences there he had not been conscious of any fear by telling himself that these were only the unreal anticipations that were always ready to pounce on one even before such mildly alarming affairs as a visit to the dentist but in spite of his efforts he found his hands growing clammy and cold at the thoughts which beset his brain what if there happened to him what had happened to another junior officer who was close to him at the moment when a fragment of shell turned him from a big gay boy into a writhing bundle at the bottom of the trench he had lived for a couple of hours like that moaning and crying out for gods sake kill me what if more mercifully he was killed outright so that he would lie there in peace till next night they removed his body or perhaps had to bury him in the trench itself with a dozen handfuls of soil cast over him at that he suddenly realised how passionately he wanted to live to escape from this infernal butchery to be safe again gloriously or ingloriously it mattered not which to be with sylvia once more he told himself that he had been an utter fool ever to reenter the army again like this he could certainly have got some appointment as dispatchcarrier or had himself attached to the headquarters staff or even have shuffled out of it altogether but above all he wanted sylvia he wanted to be allowed to lead the ordinary human life safely and securely with the girl he loved and with the musical pursuits that were his passion he had hated soldiering in times of peace he found now that he was terrified of it in times of war he felt physically sick as with cold hands and trembling knees he stood and waited lighting cigarettes and throwing them away in front of the kitchen fire where the stewpot was already bubbling again for those lucky devils who would return here tonight the major of his company was sitting in the window watching him though michael was unaware of it suddenly he got up and came across to the fire and put his hand on his shoulder dont mind it comber he said quietly we all get a touch of it sometimes but youll find it will pass all right its the waiting doing nothing that does it that touched michael absolutely in the right place thanks awfully sir he said not a bit but its damned beastly while it lasts youll be all right when we move dont forget to take your fur coat up if youve got one we shall have a cold night just after sunset they set out marching in the gathering dusk down the road eastwards where in a mile or two they would strike the huge rabbit warren of trenches that joined the french line to the north and south once or twice they had to open out and go by the margin of the road to let ambulances or commissariat wagon go by but there was but little traffic here as the main lines of communication lay on other roads high above them scarcely visible in the dusk an english aeroplane droned back from its reconnaissance and once there was the order given to scatter over the fields as a german taube passed across them this caused much laughter and chaff among the men and michael heard one say dove they call it do they id like to make a pigeonpie of them doves soon they scrambled back on to the road again and the interminable tipperary was resumed in whistle and song michael remembered how aunt barbara had heard it at a musichall and had spoken of it as a new and catchy tune which you could carry away with you nowadays it carried you away it had become the audible soul of the british army the trench which michaels company were to occupy for the next fortyeight hours was in the first firingline and to reach it they had to pass in single file up a mile of communication trenches from which on all sides like a vast rabbit warren there opened out other galleries and passages that led to different parts of this network of the lines it ran not in a straight line but in short sections with angles intervening so under no circumstances could any considerable length of it be enfiladed and was lit here and there by little oil lamps placed in embrasures in one or other wall of it or for some distance at a time it was dark except for the vague twilight of the cloudy sky overhead then again as they approached the firingline it would suddenly become intensely bright when from the english lines or from those of the germans which lay not more than two hundred yards in front of them a fireball or starshell was sent up that caused everything it shone upon to leap into vivid illumination usually when this happened there came from one side or the other a volley of rifle shots that sounded like the crack of stockwhips and once or twice a bullet passed over their heads with the buzz as of some vicious stinging insect here and there where the bottom lay in soft and clayey soil they walked through mud that came halfway up to the knee and each foot had to be lifted with an effort and was set free with a smacking suck elsewhere if the ground was gravelly the rain which for two days previously had been incessant had drained off and the going was easy but whether the path lay over dry or soft places the air was sick with some stale odour which the breeze that swept across the lines from the southeast could not carry away there was a perpetual pervading reek that flowed along from the entrance of trenches to right and left that reminded michael of the smell of a football scrimmage on a wet day laden with the odours of sweat and dripping clothes and something deadlier and more acrid sometimes they passed under a section covered in with boards over which the earth and clods of turf had been replaced so that reconnoitring aeroplanes should not so easily spy it out and here from dark excavations the smell hung overpoweringly now and then the ground over which they passed yielded uneasily to the foot where lay only lightly covered over some corpse which it had been impossible to remove and from time to time they passed a huddled bundle of khaki not yet taken away but except for the artillery duel that day they had heard going on that morning the last day or two had been quiet and the wounded had all been got out and for the most part the dead also after a long tramp in this communication trench they made a sharp turn to the right and entered that which they were going to hold for the next fortyeight hours here they relieved the regiment that had occupied it till now who filed out as they came in along it at intervals were excavations dug out in the side some propped up with boards and posts others where the ground was of sufficiently holding character just scooped out in front towards the german lines ran a parapet of excavated earth with occasional peepholes bored in it so that the sentry going his rounds could look out and see if there was any sign of movement from opposite without showing his head above the entrenchment but even this was a matter of some risk since the enemy had located these peepholes and from time to time fired a shot from a fixed rifle that came straight through them and buried its bullet in the hinder wall of the trench other spyholes were therefore being made but these were not yet finished and for the present till they were dug it was necessary to use the old ones the trench like all the others was excavated in short zigzag lengths so that no point either to right or left commanded more than a score of yards of it in front from just outside the parapet to a depth of some twenty yards stretched the spiderweb of wire entanglements and a little farther down on the right there had been a copse of hornbeam saplings an attempt had been made by the enemy during the morning to capture and entrench this thus advancing their lines but the movement had been seen and the artillery fire which had been so incessant all the morning denoted the searching of this and the rendering of it untenable how thorough that searching had been was clear for that which had been an acre of wood was now but a heap of timber fit only for faggots scarcely a tree was left standing and michael looking out of one of the peepholes by the light of a starshell saw that the wire entanglements were thick with leaves that the wind and the firing had detached from the broken branches in turn the wire entanglements had come in for some shelling by the enemy and a squad of men were out now under cover of the darkness repairing these there was a slight dip in the ground here and by crouching and lying they were out of sight of the trenches opposite but there were some snipers in that which had been a wood from whom there came occasional shots then from lower down to the right there came a fusillade from the english lines suddenly breaking out and after a few minutes as suddenly stopping again but the sniping from the wood had ceased michael did not come on duty till six in the morning and for the present he had nothing to do except eat his rations and sleep as well as he could in his dugout he had plenty of room to stretch his legs if he sat half upright and having taken his majors advice in the matter of bringing his fur coat with him he found himself warm enough in spite of the rather bitter wind that striking an angle in the trench wall eddied sharply into his retreat to sleep but not less justified than the advice to bring his fur coat was his majors assurance that the attack of the horrors which had seized him after dinner that day would pass off when the waiting was over throughout the evening his nerves had been perfectly steady and when in their progress up the communication trench they had passed a man half disembowelled by a fragment of a shell and screaming or when as he trod on one of the uneasy places an arm had stirred and jerked up suddenly through the handful of earth that covered it he had no firsthand sense of horror he felt rather as if those things were happening not to him but to someone else and that at the most they were strange and odd but no longer horrible but now when reinforced by food again and comfortable beneath his fur cloak he let his mind do what it would not checking it but allowing it its natural internal activity he found that a mood transcending any he had known yet was his so far from these experiences being terrifying so far from their being strange and unreal they suddenly became intensely real and shone with a splendour that he had never suspected originally he had been pitchforked by his father into the army and had left it to seek music sense of duty had made it easy for him to return to it at a time of national peril but during all the bitter anxiety of that he had never as in the light of the perception that came to him now as the wind whistled round him in the dim lit darkness had a glimpse of the glory of service to his country here out in this small evilsmelling cavern with the whole grim business of war going on round him he for the first time fully realised the reality of it all he had been in the trenches before but until now that had seemed some vague evil dream of which he was incredulous now in the darkness the darkness cleared and the knowledge that this was the very thing itself that a couple of hundred yards away were the lines of the enemy whose power for the honour of england and for the freedom of europe had to be broken utterly filled him with a sense of firm indescribable joy the minor problems which had worried him the fact of millions of treasure that might have fed the poor and needy over all britain for a score of years being outpoured in fire and steel the fact of thousands of useful and happy lives being sacrificed of widows and orphans and childless mothers growing ever a greater companyall these things terrible to look at if you looked at them alone sank quietly into their sad appointed places when you looked at the thing entire his own case sank there too music and life and love for which he would so rapturously have lived were covered up now and at this moment he would as rapturously have died if by his death he could have served in his own infinitesimal degree the cause he fought for the hours went on whether swiftly or slowly he did not consider the wind fell and for some minutes a heavy shower of rain plumped vertically into the trench once during it a sudden illumination blazed in the sky and he saw the pebbles in the wall opposite shining with the freshfalling drops there were a dozen rifleshots and he saw the sentry who had just passed brushing the edge of his coat against michaels hand pause and look out through the spyhole close by and say something to himself occasionally he dozed for a little and woke again from dreaming of sylvia into complete consciousness of where he was and of that superb joy that pervaded him by and by these dozings grew longer and the intervals of wakefulness less and for a couple of hours before he was roused he slept solidly and dreamlessly his spell of duty began before dawn and he got up to go his rounds rather stiff and numb and his sleep seemed to have wearied rather than refreshed him in that hour of early morning when vitality burns lowest and the dying part their hold on life the thrill that had possessed him during the earlier hours of the night had died down he knew having once felt it that it was there and believed that it would come when called upon but it had drowsed as he slept and was overlaid by the sense of the grim inexorable side of the whole business a disconcerting bullet was plugged through a spyhole the second after he had passed it it sounded not angry but merely businesslike and michael found himself thinking that shots fired in anger as the phrase went were much more likely to go wide than shots fired calmly that in his sleepy brain did not sound nonsense it seemed to contain some great truth if he could bother to think it out but for that all was quiet again and he had returned to his dugout just noticing that the dawn was beginning to break for the clouds overhead were becoming visible in outline with the light that filtered through them and on their thinner margin turning rosegrey when the alarm of an attack came down the line instantly the huddled sleeping bodies that lay at the side of the trench started into being and in the moments pause that followed michael found himself fumbling at the butt of his revolver which he had drawn out of its case for that one moment he heard his heart thumping in his throat and felt his mouth grow dry with some sudden panic fear that came from he knew not where and invaded him a qualm of sickness took him something gurgled in his throat and he spat on the floor of the trench all this passed in one second for at once he was master of himself again though not master of a savage joy that thrilled himthe joy of this chance of killing those who fought against the peace and prosperity of the world there was an attack coming out of the dark and thank god he was among those who had to meet it he gave the order that had been passed to him and on the word this section of the trench was lined with men ready to pour a volley over the low parapet he was there too wildly excited close to the spyhole that now showed as a luminous disc against the blackness of the trench he looked out of this and in the breaking dawn he saw nothing but the dark ground of the dip in front and the level lines of the german trenches opposite then suddenly the grey emptiness was peopled there sprang from the earth the advance line of the surprise who began hewing a way through the entanglements while behind the silhouette of the trenches was broken into a huddled heaving line of men then came the order to fire and he saw men dropping and falling out of sight and others coming on and yet again others these again fell but others and now he could see the gleam of bayonets came nearer bursting and cutting their way through the wires then from opposite to right and left sounded the crack of rifles and the man next to michael gave one grunt and fell back into the trench moving no more just immediately opposite were the few dozen men whose part it was to cut through the entanglements they kept falling and passing out of sight while others took their places and then for some reason michael found himself singling out just one of these much in advance of the others who was now close to the parapet he was coming straight on him and with a leap he cleared the last line of wire and towered above him michael shot him with his revolver as he stood but three yards from him and he fell right across the parapet with head and shoulders inside the trench and as he dropped michael shouted got him and then he looked it was hermann next moment he had scaled the side of the trench and exerting all his strength was dragging him over into safety the advance of this section who were to rush the trench had been stopped and again from right and left the riflefire poured out on the heads that appeared above the parapet that did not seem to concern him all he had to do that moment was to get hermann out of fire and just as he dragged his legs over the parapet so that his weight fell firm and solid on to him he felt what seemed a sharp tap on his right arm and could not understand why it had become suddenly powerless it dangled loosely from somewhere above the elbow and when he tried to move his hand he found he could not then came a stab of hideous pain which was over almost as soon as he had felt it and he heard a man close to him say are you hit sir it was evident that this surprise attack had failed for five minutes afterwards all was quiet again out of the grey of dawn it had come and before dawn was rosy it was over and michael with his right arm numb but for an occasional twinge of violent agony that seemed to him more like a scream or a colour than pain was leaning over hermann who lay on his back quite still while on his tunic a splash of blood slowly grew larger dawn was already rosy when he moved slightly and opened his eyes lieber gott michael he whispered his breath whistling in his throat good morning old boy chapter xvii three weeks later michael was sitting in his rooms in half moon street where he had arrived last night expecting sylvia since that attack at dawn in the trenches he had been in hospital in france while his arm was mending the bone had not been broken but the muscles had been so badly torn that it was doubtful whether he would ever recover more than a very feeble power in it again in any case it would take many months before he recovered even the most elementary use of it those weeks had been a longdrawn continuous nightmare not from the effect of the injury he had undergone nor from any nervous breakdown but from the sense of that which inevitably hung over him for he knew by an inward compulsion of his mind that admitted of no argument that he had to tell sylvia all that had happened in those ten minutes while the grey morning grew rosy this sense of compulsion was deaf to all reasoning however plausible he knew perfectly well that unless he told sylvia who it was whom he had shot at pointblank range as he leaped the last wire entanglement no one else ever could hermann was buried now in the same grave as others who had fallen that morning his name would be given out as missing from the bavarian corps to which he belonged and in time after the war was over she would grow to believe that she would never see him again but the sheer impossibility of letting this happen though it entailed nothing on him except the mere abstention from speech took away the slightest temptation that silence offered he knew that again and again sylvia would refer to hermann wondering where he was praying for his safety hoping perhaps even that like michael he would be wounded and thus escape from the inferno at the front and it was so absolutely out of the question that he should listen to this try to offer little encouragements wonder with her whether he was not safe that even in his most depressed and shrinking hours he never for a moment contemplated silence certainly he had to tell her that hermann was dead and to account for the fact that he knew him to be dead and in the long watches of the wakeful night when his mind moved in the twilight of drowsiness and fever and pain it was here that a certain temptation entered for it was easy to say and no one could ever contradict him that some man near him that one perhaps who had fallen back with a grunt had killed hermann on the edge of the trench humanly speaking there was no chance at all of that innocent falsehood being disproved in the scurry and wild confusion of the attack none but he would remember exactly what had happened and as he thought of that tossing and turning it seemed to one part of his mind that the innocence of that falsehood would even be laudable be heroic it would save sylvia the horrible shock of knowing that her lover had killed her brother it would save her all that piercing of the iron into her soul that must inevitably be suffered by her if she knew the truth and who could tell what effect the knowledge of the truth would have on her michael felt that it was at the least possible that she could never bear to see him again still less sleep in the arms of the one who had killed her brother that knowledge even if she could put it out of mind in pity and sorrow for michael would surely return and return again and tear her from him sobbing and trembling there was all to risk in telling her the truth sorrow and bitterness for her and for him separation and a lifelong regret were piled up in the balance against the unknown weight of her love indeed there was love on both sides of that balance who could tell how the gold weighed against the gold yet after those drowsy painstreaked nights when the sober light of dawn crept in at the windows then morning after morning michael knew that the inward compulsion was in no way weakened by all the reasons that he had urged it remained ruthless and tender a still small voice that was heard after the whirlwind and the fire for the very reason why he longed to spare sylvia this knowledge namely that they loved each other was precisely the reason why he could not spare her yet it seemed so wanton so useless so unreasonable to tell her so laden with a risk both for him and her that no standard could measure but he no more contemplatedexcept in vain imaginationmaking up some ingenious story of this kind which would account for his knowledge of hermanns death than he contemplated keeping silence altogether it was not possible for him not to tell her everything though when he pictured himself doing so he found himself faced by what seemed an inevitable impossibility though he did not see how his lips could frame the words he knew they had to yet he could not but remember how mere reports in the paper stories of german cruelty and what not had overclouded the serenity of their love what would happen when this news no report or hearsay came to her he had not heard her foot on the stairs nor did she wait for his servant to announce her but a little before her appointed time she burst in upon him midway between smiles and tears all tenderness michael my dear my dear she cried what a morning for me for the first time today when i woke i forgot about the war and your poor arm how goes it oh i will take care but i must and will have you in my arms he had risen to greet her and softly and gently she put her arms round his neck drawing his head to her oh my michael she whispered youve come back to me lieber gott how i have longed for you lieber gott when last had he heard those words he had to tell her he would tell her in a minute or two perhaps she would never hold him like that again he could not part with her at the very moment he had got her you look ever so well michael she said in spite of your wound youre so brown and lean and strong and oh how i have wanted you i never knew how much till you went away looking at her feeling her arms round him michael felt that what he had to say was beyond the power of his lips to utter and yet here in her presence the absolute necessity of telling her climbed like some peak into the ample sunrise far above the darkness and the mists that hung low about it and what lots you must have to tell me she said i want to hear allall suddenly michael put up his left hand and took away from his neck the arm that encircled it but he did not let go of it he held it in his hand i have to tell you one thing at once he said she looked at him and the smile that burned in her eyes was extinguished from his gesture from his tone she knew that he spoke of something as serious as their love what is it she said tell me then he did not falter but looked her full in the face there was no breaking it to her or letting her go through the gathering suspense of guessing it concerns hermann he said it concerns hermann and me the last morning that i was in the trenches there was an attack at dawn from the german lines they tried to rush our trench in the dark hermann led them he got right up to the trench and i shot him i did not know thank god suddenly michael could not bear to look at her any more he put his arm on the table by him and leaning his head on it covering his eyes he went on but his voice up till now quite steady faltered and failed as the sobs gathered in his throat he fell across the parapet close to me he said i lifted him somehow into our trench i was wounded then he lay at the bottom of the trench sylvia and i would to god it had been i who lay there because i loved him just at the end he opened his eyes and saw me and knew me and he saidoh sylvia sylviahe said lieber gott michael good morning old boy and then he died i have told you and at that michael broke down utterly and completely for the first time since the morning of which he spoke and sobbed his heart out while unseen to him sylvia sat with hands clasped together and stretched towards him just for a little she let him weep his fill but her yearning for him would not be withstood she knew why he had told her her whole heart spoke of the hugeness of it then once more she laid her arm on his neck michael my heart she said
