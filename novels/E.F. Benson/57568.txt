produced from images available at the internet archive peter by e f benson author of mike the countess of lowndes square etc illustration colophon cassell and company ltd london new york toronto and melbourne first published peter chapter i the two who mattered were lounging on the cushioned seat in the low window of which the lower panes had been pushed quite up in order to admit the utmost possible influx of air little came in for the afternoon was sultry and windless but every now and then some current moved outside some trickle of comparative coolness from the grass and trees of the green park sufficient to stir the girls hair on this high floor of the house of flats london seemed far remote the isolation as of an aeroplane as of a ship at sea protected them from external intrusion inside the room a party of four were assembled round the tea table the hostess mother of the girl who sat in the window seat was wondering without impatience as was becoming to so chinned and contented a face when mrs alston would cease gesticulating with her sandwich and eat it instead of using it as a conductors baton to emphasize her points in the discourse to which nobody was listening the sandwich had already a large semicircular bite out of it which penetrated well past its centre and one more application if she would only make it to that capacious mouth would render it reasonable to suppose that she had finished her tea mrs heaton herself had done so so also had the stout grey haired man with the varnished face and as for mrs underwood she had long ago drunk her cup of hot water and refused any further nourishment but while mrs alston brandished her crescent of a sandwich and continued talking as if somebody had contradicted her it was impossible to suggest a move to the bridge table that stood ready with new packs and sharpened pencils a couple of yards away to the boy and girl in the window that quartette of persons seemed of supreme unimportance both by reason of their age and of the earnest futility of their conversation they talked eagerly about dull things like politics and prices instead of being flippant in the modern style about interesting things between them and the younger generation there was the great gulf digged by the unrelenting years and set on fire by the war it was not flaring and exploding any longer but lay there in smouldering impassable clinkers high prices and high wages asserted mrs alston thats what is going to be the ruin of the country ive said over and over again why not have an act of parliament to halve the price of food and coal and that sort of thing and another act unless you could get it into the same one to reduce wages by a half also high prices so everybody allows are the cause of high wages and if miners and that sort of person could buy their food and their clothes at half the price they pay for them now there would not be the slightest difficulty in reducing wages by a half instead of multiplying them by two every time that they threaten to strike coal the root of all the trouble is the price of coal reduce the price of coal by half and instantly the price of transport and gas and electricity will go down in a corresponding manner steel too and linen it all depends on coal the english sovereign has to day hardly more than half the buying power it used to have hardly more than half restore it then by reducing the price of everything else including wages including wages mind otherwise you will find yourselves in a fine mess she put the rest of her sandwich into her mouth precisely as mrs heaton had hoped and even foreseen that made her mouth quite full and for the moment she was as dumb as the adder her hostess alert for this psychological occasion gave a short judicial and fulsome summing up addressed to the court in general well dearest mary she said you have made me understand it all now a thing which i never did before so well put was it not mr steel and im sure quite unanswerable we must none of us attempt to argue with dearest mary because she would show us at once how stupid it was of us and i for one hate to be made a fool of what a good explanation quite brilliant so now shall we get to our bridge i expect were all going to the opera to night and so we shall all want to dress early dear me its after half past five already will nobody have any more tea quite sure shall we cut then oh there are nellie and peter in the window wouldnt you like to cut in too dear no mother we shouldnt said nellie the four others swooped to the bridge table with the swift sure flight of homing pigeons and hastily cut their cards in order to give no time for repentance on the part of the two others you and i mr steel said mrs heaton hastily quite sure you wouldnt like to play peter quite said peter gently i should hate it thanks awfully well if youre quite sure you wont my deal i think partner shall it be pennies mr steel had a whimsical idea oughtnt we to halve our points too mary he said like wages and coal for a moment he was sorry he had been so rashly humorous for mrs alston opened her mouth and drew in her breath as if to speak on a public platform to the largest imaginable audience then luckily she found something so remarkable in her hand that her fury for political elucidation was quenched and she devoted the muscles of her athletic mind to considering what she would do if the dealer was so rash as to call no trumps thereafter the great deeps dimly peopled with enemies ready to pounce out of the subaqueous shadows and double you completely submerged the four of them they lit cigarettes as in a dream and smoked them in alternate hells and heavens nellie looked at them once or twice as an ansthetist might look at his patient to see whether he was quite unconscious the third glance was convincing it must be rather sweet to be middle aged peter she said for the next two hours theyll think about nothing but aces and trumps sign of youth said peter why because theyre absorbed like children when you were little you could only think about one thing at a time it might be dentist or it might be hoops but you and i cant think about anything for more than five minutes together or care about anything for more than two i suppose that when youre old you recapture that sort of youthfulness he paused a moment go on tell me about it all he said nellie did not reply at once but began plaiting her fingers together with the little finger on the top they were slender and small like her face which narrowed very rapidly from the ears downwards to a pointed chin loose yellow hair the colour of honey grew low over her forehead and just below it her eyebrows noticeably darker than her hair made high arches giving her face an expression of irony and surprise her forehead ran straight into the line of her nose and a short upper lip held her mouth in imperfect control for it hinted and wondered and was amused and contemptuous as its mood took it now it half smiled now it was half serious but always it only hinted peter apparently grew impatient of her silence and her finger plaiting youre making them look like bananas on a street barrow he observed nellie smoothed them out and gave an appreciative sigh oh i bought two to day she said and ate them in the street i had to throw the skins away and then i was afraid that somebody would slip on them and break his leg so you picked them up again suggested peter no i didnt i was only sorry for anybody who might slip on them i couldnt tell who it was going to be and probably i shouldnt know him get on he said oh about philip well there it was he asked me you see and of course hes rather old but hes tremendously attractive and its so safe and pleasant and i like being adored after all you and i have talked it over often enough and you knew just as well as i did that i was going to accept him if he wanted me nellie suddenly felt that she was justifying what she had done and she did not mean to do that what she had done justified itself by its own inherent good sense she changed her tone and began counting on those slim fingers which just now had introduced the extraneous subject of bananas peter darling she said if his grandfather and an uncle and two children of the uncle die there is no doubt whatever that i shall be a peeress wont that be fun i feel that uncle robert and the two children may easily die theyre the sort of people who do die but i doubt whether grandpapa ever will hes like the man with the white beard do i mean the ancient mariner or the ancient of days who comes in ezekiel peter mainwaring rocked backwards in the window seat with a sudden little explosion of laughter that made all the bridge players look up as if their heads were tied to the same tweaked string then they submerged again not ezekiel anyhow he said its either daniel or coleridge i expect coleridge yes i mean coleridge she said the man who stops the wedding guest wedding guest was what suggested it grandpapa always wanted philip to marry one of those cousins of his who look like tables with drawers in them long legs and bumps on their faces like the handles of the drawers but philip wouldnt peter ran his fingers along the line of his jaw as if to be sure that he had shaved that morning his face for a man of twenty two was ridiculously smooth and hairless it did not much matter whether he had shaved or not naturally philip wouldnt he said but thats got nothing to do with it i dont want to know why philip didnt do something but why you did i want to see your point to do you justice at present i feel upset about it you know quite well that theres only one person you ought to marry you asked nellie feeling that the question was quite unnecessary how clever of you to guess you are clever sometimes oh i know weve talked it over enough and seen how impossible it was but when it comes to your marrying someone else he lit a match and blew it out again i know he said youve got threepence a year and ive got twopence so that in the good old times we should have been able to buy one pound of sugar every christmas even then we should have had nothing to eat with it but what you havent sufficiently reckoned with is the fact that by the time i am a hundred and fifty years old i shall get a pension of a hundred and fifty pounds from the foreign office but its rather a long time to wait nellies eyes suddenly grew fixed and rapt oh peter one moment she whispered look quickly at mammas face when that holy expression comes on it it always means that she is intending to declare no trumps so when im playing against her if its my turn first i always declare one no trumps and then she has to declare two wait one second peter no trumps said mrs heaton there i told you so said nellie yes it is rather long to wait though i dont mean to say that a hundred and fifty isnt a very pleasant age dear the people in genesis usually lived five hundred years before they married and begat sons and daughters anyhow i shall be a widow before youre a hundred and fifty and then we shall be engaged for three hundred and fifty years more and then we shall totter to the altar i cant help talking drivel its all too serious to take seriously by the way i shall be richer than you eventually for when mamma dies i shall have two thousand a year but that wont be for two thousand years we have been born too soon peter peter thought this not worth answering but lifting one of his knees nursed it between his clasped hands in silence for her loose honey coloured hair he had a crisp coal blackness he was tall for her small slim stature and his lips were set to definite purposes whereas hers were malleable to adapt themselves to any emotion that might waywardly blow on her but both in compensation for differences that were complementary were triumphantly alike in the complete soullessness of their magnificent youth without violation of any internal principle they might either of them shoot up singing with the lark or pad and prowl with the ruthless hunger of the tiger or burrow with the mole they were satyr and hamadryad some ancient and eternally young embodiment of life with whim to take the place of conscience and the irresponsible desire of wild things to do duty for duty and impulse to take the place of reason each too had developed to an almost alarming degree that modern passion for introspection which is an end in itself and like a barren tree yields no fruit in the ways of action or renunciation peter hugged his knee and his eye grew hazy and unfocused in meditation am i in love with you do you think he asked at length she laughed quite disregarding the ears of the bridge players with peter she was more herself than with anyone else or even than when alone oh thats so like you she said and so wonderfully like me certainly youre not in love with me youre not in love with anybody you never have been you never will be youre fonder of me than of anybody else but thats a very different thing but how do you know im not in love with you he asked i may be youre not so unattractive why shouldnt i be in love with you its obvious you arent to begin with you dont feel the smallest jealousy of philip besides though you so kindly say that im not so unattractive youre the one person who really sees and notes and mentions my imperfections you wouldnt be so critical of me if you were in love and then as i said youre not jealous of philip good lord how could i be jealous of philip asked he i should have to want to be philip before i could be jealous of him and i wouldnt be philip even as things stand for anything in the world besides you dont really think him so tremendously attractive though you said so just now you said that out of pure conventionality not out of conviction some momentary perplexity like a cloud on a sunny windy day of spring bowled its shadow over her face and creased a soft perpendicular furrow between her eyebrows peter i think i want to become conventional she said and if you wish i will confess i was practising for it when i said that oh my dear were all human cast in a mould and put in a cage if you dont mind mixed metaphors im going to marry in the ordinary way just because girls do marry mamma married so did my two grandmammas and four great grandmammas and eight great great grandmammas in fact the further you go back the commoner marriage seems to have been some awful human hereditary spell has been cast on me peter leaned forward bright eyed and faun like break it he said exorcise it spells dont exist except for those who allow themselves to be bound by them the fact is we all weave our own spells but if i did refuse now what then said she if you dont obey conventions you must have conviction to take their place and i havent got any besides if i dont marry i shall become an old maid unless i die young oh we are all in a trap we girls there are three awful alternatives to choose from and i dislike them all i dont want to die young but if i live to be sixty ive got to be a grandmother or a stringy old maid youve got to be stringy anyhow at sixty said peter not at all grandmothers are usually plump and comfortable it is great aunts who are stringy and grandmothers remain young i notice whereas elderly maiden ladies are only sprightly i think that its because they cling to youth and theres nothing so ageing as to cling to anything if you want to retain anything the best plan is to drop it and then it clings to you instead thats rather ingenious said peter you may go on about it for a minute i was going to its perfectly true all the people who dont eat potatoes and sweets for fear of getting fat become elephants like mamma who lives on cracknel biscuits does she said peter with deep interest how wonderful of her and all the people who take immense care of themselves die at the age of forty because they are clinging to life while those who break every ordinance of health never die at all and all the people who lay themselves out to be brilliant are crashing bores oh yes proved said peter lets go on to something else whats to happen to me when you marry nothing said nellie why should it youll go on being quite different from anybody else thats a career in itself you arent human anyhow however many great grandmammas you may have had youre a wild thing partly domesticated and when youre tired of us all you go waving your tail and walking in the wet woods and telling nobody kipling you know then you come back rather sleepy and pleased and allow us to put a blue riband round your neck and tickle you under the chin and then you lie down on a cushion in front of the fire and purr you dont purr at us though you purr at yourself lor said peter all that about me nellie pushed back her hair from her forehead and again plaited her fingers together but this time it was no deliberative meditative process but a swift unconscious action yes my dear and theres more too she said its my swan song remember for soon i am going to become ordinary and conventional i used to go in the wet woods too you know though we never met each other there but that has been the bond between us up till now we have been completely independent youre going to remain so but not i oh peter there was a bond my dear do you think that im rather mad i have serious doubts about it myself you always were rather mad said he but go on sing your swan song then dont look as if you had taken a guinea stall to hear me she said where had i got to oh yes there was a bond you know it yourself ive never been conscious of anybody else as ive been conscious of you nor have you ever been conscious of anyone else as youve been conscious of me youve never been in the least in love with me nor have i with you but were the same kind of person and one doesnt often see the same kind of person as oneself do you understand at all or am i simply reading out of my own book he was silent a moment nellie would you marry me if i were rich he asked she made a gesture of impatience how on earth can i tell she said if you were rich you would be quite a different person no i shouldnt oh peter how stupid you are she said and how frightfully victorian that is so shallow wealth is just as much part of a man or a woman as brains or beauty i dont say that a girl loves a man for his brains or his money or his beauty but they all make a part of him wealth isnt an accident its an attribute a poor man im not talking about you and me but only speaking in the abstract may be the same in character and charm as a rich man but what a gulf money makes between them let one man be poor and another his absolute double in every way be rich they cease to be doubles at once but if you happened to love the costermonger began peter we can leave that out because neither of us has the slightest idea what love means how about the bond you spoke of then asked he hasnt that got anything to do with it she considered this and then laid her hand on his arm if i could choose now this minute she said in what relationship we should stand to each other i would choose you as my brother i havent got one i should like to have one tremendously and yet if i might have it all just the way i liked i think i should have you for my sister i dont so much want you to take care of me as i want to take care of you i want oh come now said peter its true though they had turned themselves about in the window seat so as to secure for this surprising conversation a greater privacy from the party at the bridge table and were leaning out of the window a hundred feet below piccadilly roared and rattled but here the clatter of it was shorn of its sharp edges it was as if a stir of bees was swarming in some hive down there seen like this from above passengers and vehicles alike were but crawling dots and blots everything from the swiftest motor down to the laziest loiterer seemed to be drowsily and soundlessly sauntering often had peter and nellie leaned out here looking on the traffic at the base of the cliff capturing for themselves a certain sense of isolation even leaning out they could see nothing of the precipitous cliff side of the house for a couple of feet below the window a stone cornice jutted out some ten or twelve inches and beyond the edge of that the nearest visible objects below were the tops of motor buses and the hats of the foot passengers along the pavements so still was the air that now when peter flicked the ash off his cigarette it floated down still cohering till it dwindled into invisibility he followed its fall with that detached intentness which the surface mind gives to the ticking of a clock or the oscillation of some flower head when the whole psychic attention is focused elsewhere and it seemed that nellie as far as her surface mind went was trotting in harness with him for though he had not hinted at what occupied his eyes scarcely knowing it himself she was equally intent ive lost sight of it peter she said breaking the silence of a whole minute of what he asked of your cigarette end you were watching it too dont pretend that you werent well if i was what then he asked nothing particular i only felt you were watching it just the bond he shifted himself again hitherto as they leaned out his left shoulder touched hers now he broke the contact i think thats about the extent of the bond he said and your marrying philip shows precisely what sort of value you put on it youve made it clearer than you know for youve defined your feelings for me as being a desire to have a brother or rather a sister to take care of i dont think thats worth much you defined it further by saying that you couldnt tell whether you would marry me or not if i were rich because if i were i should be a quite different person if the quality of the bond would be affected by that it must be of remarkably poor quality and youre quite right to break it when you began talking about the bond i thought you might be going to say something interesting something i didnt know something that when you stated it i should recognize to be true if thats all your swan has got to sing it might as well have been a goose nellies eyebrows elevated themselves up under the loose yellow of her hair peter dear are you quarrelling with me she asked yes no no im not quarrelling but the whole thing is such a bore wheres my tail and where are the wet woods she leaned her chin on her hands that lay along the window sill i wish you were in love with me she said im extremely glad that im not said he otherwise i suppose i should want to be philip or as the madrigal says some other favoured swain but for you to talk about a bond between us is the absolute limit you want everything your own way and expect everybody else to immolate himself thankfully and ecstatically on your beastly altar so do you murmured nellie we all do i how do you make that out demanded peter because you object to my marrying philip when you havent the smallest desire to have me yourself if you knew that i should say yes supposing you asked me to jilt philip and marry you you wouldnt ask me to you want me to marry nobody and not to marry me yourself thats not good enough you know peters mouth lengthened itself into a smile and broadened into a laugh its a putrid business he said why shouldnt i take a neat header from the window and have done with it im twenty two and already i think the whole affair is rot and if it doesnt amuse me now when is it going to amuse me it was even more amusing during the war when one came back for a fortnights leave before going out to that hell again one did grab at pleasure then because in all probability one would be blown to bits very soon afterwards but now that one is not going to be blown to bits very soon afterwards the whole seasoning has gone out of it no not quite i want to be admired what is love good lord what is love as i havent the slightest idea the best thing i can do is to grab at pleasures or the worst suggested nellie rather sententiously now get off the high horse said peter or rather dont attempt to get on it you cant any more than i lets be comfortable marry your silly philip and ill ill shall i take to drink no that wouldnt do for people would say i was trying to drown my despair at your marriage i havent got feelings of that sort and i should hate anybody to think that i had i loathe being pitied anyhow and to be pitied for something you dont suffer from would be intolerable and though you will remain just the same to me after youre married and i shall certainly remain the same our relations will be altered nellie let her eyes flit over him never quite alighting they skimmed over his crisp hair over the handsome smooth soulless profile over his shoulders over the knee he was nursing over the hiatus where white skin showed between his rucked up trouser and a drooping sock at this moment she with the knowledge of the definite step that she had taken in life by engaging herself to philip beaumont felt far older and more experienced than he she anyhow could look ahead and see a placid prosperous life in front of her whereas peter a year older than she was still as experimental as a boy all the same if he wanted anything he had remarkable assiduity in the pursuit of it until he caught it but nothing beyond the desire of the moment was to him worth bothering about her own prudence her own commitment of herself she knew to be a development of to day and yesterday and now it seemed suddenly to have aged and consolidated her but she had no answer for that voice crying in the wilderness what is love or was there some sort of signpost by the wayside enveloped in mist she passed over that point if it really all seems to you so putrid she said i cant imagine why you dont as you say take a header into the street but youve no intention of doing anything of the sort you would firmly resist any attempt of mine to tip you out you like life quite passably as it is you know and also you do expect something more from it in fact i never saw anyone so thoroughly unlikely to give up living or to run any risk that could reasonably be avoided you say its a putrid business but really you find it a pleasant one peter sighed oh yes it will have to do he said dont tip me out nellie but dont on the other hand think that i cling so desperately to life not desperately but instinctively it would be silly of anybody to throw up a hand that may contain some glorious ace without looking very carefully through it everyone goes on playing and clutching at the new deals until he is sure that there isnt an ace in the pack for him indeed its when youve found the ace that you dont value the rest of the hand so much i dont follow explain said peter well this kind of thing for instance if you found the ace that is to say if you fell tremendously in love you might not care about the rest of the hand if the adorable was in my bedroom two windows off and if she was locked in there and if the house was on fire any more ifs asked peter not one but supposing all these things you would instantly get out on to that cornice at peril of your life and shuffle your way along it you would have to be with her you wouldnt give two thoughts as to what might happen to you peter thought this over i should be a consummate ass then he remarked a fellow with a grain of sense would go down the passage and bash the door in but lets pretend that for some reason you couldnt if the only way of reaching the room was along the cornice you would go peter looked at the ledge and if i got there in safety what then he asked i couldnt carry her back along the ledge but that wouldnt prevent your going said she whatever the risk to yourself was and however useless your going was you would go peter was silent a moment frowning i feel as if all this has happened before he said do you know that feeling did we ever sit here before and talk about just this not that i remember no im sure we never have isnt it odd that sensation does it seem to you like remembrance of a previous occasion or a presentiment of a future one or a slightly faulty action of the two lobes of the brain said peter what were we talking about aces yes thats what i mean about throwing the rest of your hand away for the sake of an ace peter looked at his watch i must go he said ive got to get home to dress and rush back to the ritz to dine early before the opera oh not just yet said she but i wish you wouldnt live in south kensington why do you peter had a direct glance and a direct answer for this because its cheaper living with my father and mother than being on my own he said also well she asked i was going to say because they like having me with them said he but i dont think thats true so i didnt say it i mean if i had plenty of money i should take a flat of my own quite regardless of whether they liked to have me with them nellie gave a little sigh with a click of impatience at the end of it theres an odd kind of honesty about you she said you state that sort of thing quite baldly whereas i should conceal it if i had been you i should have said that i lived at home because my mother liked having me with her it wouldnt have been true but i should have said it very likely by saying it often i should have got to believe it nobody else would have remarked peter youre rather a brute my dear said she go away to south kensington im going but about aces for one second more have you found your ace nellie dont bother to answer that is spoken like a rather spiteful woman was nellies perfectly justifiable rejoinder maybe im your spiteful sister said peter he walked gracefully and gently over to the card table good bye mrs heaton he said nellie and i have had a lovely talk i hope youve won every rubber and three aces thirty said mrs heaton good bye dear peter i suppose youll be at the opera to night parsifal my deal so it is chapter ii peter descended from these heights into the hot dusty well of the streets and soon was on his way home to dress and return to the ritz where an early dinner preceded the opera and any other diversions that might present themselves on this sweltering june evening the top of a bus was a cooler progression than a taxi besides advancing the sacred cause of economy which he had just confessed was more real to him than that of filial piety and at hyde park corner he could catch a conveyance that would deposit him not fifty yards from his fathers house coolness and economy were sufficiently strong of themselves to make him board it with alacrity and the detachment of a front seat just suited the meditative mood which his talk with nellie had induced peter knew himself and her pretty well and with the admirable contributions she had made to their discussion there was little to puzzle out but much to appraise and estimate the notion that the news of her engagement had been a blow of any sharp or stunning quality could be at once dismissed for never had he known so well as when she earlier in the day had communicated the news of her engagement to him over the telephone that was like her how whole heartedly he was not in love with her and how unintelligibly alien to him as she had pointed out was that emotion during the last year which had witnessed a very decent flowering of intimacy between him and her there had never been on either side the least attempt at love making their relations had been wholly free from sentiment and not once had either of them tripped or stuttered over the foreign use of love language but in ways wholly unsentimental they had certainly arrived at some extremely close relation of intimacy there had emphatically been a bond between them which to his mind her engagement if it did not actually loosen it would shift so to speak on to a new place the harness must be worn elsewhere if it was to be maintained he at any rate must accustom himself to its new adjustment she had defined that comradeship this afternoon in a way that was rather surprising for the ideal relation of him to her apparently was that of a brother or with greater precision that of a sister that had not struck him before but even when first presented it did not in the least puzzle him indeed it satisfactorily accounted for that elimination of sex which had always marked their intimacy she had not sought the male element in him nor he in her the female so far he was in complete agreement with the casual conclusion they had jointly arrived at but at that point peter detected the presence of something that seemed to show a lurking fallacy somewhere for he had no doubt that if he had been rich he would before now have proposed to her and in spite of her provision that since riches were an attribute of a man and not an external accident they turned him into a different person and that thus she could not tell whether she would have accepted him or not he did not for himself believe that she would have hesitated in doing so finally as material to meditate upon came her firm statement that though peter did not want or intend to marry her he objected to anybody else doing so with the extreme frankness with which he habitually judged any criticism on himself he instantly admitted that there was a great deal to be said for nellies assertion when it was stated brutally like that he recognized the justice of her outline she might have made a caricature of him but her sketch contained salient features the identity of which as he contemplated this scribble of her inspired pencil he could not disclaim without doubt she had caught a likeness more tersely she had got him even as he acknowledged that he felt a resentment that she had so unerringly comprehended him and shown him to himself he enjoyed rather than otherwise his own dissection of himself without bias or malice but he felt less sure that when nellie was the dissector he welcomed so deft an exposure the retrospect had been sufficiently absorbing to make him unaware that somewhere in knightsbridge the top of the bus had become a strenuous goal for travellers every seat was occupied and beside him a young man had planted himself in the vacant place and was talking to a girl who had plumped herself into a seat two tiers behind his peter instantly jumped up let me change places with your young lady he said and then youll be together and talk more conveniently the change was made with a tribute of simpering gratitude on the part of the young lady and peter with laurels of popularity round his straw hat took the single place he knew perfectly well that he had disturbed himself from no motive of kindliness he did not in the least want to please either the man or the girl his motive had been only to appear pleasant to obtain cheaply and fraudulently the certificate of being a kind gentleman for himself he did not care two straws if the pair of sundered lovers bawled at each other from sundered seats and then as he took his new place it struck him that the quality which had prompted the transference of himself from one seat on the top of a bus to another was precisely the same as had led him to resent nellies dissection of him in the one case his vanity was gratified in the other his vanity was hurt thats it he said to himself and mentally he prinked like a girl in the glass that had so unerringly shown him to himself yet it did not show him an aspect of himself that was in any way surprising either for pleasure or distaste for he knew well how prolific a spring of native vanity was in him he would always take an infinity of trouble in order to appear admirable or on the other hand to conceal what was not so admirable he would always inconvenience himself in order to appear kind exert himself to appear amusing bore himself while preserving the brightness of an attentive and interested eye in order to confirm his reputation for being sympathetic but though vanity was the root of such efforts there was at any rate no trace of it in his acknowledgment of it he never deluded himself into thinking that he suffered fools gladly because he liked them or desired to secure for them a pleasant half hour in which they could tediously inflict themselves on him he suffered them with the show of gladness in order to be thought kind and agreeable in the abstract and in the concrete to pick up the gleanings of welcome and entertainment which for such as him lie so thick on the fields of human intercourse when the great machines have gone by he had no reason to complain of these gleanings there was no one among the youth of london who was more consistently in request or who more merited his mild harvestings in a rather fatigued and casual generation tired with the strain of the last five years and now suddenly brought to book after the irresponsibility of wartime when for all young men each leave snatched from the scythe of the french front might easily be their last there was a certain license given peter had always been a shining exception to such slack social conduct of life he did not as he had told nellie expect much from it but as long as you were on tap it was undeniably foolish not to present yourself presentably your quality was certainly enhanced by a little foam a little effervescence that nice mr peter always so polite and pleasant was his reward and at this moment nellies divination of his true attitude towards her engagement was his punishment the bus hummed and droned along the brompton road there was still a solid stretch before it halted just opposite the side street which was his goal and there was time to consider her further criticism that he went off waving his tail into the wet woods and saying nothing to anybody what had she meant exactly by that he had at any rate his own consciousness that she had hit on something extremely real and vitally characteristic of him surely she meant his aloofness from any intimate surrender of himself the self sufficiency that neither gave nor sought strong affection he had acknowledged the vanity as of a be ribanded cat and now he added to that his desire for material comfort a quiet determined selfishness and the reservation to himself of solitary expeditions in the wet woods with a waving tail probably she meant no more than that and though peter quite acknowledged the justice of these definitions he again felt a certain resentment against her clear sightedness she had a touch of these defects and qualities herself it was that which made the bond between them peter let himself into his fathers house in the grilling dusty street nearly opposite the oratory with the anticipation of finding a speedy opportunity for a domestic exhibition of vanity for he felt sure that something ludicrous or tiresome and uncomfortable would await him something he would certainly tolerate with bland serenity and agreeableness the house the front of which had been baking in the sun all the afternoon was intolerably hot and stuffy the door at the head of the kitchen stairs had as generally happened been left open and the nature of the dinner which would presently ascend could be confidently predicted beyond at the back of the hall the door into his fathers studio was also open and a languid odorous tide of oil paint and virginian tobacco made a peculiarly deadly combination with kitchen smells and indicated that mr mainwaring had been occupied with his audacious labours just now he was engaged on the perpetration of a series of cartoons suitable or not for mural decoration the practical difficulty if these ever attained completion would be the discovery of the wall that should be large enough to hold them indeed the great wall of china seemed the only destination which though remote was sufficiently spacious the subject of them was the european war from a psychic no less than from a sanguinary point of view for the series of which the sketches were complete started with a prodigious cartoon which depicted satan whispering odious counsels into the ear of the emperor william ii who wore a smile of bland imperial ambition at the very attractive prospects presented by the father of lies in the background an army corps of the hosts of hell stretched from side to side of the picture like some leering malevolent flower bed thereafter the series was to traverse the annals of all kinds of frightfulness zeppelins dropped bombs on sunday schools submarine crews agape with laughter shot down the survivors from torpedoed liners all these existed only in sketches the first however as peter knew was rapidly approaching completion on the monstrous scale and took up the whole end of the studio neither peter nor his mother had as yet been permitted a glimpse of it the full blast of its withering force so mr mainwaring had planned was on completion to smite and stun them he had heard peters entrance into the house for an outburst of jubilant yodelling came to the young mans ears as he put down his hat tirra lirra tirra lirra sang out the boisterous voice is that my peter ha de ah de ho peters eyebrows went up his mouth slackened to a long sigh and his slim shoulders shrugged but his voice all of him that at present could convey his mood to his father was brisk and cordial hallo father he said do you want me yes my dear come in a moment i have something to show you peter closed the door of the kitchen stairs and went into the studio his father was standing high on a stepladder in front of his canvas dashing the last opulent brushful of sombre colour on to the thundercloud which portending war formed so effective a background of prussian blue to the emperors head he painted with swoops and dashes such things as finish were out of place in designs for the wall of china even as peter entered he skipped down from the steps of the ladder and laid aside his palette and brushes finito e ben finito he cried congratulate me my peter i made the last stroke as you entered an added horror is it not so in that cloud ha you have not seen it yet sit down and drink it in for five minutes does it make you hot and miserable to look at yes youll see more of that cloud and of what it holds for distracted europe before i come to the end of my cartoons bombs and torpedoes are in that cloud my peter devastation and destruction and damnation he struck a splendid attitude in front of the tremendous canvas and with a sweep of his hand caused his thick crop of long grey hair to stand out in billows round his head physically as regards height and fineness of feature peter certainly owed a good deal to his father for john mainwarings head with its waves of hair its high colour its rich exuberance was like some fine manuscript now enriched with gilt and florid illuminations of which peter was so to speak the neat delicate text unadorned by these flamboyant additions peters vanity doubtless came from the same paternal strain for never was there anyone more superbly conscious of his own supreme merits than his father highly ornamental he knew that his mission was not only to adorn the palace of art with his work but to enlighten the dimness of the world with his blazing presence like most men who are possessed of extraordinary belief in themselves of high colour and exuberant spirits he was liable to accesses of profound gloom when with magnificent gestures he would strike his forehead and wail over his own wasted life and the futility of human endeavour these attacks which were very artistic and studied performances chiefly assailed him when the royal academy had intimated that some stupendous canvas of his awaited removal before varnishing day then with bewildering rapidity his spirits would mount to unheard of altitudes again and brush in hand he would exclaim that he asked no more of the world than to allow him to pursue his art unrecognized and unhonoured like millet or corot his temperament in fact was that of some boisterous spring day which opening with bright sunshine turns to snow in the middle of the afternoon and draws to a close in lambent serenity and whether exalted depressed or normal he was simply though slangily the prince of bounders he clapped his hand on peters shoulder i need not point out to you the merits or indeed the defects of my composition he said for my peter inherits something of his fathers perceptions look at it then once more and tell me if my picture recalls to you the method even perhaps the inspiration of any master not like me unknown to fame who my boy if we allow ourselves for a moment to believe in psychic possession who i ask you or rather to cast my sentence differently to whom do i owe the realization of terror of menace of spiritual horror which ever so faintly smoulders in my canvas he folded his arms awaiting a reply and peter cudgelled his brains in order to make his answer as agreeable as possible the name of blake occurred to him but he remembered that of late his father had been apt to decry this artist for poverty of design and failure to render emotional vastness then with great good luck his eye fell on some photographic reproductions from the ceiling of the sistine chapel that decorated the wall of the studio and he felt he had guessed right no one but michael angelo he said thats all the influence i can see father mr mainwaring rested his chin on his hand and was gazing at his work with frowning seer like scrutiny it was difficult to realize that it was he who had yodelled so jubilantly just now curious that you should have said that peter he said in a deep dreamy voice for days past as i worked it has seemed to me that ma master of art as well as michael angelo note you that ma was standing by me at times indeed it seemed that not i but another controlled my brush i do not say he approved no no that he was pleased with me but he was there my boy so if there is any merit in my work i beseech you to attribute it not to me but to him it was as if i was in a trance he closed his eyes for a moment and bowed his head and then as if at the last amen of some solemn service he came out of the dim cathedral into sunlight your mother he said we must not forget her in this great moment is she in tirra lirra ha de ah de ho my own he pranced to the door ringing the bell as he passed and repeated his yodelling cries from upstairs a quiet thin voice gave some flat echo of his salutation from below a hot parlourmaid opened the door of the kitchen stairs and set free a fresh gale of roastings three glasses he said to the latter three glasses please and the decanter of port maria mia come down my dear and if you love me keep shut your lustrous eyes and take my hand and i will guide you to the place i reserve for you so eyes shut and no cheating mrs mainwaring small in stature with a porcelain neatness about her as of a dresden shepherdess suffered herself to be led into the studio preserving the scrupulous honesty of closed eyelids by her side her rococo husband looked more than ever like some preposterous dancing master and if it was correct to attribute to him peters inherited vanity it was equally right to derive from the young mans mother that finish and precision which characterized his movements and his manners easily too though with a shade more subtlety a psychologist might have conjectured where peters habit of walking in the wet woods and telling nobody was derived from for it was not hard to guess that mrs mainwarings tranquil self possession her smiling serene indulgence of her husbands whim was the result of a quality firm and deeply rooted self repression had perhaps become a habit for her conduct seemed quite effortless but in that tight thin lipped mouth gently smiling there was something inscrutably independent she was like that secret and self contained because she chose to be like that her serenity her collectedness were the mask she chose to wear thus probably peters inheritance from her was of more durable stuff than the vanity he owed to his father for how if his mother had not been somehow adamantine could she have lived for nearly a quarter of a century with this flamboyant partner and yet have neither imbibed one bubble of his effervescence nor lost any grain of her own restraint indeed she must have been like some piece of quartz for ever dashed along by the turbulence of his impetuous flood and yet all the effect that this buffeting and bruising had produced on her had been but to polish and harden her she went precisely where the current dashed her but remained solid and small and impenetrable such was her relation to the bounding extravagance of her husband he swept her along quite unresisting but never parting from her self contained integrity and all his whirlings and waterfalls had never stripped one atom off her nor roughened her surface to him she appeared transparently clear though as a matter of fact not only had he never seen into her but actually he had never seen her at all he bounced her about demanding now homage when the exuberance of creation was his now sympathy when the rejection of a picture by the royal academy made him a despairing pessimist but she never varied with his feverish temperature and on the surface at any rate remained of an unchangeable coolness his trumpets never intoxicated her small pink ear his despair of himself and the world in general never came within measurable distance of sullying her serenity any more than a thunderstorm disturbs the effulgence of a half moon that neither waxes nor wanes she still continued calmly shining behind his clouds as was obvious when those clouds had discharged their violence john mainwaring never dreamed of considering what possibly might lie below that finished surface it was enough for him that she should always be ready to pay a scentless homage to his achievements or sit quietly like a fixed star above the clouds of despair that occasionally darkened his day she was maria mia my beloved when he was pleased with himself and when otherwise it was enough that she should repeat at intervals fancy their rejecting your picture i am sure there are hundreds in the exhibition not half so good to peter she was an enigma to which he never now attempted or desired to find the key she seemed to him quite impervious to external influences behind that high wall of her reserve nothing so far as he knew roused emotion in her nothing excited nothing depressed her sometimes when a boy he had gone to her with a trouble to confide and she would say how tiresome for you dear and perhaps suggest some sensible course of action but neither his troubles nor her own if she had any seemed to touch her emotions while on the other hand if there was something agreeable to communicate if his father sold a picture or peter had the announcement of promotion in the foreign office her sympathy and pleasure if she felt any were just as iced as her condolence had been the event to peters apprehension that most had power to move her was the fact that somebody had left open the door at the top of the kitchen stairs when that was quite shut and when all household cares had their sunset after dinner her habitual mode of self employment was to read a page or two of a novel returning it to the library next day and then to take some sort of railway guide and scan the advertisements of hotels situated in agreeable places on the south coast or among the derbyshire highlands often and often had peter returned from dinner to find his mother thus employed his father when in the throes of creation went early to bed in order to be fresh and spry for the light of the morning hours but she slept badly and slept best if she went late to bed there she would be then when peter latch keyed himself into the house on his return from dining out or even occasionally when he returned far later from a dance with the bradshaw in her hand open among the advertisements of hotels she would put a paper knife in the leaves to keep her place while she exchanged a few words with him then when he went to bed she would resume her reading quite naturally and warrantably he had always considered this a sad narcotic exercise on her part producing it was to be hoped the drowsiness which she was wooing a more promising device for dulling the activity of the brain than reading about unknown hotels at unvisited places could hardly be desired and so reasonable a process provoked no curiosity on his part but the door at the top of the kitchen stairs was the most active of her interests and took precedence in her mind of any mood of her husbands so when to day he led her with a prancing processional movement to a throne of spanish brocade at a suitable focusing distance from the finished cartoon she with nostrils open though with shut eyes gave the door to the kitchen stairs the first claim on her attention that door has been left open again she said how careless burrows is please shut it my dear i will keep my eyes tightly shut it struck peter at this moment that both he and his mother treated his father as if he had been a child they both played his games treating them with due seriousness lest they should damp the excited pleasure of the young she was playing now without collusion for led in as she had been with closed eyes she had no idea that peter was present then faintly up the kitchen stairs came the jingle of the glasses and burrows entered with the tray that had been ordered once more leaving that fatal door agape by some exercise of domestic intuition mrs mainwaring divined the sort of thing going on round her and with eyes still honourably closed said be sure you close the door at the top of the stairs burrows when you go down again john mainwaring with a wealth of gesticulation in order to enjoin silence on peter and with much stealthiness of action completed his festive preparations demanding from his wife steadiness of hand and no questions he thrust between her fingers a brimming glass of port took one himself and filled a third for peter in obedience to his pantomime peter stood on one side of his enthroned mother and elevated his glass open your dear blue eyes maria mia exclaimed john mainwaring and before you say a single word drink to your husbands offering to art mrs mainwaring opened her eyes and found as she had already guessed from previous experience her brimming glass i couldnt possibly drink all that my dear she said but i will sip it with pleasure before i say anything there dear me what a fine great picture all success to it so thats what has kept you so busy all these days when i wasnt allowed to come into your studio oh theres peter are you going to dine at home dear i thought you said you were going out ive only come home to dress said he i see now let me look at your fathers picture why theres the german emperor and what a quantity of other people dear me and who is that whispering to the emperor what a horrid expression he has the artist drank his glass of port at a gulp and at another the rest of hers horrid i should think it was if you had said devilish you would have been even more on the bullseye now you shall be our molires housemaid speak voice of the british public tell me and peter what you see before you mrs mainwaring with the aid of her glasses and the slight hint already given was perfectly certain that it must be satan who was whispering to the emperor and that all those dreadful faces behind must have something to do with him then there was that huge dark cloud in the background the emperor and satan she said with a sort of placid excitement like an adult trying to guess a childs riddle now wait a minute my dear yes im sure that dreadful thundercloud behind is the war and if the emperor wouldnt listen to satan it would go away but hes looking pleased and proud he is listening i suspect that satan is telling him that he will win the war and be emperor of the earth as youve always said he would have been if the germans had won well i do think its clever of you to have made me think of all that such a few weeks too to paint such a big picture how well you kept your secret you only told me that you were very busy and that i mustnt come into your studio i never thought that when you allowed me in again i should see anything so large and remarkable most striking isnt it peter splendid said peter then he wondered if he had put enough conviction into his voice to satisfy the gourmandise of his father quite splendid he said rather louder then it was mrs mainwarings turn in this game and its only the first of a series said she you must send it to some exhibition at once john in order to make room for the rest so large is it not it fills up all the end of the studio such an important picture dear me how wicked the emperor looks and what will the next picture be war picture of war allegorical shells bursting into shapes of devilish malignity he leaned on the back of the throne regarding the picture intently it will kill me painting the rest of them he said with a fell intensity ive got to go through the hell of it all myself before i can paint them the calm of mrs mainwarings voice was untouched by this gloomy prospect no dear it wont kill you she said consolingly thats your artistic temperament you will have a good holiday afterwards you must be sure to do that i see the other pictures will all come out of that dreadful thundercloud such a poetical idea and i hope youll have a picture of peace for the last one everything quite serene again and the thundercloud vanished and no emperor at all unless you paint a very little figure of him in the background to show how small he has become just him in the background somewhere in holland john mainwaring left his domestic position leaning on the throne and strode up and down the studio ah that intolerable happy ending he said thats the convention that spoils all art arts a stern bitter business you mustnt expect to find a bit of sugar at the bottom of your cup art as the greeks said is meant to move pity and terror mrs mainwaring stepped from her throne well i shall think of a peaceful picture for myself then she said and when i have looked at all yours i shall imagine my own after all the war is over and its had a happy ending for us since the germans have been beaten and peter has come back from it all safe and sound thats my ending he projected his fine grey hair again with a dexterous sweep of the hand well well he said as if he was an adult playing with a child whereas certainly the relation was the other way about i will do my best for you maria but i make no promise mind remember that as peter started off again for the various entertainments of the evening he tried to imagine himself in serious sympathy with either of his parents and ruinously failed beginning with his father he surveyed with the critical clear sightedness of his terribly sensible nature those hysterical daubings of paint those mysteries as to what his father was engaged on those prancing port wine ceremonies when his labour was finished that crystal confidence never clouded in the worth of his fatuous achievements long ago it had soaked into his soul that his father was a magnificent buffoon who decking himself in the habiliments of hamlet had no idea that instead of being engaged in heroic drama he was a figure in a farce so outrageous that you could not really laugh at him you could only marvel had his pictures every one of them been masterpieces his own enthusiasm over them would have verged on the grotesque as it was they were preposterous and childish performances inspiring the observer with pity and terror for the perpetrator rather than in the sense of aristotle whom his father so often quoted for the works themselves how was it possible to feel sympathy with one whose impenetrable egoism burned radiantly unconsumed like that yet while he rejected that possibility peter found himself somehow envying the temperament that transmuted life for its owner into an endless orgy and carouse even the deepest despairs into which reaction plunged his father were psychical feasts to him served up with the same sauce of transcendental egoism as were his raptures that was like some pungent essential oil of so ammoniacal an aroma that it pervaded its whole accessible atmosphere no neutral quality on the part of others no individual indifference was permitted to exist or if it existed it was either wholly unnoticed or if noticed sublimely pitied peters father so it struck the young man galloped through life like a ramping and a roaring lion the king of the beasts it was no manner of good to attempt to sympathize with so predatory an animal and from the thought of his father peter switched off to the thought of his mother who was the habitual prey there he was confronted with the mild enigma of which he had not the faintest comprehension and for the hundredth time guessing out of a dubious incurious twilight he wondered if there was could be anything to comprehend he tried to sum up his knowledge of her she ordered dinner she wore day and night some family inheritance of her own of splendid pearls she read advertisements in railway guides of hotels on cornish rivieras and derbyshire switzerlands that she should order dinner and wear her own pearls was an accidental happening because she was mistress of a house and had some pearls but beyond that she receded as far as peter was concerned into a dreamland without logic indeed as he devoted his mind to her now the most illogical thing about her was that for twenty three years she had contrived to live with his father and had preserved a certain personality of her own it seemed frankly impossible that anyone who had lived so long with that maniacal egoist should not have been in any way affected by him but there she was his father had neither crushed her nor vitalized her and whatever her real personality might be peter felt sure that the ramping and the roaring lion had not invaded an atom of it if his father sustained himself on the flamboyance of his own existence she none the less was self sufficient demanding neither sympathy nor comprehension from others the chasm that yawned between himself and his father was a mere rabbit scrape compared to the abyss on the other side of which there sat his mother delicate and immovable covered with hoar frost and decked with her pearls and reading her railway guide peter owed that deep seated vanity of his to his father to his mother he owed that aloofness which was no less characteristic of him but to himself he seemed to have nothing to do with either of them they both appeared to him to be distant and ancient phenomena and he waved a mild salutation to them as acknowledgment of the debt of his own existence between them they had projected him but his own individuality swamped that as completely as his fathers egoism drowned all other flavours was it always like that nowadays were all the last generation so far sundered from the adolescent present as he from his father and mother was there a new plan of life a new outlook a new everything chapter iii peters dinner at the ritz was no dinner party and there were but three young men of whom he was one and their hostess who assembled in the yawning place people always yawned there they were either waiting for somebody to come or they were waiting for somebody to go away his hostess to night was the perennial mrs trentham with whom a party of herself and three young men was a favourite form of entertainment she always professed a coquettish contrition at not having been able to get some girls to meet her young men which indeed she had been quite wonderfully unable to do since it never occurred to her to take the preliminary step of asking them and no nice girl would come to dine with mrs trentham without being asked so the girls not being asked stayed away and mrs trentham apologized she was considerably older than the rest of her youthful assemblage but she looked almost as young as any of them and might charitably have been supposed to be a sister or a wife or something she had only one real passion in her excited life and that was to dine as publicly as possible with several young men sending her husband to his great contentment to amuse himself comfortably at his club there he talked politics and played bridge and the very number of these public entertainments on the part of his wife and the diversity of the youths who partook of them were guarantee against any breath of scandal sullying herself or anybody else with perfect justice nobody believed anything against her yet this delightful immunity from gossip rather annoyed her but in order to give colour to compromise she would have been obliged to descend to duets in quiet corners which would have been no fun at all the loss of publicity the loss too of the pleasing phenomenon that batch after batch of young men in groups of two or three so constantly accompanied her to one of the most strategic tables at the ritz would not have been compensated for by the added chance of scandalous talkings after all london was not so violently likely to care what she did especially since she did not care either and it was far more agreeable to continue doing what she liked rather than gain an entirely spurious loss of reputation by less enjoyable methods she had a pleasant prurient mind and her morals were beyond reproach she called attention to her age when she was with the young in a somewhat excessive manner and often alluded to her beautiful hair which had been grey before she was thirty such an old woman as me was an ungrammatical phrase which she often affected and this was a preventive measure against anybody else thinking of such a thing her favourite subject of conversation was love mrs trentham was not really quite so silly as she sounded though her immense sprightliness often seemed to plunge her into the nethermost depths of fatuousness during the war she had taken to dressing in the uniform of a nurse which she discovered suited her though for fear of witnessing distressing sights she kept well away from hospitals since then having realized the decorative value of black and white she had adopted a garb which seemed to indicate that she was a widow though not quite recently bereaved an occasional bright note of colour in her hair or round her charming waist seemed to have forgotten about her widowhood and was extremely becoming so garbed so minded she awaited peter who was the last of her conspicuous party of young men he was certainly late for her appointed hour but she did not dislike that as the yawning place was full and instead of scolding him she had her usual apologetic greetings volubly ready my dear you will be furious with me i know she said but i simply couldnt get hold of any girls so you and charlie and tommy will just have to put up with an old woman until we go to the opera and then you will breathe loud sighs of relief and i shall see you no more why are you so late peter whom have you been flirting with my father and my mother said peter he has just finished the largest picture in the world how sweet of him ah they have brought some cocktails at last she waited till the servant was well out of hearing but how stupid the waiter is she said i am sure i told him to bring three not four shall i taste it shall i like it do you think it seemed not too optimistic to hope that she would for otherwise she would long ago have ceased not only tasting the fourth cocktail which she was sure she had not ordered but consuming it so completely that the strip of lemon peel overbalanced against the tip of her pretty nose my dear how strong she exclaimed i feel perfectly tipsy and one of you must give me your arm as if you were a nephew or something if i stagger or reel let us go in to dinner at once i promised ella we would get to mrs wardours box by the beginning of the opera who is mrs wardour asked charlie harman oh quite new said mrs trentham hardly anyone has seen her yet rich fabulously rich her husband was one of the hugest profiteers not eggs at fourpence but steamers at a quarter of a million he bought up everything that floats and sold it to the government and most of it got sunk he died a couple of years ago too sad more about her please said peter i havent seen her yet my dear but ella thirlmere is being her godmother sponsor you know and she asked me to take people to her box and her dinners and her dances her names lucy it would be i shall begin by calling her lucy almost immediately theres no time nowadays to get to know people you have to pretend to know them intimately almost the moment you set eyes on them and pretend not to know them afterwards if necessary said peter may trentham gave a hasty glance round the room and becoming aware that quite a sufficient number of people were looking at her and her party slapped the back of peters hand with the tips of her fingers and gave a scream of laughter to show what a tremendously amusing time she was having you naughty boy she said is he not cynical about lucy i shant talk to you any more tommy my dear tell me what youve been doing you look flushed i believe youre in love no ive been playing squash said tommy what is squash i believe its one of your horrid new words and means flirting who is she she is charlie at least i was playing squash with charlie said tommy with laborious precision he didnt like it charlie fingered two little tails of blond hair that grew directly below his nostrils and formed his moustache otherwise his face was completely feminine plain and pink and plump he gesticulated a good deal with his hands flapping and dabbing with them odious game he said showing a great many teeth between his red lips you go on hitting a ball against a putrid wall until youre too tired to hit it any more and then tommy says one love when youve done that fifteen times he says game and then you begin another one i hoped i should never hear of it again you shant my dear but dont be such a cross patch i know youre annoyed with me for not getting you some pretty girl to talk to you must talk to peter hes in disgrace with me oh peter is it true about nellie heatons engagement perfectly said peter then why arent you broken hearted i dont believe any of you young men have got hearts nowadays that accounts for their not being broken said peter it was time to laugh loudly again in order to remind the rest of the diners what a brilliant time she was having and may trentham did this there he goes again she said is he not shocking my dear have you had a dreadful scene with her no i only had tea with her oh dont pretend you werent desperately in love with her but never mind i will find some other girl for you who will adore you so violently that you will lose your heart to her though you say you havent got one she shall be rich and lovely and we shall all be frantically jealous of her and you shall both call me aunt may because i have brought you together thank you aunt may said peter go on about her please no ive talked to you long enough tommy is feeling left out when the opera is over by the way i want you all to come on to ella thirlmeres dance i promised to bring you all mrs wardour is sure to be coming and she will certainly have plenty of motor cars to take us oh there is that marvellous spanish boxer is it not dining alone with ella how gentle and kind he looks darling ella i wonder if she will have six rounds with him in the middle of her dance i would certainly back her look at her chest but how daring of her to dine with him here they say he marries again after each of his fights and settles all the money he has won on his new wife but after all i suppose its just as daring of me to dine with three such attractive young men as for her to dine with just one solomon like that tommy puzzled over this for a moment he was very good looking but there was no other reason for him solomon he asked yes my dear think of his wives i was talking to anthony braille to day who makes all those wonderful tables about population and what encourages and hinders it he said the only chance for england was to close all the music hall bars and introduce polygamy every englishman after this dreadful war you know i was a nurse during the war must have fifty children a year for two years or did he say two children a year for fifty years in order to bring up the population again to its proper level it was all most interesting if he only didnt stutter so much he seems to have stuttered out the main facts said peter oh i couldnt tell a young man half the things he said to me we ought all to be patagonians and polygamists the birth rate among patagonians is colossal they behead all women of the age of thirty five who arent married and all bachelors at the age of forty it has something to do with eugenics the intoxication of a restaurant now crowded with people had gained complete ascendancy over peters hostess she never felt quiet and contented unless she was surrounded by a host of friends acquaintances and people she knew by sight and had to shout at the top of her voice in order to be heard above the roar of other conversations and the blare of a band it was equally necessary for the establishment of this tranquil frame of mind that several young men and if possible no women should be with her and that she should constantly be convulsed by shrieks of laughter and should have both her elbows on the table a finer nuance in success was that she must appear wholly absorbed in the brilliance of her own table and quite unconscious of the hubbub round her though presently when she got up she would seem to awake to the fact that she was in a crowded restaurant and would blow kisses all over the room and have dozens of little smiles and words for all those whose position between her and the door she had unerringly noted just a sentence or two for each reminding her my dears of a meeting to morrow or a meeting yesterday with a phrase of flattery and a bit of whispered scandal and the conclusion i must fly those boys will be so cross with me if i keep them waiting meet you at dearest ellas yes lovely all this was faithfully performed on her part and her face with its pretty little features all bunched together in the middle of it like the markings in a pansy had expanded and contracted again sufficient times before she reached the door of the restaurant to enable a weary conclave to express itself as it waited for her parsifal too said charlie thank god weve missed the first act aged stunt flower maidens and grails cant we get away peter come home with me say were busy at the fo german complications bolshevists on the rhine tommy stood first on one leg scratching a slim calf with the other instep and then on the other leg scratching in a corresponding manner you simply cant he said how am i to deal with her and lucy and parsifal polygamy and patagonians said peter with a vague remembrance of the preposterous conversation that had garlanded their dinner flirt tommy can you flirt hold hands sigh beam cant you manage it no said tommy then tommy and i will go away said charlie after all she doesnt want us except as a stage crowd she wants you most peter i say i like your studs who nobody i liked them too so i got them but weve all got to go on after all weve had dinner all the more reason for not going on said charlie thats no good it doesnt pay besides shes awfully decent dont be priggish peter i say is nellie really going to marry philip beaumont do you mind this atrocious conversation was interrupted by the sprightly tripping advent of their hostess who put her fingers in her ears which she knew were shell like as she passed through the direct blast of the band and consoled them for her want of appreciation of their professional functions by distributing more of her little smiles now i know you are all going to scold me she said because ive kept you waiting but there were so many dears who insisted on my having a word with them they nearly tore my frock off lets all cram into one taxi and i will sit bodkin and after ellas dance well all go on to margie cliffords she specially told me to bring all of you and scold you well first for not having talked to her on your way out i dont know what everybody will think when i appear at the ritz and the opera and two dances with the same young men i shall have to tell my darling bob that the morning post hasnt come or hell storm at me what a lovely white lie there flashed through peters consciousness at that moment an insane wonder as to what would happen if he said calmly and clearly and genuinely my good woman who cares as for the compromising young men who accompany you they are all dying to get away and only the debt of the excellent dinner you gave us of which i reminded them prevents us from doing so there was the truth of the matter and it was all rather mean and miserable her guests were spending the evening with her and ministering to her hopeless delight in daring situations simply because she had on her side administered the nosebag they consented with a grudging sense of honourable engagement to plough their way in her wake merely because she had fed them if she had asked them severally or collectively to drop in after dinner in the way of a friend for conversation and soda water none of them would have dreamed of gratifying her and now when they had fed deliciously at her expense they would all have preferred to go back to charlies rooms in jermyn street or to tommys flat peters house was handicapped by the presence of parents rather than trail along to parsifal and to a dance and yet another dance the dances perhaps might be amusing for there would be girls there and some sitting about on stairs and some sliding about on slippery floors and an irresponsible atmosphere and certainly some more champagne you had to get through the night somehow and nowadays you could smoke while you were dancing and you neednt dance much the nuisance rather a serious one was that mrs trentham would be there all the time screaming and dabbing at them to show how amusing and brilliant they all were keeping them firmly planted round her while she told them that they must go away and dance and make themselves agreeable to others rather than hang round an old woman like her and continually whistling them back if they attempted to do anything of the sort she would take up a position where she could most advantageously be seen and heard and get them all plastered about her swiftly talking to each in turn so that he could not possibly go away as long as she so volubly told him to she had that artless art to perfection no one had such a gift for making young men adhesive as she while all the time she was scolding them for wasting their time on an old woman there was no semblance of sentiment in these proceedings the entire objective of the manuvres was to demonstrate to the world that these boys insisted on crowding round her and not leaving her that was her notion of a successful evening and since they had signed their bond by eating her dinner she managed to exact the full pound of flesh the curtain went down on the first act of parsifal precisely as mrs trentham led her shrill way into one of the two boxes that bore the name of mrs wardour she tripped in all feather fan and stockings like some elegant exotic hen proudly conscious of the brood of most presentable chicks though not of her rearing which followed her the house at that moment started into light again and black against the oblong of brightness were the backs of two female heads both of which turned round at the click of the opened door one of them had a great tiara on sitting firmly on a desert of pale sandy hair may trentham advanced with both hands held out my dear how late we are she said you must scold these boys for they kept me in such shrieks of laughter at dinner that i had no idea of the time dearest ella has so often talked to me about you always asking havent i met mrs wardour yet was it possible i had not met her great friend lucy wardour charmed in the hard light of the theatre mrs wardours face appeared to her to be quite flat the shadows on it looked like dark smudges applied to the surface with a brush rather than markings derived from projections and depressions this apparition of a diamond crowned oval of meaningless flesh was slightly embarrassing and she turned to the second occupant of the box there in the younger face she saw what lucy might perhaps once have been like before the years had flattened her out obviously this was a daughter though ella thirlmere had altogether omitted to mention such a thing then with her rather short sighted eyes growing accustomed to the staring light mrs trentham observed that her first impression of her hostesss face was an illusion though founded on fact just as when the figure of a man resolves itself into a hat and coat hanging on the wall there was nothing in fact abnormal about mrs wardours countenance it was just blankish she had large cheeks of uniform surface a nose of small elevation no eyebrows and eyes set in very shallow sockets then another shadow came on to her face but this time without delay may trentham saw that it was her mouth opening when she had opened it she spoke but she did not conduct both processes simultaneously well im pleased to see you she said but there are so many friends of lady thirlmere ella i should say she told me always to say ella there are so many of ellas friends visiting me to night that i dont quite seem to know your name may trentham felt that her brain was giving way here was a perfectly empty box except for mrs wardour and her daughter and yet here was mrs wardour assuring her that so many friends of ella were here where were the friends were they invisible was the box in reality crowded with unseen presences im mrs trentham she said clinging firmly to that sure and certain fact may trentham ella told me you would expect me mrs wardour appeared to be making an effort of recollection this in a few moments seemed successful thats correct she said i remember and this is my daughter silvia for a moment her face slipped off its sheath of meaninglessness and something homely and kindly and simple gleamed in it ive got two boxes to night mrs trentham she said this and the next as lady thirlmere ella so kindly sent along such a quantity of her friends thats what it is and so silvia and i didnt we silvia we left the other box seeing that it was so full and came in here for naturally i wanted to put my guests where they could see the play and silvia and i we wanted to see too mrs trentham was it and im sure im very glad to see you and your young friends i should like them all to be introduced to me and silvia charlie had hung up his hat and coat during this amazing conversation and now came forward how de do he said i havent caught the name yet said mrs wardour the sheath had gone back over her face again this is lord charles harmer said mrs trentham indeed the son of the marquis of nairn asked mrs wardour charlie opened his mouth very wide brother he exclaimed as if he were saying murder on the lyceum stage tommy and peter were less important the latter when the introductions were over found himself sitting between silvia and her mother on the further side of mrs wardour was may trentham between the other two young men and already absorbed in identifying the occupants of boxes opposite and blowing kisses there theres just room for all of us said mrs wardour without squeezing each other we were too squeezed in the other box werent we silvia theres six in the other box and now were six here let me think theres lord poole and theres lady poole theres mrs heaton and theres miss heaton and theres mr philip beaumont thats five miss heaton is engaged to mr beaumont isnt that it silvia i want to get it clear yes thats right said peter indeed do you know miss heaton asked mrs wardour yes very well said he thats whats so pleasant said she just to sit here and know everybody thats what we want silvia isnt it just to sit and know everybody but that only makes five whos the other one his name began with f and he was very fat perhaps that was his name said peter he was beginning to enjoy himself the whole thing was such complete nonsense what kept up the high level of it was that mrs wardour replied with seriousness no if his name had been fat i should have remembered it she said it wasnt mr fat nor lord fat he seemed to know everybody too he just sat there and knew everybody from peters other side where silvia sat there came some little tremor of a laugh hardly audible and turning he saw that her face dimpled with amusement it was singularly sexless the curve of her jaw the lines of her mouth were more like a boys than a girls boyish too was her sideways cross legged attitude if she was laughing at her mothers remark her amusement was clearly of the most genial kindliness mrs wardour continued in a perfectly even voice that almost intoned the words so void was it of inflection its a pity your party has missed so much of the opera she said theres been a lot of pretty music some of it reminded me of being in church and hymns itll seem quite strange going to a dance afterwards a lot of knights singing hymns parsifal you know some say its the best opera wagner ever wrote this time silvia certainly laughed and again her laugh had not the smallest hint of satirical enjoyment she was just amused peter found himself though he had scarcely yet glanced at her somehow understanding her he recognized in her amusement all that he himself failed to feel with regard to his fathers cartoons and his mothers readings in bradshaw he knew intuitively that silvia had got hold of the right way to regard absurdities to see comedy without contempt whether she knew it or not it was quite certain that she did not she had given him a glimpse a hint an enlightenment not only of what she was but of what he was not looking at her now directly for the first time his handsome face caught some reflection of her boyish brightness and what do you think of parsifal he asked she raised her eyebrows how can i tell she asked i never saw an opera before i envy you said peter why for not having seen one or because i am at last seeing one she asked peter as usual found himself wanting to make a good impression if he had been in a lift with a crossing sweeper he would certainly have tried to make the crossing sweeper like him and have exerted his wits to hit upon something which the crossing sweeper would think to be admirable even though on arriving at the next floor he would never see him again he quickly decided now that the girl would not admire mere drivel she happened to want to know what he envied her for for both he said for getting a new impression that includes both you mustnt have seen an opera before and you must be seeing one now she looked at him with perfectly unshadowed frankness i believe you meant the first she said i believe when you said you envied me that you meant i was lucky in not having spent a quantity of boring evenings in any case i dont mean that now said peter ah then you did why do you mean it no longer peter found himself criticizing her a conversation between the acts of an opera was not meant to degenerate into a catechism you talked in order to mask the ticking of the minutes but as he was in for a catechism it was better to be an agreeable candidate why he asked because i expect that you never spend boring evenings probably you are not a person who is bored clearly as he suspected she was not going to commit herself to any statement without consideration even when so violently trivial a subject was under discussion her eyebrows much darker than the shade of her hair like nellies pulled themselves a little downwards and inwards so that they nearly met oh i could easily be bored she said a lot of bored people would infect me and make me bored she leaned a little forward towards him again with that boyish appeal please dont be bored she said be interested and amused make yourself into a sort of disinfectant to protect me is there an epidemic he asked yes the place is reeking with it my mother for instance detests music isnt it darling of her how very odd of her then he began he stopped because in some emphatic intangible way the girl retreated from the platform of intimacy on to which she had stepped she moved her chair an inch or two away from him hitching it back with her foot but that was only a symbol of her change of attitude what to peter made the significance of that small steering was a certain quenching of light in her face as if over it she had put up some mask of herself that might easily have been mistaken for her if the beholder had not for a glimpse or two seen her unmasked she shifted from the personal ground on which for a minute they had met and became miss silvia wardour generalizing in small talk in the usual imbecile and social manner she also became much more feminine i wonder how many people in the house who have come to hear wagner really dislike it she said probably we all of us like some species of noise and dislike another species of noise if you like the beethoven noise you probably dislike the wagner noise only nobody will say so they come to look at each other she had carried back the conversation on to the personal platform again as if she was sorry to have slipped off it so suddenly but she carried it on to another part of the platform quite clearly she did not intend to discuss her mothers presence at the opera tell me she said what sort of noise do you really like this or somebody elses peter wondered for the moment whether she was to prove to be the earnest sort of girl who whatever you said insisted on discussing your random statements until you contradicted yourself which usually happened quite soon and then vouchsafing a gleam of daylight found an explanation for them in order that you might be encouraged to entangle yourself further the earnest girl the inquisitorial girl he did not like that type they gave you pencils and pieces of paper after dinner and made you write acrostics they took letters out of a box and gave you eight of them from which you had to make a word they divided the guests up into equal numbers told them that this was clumps and that two people were going to leave the room and guess whatever had been thought of these were their lighter intellectual motions and you feverishly played clumps in order to avoid intolerable abstract discussions yet silvia had not the sleuth hound expression that usually accompanied these hunters after intellect what a searching question he said but really im omnivorous about noises i like the noise im listening to i like it particularly there was not in her face the smallest consciousness that he might conceivably be alluding to the fact that she was talking to him she let her eyes sweep across the crowded theatre that noise she asked all those people talking i love it too oh wouldnt it be interesting to be somebody else for a minute and know what he meant what he felt like when he said anything clearly she had used the masculine gender quite unconsciously peters answer on the other hand was deliberate yes i should love to know what she feels like even over the most trivial speech he said silvia dropped on to this with a precision that only showed how complete her own unconsciousness had been she she asked certainly she he said i know well enough the kind of thing which men feel like she leaned forward again oh tell me about that she said certainly they were together on the personal platform again peter was quite at home there his passion for making a good impression on new acquaintances his rather uncanny skill in extracting intimacy from them gave him a confident gait on these boards he felt that this queer attractive girl did not in the least wish to be talked to in the ordinary nonsensical manner in the gabble of the ballroom and in the more intimate duologue on the stairs outside it girls the generality of them liked to be told that men thought exclusively about them and spent their waking and sleeping moments in the contemplation of their divinity and pricelessness nellie of course was an exception for between them there certainly was some peculiar bond of understanding but the majority of girls so ran his indolent and incurious creed just wanted to be told that they were too priceless for anything and some wanted to be kissed it was all nonsense they knew that as well as he did but such was the inherited instinct or if you wished to be precise the inherited instinct acting on the new conditions but he knew that silvia was not like that there was some eager friendly quality about her she was not quite the normal girl of the ballroom nor again was she the earnest girl who wanted to explore your brains and prove that you hadnt got any she seemed merely interested in the topic not because it would lead to a demonstration of her cleverness men he said what do men feel they are as vain as peacocks and they think entirely about themselves they think of you as an inferior sex designed to amuse them ah the darlings said silvia quite unexpectedly the great pervading brilliance of the lights went out a row of veiled illuminations only remained in front of the red confectionery of the curtain against which the conductors head was silhouetted silvia after her surprising exclamation drew her chair more into the corner in order to enable peter to pull his up to the front of the box klingsors castle said mrs wardour with a final desperate glance at her programme who is klingsor silvia peter wondered whether he could whisper who is silvia but decided against it a magician darling said silvia with the same underlying bubble of amusement chapter iv there was a mad brutality of discordant noise and the risen curtain disclosed an astrologer he roared and yelled and soon a dishevelled female in an advanced stage of corruption shrieked back at him silvia found herself disliking the wagner noise and her attention came closer home came in fact to the quarter view of peters face as he sat low in his chair in order to give her a clear view of klingsor she was not sure that she liked peter any better than the hurly burly that was going on and though she knew she had been liking him during the interval between the acts she now seriously set herself to the task of disliking him and the easiest method of achieving that result was to class him as just one of the crowd which had come that night to occupy by request her mothers two boxes she perfectly understood the situation lady thirlmere the woman with the pearls and the blue black hair had told a lot of her friends that they could go to see parsifal for nothing and reap a quantity of subsequent benefits at the price of knowing mrs wardour of frequenting her house and of permitting her to eddy round in the general whirlpool for some reason inscrutable to silvia her mother wanted that she and her mother in fact were like a pill which lady thirlmere had guaranteed that the world should swallow the pill was nobly gilded and there was any amount of jam to assist the swallowing of it without doubt peter was one of the open mouths klingsor and kundry continued to rave at each other and so far from listening silvia used that external noise to drive her own thought into seclusion much as a dull sermon a tedious lecture makes for introspection in the audience and hardly had she classed peter among the open mouths than she wondered if she had been quite fair in doing so for the talk they had had was not of the same timbre as the conventional quackings which for the last week had made her mothers house like a farmyard with her like mrs bond of the nursery rhyme calling dilly dilly you shall be stuffed and stuffed they were silvia could no more enter with sympathy into her mothers aims than she could enter with sympathy into stamp collecting but out of love for the stamp collector the dear weary steadfast stamp collector she was eager to feel the highest possible interest in the collection and collect for her with all her might but she knew that she despised the spirit of the stamps which in return for food and drink and opera boxes were so willing to be collected next week there was to be a dance for her in that immense mansion which had been re christened wardour house and pages of the stamp book would on that occasion be filled with adhesive specimens everybody so she understood ella thirlmere to say would come and no doubt it would be tremendous fun there were certainly some stamps here now lord charles was one though why had he been willing to be collected he sat with his head propped between two long hands and a queer sort of nose just protruding indicated by its downward angle that he was profoundly meditating next him was her mother whose pearls clinked rhythmically to her breathing and nearest to herself she could see the half averted profile of the young man whom she was encouraging herself to dislike he appeared to be looking at the stage certainly he was paying no attention to her and she got back to what she actually thought of him instead of forcing herself into a defensive attitude against him somehow they seemed not that it mattered to have been talking to each other from odd standpoints when ridiculously interested for the moment she had asked him what men felt he had not given a masculine answer he had spoken to her as if he had been a girl he had said that men were as vain as peacocks and thought of women as an inferior sex designed for their amusement very likely that was quite true but now in this isolation of darkness and loud noises which cut her off from him and everyone else in the box it seemed to her to have required a woman to state that that was a womans view of a man a man though he shared it could scarcely have said it instead he would have told her that women were the angelic sex meant to be adored some violent concussion had occurred on the stage there was no longer a gloomy black man with a photographic lens but some insane sort of flower bed and remembering her programme she recollected that this was the enchanted garden the enchantment seemed to lie in a quantity of prodigious calico or cardboard flowers presently they burst if they had not burst they must have burst for mature females singing loudly were hatched out of the centre of each the change had awakened charlie and he opened his mouth very wide my dear what unspeakable wenches he said loudly to mrs trentham silvia look at the flower maidens said her mother they all came out of the flowers was not that wonderful look at the one from the blue convolvulus isnt she sweet silvia choked a laugh with an audible effort swallowing it whole yes darling she said arent they pretty peter turned to her quickly oh thats just how i talk to my father he said and instantly looked back at the stage again she reconsidered her verdict of him as merely belonging to the open mouths which lady thirlmere showered on her mother they at any rate did not behave in that unwarranted way her neighbour was ill bred odious familiar and having thrown an impertinence like that over his shoulder he did not even wait for her rejoinder what it would have been she did not quite know but was it impertinent of him after all was it perhaps rather a pleasant indication of intimacy for intimacy in the ordinary sense there had not been time or opportunity but had he perhaps just spoken quite naturally assuming a corresponding naturalness on her part if so she had failed him silvia was annoyed with herself for such a suggestion how could she have failed a young man whom she had seen for the first time half an hour ago who was only one specimen out of that flock of rooks which had alighted there in this new field where worms were to be had for the mere picking of them up there was a long interval at the end of this second act and a reseating of the occupants of the two boxes lord poole whom mrs wardours godmother had chosen as a genial acquaintance came in with his great towering frame and his immense red face and his unlimited capacity for enjoying himself lucky dog parsifal he remarked to silvia to have had all those girls to choose from he should have taken the one that came out of that great white lily my word she did surprise me when she came out of that lily i wish i knew where i could get some of those lilies hallo peter get out of that chair like a good boy and let me sit between miss silvia and her mother havent had a word with either of them yet go and make love to my wife for ten minutes youll find her next door and come back and tell me how youve been getting on when this great licensed victualler of london appeared on the scene and made some such suggestion it was usual to go and do as he told you but now peter glanced at the girl as if to ask whether she wished him to make way or not she gave him no sign however no hint that he was to stop where he was and so the best thing as his cool quick brain told him was to answer lord poole genially according to his folly you condone it then he said lord yes i condone anything he said we all condone everything nowadays saves a lot of trouble in the courts the frankness of these odious sentiments made it quite impossible not to treat them as a farce no one in his senses took lord poole seriously he was so jolly and so preposterous and so successfully sought safety in numbers he instantly spread himself over peters chair and firmly put one arm round silvias waist and the other round her mothers nice young fellow that he observed as peter went out of the box what a pair he and miss silvia make hey hes black and shes fair and hes a clever fellow and wont have a penny and i wish i was his age do you know his father hes a rum un these remarkable statements were addressed in a loud hoarse whisper to mrs wardour and were of course perfectly audible to silvia then he turned to the girl ive been asking your mother to elope with me he said so i hope you didnt overhear now im going to talk to you and she mustnt listen youre perfectly delicious my dear you and your golden hair and that little foot thats kicking me let it go on kicking i like it wonder how peters getting on with my missus peep round the corner miss silvia and see if she looks like going off with him there are several topping girls in that box but shes the pick of them bless her heart what heres your mother getting up and leaving me more friends coming in i never saw such a lot of friends why its ella im in luck to night and theres may trentham only one chair away look at her profile against the light did you ever see anything so perfect looks rather like the head on a postage stamp but dont say i said so lord poole was now satisfactorily engaged in his usual evening occupation of getting as many girls and pretty women round him as possible while mrs trentham was performing a similar office with regard to every young man who came into the box her pansy face was growing sillier than ever as she kept telling them all to go and talk to somebody else the object of these two middle aged magnets was precisely similar one wanted to attract to itself all the men the other all the women but there was an infinite divergence in their methods may trentham pretending to be young kept asserting how old she was lord poole pretending to be old could not conceal the fact of how young he was he again was not thinking one atom about himself but was entirely absorbed in his collection of sirens she was thinking exclusively about herself and was only anxious that every one in the house should turn green with envy at her galaxy of adorers then ella thirlmere and a friend or two joined the group and he returned blatantly fatuously delightfully to the opera well now i do feel like parsifal he said here i am in the middle of such flower maidens any of whom could give a couple of furlongs in a mile to those on the stage and come romping home in a canter look at ella now theres a picture for you why my gracious heres winifred too come and tell us all about it winifred how many hearts not reckoning mine have you broken to ight look at that hair of hers did anybody ever see hair like that i never did and ive seen a lot in my time may trentham too do you wonder that all the young men go swarming round her im sure i dont and id join the swarm myself if i wasnt so blissfully situated just where i am havent enjoyed an evening so much for years wish this interval would last till doomsday and then wed all go up to heaven together st peter would let me in without a question when he saw whom id brought along with me among the people who had drifted in at the end of the act was philip beaumont whom mrs trentham had instantly rendered adhesive by her voluble commands to go back to nellie heaton at once nellie however had very designedly sent him here for she had become aware by a glimpse a sound an instinct perhaps even more that peter was in the box next door and her dispatch of her lover there would certainly signify to peter that she wished him to take the chair now vacant by her and resume the talk in the window that had taken place that afternoon somehow that talk had made for itself an anchorage uncomfortable to her consciousness it had been like a fishbone in her throat she had taken gulps of her fianc so to speak in order to dislodge it but she had not succeeded in swallowing it she had tried to divert her attention from it had pounced with fixed claws on the opera in front of her had jotted down in her memory with the fell example of lady poole as an object lesson a quantity of ways of behaviour and of the presentation of yourself to others which were undesirable when you were fifty or seventy or whatever lady poole happened to be you must be quiet and calm when you had tottered up to those hoary altitudes you must leave your hair to turn any colour it chose you mustnt wriggle and snort for whereas wriggling in the young might exhibit quite advantageously a graceful litheness it suggested in the old that a galvanic battery had been unexpectedly applied to the knees and the elbows and the middle part of the person but there was something remote about these gleanings of knowledge they might prove to be nutritious and possibly palatable if preserved and remembered for thirty or forty years at the present moment they were not of sufficiently arresting a quality to divert her mind from this fishbone of her interview with peter there had been a harshness a crudity in it there had been to her mind a certain hostility in it there had been also a certain hunger in it an emptiness that ached he had clearly pronounced that their relationship the bond in fact of which she had spoken must be changed by her engagement and though she would have combated that with wit and good sense some internal fibre of her throbbed vibrated to the truth of it she wanted to convince peter and even more to convince herself that the old bond the old relationship still flowered and had lost no petal of its fragrance she had not to wait long for his entry philip had barely left the box before peter appeared in the doorway and she applauded his quickness in answering the signal she had waved to him in the ejection of the other he was silhouetted there for a moment as he spoke to someone in the corridor outside cool and crisp and complete peter was always like that nature had applied to him some extra polish some exquisite finish which detached him from all others in the moist or dusty crowd adorable though that was the thought came to the girl that above all else she wanted to disturb and disarrange that peter excited and dishevelled peter enthusiastic peter undetached and clinging was perhaps the real peter a clamorous turbulent peter he looked round as he entered he clearly saw her and as clearly disregarded the obvious movement of her hand to the vacant seat which philip had just quitted though that rejection that cut you might call it considering their friendship was in no way premeditated it was when he saw nellie beckoning as with proprietorship or so it struck him quite deliberate he had given no thought to it before and apparently gave no further thought now for he instantly placed himself next lady poole beside whom there was another empty seat there was a great green feather nodding a welcome from her violent hair it matched her green shoes and the large slabs of false emerald with which her dress was hazardously held together she was quite as absurd as her husband and had a witty poison under her tongue which she sprayed profusely over most subjects of discussion but her poison hurt nobody since nobody ever believed a word she said she was in fact as harmless as a serpent and certainly not as wise as a dove the serpent aspect showed its innocuous fangs monster she said to peter sit down and tell me at once whats going on next door whoms my christopher flirting with everybody said peter he sent me away to flirt with you lets begin shall i begin tell me why you and he should always remain young when all the rest of us are as old as the hills the wisdom of the mature dove peeped out for a moment but was driven back by a hiss of the serpent as a loud squeal of laughter sounded from the next box thats may trentham said lady poole unerringly my dear what a woman why do all you young men crowd round her like moths round a night light whom has she got the rest of the males said peter male and female you know stuff and nonsense there are people who are things look at our hostess whom christopher is probably embracing at this moment i assure you she hasnt got a face shes got a slab what are we coming to then theres her daughter shes a boy a nice handsome healthy boy doing well i wish my son was like her do you know him hes like a pincushion peter was not actively listening to these extraordinary remarks he was taking in and assimilating just what he had done in not occupying the place indicated to him by nellie he came to the conclusion that he had not done so precisely because she intended him to she was meaning to get on perfectly well without him and had better begin at once why pincushion he asked because i put pins into him whenever i see him which isnt often and he just sits there and keeps my pins he doesnt mind he doesnt bleed hes nothing at all poor wretch i beg him to steal or bear false witness or break any commandment that comes handy so long as he does something he eats chocolate and trims hats i shall have no pins left soon never mind eddy but what a horrible opera must have been written by an organist in collaboration with a choirboy i wonder if christopher is in the next box at all i expect hes gone behind to scrape acquaintance with some flower maiden probably that voluptuous crone who came out of a large white lily though how she got into it originally is more than i can say because she was bigger than anything i ever saw if only eddy would do that sort of thing so much more suitable anmic thats what you all are the women arent quite so bad as the men i know personally five grandmothers who have married again in the last fortnight but the grandmothers who continue optimistically marrying will die in time and whats going to happen to england then whats the use of saying emigration when there wont be anybody to emigrate i didnt say emigration said peter with his head whirling this sort of speech was characteristic of lady poole she dashed pictures on to a screen like a magic lantern and took them off again before you had seen them leaving darkness and the smell of oil may trentham too said this amazing lady i hear youve been dining with her she would like every boy in the kingdom to remain celibate for her antiquated sake i will say for christopher that he doesnt want that he would like every woman to do just the opposite good gracious heres another act and i thought it was all over and that we were only waiting for our motors come and see me to morrow any time im always at home where is one to go in these days profiteers and bolshevists and jews thats england mark my words peter groped his way out of the box in the sudden eclipse of the lights sidling by others who were tip toeing back again without any response to nellies signal he knew quite well that there was an unoccupied seat next her and that it would have been the most natural thing in the world for him to have appropriated it but he chose to consider that it was more suitable yet that philip should find his way back to it she had given him the right to be there and peter with a tinge of insincerity told himself that he was behaving with extreme correctness in not occupying it the insincerity lying in the fact that his root reason for going back to the other box being that he was determined that nellie should not have everything quite her own way then again another reason for behaving so properly she had said herself that afternoon that she meant to fit herself to the conventional mould and here was he helping to secure a perfect fit no doubt she was right she was right also in divining that the nature of the bond between them must now necessarily be changed it had never been a passionate one their individual independence no less than the material obstacles in the way of declared and complete surrender to each other had always stood between them but there seemed now that the bond was slackened to have been potential passion woven into it perhaps the slight collision with philip in the doorway and the knowledge that he was groping his way back to the chair by nellie again accentuated that perception for a moment peter paused he had yet just time to slide past philip and occupy the chair but there seemed to glimmer in the seat of it some label reserved and he checked his impulse no doubt he would resume natural relations with nellie again to morrow or probably even to night in the dance or two dances was it where they would be sure to meet and a certain subtle antagonism which had begun to smoke and smoulder within him would be quenched he left it for the present at that for three or four hours more that night after the conclusion of the opera sivia found herself in touch with one or other of the guests who had so agreeably and with so little ceremony decorated the fronts of her mothers boxes they seemed just as much at home in lady thirlmeres house taking genial possession of it dancing to her band drinking her champagne in the same clubable manner lord poole was greatly in evidence surrounding himself with the gay moths that positively stuck in the spiced honey of his outrageous compliments and could scarcely disentangle their feet therefrom he squeezed their hands he put his arm round their waists he made the most amazing speeches right and left as to their irresistibility he was like some mirror into which every woman looked and saw there a fascinating reflection of herself that presented an image of herself more delicious than even when trying on a new hat she had ever supposed herself to be whats to happen to us poor men he asked silvia if youre all of you going on being so tip top we shant do a stroke more work we shall spend all our time in looking at you and then whos to pay your bills ive lost my heart twenty times already to night and thats enough for an old chap like me so i shall take myself off to bed wheres my wife i wonder can your bright eyes pick out any extra dense crowd of young men if you can i shall plunge straight into them like taking a dive after a pearl oyster and ill find her right in the very middle of them there seemed to be an unusual congregation at the end of the drawing room which opened on to the dancing floor and lord poole accordingly took his dive silvia could see as the waves of black coats and white shirts split up round him that it was mrs trentham who was the pearl oyster just there but the dive must have been satisfactory for lord poole disappeared fathoms deep silvia began to revise her judgment on the nonchalant greed of the mouths that flocked to be fed everyone was so gay and pleasant so intent on laughter and amusement everyone knew everyone else she had done no more than set eyes on a young man who had come in with mrs trentham to her mothers box but tommy confidently claimed her as an old friend and she stalked and slid about the floor with him at the conclusion of that a girl whom she remembered with even mistier vagueness disentangled herself from another young man the one who had slept so quietly and cried out so audibly at the appearance of the flower maiden and ejected tommy from the seat next silvia she was entrancingly pretty in some wild dewy manner and had all the assurance that the knowledge of a delightful appearance gives its possessor i havent had a word with you all the evening she said and i want to tell you how delicious it was of your mother to let me come to her box i saw you round the edge of the curtain talking to peter he raves about you so as i wanted to rave too i well here i am dont send me away silvia was utterly unaccustomed to exercise any critical faculty where friendliness seemed to be offered there were no outlying forts to her heart no challenging sentries if a girl seemed to like her that was passport enough who this was she could not for the moment remember though doubtless her name was among those which her mother had repeated as being occupant next door then the name nellie heaton found a lodging in her mind and seemed secure she was not sure that she liked the information that peter was raving about her but it was surely friendliness the desire to be pleasant that had prompted the retailing of it to her you must be miss heaton she said am i right there were so many new faces to night you know she looked at nellie with that direct gaze that sought only to appreciate there was certainly a great deal to appreciate the girl was dazzlingly pretty nellie laughed yes i suppose i am miss heaton for the present she said a little more of her mothers commentaries came into silvias mind had there not been a man in the next box name missing for the moment to whom miss heaton was engaged perhaps her phrase for the present alluded to that ah im beginning to remember she said i remember that you are soon to be married i hope youll be tremendously happy thats dear of you said nellie but when i said i was miss heaton for the present i didnt quite mean that silvia with all her friendliness shrank ever so slightly from this there was a certain reserve about her which did not quite allow the indicated response but the welcome of her manner was not abated do be kind and sort out all these nice people for me she said i have grasped lord poole and isnt it mr mainwaring who is peter he sat next me for an act all the christian names are a little puzzling at first then theres tommy i havent the slightest idea what his surname is though i shall know him again because i danced with him just now and theres lord charles who went to sleep i shall know him again and wont you know peter again asked nellie thats one for peter oh but i shall said silvia hes the two were sitting close to the door into the ballroom and at that moment peter passed in front of them talking to a girl he just glanced at them took them both in and melted into the crowd yes thats mr mainwaring said silvia confidently i i liked him dont you like him nellie made a little sideways bird like movement of her head out of her changed relations with peter she felt that something like antagonism had minutely sprouted she wanted yes she would give an answer that would seem wholly appreciative of peter and that would yet contain something that silvia possibly just possibly would not like dear peter she said of course were all devoted to peter its the fashion to be devoted to peter chapter v during the next month the foam and froth which spouted from the weir of london into which mrs wardour of her own design and desire had been so expensively plunged began to be less tumultuous as she floated away from the occasion of her first bewildering dive lady thirlmere that admirable godmother had chucked her into it holding her breath and shutting her eyes and now mrs wardour was getting her head above water and beginning to paddle on her own account the sponsor had provided the richness of total immersion and lucy wardour was certainly swimming as she came up to the surface she found herself surrounded by iridescent bubbles she was bobbing along in a mill race of desirable acquaintances she had made no friends there was no time for leisurely processes of this sort but when she had decided that she wanted to spend her months and her money in the pursuit of some such indefinite goal as now loomed promisingly in front of her she had not expected to make friends she had not gone for friends she had gone for something that attracted the attention of the accomplished gentlemen who wrote those small and exquisite paragraphs in the daily papers inscrutably enough that happened to be her ambition what she wanted was to see though she knew it already that mrs wardour was among those who brought a party to the first night of the bugaboo mrs wardour gave a dinner at wardour house last night followed by a small dance mrs wardour was in the park chatting to her friends and wearing a green toque and her famous pearls among her secretarys duties was that of pasting these juicy morsels supplied by a press agency into a red morocco scrapbook in fact she was streaking her way across the bespangled firmament of london like a comet with a blank face and an anxious eye but those who thought that the anxious eye received no impressions just because they were not instantly recorded on the blank face made the mistake of this season may trentham had undeniably been guilty of this error from that first night when she had brought her young men to the opera she had thought that mrs wardour was not sufficiently alive to her value and as mrs wardour did not appear to be learning any better she had certainly permitted herself to indulge in little rudenesses little patronizations little contempts which mrs wardour did not appear to notice certainly she made no direct allusion to them and her rather meaningless countenance showed no sign of having perceived them this afternoon she was occupied with her secretary in making out a list of a favoured few not more than eighty all told who were to be bidden to an entertainment at which the russian ballet was to figure she ran her short blunt forefinger down the alphabetical pages of her visiting list and dictated names to the gaunt miss winterton who took them down in an angry scribble of shorthand the last few pages were approaching then theres mrs trentham she said to silvia i think well leave out mrs trentham silvia put in a mild plea she rather enjoys things mother she said there was a pause in which mrs wardour slowly and deliberately recalled certain moments which nobody would have thought she had noticed well she isnt going to enjoy my things she said they were seated in mrs wardours private sitting room in the great house in piccadilly it was hung with french brocade an immense aubusson carpet covered the floor and a reisener table and bureau with half a dozen very splendid chairs echoed the same epoch mrs wardour had found this a little too stiff for domestic ease and a decidedly more homely note was struck by a few wicker chairs upholstered in cretonne and a tea table of the same imperishable material with flaps which let down on hinges and formed convenient shelves for cakes and teacups on the top of the bureau was a large photograph of the late mr wardour in watch chain and broadcloth there were but a few more names and mrs wardour closed the book then youll send invitations to the names ive given you miss winterton she said on rsvp cards theres no one else youd like to ask silvia silvia knew quite well what she was intending to say and wondered why she hesitated will you ask mr peter mainwaring she said mr mainwaring i dont seem to recollect darling of course you cant recollect everybody said the girl but i should like him to be asked certainly then whats his initials and address silvia supplied this information and miss winterton gathered up her papers and left them she had the air of some dethroned queen for whom disastrous circumstances had made it necessary to perform menial offices mrs wardour breathed a sigh of obvious relief when she had gone she terrifies me silvia she said when the door had closed she and that new butler to think that one of them is called summerton and the other winterton well im sure silvia blew out a little bubble of laughter stand up to them dear she said yes its all very well to talk but how am i to stand up to them when my knees tremble i wouldnt have it known but thats the fact well we are going to have a grand party next week mrs wardour relaxed herself in the wicker chair its been a job and a half she said and i wish your father was alive to see what a good job and a half ive made of it he always had a hankering for high life himself but he was too busy to catch hold of it when i give the word lucy hes often said to me well start in and show them all how to do it often hes said that to me and i always had a taste for it too and sure enough it came natural to me from the first were pretty well sitting down and knowing everybody now hard work it certainly had been for the last two months mrs wardour had worked as hard at securing the goal she had so steadfastly set before her as her husband had ever done in providing the paraphernalia for the enterprise but now she might fairly claim that she was beginning to sit and know everybody she had brought to her task an unremitting industry and when the tide was once flowing in her favour so that it was possible to consider not so much whom she would ask but whom she would leave out a steely ruthlessness that ruthlessness indeed had been a weapon throughout the campaign if a desirable guest was unable to come on monday tuesday or wednesday mrs wardour had adamantinely proceeded with thursday friday and saturday she had even taken her place at the telephone and demanded in her flat firm voice that her quarry should consult his engagement book and let her know which was the first disengaged night ruthless also she had now become as in the case of mrs trentham when the question was one of exclusion and the party for the russian ballet had been selected on the sternest principles thinking over that now her mind reverted to silvias final invitation and who is your mr mainwaring she asked silvia again had to stifle some embarrassment that since it did not exist on the surface at all must have had some more secret origin oh ive met him a score of times she said hes one of the people who is always there he sat between us once at the opera i think i remember one evening when lord poole made love to you dear but somehow hes never been to your house yet thats more than most can say remarked mrs wardour so nearly smacking her lips that an impartial umpire might have said that it counted this set silvia laughing and what have i said now asked mrs wardour it was not so much what her mother was saying as what she was being that so continually kept silvia in a state of simmering hilarity contemplate it as she might she had never been able to comprehend the impulse or rather the steady unwavering devotion that had kept mrs wardour at such high pressure all these weeks she did not enjoy the process of these eternal entertainments the gaiety of others did not make her gay music made no appeal to her she was long past the age of dancing though so many of her contemporaries were not and yet she would sit benignly content through the short hours of the summer night with her great tiara on her head and feeling the heat acutely for the mere pleasure of being there that she was there was now undeniable and happily having got there she suffered no disillusionment the mere chasse the acquisition was certainly not the mainspring of her activities she had engaged in the chasse not for the sake of getting but of having the second terror of her busy life entered miss heaton wants to know if you are at home miss said the formidable summerton it was a relief to silvias mother that she had not got to stand up to summerton and indeed there was no crisis at all for close behind him was nellie my dear i was so afraid you might say that you werent at home she said that i thought it only my duty to save you telling lies am i interrupting how are you mrs wardour send me away if i am intruding or say that you have just gone out if you dont want me to stop and i will promise to believe you silvia had risen with a flush of pleasure on her face at the entrance of her friend from all the new acquaintances of london nellie had made a shining emergence through all the mists and bewilderments of the new life she shone with a steady beam like the luminous finger from a lighthouse clear and steadfast above the complicated currents but this is lovely said silvia sit down tea something anything she stood looking at her with frank surrendered gaze a little dazzled as she always was with such easy unconscious splendour she regarded nellie if she could have put her appreciation into words as she might have regarded some golden casket set with gems which seemed to have been laid in her hands she had as yet no idea what was inside it she had not attempted to raise the lid it was enough at present to be allowed to hold it in shy adoring fingers no nothing said nellie not even to sit down i came in fact to make you stand up im doing that said silvia thats not enough my dear what a delicious frock but my horrible philip has been obliged to go out of town and im at a loose end till dinner and thought it would be wonderfully pleasant to sit on the grass somewhere isnt that original at the moment when that rural idea occurred to me i passed your gilded portals and thought it would be even more wonderful if you came and sat there too i dont mean ordinary dirty grass but clean grass richmond park or something top of a bus of course old hats there could have been no more attractive notion to silvia she felt that it was just that she had long been wanting namely to be with nellie on the grass in an old hat she could still ecstatically be dazzled could follow the beam of the lighthouse with steady rapture but a fresh aspect of her away from ball rooms and crowds just that old hat aspect she felt at once to be what most she desired she might it is true be just as dazzling thus she might indeed be more dazzling when other lesser brightnesses were withdrawn from her vicinity but however she turned out she could not fail to show a new enchantment of course ill come she said let me go and get an old hat you dont want me mother do you no dear but if youll ring the bell ill order the car for you far more comfortable and far quicker than the top of a bus nellie had been taking in the appurtenances of this room to which she had not previously penetrated with those quick bird like glances which were away again scarcely alighting before you knew they had perched at all mrs wardours hospitable suggestion seemed to contrast with her own project in just the manner in which those creaking cretonne chairs contrasted with the brocade on the walls and the aubusson on the floor ah how kind she said but dear mrs wardour the point of our expedition is not to be comfortable and quick but uncomfortable and slow i yearn for that and for being rustic and common otherwise i should ask you to lend me one of those glorious chairs and let me sit and look at buckingham palace yes you can see it out of the window said mrs wardour but the top of a bus let me see miss heaton isnt it is the top of a bus quite the thing for girls like silvia and you but absolutely said nellie it wouldnt be a bit the thing to drive in your lovely rolls royce and we shall have tea somewhere quite unspeakable with dirty napkins mrs wardour shook her head now a nice tea basket and the car she insinuated ready in ten minutes i beg you miss heaton why the notion of richmond park and a bus and a tea shop had blown in upon nellie she had no clear idea but as she and silvia swayed and bounced westwards it easily yielded an unconscious analysis her morning had been taken up with dress and trousseau for the imminent wedding her mother had joined her at the dressmakers flushed with triumph over some grabbing business called settlements and over the afternoon there had hung rather sultrily the prospect of long hours with philip who was coming to lunch her mother as usual had a bridge party of harpies and no doubt she and philip just as she and peter had done not many weeks ago would sit in the window and pass for being absorbed in each other it was owing no doubt to the hymeneal morning and the prospect of a similar afternoon that on the outpouring through the telephone of philips calm but sincere regrets that business claimed him in the country reaction had opened its sluice gates and overwhelmed her with the desire for hours physically and morally remote from rich fabrics and opulent comfort and from the ambient atmosphere of things connected with just one theme she was perfectly well satisfied with the general prospect matrimonially considered but she wanted just now as celibacy was so soon to vanish a foreground of it and simplicity and freedom to her picture originally when the telephone had first told her of philips defection she had scarcely made the needful pause of ringing off before getting into communication with peter to know whether he could slip the official collar for an afternoon certainly that was ringing off philip with some completeness and with whom better than with the other could she take a last excursion into the country that would so soon be severed from her by the sea placid she hoped of matrimony but the official collar could not so peters very distinct voice told be shifted he peters voice at any rate said he was sorry but he added no superlatives of regret and before she had removed her ear she heard the click of the replaced instrument at the other end he rang off so it seemed to her with a certain finality not lingering to gossip that had been rather characteristic of him lately though she had constantly met him he had always appeared in that light impenetrable armour of his aloofness never raising his visor nor showing a joint in his harness where she could get at him ever since the interview on the window seat six weeks ago he had been withdrawn like that failing to get peter her next inclination had been to sip her celibacy alone for though peter better than anybody symbolized the things that were passing away the wet woods and the roving and the independence she would in his absence get nearest to them alone so she had already started on her suburban pilgrimage strolling down the glare and wilderness of piccadilly to get on to a richmond bus at the corner of hyde park when finding herself dazzled by the sun on the newly gilded gates of wardour house the notion of silvias companionship suggested itself and she paused weighing its advantages silvia would certainly give her an eager appreciative comradeship so much was instantly clear and on the heels of that a tangle of other interesting little curiosities with tentacles protruding plumped themselves into the same scale she did not trouble to unravel them now they would straighten themselves out as the afternoon went on richmond park proved very empty of loiterers occasionally a motor bicycle with a wake of dust hanging in the air behind it streaked down the yellow road but by the pen ponds no more than the distant throb of such passenger was audible summer was in full leaf among the oaks and beeches retaining still the varnished freshness of spring and populous in the shade of the leafy trees were herds of fallow deer which lay sleepy and yet alert with twitching ears and whisking tail against the incorrigible menace of flies until an abatement of the heat restored appetite for the young tussocky grass the hawthorn was nearly over smouldering coronets of faded flame or grey ash of dazzling blossom represented the glories of may but round the ponds the humps of the rhododendron banks were still on fire such talk as had flourished between the two girls had not yet penetrated beyond the barrier where triviality ceases and past dances with keen criticism on their merits and dances to come and the adequacy of various partners among whom peters name flitted by like blowing thistledown had been flashed on and off the public plate there had been a little longer exposure for the projected party at which the russian ballet were to supply the entertainment and nellie had been informed with horrified eagerness on the part of silvia that of course she had been bidden the invitation had only been inscribed that afternoon her acceptance of it was equally of course and with the luck that attended friends the date of it was a clear two days before her marriage trivial though it had all been she felt that the hamadryad herself had been doing spade work in the shade the ground was cleared and levelled every topic that she might now wish to work up into a more elaborate tapestry had been put in on tentative threads much as characters in a decently written drama flit at any rate across the stage in the first act the two delightfully grouped hatless and secure from interruption had come to anchor in the circular shade of an old thorn bush not far from the edge of reeds that fringed the pond the red petals of the spent blossom dropped down from time to time the hum and murmur of june woods was a carpet on which more intimate conversation could lightly spread itself nellie drew up and clasped her knees fancy my impertinence in dragging you out to richmond park when i know that you had a hundred things that you wanted to do she said tell me what would you have done if i hadnt appeared like some bird of prey and clawed you now dont say that you would have had tea with your mother and gone for a drive in the park if you do i simply shant believe you yes she was more dazzling so silvia found when there was no one to contrast her with the sheer silly conventional tittle tattle took a sparkling quality quite alien to it when it came from her mouth her personality was like coloured lights playing on a fountain and turning the drops to gems i must be silent then she said oh dont be silent when people are silent it means they are only being polite if they were less polite they would say that they were excruciatingly bored then after a suitable silence they say how charming it is here dont say how charming it is here that will be the last straw silvia dear me i said silvia by accident it what they call slipped out oh do say it on purpose then said silvia very well me too you understand what a funny business is christian names the christian name is never really ripe till it drops i wonder if you know what an unutterable boon you and your mother have been to that smoky place over there and to crown it all you are giving the most delightful party with the most gorgeous punctuality as far as i am concerned do say you settled it for that night because you knew i couldnt come on any subsequent night silvia gave a little moan like a dove in a tree i cant say that she said nellie sighed wholly appreciatively thats so refreshing of you she said youre one of the real people i expect the people who mean what they say i usually mean what i dont say silvia turned round and lay facing her friend dont say it then nellie she said i mean do say the things you mean how complicated it sounds and how simple it is shall we stop talking about me do you think ive got another subject i know it said nellie what about peter i adore peter by the way dont say anything horrid a certain sense of shock came to silvia peter had not ever so remotely been the subject to which she alluded but when nellie suggested him he was flashed on the screen with disconcerting vividness but i didnt mean him at all she said i wasnt thinking about about mr mainwaring he wouldnt like that said nellie silvia sat up she had a perfectly clear conscience to endorse an immediate repudiation what caused that suspicious that questionable little leap of blood to her cheeks was indeed not that she had been thinking of peter but that nellie supposed she had oh but this is quite silly she exclaimed indeed he wasnt in my mind at all why should he be i scarcely know him nellie knew that she had ceased for that moment to dazzle silvia to whom the suggestion that peter had been in her mind was clearly unwelcome and unexpected it might be true or it might not so ran nellies swift argument that silvia was not thinking of peter at all but that she should be ruffled ever so delightfully at the notion that she had been constituted a symptom did it not but it was enough to note that and pass on at once to the easy task of dazzling silvia again you are too delicious she said yes im going to stick to my subject for a minute longer which is you since yours isnt peter youve got the most lovely lack of self consciousness do you know of course you dont or you wouldnt have it but when i talk to other girls we each think about ourselves its like talking to a boy not peter mind to talk to you silvia made some gesture of deprecation no i will go on said nellie look at the glass i hold up to you please it isnt only the lovely parties that you and your mother have given us that have polished up the rusty old season its your quality what shall i call it wind and sun sexlessness you just move along like a spring day with all your banners streaming in the most entrancing glee youre absolutely insouciante if you understand french silvia had lost sight of peter by now he was round the corner and how near that corner was was immaterial she wanted to put herself round the corner too and seized on this as a possible diversion oh yes i do she said i only came back this spring from three years in france there you are again theres another of your completenesses youre spread evenly richly like butter when were all eating margarine over the whole slice of life i wish i could bite you i believe that with a little trouble i could and if so i should hate you not for what youve got but for what i havent at this moment nellie became aware that her day in the wet woods had changed the character with which prospectively she had endowed it she had meant first with peter as her companion and next by herself to enjoy the last hours of her celibacy with silvia on the other hand she was now not enjoying her own but envying her companions what she envied her most for was her decorated simplicity silvia wore her decorations externally she didnt attempt to swallow them and by digestion make them build up a complicated identity worst of all from the envious point of view she didnt know how splendidly embellished she was it was as if you said to a gallant soldier have you got the vc sarcastically almost and then he looked down not up at his decorations and found that the little piece of riband was there silvia moved a shade away from her companion the break in the thorn tree with the consequent oval of hot sunlight quite accounted for that but what havent you got she asked you live as naturally as drawing breath the life thats so new to me and so puzzling and so delightful and below and beyond all that youre on the point of being married he chose you out of all the world and you found all the time that you had chosen him what is there left for you just you now and here to want youre adorable silvia wrestled and threw the bugbear of shyness which so often sat on her shoulders and strangled her neck there it writhed on the grass not in the least dead but for the moment knocked out oh sometimes i wish i was a boy she said im more in that key than in ours sometimes i think nellie projected herself into that gap of sunlight from which possibly silvia shrank she had no definite scheme of exploration for the moment but it seemed to her that something in the tangle of motives with which she had invited silvia to share her afternoon was faintly stirring as if with unravelment those loops and knots might get more inextricably muddled it is true but conceivably the whole thing might come out like a conjuring trick ah what is it that you think she asked dont stop so tantalizingly as if thinking wasnt everything whatever one does is only a clumsy translation of what one has thought think aloud nellie looked more than ever at that moment like some exquisite wild presence of the woodlands dryad or bacchante delicate and subtle in face and limb and brain and merely proto plasmic in soul a creature made for the bedazzlement and the undoing of man certainly she had woven her spells over silvia again the momentary check in the incantation when she had attributed peter thought to her had passed as swiftly as the shadow of one of those light clouds which drifted over the grass but at that moment when she so bewilderingly shone out again there formed itself in silvias mind as she tried to follow this injunction to think aloud not the image of her at all but of peter for if nellie was divinely akin to the blossoming thickets and the shadows that were beginning to lengthen over the grass making cool islands on which the deer were grazing now he too would be no less harmoniously bestowed by this reflecting lake side it was not that either of them suggested rurality no one indeed was more emphatically of the street and the ballroom and the complication of the city than they but by some secret pedigree of soul they were of the house and lineage of the things that glowed and enjoyed and were lovely and gave as little thought to yesterday as they took for to morrow all this not catalogued in detail but fused into a single luminous impression passed through silvias consciousness like the wink of summer lightning as if it wasnt difficult enough to think at all she said and as for thinking aloud thinking articulately if im to sum it up ever so clumsily its merely that i adore with all the incense ive got the thought of your happiness it does matter so much to me and and isnt it noble fun to find someone who matters very few people really matter i suppose little silly finite hearts like ours cant take in many but those who do matter must come right in if they dont mind they mustnt risk themselves by hanging about on the doorstep they might catch cold arent i talking nonsense its your fault for taking me into the country for assuredly it has gone to my head where theres a stifle of roofs and a choke of streets nobody matters and everyone is quite delightful what a stupid word that is and how expressive of a stupid thing silvia very deliberately shot off into the backwater of nonsense so to speak out of the main stream for the sun was on the water in this dazzle of nellies personality and she could not see towards what weir the hurrying river might be taking her very likely there was no weir the glistening tide running swift would very likely spread out into some broad expanse of peace pools but it was the brightness that prevented scrutiny by some flash of woodland instinct by some uncanny perception nellie divined the cause of this retirement into the backwater of triviality with a ruthlessness that rivalled mrs wardours pursuit of desirable guests she caught the rope of silvias boat so to speak before she could tie it to the security of some overhanging branch and shot it out into the main stream again yes my dear she said you talk nonsense delightfully ah i didnt mean stupidly i didnt mean in the sense you had just labelled it with i meant delightfully charmingly but just for a change after that delightful now i mean stupid london were talking sense you interested me indescribably just now you said you were more in a boys key than a girls what did you mean exactly silvia watched the receding shore to which she had hoped to tie up after all what did it matter if there was a weir not a peace pool down there in that dazzle of benignant sunshine but there was another difficulty in the way of expression i cant really explain she said there are things so simple that no explanation is possible if i said it is a hot day and you told me to explain i couldnt i could only say if you dont feel it if you dont know what that means i cant help you its the same with all elemental things nellie regarded her with eyes that were framed in some steely sort of interest eyes that were eager to know not from the kindly tenderness of friends but from some surgical curiosity i think i know what you mean by a boys key she said let me see if i can explain you to yourself silvia since you wont ah cant explain yourself to me if you were in love for instance you would passionately want to give love to pour yourself out instead of like most girls provoking love and permitting it and ever so eagerly receiving it you wouldnt want a mans homage so much as you would want to be allowed to love him you would want and how queer and delicious of you you lovely upside down inside out creature this abrupt termination of the presentment of silvia in love as imagined by her friend was due to something quite unexpected there came on silvias face as her own privacy was thus invaded a dumb but none the less violent signal of protest she shrank and withdrew herself as if a burglarious bullseye had been shot through the window of her room where she lay lost in cool soft maidenliness the contact was even more direct than that it was as if some pitiless incision had been made in her very flesh but with this pause in the application of the knife this shuttering of the bullseye for any further beam would have disclosed the deliberate attempt to rifle the jewel chest there came the complete withdrawal of her protesting signal it had been the bullseye of a friend that looked in the scissors of a dear amateur manicurist she was sitting there hatless in the shade and with her hand she pushed her hair back oh youre a witch nellie she said two hundred years ago you would have been burned and i should have helped to pile the faggots i expect that youre magically right i cant tell you know because i assure you literally and soberly that i never have been in love literally never soberly never but somehow what you suggested how did you divine it you witch touched something made something vibrate and sing i didnt know anything about it i didnt know it was there then you put your finger on it and i knew i knew i had it and then you just hated me for a moment said nellie silvia did not quite accept this you made me wince she said in correction and oh yes ill confess just for a moment you seemed to me hostile and hurting you arent youre heavenly and healing you taught me bless you but i think youre a witch all the same it wasnt telepathy you told me something about myself that i didnt know and couldnt have known and cant know now for that matter oh you lucky creature youve fallen in love you know it all did you do it in the manner you attribute to me did you savagely give not wanting anything but to give give how did you put it just now to be allowed to love to pour yourself out to pay homage instead of exacting it the boys key my dear it seems ages and ages since that phrase came up ive had a whole drama since then you know nellie in point of fact had had her drama too but it was as yet undetermined she had not got at the root facts for which she was burrowing silvias volley of questions anyhow were easy of response they were barring a certain inversion very victorian questions dating from the days when men blindly adored and women swooned at the declaration of the passion which they had done their level best to excite but that inversion made to her and for particular reasons a wildly interesting speculation silvia when she loved so much was certain would love in the boys key the eager evocative key she acknowledged herself in contemplation of the event as blindly adoring as being allowed to love whether that was entirely a prognostication or whether it was already partially potentially fulfilled was another question and the application of that concerned nellie and her own purposes alone soon deftly now with the lesson of silvias revolt against surprises she would get a further result from her dissection at present there was the impatient intimate volley of questions to answer oh my dear i understand so well the boys key she said a triumphal victorious surrender with all the bells ringing isnt that it a march out with white flags insolently flying i should love to be like that if i was like that but that isnt my key i just surrendered rather terrified you know but i couldnt be terrified of philip for long hes such a dear this could not be considered more than an approximate account a vague sketch very faintly resembling the scene it portrayed a quiet feminine disclosure but nellie did not want to discuss that she wanted to get back to her tangled skeins again i should like to see you in love silvia she said promise to tell me when it happens at least you neednt it will be wonderfully obvious you in your boys key whom can we find for you who will just fall in with that and be the complement of it making it complete and round and perfect hasnt ever so little a bit of him just the top of his head come over the horizon yet silvia did not withdraw or raise any signal of protest this time she made no signal at all none at any rate that could be perceived by the girl who sat watching her very narrowly and once more nellie fumbled so to speak at the shutter of her bullseye which would flash on the light she looked at the watch on her wrist my dear how late it is she said we must go at once i promised to go to mr mainwarings studio peters father you know peter will be vexed if i dont come then came the signal silvia jumped up with wholly unnecessary alacrity but more nimbly yet did the high colour mount to her face chapter vi one evening a week or so before the date fixed for the wedding philip beaumont and nellie had dined and gone together to the first night of some new play it was saliently characteristic of him a peak so to say prominently uprising from the smooth level of his cultivated plains that when arrangements for such diversions and businesses were in his hands they always went without a hitch nellie had expressed a desire to see this play without giving long notice to him of her wish and it followed as a matter of course that he managed to get gangway seats in the stalls at the most advantageous distance from the stage things happened like that with him his own unruffled smoothness which seemed immune from any of the attacks of asperities of one kind or another to which human nature is subject seemed to create a similar well ordered decorum in his activities tonight for instance the dinner which preceded the theatre was punctual and swiftly served so that neither hurry nor undue lingering followed it his motor slid up to the kerb stone precisely as they quitted the restaurant and it might be taken for granted that at the conclusion of the piece it would be bubbling up opposite the portals of the theatre precisely as they emerged once in their seats there had been but a few minutes to wait before the lights were lowered for the first act these afforded a convenient time to grasp the real and the histrionic names of the actors and see where the acts were laid in those few minutes nellies glance had swept over stalls and boxes noting the position of various friends silvia was in a box with her mother and loud screams of laughter from another box opposite perhaps temporarily turned into a parrot house made it almost certain that mrs trentham was having her usual splendid time surrounded by a bevy of young men a glance verified that and the same glance showed her that peter who she knew was to be present was not among them then someone entered the box where silvia and her mother sat and she knew where peter was immediately a loud flamboyant voice just behind her informed her that peters entry had been noticed by someone else glance maria mia it said at that box next the stage on the right where is the lady with the wealth of golconda i allude to diamonds on her head you and i have no reason to be ashamed of that tall handsome boy ah behold just in front of us the adorable miss heaton miss heaton the box by the stage the lady in diamonds her name a word a whisper the quenching of lights gave suitable cover for the emotions evoked by this particular brand of theatrical slosh there were whimsicalities there was slyness there was maidenliness and womanliness there was the sense of looking through a keyhole but all these qualities were soaked and dyed with slosh mr mainwaring to nellies sense seemed to make himself spokesman for the house he thrilled to every slyness however subtle and he advertised on behalf of the rest of the audience his appreciation his resonant laugh proclaimed the gorgeousness of the less abstruse humours as when the heroine being asked to give her lover a kiss wore a face of horror and said eh on the sawbath his giggling and his slapping of his great big thigh gave the cue for more recondite deliciousnesses he exclaimed brav brav at the end of a long speech he blew his nose loudly at the blare of the highland vox humana and bestowed one splendid sob on his handkerchief when the author really let himself go and opened all the sluices of sentimentality mr mainwaring had to recover with gulps and hiccups from that but he pulled himself together like a man and ran his fingers through his hair to make it stand out from his interesting head though these convulsions were resonant only just behind her nellie gave them no more attention than she would to raindrops on the window and the doings of the stage occupied her as little and as little the presence next her of the perfect organizer a certain antagonism had grown up had seeded itself and was rapidly propagating a vigorous seedling was the fact of peters being where he was it was no business of hers so she told herself with whom peter went to the play and she tried to divert her mind by ironical comment peter poor and parasitic would always dance a graceful attendance on anyone who would give him dinner and a seat in the box peter was like that and for his grace and politeness there was due reward he had a trick of sympathetic listening of intelligent interrogation that made his companion feel herself interesting you could put him next the most crashing bore and he would wreathe himself in smiles until the crashing bore felt herself to be the wittiest of sirens and then suddenly the stupidity of her comments and their irrelevance failed to divert nellie altogether there was the antagonism hugely grown by now peter so she made out was as conscious of it as she and had certainly during the last week or two contributed to its growth he had answered nellies formalities with similar politeness he had watered where she had sown and she wondered whether he contemplated with the dismay of which she was conscious the lively crop of their combined husbandry it was the fashion as she had once said to silvia to be devoted to peter and silvia seemed to have picked up the fashion with the same ease as she had exhibited all along her social pilgrimage she welcomed all that came up with a frolic boy like enjoyment but there was as nellie perfectly well knew a real silvia a serious silvia somebody with a heart and the shy treasures of it a personality curiously ungirl like something eager and hungry and wholesome she knew in advance what her way of love would be and her feet firm and unstumbling silvia would never stumble were on the high road of all the saunterers that she might meet there would she not by the mere instinct of divination choose the complement to her own unusual personality the complement certainly was someone feminine but not effeminate indeterminate in desire somebody in fact extraordinarily like nellie herself in the way of a girl silvia had already quite succumbed to a charm that nellie had not troubled to exercise she had recognized and surrendered to it with that victorious white flag abandonment with what ringing of bells would she not march out to the mildest call for capitulation when a boy of that type blew his lazy horn long before the act was over nellie had known that she would present herself in the interval at mrs wardours box she would in anticipation have much to say to silvia there would be plans for the next day or regrets over the dreadful occupations that made plans impossible there would be some flat steady compliment about diamonds and parties for mrs wardour and there would be nothing at all for peter she wanted as far as she was aware just to take him in in the new situation which was surely forming as clouds form on a chilly windless day she wanted to get used to it she wanted or did she not want to put the weed killer of familiarity on the crop of antagonism which was certainly prospering in a manner wholly unlocked for and then much quieted and reassured she would return to philip and feel for his hand when the lights went down again he had a good hand cool and secure and efficient there was the sense of safety about it of correctness it was all that a hand should be then still secure and vastly more content than she was now he would take her back to her mothers flat and perhaps drop in for a half hour she would say quite correctly come upstairs and talk to mother and me for a few minutes she would work the lift herself and he would be surprised at her mastery of it then when they were vomited forth at the fifth floor she would remember that her mother had gone to a bridge party and would certainly not be home before twelve that would give them their half hour alone nellie was not prepared for the companionship in her expedition with which mr mainwaring decorated her standing in the middle of the gangway he made her a sonorous and embellished little speech when rather rashly she revealed her destination at the end of this interminable first act peters friends my peters friends are mine he magnificently observed and i feel it my duty to pay my respects to them oblige me miss heaton by accepting my escort to the box that glitters with the combined distinction of diamonds and peters presence my wife will you not maria mia will prefer to remain precisely where she is chocolates my beloved a cup of coffee i will leave my purse with you refresh yourself mrs mainwaring declined refreshment except in so far as it was ministered to by some advertisements of brighton hotels which appeared on the back of the programme there was one there which she had not previously heard of and which seemed very reasonable her husband offered the sleeve of a velveteen clad arm to nellie and they proceeded upstairs with pomp and the slight odour of turpentine which was all that was left of a dab of paint which had dropped from his brush on to the skirt of his coat as a profound inspiration seized him after he had dressed for dinner philip gave a slightly iced negative to nellies inquiry whether he was to join this pilgrimage mr mainwaring did all the usual things he clapped his hand on peters shoulder when the introductions had been made and hoped with a stately bow that his boy had been behaving himself he waved his hand when mrs wardour pronounced the first act very interesting and recognized a fellow artist before ten minutes were over mrs wardour was committed to look in next afternoon and see his few poor efforts then he became more confidential and whispery a marvellous an incomparable type he said looking at silvia and back again at her mother who has had the felicity the difficult felicity of painting that glorious head no one i am astonished i would be shocked if i were capable of so bourgeois an emotion hm beyond a visit to the private view of the royal academy mrs wardour had not penetrated into pictorial circles and faintly through the impression volubly audible of silvia and nellie talking together peter heard his father leading up to the series of war cartoons suitable for mural decoration as regards that he went walking in the wet woods as aloof from his father as from any other magnificent self advertiser he had heard mrs wardours promise to go to the studio next day and to bring silvia and he thought that very probably the relations of great britain with foreign countries might struggle through a free hour without his co operation meantime nellie seemed to be talking secrets to silvia and he sat nursing his knee a little aloof from either group presently nellie would go back to her seat in the stalls and his father would do the same and then he would hitch his chair a little forward again people began to troop back into the stalls obviously a bell had rung announcing the imminence of the second act nellie recognized that and got up as yet she had barely spoken to him i must get back to my philip she said very properly good night darling silvia peter had gone to open the door for them come to the flat peter she said without turning her head as she passed him i shall go straight home the words were just dropped from her as if by accident or inadvertence but the moment she had spoken them she knew that this had been in the main the object of her visit to the box it was this which she had primarily wanted the merest hint of an affirmative nod on peters part was sufficient answer the play came to its happy concluding treacliness and they went out philip and nellie of course were among the first into the vestibule where he instantly caught his footmans eye the wardour group must have left their box slightly before the end for peter was seeing them into their motor thanking mrs wardour for such an awfully nice evening and excusing himself from being given a lift as after a day in the office he liked walking home yes all the way to south kensington how nice it would be to see mrs wardour at his fathers house next day he lingered a moment on the pavement and as nellie passed him on her way to the motor just nodded again without seeming to see her philips first concern as they slid off into the traffic was that there should be air but no draught for nellie perhaps if he put her window quite up and his half down was that comfortable and a match for her cigarette after which he slipped her hand into his and after a moments delay she returned the pressure in a flash of general comprehensive consciousness nellie was aware how comfortable and well ordered the whole evening had been and realized that all days evenings and mornings and afternoons alike would to the end of life owing to the very ample settlements which she understood to have been made be padded and cushioned like this she was conscious at the same moment that her appreciation of that lacked acuteness she would just as soon to take an example be walking with peter along the pavements where nobody cared if she felt a draught or not as be having it all her own way in unjostled progress the flash of this perception was instantaneous measured only by that moments delay in response to philips hand for he instantly began to tick again as she put it to herself a pleasant tick a good reliable firm tick a charming play was it not dear said he and that delicious humour of his well if nellie was going to be comfortable all her life it was only fair that she should contribute should put her penny into the placid bag delicious she said i am sure it will have a great success and how interesting to be there on the first night she broke off suddenly and clasped philips arm ah we nearly ran over that man she cried philip remained quite calm he would obviously be an admirable companion in a shipwreck or a thunderstorm or a railway accident this was delightfully a new point about him and nellie found on the discovery of it that she must have been collecting his good points for with the collectors zeal she hastened to net it and add it to her specimens he pressed the hand that she had laid on his arm and looked out of the window which he had opened on his side of the motor my dear there is nothing to be alarmed about he said the man is quite safe and has not forgotten his usual vocabulary you need never be afraid with logan he is the most careful of drivers and has an extraordinary command of the brakes nellie collected this new genus philip sub species logan it added a little bit to the completeness logan is quite trustworthy he went on you need never have a moments qualm when he is on the box we were discussing the play i should like to see it again does not that strike you as the true criterion as to whether you have essentially enjoyed a play if there is only mere glitter one does not want to repeat the experience but there was gold i thought this evening he was silent a moment patting her hand and nellie divined his mind with a rather terrible distinctness she had been very considerably agitated for that moment and he assumed how wisely and how consciously a complete oblivion of that the best method of reassuring her after the little testimonial to logan was to be unaware of any fluttering incident a manly calm was the efficient medicine for feminine alarm he went on talking about the play as if nothing agitating had occurred swiftly as the car slid down piccadilly nellies brain was just a little in advance of it and before it slowed up at the house of flats she was mentally on the doorstep earlier in the evening she had contemplated philips admiring ascent with her in the lift her own surprised recollection on their emergence that her mother would not yet be in but now that picture had been whisked off the screen altogether there would be no ascent with philip no sudden remembrance of her mothers absence a subsequent engagement not so conventional had been proposed by her and assented to with a nod so imperceptible that it had been repeated philip had so often spent a final half hour like this that as the motor stopped he almost assumed it and may i come up for a few minutes he asked she laid her hand on his shoulder as if to press him back on to his seat dont find it horrid of me dear she said if i say no i am a little tired do you think but what a lovely evening we have had you come and fetch me in the morning dont you good night my dear the most ardent of lovers could hardly have insisted after this little collection of sentences each unmistakably clinking with some sort of final ring and it was out of the question for philip to repeat a request which in any case had habit rather than craving to back it he would certainly have liked to sit with nellie and her mother so he supposed for a quarter of an hour discuss the play a little more quietly sun himself contentedly basking in nellies presence and consider himself a very fortunate fellow but if she was a little tired it would have been unthinkably intrusive to beg her to take a part and let him take a part in a sance that she had no wish for but she lingered a moment yet in order to give no impression of being in any hurry then forbidding him to get out of the motor she disappeared with a final gesture as of but a short separation into the house her mother as nellie knew would be the case had not yet returned from her card party nor would she be likely to do so for a full hour yet and her absence in relation to the visitor she now expected took for itself a totally different aspect she had limitless opportunities and facilities for a tte tte with philip and her mothers absence if it had been he who had come admiringly up with her as she managed the lift would in no way have been a special even a desirable condition she and philip were so often alone together and before many days were passed would be so exclusively alone together that the gain of another such hour was frankly quite imponderable but for the last fortnight she had scarcely had a private word with peter and whatever it was that she had to say to him in this visit she had bidden him to and whatever he had to say to her that he had something to say was probable from his reiterated acceptance of her request it was quite certain that these things could not be satisfactorily said even perhaps be said at all before any audience whatever nellie had no definite knowledge in any detail of even her own contribution to the coming interview all that she knew was that when half an hour later or an hour later she would click the door on his departure she must somehow have looked minutely with his eyes to help her at the antagonism which had so odiously flourished she intensely hoped that it could be rooted up altogether and put on to the rubbish heap of mistakes and misapprehensions but whether her hope had much of the luminosity of faith about it was not so certain too much depended on what he had to tell her and she did not fall into the error of forecasting the upshot before she knew what contribution he was to make towards the preliminary process then with an internal vibration partly of suspense partly she admitted of eager anticipation she heard the faint tingle of the electric bell the servants no doubt had gone to bed and she went to the door herself hullo said peter he stood there a moment after the door was opened without moving his eyes agleam and a smile hovering over his mouth often and often had they met in precisely similar fashion he as he passed the door on his way home giving one discreet little ring which nellie would answer if she felt disposed to see him sometimes her mother would be in but oftener if in she had gone to bed and the two would sit over the fire or on hot nights seek the window seat and spend an hour of desultory intimacy as two boys might or two girls but to night there was some little effervescent quality added to the meeting the spice that a combined manuvre however innocent brought with it both realized too that a talk which must attempt to readjust their old relations or fit them into the changed conditions lay ahead and for the moment each brought gaiety and goodwill to the task the best evidence for that was the assumption of the old relations pending the readjustment peter how lovely of you she said come in is she in he asked putting down his coat and hat mother no shes at a harpy party four women rooking each other at bridge theyll all be trembling and being frightfully polite by this time peter bring your hat and coat in with you if mother sees them there she will think philips here and will come in to sit with us and if she thought they were mine she would come in twice but if there are no signs of anybody she will probably go to bed and not interrupt us the night was hot with a thundery overcast sky and they sat together again in the window seat a hundred feet below the street was roaring and rolling along thick with the discharge from theatres and music halls the clever one and how did you get rid of philip asked peter lied darling said nellie succinctly did you indeed nellie i dont think youre getting on very well with your determination to be conventional nellie blew reproach at him in the shape of a ragged smoke ring i never heard anything so unjust she said oh peter it was just here we sat when i told you i was going to be quite conventional wasnt it dont say you dont remember well im being the model of conventionality pleasant is it asked peter in a wonderfully neutral voice he did not yet quite know why nellie had summoned him here and he was greatly aloof still dont make slightly acid comments said she about conventionality its a fortnight more than a fortnight since i saw you last oh i dont count balls and that sort of thing your friends are invisible at balls you can only see your acquaintances whats the use of just seeing a friend youve got to be alone with a friend in order to see him nellie was still unaware of what course she was really meaning to steer it was to be a safe course anyhow avoiding shoals and avoiding icebergs just at present peter was making himself an iceberg she went on talking rapidly and quite naturally with a view to bringing peter out of his frozen aloofness but my scheme for conventionality never went so far as to exclude my seeing my friends altogether she said and if in order to see a particular friend i have to tell lies to one person and and tell the other not to leave his coat in the hall thats not my fault its mothers fault for not having gone to bed yet its philips fault for proposing to drop in peters smile hovered over his face again not quite breaking through brutes he said perfect brutes im not sure that you arent the worst of them all remarked nellie his smile broke through at that and he laughed you may be quite sure im not a brute he said but i should like to know why you think so nellie was sincere enough in her desire to re establish a genuine friendly relationship with him again at present their grip on each other was clogged and rusted if this rather unconventional meeting was to be of any use what use she did not clearly define the first essential was to wipe the wheels clean you know perfectly well she said ever since my engagement you have taken yourself completely away you have shut yourself up you have bolted your windows and barred your doors to me havent you peter weighed this accusation it might possibly be true but it contained an arguable point which was easy to state i never bolted the windows and barred the doors he said it was you who did that i didnt arrange that you should marry philip thats what shut me up if you choose to put it like that i told you at the time that our relations must be changed she shook her head no relations that ever existed between us need have been changed she said you speak as if we had been in love with each other not at all we never were in love with each other that we both know but what then she asked ill take your simile he said my windows and doors were open to you i might easily have fallen in love with you or for that matter you with me our relationship and the possibilities it held were just those of open doors and windows then you came round and shut me up and philip drew the curtains she took this in and turned it about before she answered by which you mean she said that whatever our relationship might have ripened into i nipped it off like a frost yes said he a latish frost she got up and moved about the room patting a cushion here and setting a chair straight there peter did not move he did not even turn his head but he was quite aware of her pondering restlessness he was aware too that so long as he held his tongue he had the whip hand the evidence for that was soon apparent i didnt know that my engagement would have that effect she said i think it is unreasonable that it should have that effect if you had been in love with me it would have been different in that case i could have understood it but as it was why should it have made any change in our friendship whats the use of asking me said peter with a sudden touch of irritation i cant tell you why i dont know the why of anything under the sun but put it the other way about suppose that it had been i who had got engaged to some girl wouldnt that have made any change in your sense of our friendship peter had spread himself a little over the window seat when she got up now when she came back to her old seat she pushed his encroaching knee aside thats not the same thing she said a girl cant be a very intimate friend of a married man in the same way that a man can be a very intimate friend of a married woman i wont ask why said peter gently because im aware that you dont know what i say is perfectly true though not in the instance of you and me you knew quite well that i wasnt going to give myself a free rein to fall in love with you after you had settled to marry someone else besides it you come to think of it a man dangling after a married woman is just as ridiculous as a girl dangling after a married man i dont see why a man shouldnt be allowed to retain his self respect as much as a woman though as far as the spoken word went they had arrived at no agreement no compromise even on which agreement could be based they both felt that somehow in the region of unspoken treaties the ground had been cleared though the wheels did not yet revolve again rust had been wiped off them and in peters next speech the scouring of the wash leather was busy you mustnt think that i dont regret what were suffering under nellie he said i regret it most awfully ive been saying and i stick to it still that you are responsible for it it was you who closed my windows and bolted my doors it would be simply silly of me to pretend that i was broken hearted about it for that would imply that i had been or was in love with you but that doesnt prevent my being sorry or my missing which i acutely do our old relationship i dont know if its any use trying to recapture it trying probably hasnt much effect on what you feel its no use trying to feel hot if you happen to feel cold or trying to feel ill when you do feel well my dear it makes the whole difference said nellie quickly will you try to to feel yourself back in your relationship with me i want it too peter she pulled back his encroaching knee which just now she had pushed away and kept her hand on it the very fact that this triviality was so instinctive constituted the significance of it i hadnt reckoned with losing you she went on no i dont excuse myself or account for myself probably i should have done just the same if i had reckoned with it probably if it was all to do again now i should do the same dont let us labour the point if youll try thats all i ask ill try too if that will be of any use i put my nose in the air just as much as you did as if my nose wasnt sufficiently in the air already but it always turns up at the end not to matter dont mention it said peter thats the old style peter she said keep it up run with it till it works on its own account motor cycle you know they were looking at each other now with something of the alert unconsciousness of two old friends alone together but certainly the machine required running with at present theyre heavy things to push when they wont get going said he how odious you are hurrah for that word said peter why i wonder how often we have told each other we were odious nellie was silent and in that moments pause peter was conscious that real no doubt as had been her desire to uproot the antagonism that had grown up between them that process had been no more than preliminary to something that should follow the ground had to be cleared first but the clearing of the ground was not her ultimate objective the moment he perceived that at all he saw how obvious it was how her appearance suddenly in mrs wardours box that evening gave a clue to the nature of the further development then quick as an echo she began to reproduce the thought in his mind lets pick up the thread again she said i can give you my weavings very simply trousseau philip philip trousseau how lucky men are when a man is going to be married he doesnt have to spend his days in buying things he doesnt have to buy anything wedding ring said peter in parenthesis yes but you cant have occupied yourself with that unless you have had a private marriage behind the locked doors and curtained windows we were telling each other what we had been doing in this long interval it was your turn oh usual things said he foreign office dinner breakfast foreign office and hows may trentham asked nellie wheeling in smaller circles round this objective youve left her out she wouldnt like that she left me out to night said peter she had that immense box for the play and never asked me to it nellie folded her wings and dropped but you got there all right she said she saw you too sitting with mrs wardour who hasnt asked her to the party for the russian ballet blood my dear therell be blood over that do you know i think silvia is one of the most attractive girls i have ever seen as she spoke there came from outside the tingle of the front door bell nellie got up with a finger on her lip who on earth can that be she whispered it may be anybody said peter very prudently you cant tell till you go and see perhaps its philip we may have got hold of each others hats by mistake and hes come here nellie suppressed a laugh probably mother she said she forgets her latchkey when she thinks shell be late home i shant say youre here or shed come in and spoil our talk oh what a tangled began peter nellie took the additional precaution of turning out the lights in the room where they were sitting and leaving the door open close outside was the entrance door from the stairs into the flat and peter sitting in the window seat heard with an amusement that dimpled his cheeks nellies unhesitating account of herself it appeared that she had just come in and was just going to bed she had already put out the lights in the sitting room there followed a triumphant announcement of her mothers winnings an affectionate good night and the closing of a door down the passage sitting there in the dark peter drew the conclusion that nellie put a high premium on the pursuit of the conversation in which as he infallibly conjectured she had just got down to the bone she would scarcely for the sthetic delight in tortuosity have concealed the fact that he had dropped in as he had done a hundred times before for a few minutes chat on his way home she wanted to talk about silvia for his part he was perfectly ready to talk about silvia just before the closing of the door which must certainly be that of mrs heatons bedroom nellie had said ill put out the lights good night dear what a lovely last rubber and peter feeling his way so to speak into nellies mind by the analogy of his own knew exactly what she was doing in a moment now there would be the click of the extinguished light in the hall and she would very softly rustle back in the dark into the room where he was sitting close the door of that and then perhaps turn on the light inside again or as likely as not shuffle back into the window seat so often had they sat there talking in the dark and as he waited for those five or ten seconds to pass he was invaded by a sense of passionate rebellion against himself there was the girl whom for the last two years he had been interested in fond of to the practical exclusion of anyone else and now at this moment she engaged to a man whom she did not ever so remotely love was presently stealing back on the eve of her marriage to spend a more than midnight hour with him he ought to have been a balloon rising into some stratum of sunlight high above the twi lit earth and instead he was bumping heavily over uneven ground quite unable to get into the air no matter what the ballast of worldly consideration he threw out he could not feel himself lifting and nellie when she came back would only add to the weight his expectations were ruthlessly even ruefully fulfilled she stole in invisible in the darkened oblong of the doorway closed it and without turning up the light established herself in the window seat again mothers gone to her room she said i did it so cleverly peter i said i had just come in i know i heard said peter brilliant wasnt it now we can talk without any fear of interruption where had we got to oh i know i think silvia is perfectly fascinating dont you here was the bumping process the added weight eager though nellie had been to re establish old relations between herself and him there was a livelier eagerness to ascertain anything about new relations between himself and silvia if nellie as he had affirmed had shut his windows and bolted his doors for him he now made a tour of the secure premises to see that she had done her work thoroughly i dont know if i should say perfectly fascinating he said but you like her dont you extremely but nellie waited to hear the qualification she liked the fact that there was a qualification though at present she did not know what it was as nothing further came she spoke again quite in the old style oh its so rude to say but and then not go on she said peter jerked back his head let me be polite then he said one can always observe the small decencies of life what i nearly said was but im not in love with her i stopped myself nellie if you want to know because it seemed to me very vividly that it wasnt your business there was an illumination cast on to her face from the street lamps from below to his intense surprise he saw that her eyes wide and unfocused grew suddenly dim thats just what i too am beginning to realize she said whatever you do now is none of my business ive got a separate establishment im bound to say that you have quite realized that you havent asked me a single question about what goes on in mine it doesnt concern you any more therefore you dont care i shall learn to respect your privacy too peter another snub or so will teach me thats nonsense he said quickly it isnt nonsense you treat me like a stranger because i happen to be marrying someone else if you had been in love with me weve had that already said peter then listen to it this time youve absolutely been turning your back on me you are piqued horrid word because i dont want to remain an old maid for your sake maynt i feel interested in you without your resenting it you object to my marrying philip when you could have made it perfectly clear what could i have made clear he asked you could have made yourself indispensable to me she said a single further turn of the screw again she broke off no im wronging you she said that final turn of the screw must be made mutually it never came to us though i was there wasnt i with my screwdriver and you with yours it just didnt happen lets make the best of what remains a good deal remains after all we have everything that is of value between us except that final turn of the screw good heavens peter how i wish i adored you i do all but that and you do the same for me darling when all is said and done if only you were masterful and masculine or if only i were the thing would be solved as it is we are like two oysters in the flow of the tide just gaping at each other nellies ultimate objective unless peter had completely misunderstood her had sunk out of sight for him and all the time the tide is flowing he said thats so maddening of it i mean that the days and weeks and months are passing and one doesnt even think still less does one feel one only exists i am an oyster its quite true but i dont make pearls pearls i believe are only pieces of grit which the clever oyster covers up with iridescent stuff all that stuff comes from the oysters inside somehow i cant make i cant manufacture like that the clever oyster does it or the normal oyster somewhere in the south seas i suppose im a northern oyster only meant to be eaten just to be eaten i really want somebody to come along and gobble me up im nothing but a small piece of food nellie found herself hugely interested in this it gave her what she wanted to know namely peters own personal estimate as to how he stood to silvia he had defined it negatively when he told her that he was not in love with her but here was a more intimate revelation namely that of his willingness to be absorbed there too was the difference vital and essential between herself and him for she never contemplated the possibility of being absorbed by philip there would certainly be no absorption there on either side he so she judged was as little likely to make that surrender as she for a moment she thought over what he had said instantly finding herself unable to accept it i can imagine your being very indigestible she remarked i dont really think nor perhaps do you that you will allow yourself to be assimilated i cant imagine you giving up your wet woods i shall always remain selfish you mean said he self centred whatever you like to call it she frowned over this what i suppose i really mean is that i dont understand you she said and getting up she fumbled for the switch of the light by the door lets throw some light on you he got up too i must go to bed he said its any hour of the night she stood in front of him stretching her arms which were a little cramped with leaning on the window sill and looked at him gravely youre going to ask silvia to marry you then she said i am as soon as i think she will accept me nellie received this point blank she had fully expected it and now when it came there was nothing in her that ever so faintly winced then she took two steps forward put her hands on his shoulders and kissed him peter darling what good friends weve been she said and well carry all that forward into the future theres no one like you thats just what i meant by kissing you that and to wish you all good luck perhaps your son will marry my daughter wouldnt that be nice and then we can envy them both and be wildly jealous as for asking silvia well what about to morrow perhaps its rather late to ask her to night he tiptoed his way out and nellie closed the door very cautiously behind him at that moment when she kissed him she had given him all of the very best of her she exulted in having done it but assuredly virtue had gone out of her restless and unquiet in her bed she thought over what was left for her chapter vii john mainwaring had prepared his studio for the visit of mrs wardour and silvia next day with the utmost dramatic completeness employing for their reception the scenery and the setting which suggested itself as being most likely to impress and astound with this end in view he had littered the room with all possible properties bringing down from the attics stacks of his own pictures which he disposed in careless profusion round the walls sketch books and paint boxes littered the tables lay figures peeped from behind easels robes trailed over sofa backs and he when his visitors were announced had designed that he himself should be found in his oldest velveteen coat and morocco slippers at the top of the step ladder which he had put into position again in front of the great canvas representing satan odiously whispering to the german emperor there absorbed in his inspired labours he was to be giving the last the crowning the positively final terrific touch to it as his visitors and as he hoped his victims entered since the work had actually been finished at least a month ago and on that occasion had been toasted in glasses of port wine by himself his wife and peter he had thought it prudent to inform her that more last touches were to be applied to it again to day visitors he had added were dropping in that afternoon and she would no doubt be sitting upstairs in the drawing room when they arrived with tea prepared for their refreshment when the time came he would yodel for her and she would come down be presented to mrs wardour and her daughter and would scold him for keeping these ladies looking at his stupid pictures instead of bringing them up to tea such was the general idea of the opening of a manuvre from which he with a quite incurable optimism expected very gratifying results peter had already alluded to the surprising dawn of mrs wardour on the town and he himself at the play the night before had paved the way for a commission to execute a portrait of silvia he had no idea whether or not mrs wardour inserted any of these golden tentacles with which like an octopus she appeared to be enveloping london into the domain of art but it was worth while hoping that her sense of completion would not be satisfied unless she had silvias portrait painted that so he had ascertained had not been done and he had so to speak left a card soliciting the favour of a call the call certainly was to be made that afternoon and his imagination now bit in teeth and wildly galloping foresaw another possible commission in the portrait of mrs wardour herself perhaps here was the rosiest of the summits yet in view he might profitably dispose of that great cartoon which mrs wardour would so soon be privileged to see receiving its finishing touches farther than that his vision did not definitely project itself but in sunlit and shining mists he could vaguely see himself working for all he was worth and for much of what mrs wardour was worth at more of these stupendous canvases and berthing each as soon as possible in the same remunerative harbourage the ring at the bell of the street door warned him to scamper up his step ladder and absorb himself in finishing touches at the top of the thundercloud of war in due time the studio door opened and burrows announcing his visitors had to raise her voice to the pitch of a vendor of street wares and recite the names again before she was so fortunate as to attract his attention then mr mainwaring turned slowly round with a dazed expression and shading his eyes perceived the expected presences then with brush in one hand and palette in the other he gave an ecstatic cry of welcome not to be confused with the yodelling summons for his wife and came bounding down the step ladder divesting himself of his palette and brush he held out both hands ah my dear friends he said but this is charming i am ashamed of myself to be found in such dishevelment but well we artists are like that silly donkeys as we are and i had forgotten for the moment i had forgotten the advent of my delightful visitors he held a hand of each of them for a moment with pressure and expression and then withdrew his left hand holding it to his forehead a finishing touch he said i was at that very moment putting the last touch of paint on to my canvas let me forget that give me a moment to forget it you are here that is the great point he made a splendid obeisance and as he recovered thrust back his hair and embarked on a period you find me dear mrs wardour he said in a moment of triumph of jubilation even little as that can possibly mean to others this is one of my red letter days a moment ago my brush touched my canvas for the last time my picture is done all but for the obscure initials which in vermilion i shall humbly inscribe in the corner would it by chance be of the smallest interest to you to see that little rite performed i take my brush then i squeeze out a morsel of paint i trace those obscure initials no inspiration could have been happier mrs wardours eye was already travelling over the huge canvas with rapture and astonishment and it was thrilling that she should have come just in time to see the artist testify in vermilion that this great thing was of his own creation naturally she could not be expected to know that if she had arrived half an hour ago or had not arrived for half an hour to come she would have been just in time for this ceremony she turned to silvia well if that isnt interesting silvia she said as if silvia had denied it werent we saying to each other as we came along that perhaps we should find mr mainwaring painting and what a work of art too my john mainwaring having recorded himself as creator became showman and spectator in one and moved the step ladder aside so that he should both get and give an uninterrupted view then losing himself once more as spectator he propped his chin on his hand and gazed at the work finished finished he said with a magnificent detachment now let us see what we think of it mrs wardour gazed too and the more she gazed the more powerful that was exactly the word she would have used appeared the significance of this tremendous presentment she had no great taste for pictures but if you were in pursuit of pictures and pictures had certainly been the objective of this expedition here was what she meant by a picture not long before his death her husband had bought what he called a picture or two destined to adorn the walls of the gallery which was so great a feature in the castellated residence which he had built on the ridge of ashdown forest it ran the whole length of the house and when complete as to embellishment was to be a lane of pictures from end to end hung on red spanish brocade to her mind no less than his real pictures true pictures pictures worth looking at were brightly or sombrely coloured illustrations of famous personages of well known places or told a story best of all were those that told a story a few such had already been plucked and gathered there there was a very splendid record of the coronation of queen victoria the rock of gibraltar with a p and o steamer to the left and a sunset to the right an execution of mary queen of scots and in lighter mood a delicious immensity called knights of the bath in which a small boy and a large puppy shared a sponging tin here then and now the image of the walls of the great picture gallery at present insufficiently clad and crying out for covering like a bather who has lost his clothes flashed into her mind the image was not sufficiently clearly realized to admit of a definite association of ideas between it and the allegory at which they were all gazing but certainly as she looked at the size particularly the size of mr mainwarings masterpiece the gallery at howes occurred to her if there were to be pictures here or elsewhere she liked to know what such pictures were about and she instantly perceived what this one was about now that the war was won and the german emperor for all practical purposes annihilated he had served his turn because the destruction of ships by his submarines had brought her so excessive a fortune she could perceiving the message of the picture unreservedly gloat over the realism of it if that isnt the german emperor she loudly enunciated and if that isnt satan whispering to him about the war satans saying that he would help and to be sure he tried to i do call that a picture and theres the war coming up behind like a thunderstorm theres a subject for a picture and how beautifully youve done it mr mainwaring he leaned his chin still more heavily against his hand ah you think so he asked i wish i thought so but what is there to want asked mrs wardour its all as clear as day we saw nothing so striking at the royal academy did we silvia even at the private view the academy the academy murmured mr mainwaring as if he wondered whether he had heard that name before then he shook his head gently as if abandoning the attempt to remember what the academy was and i see lots of guns and bayonets underneath the thundercloud said mrs wardour unerringly theyre coming up the artist still gazed and smoothing his chin with his hand he repeated yes theyre coming up coming up he gave a great start and seemed to shake himself like a big retriever emerging from the water where he had brought some thrown token to land he did not know of the great gallery at howes which starved for decoration but even if he had he would have bounded out of the water just like that basta basta he cried i am boring you dear ladies i am wearying you i am making myself a most unutterable tedium for you where is my wife why is she not here to tap me on the shoulder and say tea he gave the preconcerted signal of a yodel and opening the door of the studio repeated it a faint cry from upstairs answered him and on the heels of that cry mrs mainwaring came downstairs the introductions were floridly effected and she shook her finger at her husband and explained her reproof to her visitors i always tell him that when he is at his painting he never knows the time she said john it is very wrong of you to have kept mrs wardour and miss wardour down here she turned to mrs wardour as her husband vented himself in contrition and apology to silvia of course im no judge she said for i always think that everything my husband does is so striking but is not that a wonderful thing the emperor satan yes such expressive faces now i must insist on your coming to have a cup of tea i always have to drive my husband away from his easel look at him in his old coat too john im ashamed of you go and put on something more tidy silvia felt somehow as mrs mainwaring gave this skilful rendering of the general hints that she had received as if she was listening to some automaton wound up to emit through a mask like face certain words certain sentences that formed its accomplishment that was the immediate effect but immediately afterwards followed the conjecture that it was not a mere automaton that spoke it said so she seemed to gather what it had been told or thereabouts to say but probably mrs mainwaring was capable of saying and doing things for herself though she had been pulled through the funnel of mr mainwarings personality she had not lost her own individual self but what that individual self was she could form no conjecture it was as if a voice came from inside a window over which a blind had been completely drawn she could arrive at no perception of who it was who talked behind the blind nor was the room lit within so that at the least there came a shadow on the blind suggesting features all this was no more than the details of the first impression made by a new acquaintance her instinctive valuation of her hostess something to work upon provisionally mrs mainwaring was only repeating her lessons which she seemed to know so excellently well she gave at present no indication of what she was like when her lessons were over but that she existed silvia had no doubt whatever there were people like that people who had an aloof sequestered life of their own then without being conscious of the transition she knew that she was thinking of mrs mainwaring no longer but of peter more yodelling proclaimed that the artist had put on his tidy coat and he pranced back and led the way upstairs with mrs wardour saying that he was as hungry as a hunter and hoping that his wife had provided them with a good tea mrs mainwaring on the other hand seemed a little to be detaining silvia she pointed out other of the works of art that so plentifully bestrewed the room and this struck the girl somehow as being part of a manuvre in no way connected with the lesson she had so faultlessly repeated the blind had been ever so slightly pushed aside someone was looking out yes theres a picture my husband painted of my son last year she said i think youve met peter havent you miss wardour that was considered to be very like him i hope he will be home for tea he said he thought he could get away from the foreign office early to day very interesting for him to be in the foreign office silvia said something amiable about the portrait which was quite recognizable so pleased you think it like continued mrs mainwaring yes peter is at the foreign office all day and he is generally out in the evening i do not go out very much i sit at home mostly in the evening and read silvia welcomed a new topic though the blind had been distinctly twitched aside she could not see in she was only conscious of being observed but this seemed an encouraging opportunity of getting a glimpse what do you read most she asked novels memoirs no what i like reading about is places i have never been to said mrs mainwaring i wonder when i read what life is like in those places and how i should enjoy it if that was a glimpse for the girl it was a very momentary one lit so to speak not by any clear illumination but rather by some vague dim phosphorescence silvia by some whimsical association of ideas found herself thinking of a phosphorescent match box if you felt for it in the dark you might find matches there which would produce something more illuminating ah i too love new places she said i love waking in a new place where i have arrived after dark and wondering what it is going to be like the glimpse grew a little more definite i should like that too said mrs mainwaring but my husbands work keeps him in london and i do not get away very often shall we go upstairs to tea as they turned mrs mainwaring cast one glance at the great cartoon for the moment infinitesimal in duration her neat smooth porcelain face grew hostile and malevolent no sooner did silvia appear in the doorway of the little drawing room facing the street than mr mainwaring to her immense surprise bounded from his seat chassed across the room to her and fell on his knees before her behold me in an attitude of abject entreaty he said your mother subject to your acquiescence dear miss silvia has asked me to attempt to use my best endeavours feeble as they may be to render you the eager homage of an artists skill she has asked me subject to your consent i repeat to paint your portrait for her even as he spoke there came the quick light step on the stairs the identity of which silvia seldom as she had heard it knew with a certainty that surprised her and peter came in kneel peter my dear said his father enjoying himself tremendously and putting up hands of supplication maria my angel i beseech you to kneel too we are entreating miss silvia we are urging the sacred claims of art silvia gave a laugh of sheer amusement at this ludicrous situation amusement was the only possible solvent for it oh please let nobody kneel she said and you mr mainwaring please get up yes of course if my mother wishes it and if mr mainwaring will be very patient and tell me what to do he bounded up again ecstatic at the granting of his petition to do he asked dear young lady you have only got to be be be just as you are now again he supported his head on his hand as when he gazed at the cartoon and with the other shaded his eyes staring at her in an embarrassing manner he gave a gay yodelling cry i see it i see it he announced my superb picture is already flaming in my brain madam he turned to mrs wardour you shall have a masterpiece and i john mainwaring will have created it he took his hand from his forehead and made a movement as if to cast something away enough he said let us descend to earth again my angel give us our tea we are exhausted by our adventures peter so silvia noticed was looking at his father with eyebrows ever so little raised as if in contemplation of some phenomenon that however familiar was still remarkable and his lips were faintly smiling when he turned to silvia as he now did that expression still remained there and she felt that wordlessly he had somehow taken her into his confidence certainly his father amused him his raised eyebrows and half smiling mouth told her that and was there a touch of indulgent contempt in it john mainwaring continued to claim the attention of the little party in a boisterous rollicking fashion it was like being out in a high wind where shouting was the only means of communication he assuaged the hunger which he confessed was prodigious with incredible quantities of tea cakes he ate cherries backwards beginning with the stem he roared with laughter at his own jokes he apologized for his boyishness and whispered to mrs wardour that he was in for a scolding afterwards from his wife for making such a noise and there all the time far more potently vital was peter blowing off no steam like his father but quietly self containedly reserving it there was something inscrutable about that smooth handsome face though now and then as their eyes casually met silvia felt that she was looking into clear dark beckoning water and if her eyes could not fathom it that was no fault of his transparence but only of her own purblind penetration mr mainwaring was just now launched on a story the very recollection of which made him laugh in anticipation of what was coming and silvia could let her eyes roam at will she looked at her mother at the narrator at mrs mainwaring all in turn in order for the purposes of strict impartiality to look at peter as well mrs mainwaring with wifely and domestic devotion had managed to attach to her face some faint semblance of interest in the story as if it were new to her then came peters turn and that handsome inscrutability suddenly seemed to silvia to be like a reflecting surface which when you looked at it showed you not itself but presented your own image she saw not at all how he stood to her but how she stood to him her own subjective relation the image of herself regarding him was flashed back at her looking at him in some mysterious way she saw herself his dark clear water gave back to her her own soul she whisked her eyes away forgetting the impartiality of her rotation and found herself met by mrs mainwaring and there so it seemed she found comprehension of this bewildering impression as regards mrs mainwaring herself the blind was still drawn but from behind the blind silvia heard inwardly and unmistakably that quiet precise voice saying the girls in love with my peter mrs mainwaring by some divination as mysterious as herself was in possession of that she and silvia shared the secret knowledge and then before the girls eyes could shift themselves to mr mainwaring who it seemed clear from his thumping with his fist on the tea table was now at the climax of his narrative there peeped out from his wifes face that same secret malevolence with which as they left the studio she had looked at the great work of art that hung there while she admitted that her husbands work kept him and her in london the point of mr mainwarings story entailed the use of the falsetto voice and peter at its conclusion got up on the pretext of handing cigarettes and reseated himself next silvia it is good of you he said that was fragmentary enough undetached from any context but silvia found herself understanding him perfectly my mother and mr mainwaring arranged it she said i couldnt very well say no could i not that i wanted to i dont mean that my fathers delighted said peter he paused a moment hes in great form he added youve delighted him arent we a weird family there seemed no direct reply possible to this silvia could not imagine herself assenting and it seemed banal as well as untrue to say no youre quite ordinary but she found herself not wanting and not even needing to reply at all she wanted and for that matter she needed no more than to have peter there and be wonderfully happy he shifted himself a little in his very low chair as he turned to get a match for his cigarette and she again just found herself noticing little things about him his fingers were very long and smooth the nails very neatly sheathed in the skin that held them they grew beautifully best of all was the short closely clipped hair which when he bent his head forward towards the match stopped just above his collar you neednt answer that he said tell me instead what you thought of the play last night are people sentimental girls particularly like that when they are really moved i should have thought that emotion killed sentimentality but it may be different in scotland peter at the conclusion of this ridiculous speech suddenly found himself in the dilemma of talking nonsense without the co operation and backing of the person whom he was talking nonsense to silvia at any rate did not contribute any soap bubbles of her own and quick to perceive that he turned to his mother what sort of hotels are there in scotland mother he asked oh i must explain to miss wardour my mother loves reading the advertisements of hotels in bradshaw it gives her the sense of travel doesnt it mother he paused no more than infinitesimally and went on again in the same breath i love the sense of travel too and i got it by going to the foreign office guatemala has been my aprs midi silvia triumphantly applauded his quickness she had seen on mrs mainwarings face a protest at the invasion of her privacy but peter had done more than merely see it he had slammed the door again with allusions to himself and guatemala that somehow a perception as quick as intuition seemed to her extraordinarily characteristic of him there was no stumbling no hesitation where she would have drawn attention to a similar mistake by a bungling silence his mind was like the hair on his neck abrupt and crisp the ball was with peter again i nearly fell asleep over guatemala he said surely guatemala is very remote there are many things more immediately interesting nellies wedding by the way its less than a week ahead and every young man i know is buying new pocket handkerchiefs to weep into ive bought an extremely large one therell be room for you to cry into one half of it miss silvia while i cry into the other they promised to send it round on a hand trolley like a sack of coals silvia laughed ah i shall want some of that handkerchief she said but not to cry into only to wave she is going to be tremendously happy isnt she whats he like i hardly know him peter considered this hes like hes like a very tidy room he said solid furniture and not a speck of dust and the person who sits in it asked the girl nobody sits in it at least i never found anyone there philip is the room theres the times warmed and folded theres letter paper big and little and envelopes big and little perhaps nellie has found someone there philip may get under the sofa when anybody else comes in and shes very much in love with him asked silvia you ought to know she takes you out to richmond park and sits on the grass with you all afternoon silvia wrinkled up her eyes as if she were focusing that afternoon nellie dazzles me she said shes like the sun on water i expect shell make his room that tidy room look lovely but i shall never understand what nellie does i shall only understand the effect of what she has done she has a spell she makes you see what she has seen she was conscious now of receiving from peter a more direct answer of eyes than she had ever done before she knew they were talking about the same things now they might each of them though they were talking of nellie superficially the same thing have been regarding her have been framing their remarks about her from different angles given that as silvia had said she was a dazzle of sunlight as well one of them owing to the prismatic process might have been seeing blue another seeing yellow but peters answer convinced her that they were both seeing nellie from the same standpoint thats hit her he said nellie says and does nothing trivial one is continually discovering that she waves her fingers and she mutters and then afterwards you find she has been making a spell isnt she uncanny or she tells you something about yourself that you didnt know or scarcely knew and you find that it is quite solidly true is she a witch do you think silvia leaned forward towards him it was impossible not to close up with this thats just what i said to her once she said i said that she was a witch she told me something about myself that i never had known it was true it had been true all the time but literally i had never had the smallest notion of it till she told me indeed as silvia acknowledged to herself the truth of what nellie had said on that occasion was receiving a firm endorsement at this moment etched and bitten in to her consciousness from the moment of that prophetic babbling had been the image of herself in love singing so nellie had said in a boys key eager to be allowed to give homage rather than receive it eager to be allowed to love rather than permitting love with whatever ardency of welcome and here was peter repeating on general grounds exactly what she had found and in especial was finding now to be magically true since we both agree she is a witch said he we ought surely to collect evidence against her what was it she said to you that something unknown to you which you found to be true when she said it i have evidence also she said something to me last night which i didnt know but which what went through his brain at that moment with the sureness of a surgeons incision was just that which nellie had said when he told her that he was intending to ask silvia to marry him he had hedged that with the reservation that he would do so when he thought that he had a chance of success and witch like with swift incontinent prophecy she had told him that it was rather late already as regards to night the prophecy had been encouraging at the time but not convincing now he suddenly felt himself convinced why or how their conversation had only been about nellie he did not know but it seemed that nellie had penetrated where he had not there was his father sitting on the sofa beside mrs wardour there was his mother veiled and shrouded from him as she had ever been doing something with a teapot doing something with crumbs left on plates for which she made some concoction placed in the balcony outside for birds had he been alone with silvia he would have proposed to her fortified with nellies encouragement fortified even more by his present sense of its reliability then and there but unless he knelt on the floor to her as he had found his father doing when he came in oh what did nellie say to you last night asked the girl lets collect evidence as you say and have her burned outside st margarets instead of letting her marry philip inside suggested peter silvia gave a parenthetic gasp i suggested that she ought to be burned too she said more evidence please peter found her entrancing at that moment there was some keen boyish kind of frank enthusiasm about her that attacked and challenged instead of merely provoking she asked for no effort you only had to allow yourself to be caught up but its your turn he said you first suggested that nellie told you things you didnt know no it was you who said that it may have been but it was you who suggested the witch like quality you said that she makes you see what she has seen you know you did silvia ever so slightly withdrew herself did i she asked of course you did now do be fair you began and therefore its your turn to bring out the first piece of evidence it was in richmond park you know and she told you something about yourself which you didnt know peter put his hand in some judicial manner through that short crisp hair above his neck i am prepared to hear your evidence he said youre on oath get on miss silvia dont keep the court waiting silvia shot a chance arrow if i promise to tell you she said will you promise to tell me your evidence peter laughed i think were both better at cross examination than at confession he remarked oh but thats no answer she said i know it isnt it wasnt meant to be then be serious will you tell me your evidence against nellie in her character of a witch peter quite clearly let his eyes rest on the other occupants of the room one by one he looked at them no he said i suppose the trial is adjourned owing to the inexplicable coyness of the witnesses so there we are nellie will marry her philip without a stain on her blessed character in his glance round the room peter had observed that mrs wardour was trying to catch silvias eyes she would certainly succeed in doing so before long and then as her custom was she would make some faint little clucking noises like a hen that mildly wants to be let out she was incapable of going away however much she wanted to do so unless silvia took the initiative she clucked and then silvia said that it was time to go but peter did not want silvia to go just yet on the other hand if they were all to sit here until the clucking became perceptible to silvia their visitors might just as well for any practical purpose go away at once besides it was impossible to forget that nellie last night had prophesied and it had struck another as well as himself that she was a reliable seer he got up rather slowly rather tentatively and fixed in his mind was the idea that silvia would make some sort of initial step it seemed to him that they were both hand in hand it was just a question of who lifted a foot first silvia did not turn her head to look at her mother if she had she would have been bound to attend to the cluckings but what she wanted more precisely what she needed was to get away from a masked fire of elderly eyes and with peter of course just to be natural there was smouldering in this room some ember of supervision she felt herself and him under a magnifying glass being looked at being noted being examined it would answer her need perfectly well to go with him on to the balcony outside the room to see if the evening was likely to be fine to be sure that the motor was waiting here there was mr mainwaring visualizing her portrait worse than that here was the more gimlet like attention of his wife who ostensibly was making a sloppy saucer of food for the london sparrows certainly she would sooner go out on the balcony alone than remain here but when she thought of that it did not in the least satisfy her after all she did not want to sit out alone what girl would want that but she wanted to sit out there was no sort of embarrassment in her voice when she spoke to peter may we go down to your fathers studio again she asked i havent seen all i wanted to surely his glance met hers with a comprehension that seemed immeasurably marvellous yes do come down he said the clucking became inarticulate we ought to be going silvia said her mother peter took this up oh you must give miss silvia five minutes mrs wardour he said its only fair that she should know the sort of thing that fathers going to make of her mr mainwaring gave a great shout of laughter the impertinence of youth he cried peter i disown you i would cut you off with a shilling if i had one the two went down the stairs in silence in silence also they came into the studio the huge cartoon filled up one end of it on the other three sides was the stacked dbris from the attics landscapes and portraits and sketches littered the tables thats rather jolly said peter pointing to one at random and o lord my father has brought out a thing he did of me last year rather like a hair dresser not a bit said silvia but its very like you peter wheeled about and faced her evidence he said do you know what nellie said to me last night of course you dont but ill tell you now we were talking about you she said she encouraged me to think i had a chance silvia stood stock still every fibre of her stiff and arrested about you a chance said peter again is it true was she right was she being a witch silvia had been looking at him when this spell of stillness struck her now her eyelids fluttered and drooped then once more she looked at him as steadily as before all true she said and nellie told me something she said that when i loved anybody i i should love just as i love now just as i love now peter chapter viii silvia was sitting in mr mainwarings studio one saturday afternoon waiting without impatience for the arrival from the foreign office of peter with whom she was motoring down to howes there to spend the sunday silvia was perfectly capable of humour with regard to howes for she called it the family seat this indeed it was since her father had bought the norman ruin some twenty years ago and quite unmistakably it belonged to the wardours he had made it habitable while silvia was still a child and during the war when he became quite fabulously rich he made it abominable also to that period belonged the great picture gallery the gathering there for the week end was though small a rather crucial one it was to introduce to each other the families which would be brought into alliance over her wedding henry wardour silvias uncle on her fathers side was to be ponderously there and his wife elegantly so then there was to be aunt joanna darley mrs wardours sister and her husband he sir abel darley was a round pink profiteer who in recognition of the considerable fortune he had made for himself by overcharging the government for millions of yards of khaki had been made a baronet presumably in order to stop his mouth if he felt inclined to brag over the gullible government then there was mr mainwaring to represent peters side of the connection but he was to sustain his part alone since mrs mainwaring with an impregnable quietness of negation had absolutely refused to take part in this reunion of families youll be eight without me silvia she had said and eights a very good number i shall stop quietly in london and think of you all enjoying yourselves silvias sense of humour prevented her from forming any tragic anticipations about this party though as she would have been perfectly willing to confess she did not suppose that the meeting of the clans would lead to any instinctive blood brotherhood but peter would be there and she would be there and however outrageous and incompatible the rest of them proved themselves they would be like the heathen furiously raging together but unable to disturb seriously the foundation fact of that she trusted to her own sense of humour and to peters to enable them both to be indifferent to what happened outside their own charmed corner uncle henry and uncle abe and mr mainwaring and peter would form a very curious company after dinner that night when she and her mother and aunt joanna and aunt eleanor had left them to punish as uncle henry would undoubtedly say the port of which he was so inordinately fond while the ladies would form an equally inconceivable committee upstairs but since these things were to be there was no use in imagining impossible situations somehow she conjectured that mr mainwaring would impress himself more strongly on the circle downstairs than either of the uncles he had more exuberance if silvia had been set down to construct an incongruous party of eight she could not by any fantastic selection have bettered this gathering aunt joanna for instance nourished an ineradicable hatred towards her sister for having married silvias father and for being so much richer than sir abe and even sir abes rank and her own were powerless to compensate her for this rich immensely rich sir abe certainly was but she could not bear that her sister should be so much richer aunt eleanor on the other hand mrs wardours sister in law had only reverence for mrs wardours wealth but what she thoroughly despised her for was her truckling so aunt eleanor put it to the smart world aunt eleanor had been present at the great party where the russian ballet entertained the guests and the presence of so many distinguished people made her feel perfectly sick the true diagnosis of her indisposition however was that since she had tried to do for years without a particle of success what mrs wardour had so brilliantly accomplished in a few weeks it was only reasonable that she should have a violent reaction against that sort of thing if instead of marrying peter silvia had been about to wed a peer or somebody of that kind aunt eleanor would certainly have felt it her duty never to speak to either her or her mother again indeed she would never have accepted mrs wardours invitation at all so she had made quite plain unless she had felt it her duty to take an interest in her husbands relations silvia was conscious of a vein of caricature in this flitting survey but ridiculous people made caricatures of themselves without the collusion of the observer mr mainwaring was a caricature too she could not think of him quite seriously probably most people if you regarded them from a strictly individual standpoint had a touch of caricature about them for if you rated yourself as a normal person everybody else must be a little out of drawing but she looked at the caricatures with the friendliest amusement she loved them and here in particular was her mother included for being so entirely different from her for being in fact precisely what they were humorous observation was with her less a critical than an appreciative process and now as she waited for peter she wanted definitely to include mrs mainwaring in her fascinating gallery but for this last fortnight since her engagement to peter she had found herself increasingly unable to give her this genial amused observation more and more did mrs mainwaring baffle and elude her there was so far as silvia could notice nothing humanly ridiculous about her and what was even more disconcerting the girl found herself ever more incapable of attaching herself to her to attempt to do that resembled in some uncomfortable manner the notion of attaching yourself in the dark to a hard smooth surface you could nowhere get hold of her or find projection or crevice in which to crook or to insert a finger tip the more closely silvia looked at her the more strenuously she attempted to get into any sort of psychical contact with mrs mainwaring the more directly was she baffled she could not for herself give up as insoluble the mystery of that ladys mental and spiritual processes there must be if you could only lay your hands on it in the dark some key to her future mother in law something that explained for instance her unwearied study of the advertisements of hotels no one could be as completely tranquil and emotionless all through as mrs mainwaring appeared to be twice only had her mind slipped for a definite instant into the open like a lizard emerging into the sunlight and flicking back again once when on the first visit that silvia and her mother had paid to the house mrs mainwaring unveiled a glance of malicious hostility in the direction of the great cartoon less definite but like in kind was the habitual though veiled hostility with which silvia felt that mrs mainwaring regarded herself it did not flame but she knew that she was right in conjecturing that it incessantly smouldered and that enmity to silvias sense was of the same quality though smouldering as that which had leaped in that swift little tongue of flame towards the cartoon what puzzled her was the kinship between the two from the context of that moment in the studio it seemed to be mr mainwarings work which kept him in london and her therefore with him that had kindled that odd swift spark or was the origin of it a little deeper down than that did some shut furnace of impatience at her husband so floridly symbolized there some deep seated core of incompatibility suddenly flame out then if so what was the kindred nature of her hostility to the girl was it that she was taking peter away from the home which his presence there just rendered tolerable but apart from those two escapes so to speak of genuine feeling the origin of which after all was only a matter of conjecture silvia had no clue to mrs mainwaring at all she was practically featureless and even without outline she could not sketch her at all or delineate from her as model one of those genial caricatures such as her friends so freely supplied her with material for such features and such outline as she could perceive were tinged with bitter suggestions silvia did not find the waiting for peter in any way tedious there was plenty in the studio to furnish a larder for thought though what most occupied her was her alert attention for the sound of his light footstep coming down the passage but apart from that food for reflection was abundant to day the end of the studio where the cartoon had hung was empty so that if mrs mainwarings resentment was inspired purely by that work of art she might now regain her tranquillity again silvia would see it this evening for her mother following up the idea with which it had first fired her in connection with the empty walls of the picture gallery at howes had a few days ago made a purchase of it mr mainwaring had been very glorious on this occasion at first he had hysterically refused to part with it it was his chef duvre and while he had a couple of pennies in his pocket he was though poor too proud to think of selling it then lest that refusal should be taken too seriously he almost immediately declared that it should be his wedding present to silvia he let himself be hunted out of so untenable a magnificence and finally he so far humiliated himself as to accept a fancy price for it as mrs wardour knew he reminded her to make certain that it was the first of a series of six upon which he was contented to stand or fall in the verdict of posterity it seemed probable that at some future time the walls of the picture gallery at howes would be far less empty than they were to day on an easel near where silvia sat was the portrait of herself now approaching completion to her there was something uncanny and arresting about it for by accident or design the artist had caught some aspect of her which secretly she recognized as a piece of intimate revelation she herself inclined to an accidental derivation for certainly in all but one point it was a flamboyant and uninspired performance a chronicle of a green jumper and a scarlet skirt a haystack of dyed hair and a rouged simpering mouth her head was turned full to the spectator looking over the shoulder in precisely the same pose a favourite trick of the artists as that in which the german emperor listened to satanic counsels but in the eyes in the badly drawn outstretched hand clumsily posed silvia saw some unconscious rendering of the boys key she acquitted mr mainwaring of all intention and of all inspiration he had certainly not meant that he had through faulty drawing given a certain brisk violence to her hand a certain domination to her eyes and then she heard the click of the street door and the quick light footstep for which she had been waiting she wondered if she could ever get used to the mere fact of peters return from however short an absence he kissed her holding her hand for a moment its too bad of me to have kept you waiting he said i couldnt help myself there was a messenger starting for rome havent they brought you tea no i thought i would wait and have it with you peter rang the bell and my fathers gone he asked yes mother called for him and drove him down ive brought my little cording car for us just you and me thatll be lovely said peter do i quite trust your driving though you may drive yourself if you like said she no thanks i trust that far less i must see if my bag is packed tell burrows we want tea at once cant i help you to pack it if it isnt done asked silvia somehow she would have liked to do that to fold his clothes to squeeze out his sponge no its so sordid said peter besides its probably done already if it isnt call me said she no man has any idea of how to pack and you want to teach me asked peter lingering on the stairs silvia hesitated only for a moment no you darling she said i dont want to teach you anything i just want to do it why asked he she came closer raising her face towards him as he leaned over the banisters your things she said your sponge your coat that pleasure was denied her for burrows had already bestowed peters requirements in his bag and he came downstairs again silvia had given his father a sitting for the portrait this morning and he stood frowning in front of it trash rubbish he said at length and the worst of it is that he has got into it some infernal resemblance to you its a caricature oh were all caricatures to each other said she with just a few exceptions what a heathenish doctrine why am i a caricature for instance you arent youre one of the exceptions but tell me what your father has caricatured of me in that peter looked from her to the portrait and back again all of you he said the reality of you the rest is quite unlike you havent got mouth and nose and forehead and hair and chin the least like that but the person inside is horribly like you silvia put her arm through his horribly she said thanks so much i didnt say just then that you were horrible said he i said horribly like you your parody your caricature i wonder how i dared ask such a masterful young woman to marry me you knew it would be good for you said silvia it was far more daring of me to accept you theres just time for you to remedy your mistake said he positively the last chance this frank kind of chaffing talk as between friends rather than lovers had grown to be characteristic of their privacy silvia delighted in it it had the charm of some cipher about it the blunt commonplace words held for her a secret meaning known to the two utterers of them which was only to be expressed by these symbols when she feigned to misunderstand peter and thanked him for calling her horrible there lay below her foolish words a treasure which words were quite powerless to express or when he just now wondered that he had dared to ask her to marry him she felt that he conveyed something which no amount of impassioned speech could have indicated so well from the hilltops there flashed the signal that no voice could convey then sometimes as now she had to use another symbol which again was only a symbol and with her hands tremblingly eagerly shyly clasping him round the neck she drew his head down towards her not kissing him but simply looking close into his eyes positively the last chance she said oh peter what a fool i am about you doesnt it bore you frightfully frightfully said peter keeping to the first code of symbols you bear it beautifully darling she said oh shall i ever get used to you i hope so i mustnt go on being such a donkey all my days no i dont think i do hope so being a donkey is good enough for me hee haw oh let go heres burrows coming with the tea shell think it so undignified it was as a matter of fact she who had to let go as burrows entered followed by mrs mainwaring silvia had before now tried to call her mother but the experiment somehow had not succeeded mrs mainwaring answered to it quite readily but she received it so the girl thought much as she might have received an unsolicited nickname why mrs mainwaring she said i didnt know you were in mrs mainwaring paused just long enough to let it be inferred that if silvia had made any inquiries as to that she would have obtained the information she sought yes dear i have been reading upstairs since lunch time she said i came to have a cup of tea with you before you started i hope you will have a pleasant drive silvia tried to approach ah do come too she said change your mind and come with me heaps of room thank you dear i think i will keep to my original plan said she i like a quiet sunday sometimes i shall go to church and perhaps in the afternoon hear a concert at the queens hall the time will pass very pleasantly there was an aura of correct armed neutrality about this accompanied as it was by that cold sheathed glance furtive and hostile that caused some half comic half impatient despair in the girl at her aloofness mrs mainwaring so it seemed to her wanted nobody except herself she wanted just to be let alone father went off all right asked peter yes mrs wardour kindly called for him after lunch a beautiful car so roomy there was another lady and gentleman there i think mrs wardour said it was her sister and her husband your father insisted on going in the box seat with the driver he made a great noise with the motor horn which sounded like a bugle he was in very high spirits the neutrality exhibited in this speech was almost too correct to be credible nobody could have been so neutral even mrs mainwaring could not quite keep it up and something very far from neutral lay ever so little below the surface in her announcement of her husbands high spirits her neutrality towards silvia was not so deadly as that towards her husband peter laughed there was neutrality there too but it was more contemptuous than deadly and quite good humoured in its contempt oh theyll have a noisy drive he said and if mrs wardour drives him back on monday youll be aware of their approach mother while theyre still a mile or two away mrs mainwaring had one of those fine lipped mouths very neat and finished at the outer corners about which it is impossible to say whether they are smiling or not without consulting the conditions prevailing round the eyes but as peter spoke she very definitely ceased to smile monday she said i thought mrs wardour was so kind as to ask him to stop till tuesday peter got up he noticed nothing about his mother having long ago given up any attempt to comprehend her tuesday is it he said im back on monday anyhow otherwise what would happen to our foreign relations shall we start silvia im ready when you are mrs mainwaring rose too yes indeed you had better be off she said you wont have too much time then i shall expect you on monday peter tell your father she stopped that you dont expect him till tuesday asked he without the slightest indication of any mental comment yes i think mrs wardour quite took for granted that he was stopping till then silvia made one further attempt to evoke a touch of cordiality mother will be delighted she said but its horrid for you being all alone no dear i shall be very happy said mrs mainwaring with quiet decision howes stood of course in a park of considerable acreage surrounded by a massive brick wall and reflected its colossal self in the lake that lay below its terraced garden this lake had been artificially made by the damming up of the stream that had previously wasted itself unornamentally and the road that had dipped into the shallow valley now ran along the causeway that formed the farther margin of the lake and gave the visitor his first complete and stupendous view of the house the wings and galleries that had been built out rendered the original norman core comparatively insignificant and the whole resembled an apotheosis of a station hotel combined with a fortress for the character of the older part was borne out in the battlemented walls that spread so amply to right and left of it an avenue of monkey puzzlers led up to the long faade and the gardens overlooking the lake were like some glorified arboretum where you might expect tin labels asking visitors to keep off the grass and not touch the flowers at intervals along the edge of its immense lawns were aloes in square green tubs and below the house was a riband border of geraniums calceolarias and lobelias inside the expectations aroused by this sumptuous exterior were fully justified for the high panelled hall was peopled with suits of armour each with its numbered label so that a glance at the catalogue would put you into possession of interesting information about it armour had long been a hobby of the late mr wardour and he had very quaintly installed electric light in the gauntleted hands there was a passenger lift in one corner a groined roof and the famous malachite table heads and antlers of stags hung in the panels silvia had rather dreaded this moment the whole place with its monkey puzzlers and malachite its aloes and its awfulness had been left by her father to her absolutely and peter knew and she knew he knew that he was making his first acquaintance with what would be home to him she had not seen it herself since the day of her fathers funeral two years ago and it seemed to her and how would it strike peter that though it had the traditional quality of home in that there was no place as far as she was aware in the least like it its unique fulfilment of that definition was its only merit with a sideways glance now and again she had observed peters growing awe from the time they had crossed the causeway the pride of it to their approach through the monkey puzzlers and to the final revelation of the malachite table and there was much more to follow ever so much more the gothic staircase the blue drawing room the pink drawing room the picture gallery the swimming bath and it was not inanimate magnificence alone that was to assail him for there was uncle henry and uncle abe and aunts joanna and eleanor she ought to have brought him down quietly and alone for his first sight of howes peter had been gazing in a fascinated manner at the malachite table and even while silvia was wondering how to convey to him her sympathy and encouragement he with one of the flashes of intuition which she adored in him showed that he had comprehended with unerring accuracy what she was feeling about him but youre going to be here he said just as if she had spoken out all that she was puzzling over she took his arm oh my dear i promise you that she said and ive got to get used to it too but then youll be here shall we butter each others paws peter until we feel at home lets have some more tea in fact and find where the rest of them are the picture gallery seemed a likely kind of place and there indeed the six representatives of the families proved to be and when kissing ceremonies were over for herself and the rite of introduction for peter silvia found herself thinking that it was really all for the best that they should have burst on peter in one comprehensive revelation rather than that he should have been subjected to a series of shocks and surprises already staggered by uncle henry peter might have been quite thrown off his balance so flashed the alternative comedy through her head by uncle abe or what if reeling from aunt eleanor he ran into aunt joanna just round the corner silvia had not the smallest inclination or intention to be ashamed of her relations but it would have shown the joylessness of a puritan not to be amused at the blandness and the blankness on so many faces peters included as he was taken to each in turn it would have shown too an almost dangerous rigidity that her voice should not betray a tremor of suppressed hilariousness aunt eleanor came first she looked like a handsome seal with adenoidal breathing she bowed to peter with freezing propriety but when he was moved on to aunt joanna her curiosity got the better of her and she instantly put up her glasses to get a better look at him aunt joanna large and marvellously bedizened with flowers in her hat and her bosom and her hand irresistibly suggested a van going to covent garden in the early morning she too had her notions of propriety and these expressed themselves in a cordiality as warm as aunt eleanors was cold then came uncle abe who was so like a fish that it really seemed dangerous for him to be sitting so near aunt eleanor he held out a hand and took a cigar out of his mouth which remained open in the precise shape of the cigar and finally came uncle henry who was busy with a drop of brandy because tea as he instantly proceeded to inform peter gave him heartburn then all four of them stared at peter to see how he was going to comport himself peter was never more grateful to his father than when at this embarrassing moment mr mainwaring who had been mysteriously employed at the far end of the picture gallery with a cord and a sheet and a step ladder and three bewildered footmen gave a loud yodel set to some words like mio figlio to announce his perception of his sons arrival and the accomplishment of that on which he had been so busily engaged ben arrivato was the concluding stave of his melody and he came running up the gallery there was quite enough space to enable him to get a good speed up and after holding peter for a moment in a joint embrace with silvia he cast himself down for a moment on a white bear skin at mrs wardours feet ecco he said ladies and gentlemen when you will distinguish me with the gift of a moment of your leisure i shall have the honour to show you the first of my completed labours the picture the poor suppliants picture is on the wall masked by a fair linen sheet which so i fondly hope is in control of a cord just a cord which when you are ready i will in fact pull unless the mechanism which i have been contriving is sadly at fault there will then be revealed to you that which the sheet at the moment is so discreetly veiling valour perhaps my valour is but the worse part of discretion peter had heard this before but for the moment i am less discreet than valorous i will show you complete and materialized the vision that since august has obsessed and dominated my life i pray you gentle sirs and madams to indulge your humble servant and to take your places exactly where i shall have the honour to indicate opposite the discretionary linen which when removed will unbare my valour he rose from his reclining posture and after a superb obeisance placed himself at the head of the procession already as silvia had foreseen he was in a position of dominance uncle abe and uncle henry obeyed his orders aunt joanna and aunt eleanor clearly perked up at this ingratiating suppliance for himself he took mrs wardours hand holding it high as in a minuet and led the way he grouped them he requested them all with humble apologies to have the goodness to move a step backwards he set chairs for them he put his finger on his lips and on tiptoe advanced to the dangling end of the cord and pulled it up flew the sheet waving wildly but eventually festooning itself clear of the cartoon then swiftly retreating he magnificently posed himself and gazed at the picture for the moment there was dead silence then vague clickings and murmurs began to grow articulate the uncles and aunts vied with each other in perception the emperor said uncle henry good likeness eh august exclaimed lady darley terrible wonderful and she drew in her breath with a hissing sound the perception of the date was not so clever as it was largely inscribed on the frame and aunt eleanor smiled indulgently yes dear joanna she said we all see that but look at satan whispering to the emperor and the hosts of hell said joanna swiftly uncle abe turned to uncle henry a marvellous thing he said tells its own story i call that a picture mrs wardour merely wore the pleased air of proprietorship she had seen it all before and she could see it again as many times as she chose mr mainwaring chin in hand just contemplated while these appreciations were in progress but now he seemed to wake out of a swoon and passed his hands over his eyes was it i who painted that he muttered i didnt know what i was doing i didnt know till this moment when at last i see my work properly displayed with no discordant note to mar it what i had done does it terrify you dear ladies and gentlemen does it put you in possession of august does it ah dio mio he covered his face with his hands and shuddered then advancing to the picture again he violently shook the cord and the two linen sheets double bed rolled back into their original places enough enough he cried we will contemplate it more calmly when we have recovered from the first shock of our bleeding hearts let us converse let us smile and laugh again let us remember that the war is over but it is laid on me by destiny to execute five more such pictures not less terrible if i live they shall be done yes yes i do not falter but for a while let me forget let me forget mrs wardour spaced out the wall with a pleased eye they will just fill the length of the gallery she said if we do not crowd them silvia my dear you must persuade mr mainwaring well im sure if that isnt the dressing bell a vindictive purpose was weaving itself below the embowering flowers of lady darleys hat and accelerating the heart beat below the nosegay on her bosom so that the gardenias were all of a tremble lucy might be rich indeed it was quite certain that she was horribly rich but comparative paupers such as herself were not to be altogether trampled upon and other people beside lucy had picture galleries apparently the series of these tremendous allegories was not yet painted was not yet either definitely bespoken by her sister and joanna as she waded through the thick kidderminster rugs that carpeted the gothic staircase on the way to her room felt that the only thing in life that was worth living for at this moment was to order a replica of the first and secure with an embargo on replicas the remainder of this series never in her life had she been so artistically overwhelmed as by that prodigious canvas and if all the rest were going to be up to sample she could as their possessor scoff at the art treasures of the world sir abe had dabbled in pictures already he had a turner sunset which hung in the dining room at which he often pointed over his shoulder as a pooty little thing he had a rembrandt of a very puckered looking old woman which had aroused the envy of those who were permitted to see it and to be told that it came out of the marquis of brentfords collection these were desirable possessions but they were jejune compared to mr mainwarings masterpiece and the masterpieces that were to follow the war that was something to paint pictures about her envy of her sister rose to the austerity of a passion when she contemplated the equipment of her bedroom and that of her husband next door there was a bathroom attached to each both fitted with the most amazing taps and squirts and a little sitting room attached to each and a lift of which mrs wardour showing her her room and hoping she would be comfortable explained the working you pressed a button and were wafted the same lift served aunt eleanors rooms but lucy and peter and silvia used another one the lift clinched her resolution and she conjugally conferred with sir abe he to her delight was as much impressed with the passion for scoring off lucy as with the merits of the cartoon but his business habits had to make hesitations and conditions not do a deal blindly well my lady he said you shall have the pictures if theyre to be obtained reasonably what shall i offer now most striking that one was and that and similar are worth paying a pretty penny for what did your sister give for that one then if reasonable i dont mind if i add twenty five per cent more and secure the lot theyll be something to point at get along and let me have my bath you try to find out what your sister paid and then well know where we are my lady she noted with pleasure that he relapsed into a cockney accent and a slight uncertainty about aspirates as he spoke that was a good sign it showed he was in earnest and interested for in dalliance of light conversation sir abe was as good at his hs as anybody it was not to be expected that the cartoon and the magnificence of its introduction should have no effect on aunt eleanor or that her general animosity towards mrs wardour being of the same fine order as aunt joannas she should not have been kindled with ambition to bring off some similar vindictive stroke but for her the acquisition of these immense decorations was out of the question for her husband would certainly not pay such a price as she felt sure would be necessary to secure them and even if he did his house did not contain sufficient uninterrupted wall space so that to hang them at all she would have to cut them up into sections and paper several different rooms with them but mr mainwaring had said something about the original sketches for them which had suggested an idea that took her fancy at once the sketches were after all the originals the significant buds from which these over blown blossoms had developed and the sketches would be far more manageable both from point of view of hanging and from that of purchase there was a subtlety a refinement in possessing originals that these acreages of paint could not compete with her powerful imagination pictured herself exhibiting them to envious friends yes my sister in law i believe has copies on a large scale she would say of my series these of course are the originals such freshness such power all quite lost in the later and larger version and she held her seal like head very high and snorted through her nostrils as she sailed into the pink drawing room just before the dinner bell rang she was the first to come down and had time to examine with pain and disgust the photograph of a royal personage with a crown on its frame that stood very conspicuously alone on the table by the sofa where she seated herself mr mainwarings star continued to be violently ascendant all evening his harangues his humour his habit of pausing in the middle of one of his interminable stories until complete silence had been established round the table dominated dinner and when the ladies rose to leave the gentlemen to their cigars and wine mrs wardour addressed him directly and laid upon him not to permit them too long a sitting this gave him the rank of host and developed his social horse power to so high an efficiency that on rejoining the ladies he sang the toreadors song out of carmen then after that had been repeated he permitted the uncles and aunts to indulge themselves with bridge and since wives partnered their own husbands this gave scope for some pleasant family revilings in which the ladies came off far the best having thus arranged for their pleasure mr mainwaring grouped himself with his hostess silvia and peter and grew patriarchal and full of sentiment over the charming family party of parents and children on mrs wardours going to bed leaving the bridge party jealously over calling their hands he conducted her once more to pay homage to the cartoon and remained there in meditation silvia and peter had wandered out on to the dusky terrace a twilight of stars lit the still night and she drew long breaths of restoration from the exhaustion of these stupendous hours once clear of the house and leaning over the balustrade above the lake she gave way to hopeless laughter peter darling are my relations more than you ought to be asked to stand she said did you know there were such people as uncle abe did you know there were such people as my father said peter oh but hes your father said silvia quickly you mustnt bring him in why not after all its he who brings himself in theres only one word for him bounder uncle abe isnt a bounder exactly uncle henry isnt a bounder no hes just a cad said silvia enthusiastically i love people being themselves whatever they happen to be i should enjoy them much more though if you werent here i can go to morrow morning said peter for one moment she thought that he spoke seriously the next she laughed at herself for having been hoaxed by his assumed sincerity of voice assumed it just had to be ah you said that beautifully she announced and all the evening do you know youve been saying things beautifully with your mask on too your best and smartest mask ive been listening to you and never for a moment could i catch a word or a silence on your part to show that you werent thoroughly amused and interested by the aunts you behaved as if they were just the sort of people you were accustomed to meet but rather more charming you have been convincing and you were convincing just now when you suggested going away to morrow peter had not of course meant to convey that he really could go away to morrow but it had been quite easy for him to render his seriousness plausible since though impossible this was a most agreeable project but what rendered that project so attractive was the escape not from the aunts and uncles with whom he was quite as willing to be diverted as their niece but from his father his father in this milieu with his bounce and his bounding his general make up of the large souled childlike artist now humbly bespeaking the indulgence of his patrons and immediately afterwards behaving as if he was michael angelo was intolerable his gaiety his singing his family grouping with himself as aged and contemplative parent while the moment before he had been twirling his moustaches and bellowing out the song of the toreador were indecencies for a sons eye if only he had been slightly fuzzy and intoxicated with many liqueur brandies like uncle henry that would have been a palliative as it was he was only intoxicated with himself peter recalled himself from these impious meditations to the needs of or if not the needs the appropriateness for the immediate occasion silvia and he had contrived a lovers interlude under the stars will you always be as charitable to me as you are to my father he asked when i am absurd and annoying will you just be amused the question seemed to him well framed it led him and her away from all these nonsensicalities into the region where the simple things abided he expected some pressure on his arm some little deprecation of his silliness some whisper to inform him that he was a goose or an idiot instead silvias hand slackened in the crook of his arm and withdrew itself oh peter what a thing to ask she said as if i could be charitable to you as long as you loved me or as if i could find you annoying so long as i loved you youre pretending not to understand dont pretend like that any more peters quick brain was alert on the scent he had meant his words to be construed into a lover like speech and had completely thought that they could be interpreted thus but her answer convinced him that to her they were not construable at all but only gibberish before he could emend himself or even quite follow her she flashed out her full meaning anybody else in the world except you can be annoying she said and i hope i can be charitable to anybody else in the world except you but how can i be charitable to you or how can you be trying to me dont you know that i am you for a month ive ceased to be myself at all there isnt any me it isnt me you think you are in love with its its just the completion of your own wonderfulness and as for their being any you why youve ceased long ago ive absorbed you ive ive drowned you in myself and in my adoration im round you i crush you and i worship you silvia broke off suddenly as there appeared at the drawing room window a black tall silhouette yodelling and crying coo ee children oh damn that man said she sorry peter but well there it is chapter ix peter was sitting so superbly that it might have been called lying on a long dream provoking chair set outside the south faade at howes for the moment he was alone and he surprised himself with the unbidden thought of how seldom he had been alone during the last fortnight since the day of the wedding which had taken place in the unfashionable early days of september this constant companionship of silvia their motor drives their golf their fishing in the lake their long sittings with books or newspapers of which but little was read had seemed to him as he looked back on them conglomerated and coagulated like little drops of mercury running together to form a globular brightness to have been wholly delightful and satisfying these days had been for him in fact a soft luminous revelation of how completely pleasant days could be without a touch of complacency he could not help knowing how every word and every whim of his had seemed adorable to silvia and he knew that search as he might he did not propose to search at all he would be able to find no movement or mood of hers that he could have corrected or rectified she had taken possession of him tenderly and as if with held breath watched beautifully bright eyed to discover and anticipate the moods of his desires and in answer he had given her not acquiescence alone but the eager consent of every fibre of his being it seemed perfect that she should be like that silvia had just left him to meet her mother who at the expiration of their uninterrupted fortnight was coming down to howes that day and peter alone for an hour on this september afternoon let the hot sunshine fructifying and caressing melt the marrow of his bones the impressed records on his brain into definite consciousness the bees humming over the flower beds the red admiral butterflies opening and shutting their vermilion streaked wings the swallows not yet gathering for their autumn departure all conduced to leisurely summer like meditation and he found himself in possession of propositions and conclusions which he had scarcely known were his this supreme sense of content came first that like a wash of warm colour underlay the details that now began with a finer brushwork to outline themselves and each of them appeared equally admirable equally germane to the values of the emerging picture mrs wardours arrival was an important touch it might almost be called a fresh wash of colour out of numerous reflections considerations weighings of this and that each of them at the time too liquid and inconclusive to call a plan a plan now had certainly crystallized they the three contributory contrivers of it had so to speak pooled the london house and this making two houses for the three of them peter would be returning to his work in whitehall next day and since no sane being would wish to remain in london in these mellow radiances of september and october for longer than was absolutely necessary he would as a rule flow up in the swiftest of cars in the morning and stream back again in the late afternoon for one reason or another again he might find himself wanting or being obliged to spend a night in town he would be away all day anyhow and what could be more convenient than mrs wardours perfect willingness to establish herself for the present at howes where she would supply companionship for silvia and find it herself silvia again might want to spend a day or two in town and her mother could please herself as to whether she joined her or not from such a germ the idea of keeping both houses pooled and permanently open for any or all of them had easily developed headquarters for the present would be in the country and london to mrs wardours notion would be something of a picnic with the house half shut up but with four or five servants there there would she hoped be no angles of real discomfort mrs wardour then to all intents and purposes was to live with them but peter so ran the deed was master at howes while in london he and silvia would have the wide licence of guests peculiarly privileged at liberty to ask friends there whenever they wished the crystallization of it the definite statement and treaty after infinite probings and testings on her part into peters most intimate feelings on the subject had been entirely silvias it had been she who had finally suggested it with the proviso that anybody by which she undoubtedly meant her husband was to tear up the treaty without any possibility of offence if he found it unworkable or unsatisfactory but as he thought over it now he was frankly surprised at himself to find how eminently satisfactory a fulfilment of it he augured silvia had suggested it there was the great point and though he felt that he could not himself have conceivably presented a treaty like that to her for her signature he applauded her insight in so doing a man could hardly have suggested that to the girl he had but lately married it would have savoured would it not of his considering that the ideal arrangement did not procure for them their own undiluted companionship but she had known that he would not put such a construction on her proposition she did not in fact let an attitude which would have been typically feminine deter her from adopting this more sensible and more manly pose but that was silvia all through there was a robust quality about her an impotence to harbour littlenesses they expected another visitor that day in the person of peters father who had in a letter which was no less than a bouquet of flowering eloquence indicated that for the due the supreme the sublime execution of the second cartoon it was necessary for the artist to soak himself once more in the contemplation of the first so as this was rather involved to catch to the fraction of a tone the key in which it was pitched there had to be a gradual crescendo a deliberate tuning up and up a continual ascent throughout the series shorn of the mixture of metaphor he wanted to study the first cartoon before plunging with the aid of his sketches into the remainder these sketches he added were as soon as he had finished with their use to pass out of his possession for the charming mrs henry wardour had induced him to let her purchase them at a figure which convinced him that they would find an appreciative home then the letter became slightly mysterious the projected series of cartoons he had reason to know was exciting stupendous interest in artistic circles flattering perhaps a man who was proud of his work ought not to say flattering evidence of that was to hand evidence substantial and conclusive he had not made this was lucky since he would not have dreamed of going back on his bargain he had not made any contract with mrs wardour to whom all salutations about the rest of the series and thought himself fortunate in not parting with them for a comparative pittance he did not mark you my peter complain of the price she had paid him for the first of them and he was quite sure that with peters assistance everything would be arranged quite satisfactorily peter had read this letter which he must talk over with silvia on her return with the detachment of which he was so terribly capable and had come to the conclusion that his father had somehow induced a deluded crsus of some sort to offer a higher price per cartoon for his future perpetrations than that which his mother in law had no doubt already given him for the first for this deduction he had the most cordial welcome as long as his father was dumping his beastly goods so peter was now at liberty to think on the picture gallery at howes for fancy if not fantastic prices he could not in mere pious decency put it to mrs wardour that she was paying as he supposed heavily for colossal rubbish but his fathers letter maturely considered made it quite certain that somebody was willing to pay more for rubbish than mrs wardour already the general question had received his attention mrs wardour was so he supposed under contract to buy those melodramatic daubs for the decoration of a house that belonged to silvia and of which he by attested treaty was master so long as his father could profitably dispose of this rubbish here peter was filially prohibited from any protest but when once his father announced that he was receiving a mere pittance though without complaint for what he would in another market receive a less despicable dole his son surely was free to welcome his taking his wares elsewhere his son in any case was heart and soul allied to the new enterprise for already peter had experienced a vivid distaste of the fact that he countenanced by mere acquiescence this further decoration of howes he knew that if the artist had not been his father he must have already protested against the bargain which perhaps was not yet complete on either side his acquiescence in fact had brought home to him that his father was profiting by his marriage then so swiftly and involuntarily that he had not time to stop the thought on the threshold there burst into the door of his mind the inquiry as to whether he too as well as his father was not unloading rubbish at a high price and the price that he peter was receiving for his rubbish was infinitely the higher his father received no doubt a substantial cheque he himself received as far as the material consideration went an immunity from the meaning of cheques and in a standard immeasurably higher some sort of blank cheque which as silvia told him one night or was in the middle of telling him when his father made that flamboyant interruption would be honoured by her to any figure he chose to fill in and yet leave her richer in such standard than ever there in that immortal bank he divined then and knew now her illimitable credit whatever she paid out by that in the royal mathematics of love was she the richer the impression made by that unsolicited thought was to him like having seen some pass book of the soul which was hers it had blown open in front of his eyes and before he had so to speak time to close it he had caught a glimpse of sums so vast that they exceeded his powers of realization his eye in that involuntary survey had received no impression of his payments into her account the credit side was but a catalogue of her own inconceivable affluence every moment it seemed she was giving and every moment her bounty flowed back to her it was with some kind of sceptical envy that in that glimpse he realized this omnipotent finance it was not so marvellous that love should be stronger than death the miracle was that it could be so much stronger than life it was at this moment in peters reflections a moment that only half realized he was glad to get away from that an interruption reasonably claiming his attention occurred in the shape of a little old butler who had been drafted down here from london in view of mrs wardours advent he was black eyed and grey headed and perky in movement to an extent that fully justified peters exclamation of the jackdaw when he had quitted the scene last night and now the jackdaws immediate mission was to hand peter a couple of letters on an immense silver salver and inquire where mr mainwaring who so the jackdaw understood was to arrive that evening should be put he should be put clearly in the place that would please him most for this was peters undeviating creed when self sacrifice was not involved and beyond doubt the state rooms so called would please his father inordinately the state rooms had been insisted on in the rebuilding of the house by his father in law in a rich vision so silvia had half piously half humorously intimated of royal personages being sumptuously housed there there was a tremendous tapestried bedroom en suite with a second bedroom a breakfast room a sitting room all tapestry and oak mantelpieces and silver sconces yes the state rooms for mr mainwaring silvia they were on humorous terms now about peters father would enjoy that immensely peter took his letters from the jackdaw as the latter gave a pleasant sort of croak in answer to this order and remembered how nellie had once said that wealth was not an accident but an attribute a quality he had been disposed to dispute that at the time but somehow his own allocation of the state rooms to his father confirmed the suspicion that she was right he himself for instance was clearly a different person in the eyes of his father now when he could gloriously endow him with state rooms from what he had been when he as on that same occasion he told nellie only lived in the beastly little house off the brompton road because free meals and free lodging were a consideration to his exiguous purse you were different nellie was right when you could dispense material magnificence instead of accepting a tolerable shelter where though the rain was kept out the odour of dinner with that careless burrows could not be kept in still fingering his letters and trying to insert a thumb into a too honestly adhesive envelope flap peter slightly amplified by corrobative illustration this thesis how often had he so to speak sung for his dinner accepting and welcoming such invitations as mrs trentham extended to him by which for the pleasure of comfortable decent food he had gladly spent an insincere and boring evening it had not quite been greed combined with moderate penuriousness which had enjoined that it was the natural thing to do if you were young and poor to dine that is to say comfortably and by way of acknowledging your indebtedness to be towed about for the rest of the evening by a foolish married middle aged woman who for some inscrutable reason of her own wanted to present her unblemished reputation in some sort of compromising limelight but now on this opulent sunny afternoon peter tried in vain to recapture the mood once habitual to him of accepting any invitation merely because it implied a good dinner and perhaps a good supper with a boring opera in between certainly it had been easy for him to fulfil his part of the bargain in these evenings it was natural and also habitual for him to make himself pleasant to look handsome to tell mrs trentham that she had never been so marvellous so chic so smart so entrancing generally but now the mere notion of such an evening seemed foreign if he wanted to dine at the ritz and go to the opera and have some supper he could do it and secure as guests just those with whom it was pleasant to spend an evening henceforth if he wanted to do that he could vulgarly speaking pick and choose the recipients of his bounty stated like that the whole thing sounded rather sordid but it seemed to him that for himself he had got rid of that sordidness the court fool touch which compelled you to make jokes in payment for your dinner or which was worse to talk to your hostess in the serious wistful note of an adorer or at any rate of a dazzled and delighted guest to be host to pay the bill provided you had plenty of money was far the easier part there it was then he had no longer to be asked to dine at the ritz and to go to the theatre or what not afterwards he could bid to his feasts and no more consider the expense than in the old days he would have considered whether he could afford a bus fare whatever enjoyments of that kind the world had to offer were his for the mere formation of his inclination to enjoy them and then suddenly as a blink of distant lightning and so it seemed wholly independent of his own brain there came the question as to what he had paid for these privileges and remote as drowsy thunder the question supplied its own indubitable answer he had somehow the thing was done convinced silvia that he loved her he had at any rate given her the signal of response that had ecstatically rapturously contented her when below her breath as she accepted him as her lover she had whispered ah just let me love you all i want is to love you to be allowed to love you he had known quite well what that allow really implied he had to be on the same plane of emotion as she else to her understanding of it all they could never have arrived at this all the time he knew that then and knew it infinitely better now her level shone in sunlight like some peak far above the clouds compared with his little wooded hill that drowsed in the grey day below them round him there was no gleam of that ethereal brightness in which she walked or at the most through some rent in the clouds he caught a glimpse of her she at present so it appeared to him was so encompassed with brightness that dazzled she took for granted that he was with her and indeed by some device of desire and of cleverness on his part he could convince her that through the clasp of their hands there throbbed the sweet entanglement of the soul she interpreted his lightest action his words his glances by some magic of her own but already he knew that he though with consummate care was keeping it up there was no element of difficulty about it any more than there had been any difficulty about behaving to the complete satisfaction of mrs trentham at her ritz opera entertainments but in both rles as guest at the ritz and as master of howes there was an inherent falsity in both he was dressed up for the part the difference between the two situations was that in the one mrs trentham was dressed up too and in the other silvia was not peter was quite ruthless in tearing off the motley from himself and contemplating with the candidness of a true egoist the revealed deformities he never cultivated illusions about himself nor strove to soften down his own uncomeliness there he was that was he to make the best or the worst of he did not on the other hand try to depreciate his assets he tried in fact to make the most of them and use them to the utmost possible advantage he was and knew it a marvellous physical type handsome as the young hermes and crowned with the glory and flower of adolescence he surrendered to silvia all that physical perfection he gave her the wit and charm of his mind and he was aware that with these he dazzled her much in the same way as nellie had dazzled her the use and the enjoyment of them utterly at her service was responsible for the splendid success of this solitary fortnight in spite of the divine conditions of these golden country days he knew that he was not sorry to be enjoying the last of them to morrow he had to get back to his work and this sword of his body and mind would be sheathed for intervals of absence and then with the sure certainty of apprehension that had stamped out these conclusions he knew that it was not for these alone or even for these at all that silvia had loved him at the most they were for her the bright plumaged lure to which her attention had been originally attracted but even in the first moments of this attention she had divined something in him below the feathers and the fur which she sought her quest had gone deeper than skin and conversation than glances and smiles and level shoulders and firm neck and quick response and humour and all the lures of the male for the female she had claimed and clasped him for something other than what certainly appeared to her as mere appurtenances and what on his side had he looked for in her nothing so he branded it on himself except her mere physical attraction her mere mental charm and freshness and her wealth but the admission of this was a branding the hot iron hurt him and not liking to be hurt he recollected the letters which a few minutes ago the jackdaw had presented to him and which the first of them upside down in his hand was so honestly gummed that he could make no insertion into its flap he turned it over and saw the handwriting of the address he managed then to open it isnt it delightful to be married wrote nellie i didnt write to you at first peter because you wouldnt have enjoyed anything that came from outside but after a fortnight you ought to be able to be congratulated before that it would have been merely impertinent and probably is now but your friends have to take up the threads again some time all we blissful people in fact must remember that we are human beings after all and break ourselves into behavin according mrs gamp isnt it no i dont think it is anyhow we shall all meet again shant we and buzz about in london and ask each other to our lovely country houses weve got to go on peter the world has got to go on hasnt it peter turned a page and began to be quite absorbed in this new but familiar atmosphere he slipped out of his present environment under some spell which lurked in these trivialities im getting on beautifully so began the second page for philip and i understand each other so well and its tremendously comfortable we seem to want just the same sort of thing hes awfully keen about birds for instance and i am becoming so we go out with field glasses and see willow wrens and yesterday we saw a marsh warbler then i like golf you always hated it i remember so philip is learning to like it too he nearly lost his temper yesterday when he missed a short putt and thats always a good sign we dont quite agree about motoring because i always want to go as fast as the machine can manage and he always wants to slow down when theres a cross road he talks to the chauffeur through a beastly little tube and its like a funeral peter darling what rot i am writing fancy my writing such rot to you its the wrong sort of rot isnt it there are rots and rots you and i always used to talk rot but it wasnt about birds and golf im having a new sort of mashie but bar rot when are we going to meet again isnt the country a sleepy place do come up to town soon and philip and i will come up too you and silvia i mean of course i want to be in the silly old thick of it again because when youre in the thick of it you can make privacies but when youre in the privacy of the country you cant make a thick except when you have a great house party as were going to have next week and that isnt really a thick its only partridges the men go out in the morning and the women join them for lunch and then the men come home in the evening and the morning and evening are the first day but its all extremely comfortable thats the word i come back to mother has been here for the last three weeks and shes almost ceased saying that she must go away the day after to morrow i suppose thats because shes tired of hearing either philip or me murmur something about its being such a short visit p and i really both like her being with us it isnt half a bad plan and i expect shell stop till we go back to town again i want you and silvia to come over here on november th for the week end there will be hosts of rather nice people here so many in fact that you and i can steal away without being noticed and have a scamper through the wet woods they are sure to be wet in november and wave our tails and congratulate ourselves on being settled for life weve both of us got somebody to take care of us yes i mean that and if youre as pleased with the arrangement as i am why were very lucky people you and i you know if things had been utterly and completely different would have quarrelled so frightfully i saw two cats yesterday sitting with their faces within an inch of each other scowling and screeching at each other in a perfect tempest of irritation heres philip come to take me out he will sit in the chair there waiting quite placidly till i have finished this letter not reading the paper or doing anything at all but just waiting he knows where there are a pair of golden crested wrens isnt that exciting oh i cant go on with him sitting there good bye my dear mind you and silvia come on the th as peter read he heard by some internal audition nellies voice enunciating the sentences with that familiar intonation of light staccato mockery the written words were but like a prompters copy which he held and glanced at it was nellie who stood there and said the lines he would have liked to argue a point or two with her but he knew that there was between them that deep fundamental agreement and comprehension without which argument develops into mere contradiction peter thrust the letter into his pocket as steps sounded on the gravel just behind him been sitting here ever since i left you asked silvia oh peter without your hat in this hot sun she picked it up and perched it on his head there oh dear what a nuisance it is that this is your last day here but what a last day any letters peters hand fingered nellies letter yes one from nellie he said she wants you and me to go there for the week end on november th shall we oh how unkind of her what are we to do shall we say that mother will be here for that sunday it will be quite true in its way though it wont mean precisely what she thinks it means peter looked at her below the rim of his straw hat she had placed it rather forward over his forehead and as she stood beside his chair he had to incline his head sharply back so that the muscles at the side of his neck stood out below the sun browned skin she came a step closer and held his throat between thumb and fingers what shall we tell her she asked speak or ill strangle you strangle away he said i would sooner you spoke she said i dont want to murder you just yet so unpleasant for mother whether its unpleasant for me or not doesnt seem to matter said peter throatily for silvia increased the pressure of her hand not a bit darling said she i shall squeeze tighter and tighter until you tell me what we shall say to nellie brute said peter dont do it silvia youre hurting me frightfully he wrinkled up his forehead and drew in his breath quickly as if in great pain instantly silvia took her hand away oh my dear i havent really hurt you she asked with compunction once upon a time said peter there was a woman who believed every word that her husband said silvia sat down on the edge of the long chair was there is one she said if you told me you hated me i should believe you i hate you said peter promptly you didnt say that said she your mouth said it what are we to tell nellie seriously i mean it will be nearly our last sunday here if we go to london in december peter made a short calculation dear nellie he said we are so sorry we cant come because november th will be our last evening but twenty one alone here as we go up to town the next month will that do it sounds perfectly sensible said silvia shell understand it wasnt so long ago that she was married then youll write that will you she added hopefully i will if you really wish it said he but its not very sane you see well some time weve got to begin behaving like ordinary human beings again and after all nellie is a very old friend of mine and a very intimate one of yours shell think it rather odd silvia sighed a whole saturday to monday she said how selfish nellie is i never knew that before but perhaps we had better go shall i answer it for you peter got up no i must write to her in any case he said what else does she say asked silvia no message for me peter could not definitely remember any but there was sure to have been such of course all sorts of things come for a stroll silvia im getting chilly in the shade of my straw hat theres another thing i want to talk over with you lets go down by the lake hurrah i love being consulted what is it its about my father oh by the way the jackdaw asked me where he should be put and i said the state rooms is that all right silvia pinched his arm when are you going to understand that you are master she said oh peter it will be lovely for him having the state rooms hell like it tremendously wont he i wish i had thought of it it wasnt that i hope that you wanted to consult me about no now before i consult you i want to ask you a question or two which you must promise to answer not tactfully but truly not even a little tact if i find it necessary she asked not an atom do you like that cartoon of his silvia glanced sideways at him well i dont find i go and look at it for pleasure she said not often at least not every day do you like it i think its the largest piece of rubbish i ever saw now try again to express your opinion silvia gave a sigh of relief oh i do agree she said its the most appalling now isnt it question number two said peter do you think you will like the others any better do you in fact look forward to seeing the whole wall of the gallery covered with allegorical mainwarings not in the very smallest degree but weve got to have them havent we i dont think so said he in fact from a letter i have received from my father i gather that he doesnt consider he made a contract for them at all its clear from what he says that somebody else wants to buy them at a higher rate considerably higher than your mother paid for the first in fact he alludes to the price she paid for it as a pittance by the way what did she pay for it silvia looked sideways at him again do you really want me to tell you she asked if you dont mind well she gave him a thousand guineas for it peter i rather wish he hadnt called it a pittance it makes mother seem mean he was quite willing to accept it and i dont suppose do you that he sells much at that sort of price and the rest of the unspeakable six at the same price asked peter i suppose so mother understood so said she and does she want to have them asked peter no i dont think she does very much said silvia she spoke to day of my cartoons wasnt that darling of her when i said your father was coming this evening but i think i could explain to her that she neednt have them if i do it the right way she wont think she wants them but what about the one weve got sell it back to him at the price she gave for it said peter silvia seemed to consider this simple proposition rather intently yes perhaps she would do that she said without much conviction as to its probability oh peter havent we got rather odd parents i have but why have you except in so far that it was odd to give a thousand guineas for that monstrosity im delighted at the prospect of getting rid of it not only and not chiefly because its an atrocious object but because i hate the idea of my father imposing upon your mother and then talking about a pittance he would have jumped at selling it in an auction room for a quarter of what she paid i wonder who can have offered him more for it oh by the way aunt eleanor has bought his sketches for the cartoons silvia burst out laughing then aunt joanna has bought the cartoons themselves she said but dont suggest that to mother or rather if you want me to talk about it all to her i wont aunt joanna you see wants to what they call wipe mothers eye im quite certain of it and if mother got wind of it she wouldnt part with that wretched picture for a million but how odd yes thats her oddness i said we had got odd parents and i doubt at least theres no doubt about it at all whether she will let your father have back the one cartoon that she has got for what she paid for it she doesnt want any money and shes as generous as she can be bless her but she wont be done the picture is hers and she wont let him have it back at a penny less than he is going to receive for it oh lets talk about something more interesting anyhow you and i dont want the cartoon weve got or any more like it but people are so queer and i love their queernesses they are part of them after all the queernesses in people are exactly what makes their individuality youre queer im queer why am i queer demanded peter ive told you so often said she peter guessed at that what his imputed queerness was it was true that she had told him often but it was true also that there was a thing which a lover was never tired of repeating never never once said he as if i wasnt doing it all day she said taking advantage i mean of your queerness not merely telling you about it directly but being so much more direct than just telling you whats your queerness indeed if it isnt that you allow me to be queer just because you are youve changed the subject said he youre talking about your queerness now its all the same queerness she said peter could squint more atrociously than most people and now looking at silvia he allowed himself to contemplate the end of his nose silvia couldnt stand this trick and a nonsensical ritual had built itself up upon it oh peter put your eyes back she cried i cant theyve stuck push them back for me he shut his eyes and silvia stroked the lids from the nose outwards they will stick some day she said and then i shall divorce you peter looked at her straight again go on about the queerness he said yours or mine she asked you said they were the same they are in a way but your queerness is much the queerest for it was i whom you loved what i did wasnt queer anything else would have been not queer but imbecile peter dont ever be tired of knowing how awfully i love you if youre not there the thought of it frightens me theres something crushing about it but when you are with me the only thing that frightens me is the thought that it shouldnt be so but why on earth youre like that like me i mean thats what is so incomprehensible me you know this bit of nothing at all peter became aware more consciously than through the hints he had previously been cognizant of how though silvias level was some sun basked plateau far above him he welcomed and spread himself in the gleams that came to him there was a splendour in being loved like that and at this moment the inherent falsity of his position was just burned out by that consuming ray her love not in the least masculine was yet male in its adoring self surrender his as regards her though not in the least feminine was female in its reception of it there was an ecstasy in being adored by so magnificent a lover even as in material ways she showered herself on the danae for whom in their drama he was cast so in the subtler and splendid beauty of the soul she poured herself out in a love that passed the love of woman and that very quality here triumphantly shining drew out the essential fragrance of his more he said more nothing at all she seemed to step from her height at that diving down to him entrancingly tender thats all there is my darling she said if you want more than ive got you must teach it me now i wont be absurd any longer look theres a moorhen this was quite in the habitual manner like a lark she sang for so long as she was in the air then folded her wings and dropped to her nest the singing was over and it left her panting with the ecstasy of it but peter to continue that metaphor received something of a shock he had not known she would so swiftly come to ground yet that sudden dip was equally characteristic of him he probably had shown her the trick of it for often he had done just that the sky after all extended to the actual ground there was no intermediate element its a coot he said i dont care i only hope its happy said she oh my dear theres the bell for lunch and were half a mile from the house the jackdaw will peck us for being late not our fault the lake shouldnt have been so long we might fill some of it up said she lets talk sensibly what were we saying before you began to talk nonsense oh yes pictures pittance papa said he peter i cant think of any more peters papa purchases the picture he sold for a pittance said he american headlines make another this sort of monkey gymnastics of the mind at which peter and nellie and all the rest of them so fluently excelled was always productive in silvia of an intense gravity she made her contributions with effort struggle and bewilderment amazed at how quickly everybody else everybody else was so clever made words out of words and reeled off the names of eminent men which began with an x something about mother said she with knitted brows i must manage oh peter isnt that good i must manage to make mother peter giggled thats not the right form he said you must get the right form lets see millionaire mother manages to make to make oh yes money on mr mainwarings monstrosity he finished up in a great hurry oh peter how lovely said she how do you do it and why cant i mr mainwaring rose magnificently to his tenancy of the state rooms feeling that it had been a very proper arrangement to put him there here was the father of the master of howes paying a visit to his son here too in the same earthly vesture was the creator of the great cartoons which among all the futile crosses and cenotaphs and hysterical verse and prose were not unworthy of the heroic history which they commemorated with the same abandoned thoroughness with which he could be when suitable the rollicking jovial boy hungry for his tea or the robust throated toreador so now he saw in the assignation of the state rooms to his occupancy a very proper and touching homage on the part of peter or silvia or mrs wardour or more probably on their joint acclamation to the sovereignty of his art these pleasant reflections that accompanied the appreciative exploration of his territory suggested that there was so to speak a little state business to be done the nature of which he believed he had adequately indicated to peter peter good lad would no doubt have attended to it and it would be well for him to give his report probably it was as much the desire of having this conversation with peter secure from interruption as anything else that caused him to send a message to his son that mr mainwaring would be much obliged if he would spare him a few minutes in the state rooms before dressing time but it certainly fitted in pleasantly with his sovereignty that peter should be requested to present himself and that mr mainwaring should be set on a throne of spanish brocade he waved peter to a seat peter seemed to prefer to perch himself on the tall steel fireguard he divined with sufficient accuracy his fathers pose and was partly amused partly irritated silvia would have been wholly amused hope youll be comfortable here father he said mr mainwaring glanced round him yes indeed he said i shall do very well ah by the way before we get to business i have a letter from your mother which she asked me to give you perhaps you would hand me my despatch case here it is peter was lighting a cigarette and spoke between the puffs right ill take it when i go he said his father looked at the tapestried walls my dear boy he said i dont know if i am right to allow you to smoke here peter dropped his match on the carpet he did that on purpose oh dont bother about that he said i allow myself now i suppose you want to talk to me about that cartoon you got my letter you have arranged what i indicated peter felt his irritation gaining on him well your letter was rather rather involved rather vague and magnificent he said what silvia and i made out of it was that you had been offered a higher price for work that mrs wardour had commissioned you to do for her and wanted to call it off that seemed to be the general drift of it no there was no definite commission said he i mentioned that mrs wardour was under the impression that there was but that i think can be arranged for the series was intended commissioned or not doesnt matter to hang in the gallery here this is silvias house you see and in a way mine so that if we consent there will be under certain conditions no difficulty with my mother in law silvia has talked to her about it we cordially consent father we are both quite willing that you should paint the rest of the series for somebody else mr mainwaring could find no fault with the substance of the speech indeed it gave him precisely what he was wanting but in spite of peters neutrality of statement he found it dealing some dastardly wound to his vanity ha you and silvia it appears dont want the great series he remarked but apparently somebody else does said peter and you said in your letter that they were exciting a stupendous interest in artistic circles thats all right then we are very glad yes glad to get rid of them said the insatiable one peter practically never lost his temper he used it as a stored up force but certainly the sight of his father on the spanish throne looking like zeus did not predispose him to exert his habitual pleasantness you are of course at liberty to make any comments you choose he said you are vexed with me because i give you your way quite willingly instead of reluctantly by the way dont tell me and in particular dont tell mrs wardour whether the artistic circles is another expression for lady darley if it is i think it highly probable that she would refuse to let you have back the first cartoon if that is part of your plan you would in that case i suppose have to copy it if she allowed you to mr mainwaring rose to a splendour of pomposity copy he said and could i copy the fiery execution of it you speak of pictures my peter as if they could be produced like boots or hats the intending purchaser i do not say whether or no i refer to lady darley wants no cold replica she insists on the one that came hot and terrible from the furnace of my imagination then on certain conditions said peter lady darley i mean the purchaser may have it name them said his father looking like a captive king the first is that you completely withdraw and if possible regret the use of the expression pittance in connection with the price you received for it theres an implication of meanness about it with regard to mrs wardour mr mainwaring clicked his thumb and finger as if to say that for what i sold it for i make no such implication he said mrs wardour or anybody else is well within her rights in acquiring fine work at such prices as the artist is obliged from straitened circumstances to accept the point is said peter that you hadnt often if ever been obliged to accept a thousand guineas before for any picture and may not an artist after years of unremitting endeavour be allowed to come into his own and enjoy the appreciation he has long merited asked mr mainwaring certainly he may we are all delighted but when he does when that is to say you at length receive a high price for a picture you shouldnt because you are offered immediately afterwards a higher price talk of a pittance as applied to the first you thought yourself father continued peter pleasantly and inexorably remarkably fortunate to get a thousand guineas mr mainwaring at this displayed the versatility of a quick change artist it was pretty well demonstrated that peter was not impressed by the majestic attitude and he yodelled and burst into a laugh well well my peter he said you shall have it your own way it was no pittance i ought not to have called it a pittance mea culpa mea maxima culpa pittance it is let us distinguish my dear when i contrast it with the subsequent offer that has reached me but at the time a thousand guineas seemed to me a very fair remuneration i had been too modest about my value it appears now ah yes but recognition is pleasant enough and when the brush slips from my hand and my spirit flies he made a circular motion of his arms as if swimming to join the mightier dead the mainwaring estate will be found not too inconsiderable to place beside the fortunes of the wardours but that will not i hope be for a long time yet he added as the notion of picturing himself in front of some great canvas with the brush slipping from his nerveless hands supported by silvia and peter occurred to him with an almost ominous vividness quite said peter in general acknowledgment of this magnificence there remains then one thing to settle and that is the price at which you repurchase the cartoon of which mrs wardour is the present possessor mr mainwaring did not for the moment see the bearing of this and remained splendid i should not dream of repaying her one penny less than what i received for it he said the full price peter assure her of that peter thought it better to let another aspect of the case strike his father without suggesting it and was silent till mr mainwaring spoke again hm i see what you mean he said i hoped you would because really there doesnt seem to be any reason why she should let you have for a thousand guineas a thing which is now indubitably hers and which you will immediately sell for a considerably higher sum mr mainwaring began to regret that he had said quite so much about the utter impossibility of recapturing the fire of the original in a copy you would be offering her you must remember peter added a pittance for her picture you think i ought to give her what i shall receive for it asked mr mainwaring peter kept steadily before him his distaste of his father scoring off mrs wardour the whole thing though humorous was rather sordid but he knew that he rather liked himself in the part he was playing in it i think the justice of that view will appeal to you he said you couldnt very well do otherwise mr mainwaring was silent a moment and then decided to be completely superb i have no experience in business or in bargaining he said if you tell me that is right and fair and proper i yield i think its your only means of getting the picture said peter so thats settled is it oh the letter from my mother thanks dinner at half past eight chapter x peter as he strolled down the corridor knew that he had been rather signorial if that was the word and designedly so in this interview in spite of mr mainwarings magnificent occupation of the state rooms for which after all he had his son to thank peter was pleased to feel that he had been putting his father in his place it had certainly been with this object in view that he had smoked his cigarette and dropped the expired match on the carpet not exactly calling attention to his position but casually assuming it again in the matter of the picture he had ever so quietly ever so indulgently just hinted at the right course and like a lamb a great vain rococo farcical lamb his father had bleated his way into the proper fold peter confessed to himself he seldom confessed to anybody else that the motive which inspired these manuvres was an unamiable one he might easily have obtained the results that he now together with his mothers unopened letter carried away from this interview by tact by pleasantness by the general small change of sympathy hitherto he had been accustomed to use such lubrications to make the wheels of life run smoothly in domestic dealings but now that no further domestic lubrication was necessary on his part his father it is true might have to flourish the oil can with desperate agility if he was to ensure smooth working peter knew that he had just driven ahead and let the wheels if so they felt disposed squeak and squeal and grind and grumble while that small smelly house off the brompton road had been his home it had paid to make the bearings run easily but now when he thought with incredulous wonder that he could have stuck all that small stuffiness so long he detachedly admired his own past deftness and patience in dealing with the daily situation there he saw in the mirror of his own vanity the incomparable crudeness of his fathers and discovered almost with a sense of shock how cordially he disliked him for the present his sense of humour with regard to him was in total eclipse the type of quality which silvia hugged as being the lovable queerness which makes for individuality he saw only as tiresome and contemptible eccentricity a thing to be contemplated baldly without comment whenever contemplation of it was necessary and to be dealt with summarily the vexing affair was that peter caught some broken image of himself in all this one glimpse of himself in especial was irritating that namely in which he looked with great distaste on his fathers profiting by the wealth of the wardours without giving a due return for his depredations on it it was natural that when as now he was so acutely aware of his fathers unique capability for rubbing him up the wrong way he should wonder afresh at the placid unruffled tolerance that had enabled his mother to spend a quarter of a century with him women of course so ran his reflections have a greater gift of patience with men than a man can be expected to have sex no doubt had something to do with it for on the other hand men were more tolerant of a tiresome woman than other women yet that could not wholly explain his mother she was quite inexplicable for silvia even gifted as peter ever so cordially recognized with the power of putting herself into the position and realizing the identity of other people had fallen back like a spent wave from the hard smooth impenetrability of his mother she had confessed herself baffled had no idea whether there was something somebody hermetically sealed up behind that neat porcelain face by the inexorable will of its occupant or if there was nothing beyond that blank imperturbability that cared only whether the door at the head of the kitchen stairs was quite shut and had no desire except to be left alone and allowed to read advertisements of hotels in railway guides had his mother been driven into that small but apparently impregnable fortress by his fathers colossal and ludicrous personality or was there indeed no one there at all no beleaguered garrison grimly holding out peter wandered on to the terrace for a minute of composing dusk and quietness he half expected to find silvia there and felt a little ill used that she was not she knew what was the nature of his interview with his father and peter would have welcomed the warmth of her applause at his masterly conduct of it but in her absence he could read the certainly placid communication from his mother she would hope he was well she would hope silvia was well she would let it be assumed that she was well she would certainly also say that she was so sorry she could not come to howes with his father but that she hoped to do so some time during the autumn she would undoubtedly wind up by saying that it was nearly post time and that she had other letters peter drew the letter from his pocket and prepared to let his eyes slide smoothly over the lines of it she wrote a wonderfully clear hand you could take a whole sentence in at a glance my dearest peter i am sending this letter to you by your father because i want it to reach you without fail letters by post go wrong sometimes and i dont want this to go wrong when i have finished it i shall put it into his despatch box myself when your father comes back from his visit to you and silvia he will not find me here it is no use mincing words so i will tell you straight out that i cant stand him any longer it would not have answered my purpose just to go away from him for a month for i should have felt all the time that at the end of a month i should have to come back i should have been on the end of the string still as it is i shall stop away just as long as i choose i shall be free i want a holiday without any tie whatever when i mean to come back if i do i shall write to him and ask him if he will take me back i dont know how long it will be before i want to it might be a fortnight or it might be a year or it might be never i shall simply stay away from him at some pleasant place which i have selected until i feel better while you were living with your father and me i could just get along but since you have gone i cant get along at all we werent much to each other for all my individuality isnt that what they call it had long ago been hammered back into me i was like a small person in a large suit of armour but somehow you were a part of me and while you were there i couldnt go away i ask you my dear not to make any attempt to find me and i want you to persuade your father not to i shall be quite comfortable and as i am never ill i dont see why i should begin to be so now i shall go to a nice hotel where i shant have to order lunch and dinner or add up bills it is astonishing how many nice hotels there are quite moderate in price which will just suit me now this may seem unkind but the fact is that i dont want to hear a word from either you or your father you and i have nothing in common in fact i have nothing in common with anybody and i only want to be left alone in peace and not to be reminded of the last twenty five years of my life at all i want not to be bothered with anybody i want to get up and go to bed when i choose and go for my walk and read my book and play patience you and i have never loved each other at all so theres no use in pretending to be pathetic over that now before you were old enough to understand i hadnt got any feeling left in me or at least it was hammered right inside me if any time during these last ten years i had died you wouldnt have missed me though if you had died i should have missed you to the extent anyhow of your absence making my life with your father quite intolerable i dont bear him the slightest ill will and i hope hell bear me none he has excellent servants and they will make him quite comfortable which is all he wants but ive got too much sense to remain with him any longer he has been saying great things lately about the immense sums of money he will get for his series of cartoons so that i have no scruple in withdrawing from him the a year which is my own income i cant be certain of course whether he has not been multiplying everything by ten in order to glorify himself but i suppose there is some truth in it all anyhow he has got a cheque from mrs wardour for a thousand guineas because he showed me that he was in great spirits that night dancing round the table and singing and drinking quantities of port and that it appears is nothing to what he is about to get for the rest of his great series peter took his eyes off the neatly written sheets for a moment and gave a great gasp the figure of his mother as he was accustomed to behold it veiled and still and sitting in shadow and never giving a sign of individual life had suddenly cast off its concealment and tranquillities and stood out violently illuminated that smooth polished object which had lain inert so long in the midst of railway guides had proved itself to be a live shell which without any warning or preliminary sizzling had exploded he himself was unhurt though immeasurably astonished and startled and he exulted in the fact that the thing had been alive after all carrying within it such store of devastating energy his own marriage his departure from home had set off the fuse he had been all unconsciously the controlling agent he dived again into this most lucid report of the explosion observing with regret that there were but a couple of pages more at the moment silvia appeared at the door from the terrace into the drawing room close behind where he sat peter is that you she asked yes one minute or come here silvia take these sheets and read them without saying anything till ive finished its a letter from my mother he buried himself in the remainder of the letter hardly hearing silvias gasp of surprise as she came to the second paragraph now i want you the narrative continued to consider this before you pass any judgment on what i have done i am injuring nothing and nobody except your fathers vanity and i have no doubt he will find some explanation of my leaving him which will quite satisfy him he will not be the least less happy without me nor will you i have got no friends for i am not the sort of person who can make friends or wants them i have been hammered as i have said into myself and i break no ties the severance of which is painful for others any more than for me i see so few people and those so very occasionally that there need be no scandal of any kind your father will only have to say about once a month that i am on a visit in the country which is quite true my solicitor knows where i am and from time to time he will let you have a note from me saying how i am as for news i shall have none i shall take my walk and read my book and entertain myself very well and i shall be very happy because i shall be free i rather believe that you are sufficiently like me to understand that for you have always kept yourself independent of everybody finally i leave it to you no doubt you will consult silvia as to whether you let your father find out that i have gone when he returns home or whether you tell him i think personally that it would be wiser to tell him because when he got home and found the few lines not like this long letter which i have left for him there just to say i have gone he might make some dreadful scene and upset everybody but that i leave entirely to you all the wages and books were paid up to the end of last week the bills with their receipts are in their place in the third drawer of my knee hole table your affectionate mother maria mainwaring peter thrust the remaining pages into silvias hand and waited till she had come to the end then they looked at each other in silence im going to laugh said peter at length no please dont said silvia if you do i shall cry peter tapped the sheets that lay in her hand but its gorgeous he said i should laugh if i did not from amusement though there are amusing things but from pleasure every word in that letter is true thats something to be pleased about and whats more every word in it is right but the surprise the wonder of it theres a splendour about it silvia shuffled the sheets together and giving them back to him leaned her forehead on her hands ah havent you got any tenderness she said dont you see the bitter pathos of it your mother you know but she says there is nothing pathetic about it said he and thats just the most pathetic thing of all silvia said peter puzzled over this a moment he understood silvias feeling well enough but he understood equally well and with greater sympathy the answer the retort almost to it but if she sees nothing pathetic in the situation and i quite agree with her whats the use of trying to introduce pathos he asked pathos painted on like a varnish ceases to be pathos at all it becomes simply sentimentality silvia turned to him like some patient affectionate teacher to a child who pretends only not to know his lessons if the absence of love in relationships like these isnt pathetic she said love itself is only sentimentality peter again saw precisely what she meant he knew too that what she said was true but he knew that he for himself did not realize it with conviction with a sense of illumination the statement of it was just an instance the more of silvias shining there aloft of his confining cloudland the thought of that dealt him a stab of envy and under the hurt of it his spirit snapped and snarled and retired so to speak into its kennel leaving his mind outside to manage the situation well then its pathetic he said but it has been pathetic so long that one has got used to it i know youre right but what you say hasnt any practical bearing ah my dear but it has said she it has all the practical bearing it is up to you practically to handle it in hardness in in a sort of ruthlessness or you can recognizing what i say deal with it tenderly by all means but the facts arent new leave me out lets consider my father and mother only theres the practical side of it hes got to be told at least i suppose so theres no new pathos there theyve both been aware of lovelessness for years if my father takes the wounded the pathetic pose it will it will just be a pose frankly im all on my mothers side by one big gesture she has explained herself she has made a living comprehensible reality of herself the bradshaws the railway guide advertisements good lord we know what it has all been about now theres flesh and blood in it i always respect flesh and blood but her way of doing it is an outrage said silvia shes your fathers wife after all shes your mother take your mothers side by all means weve all got to take sides in everything nobody can be neutral but take his side in her manner of doing what she has done sympathize with him in that that letter too will you show him the letter the hostility of it the resentment peter sat still a moment fingering the leaves of the letter its not so much resentment he said as repression she has been hammered back into herself all these years oh i understand her better than you it had to happen this way what else was she to do could she go to my father and say if you cant put some curb on your egoism and vanity if you continue to be such a bounder thats what bounders are i really shall have to leave you you want to score off him peter said she thats the hardness the ruthlessness and you arent hard my darling who knows that better than i are you sure im not he said she did not answer this directly youve got to be gentle she said peters fingers closed on the letter hesitated and then tore the sheets in half he tore them across yet again well he shant see the letter he said it was written to me and ive destroyed it but if when i tell him he becomes melodramatic how can i help being what you call ruthless hes so vain you dont know how vain he is this will be a brutal outrage an attempted assassination of his vanity but it wont injure it the dastardly blow will glance aside and hell put an extra bodyguard round his vanity for the future hes a ridiculous person silvia said peter in a loud firm voice silvia gave a sigh ah thats better she said for youve torn the letter up anyhow and when you said he was ridiculous you said it my dear as if you were justifying yourself rather than accusing him oh you said it firmly and loudly but will you mind if i say this too you didnt say it so spitefully now lets be practical you always used to be practical peter when are you going to tell him peter looked at his watch that means that if i say that i havent made up my mind he said you will certainly let me know that there is plenty of time to tell him before dinner you want me to tell him now thats where we are you call me practical who was ever so practical as you when it comes to the point she did not challenge that but rather proceeded to justify peters opinion for him my dear you can put off pleasant things if you like she said because you enjoy the anticipation of them but where where is the use of putting off unpleasant things that only lengthens a beastly anticipation hell make a scene said peter i hate scenes there was nothing to reply to this it all came under the advisability which she had already expressed of not putting off unpleasantnesses so she made no reply and soon for the face of her continued to push him he got up still wondering if she would prefer to tell his father herself how strongly she wanted to do that and how more strongly she refrained from doing it he had no idea her inclination that which she combated was simply to go straight to those voluptuous state rooms but her will her convinced sense of what was right of what was peters own duty and development kept her silent oh i am sorry for you she said at length as he turned to go into the house but dont forget to be sorry for him peter his only answer to that was a just perceptible shrug of his shoulders comment on the futility of her sympathy and he walked away across the crackling gravel silvia knew how peters mere presence stifled her power of judgment with regard to him often and often she had to cling desperately to a mental integrity of her own in order not to be washed away by the mere tide of her devotion to him her desire not only the flesh and the blood of her but her very spirit would always have surrendered to him would have given up herself whole and complete to what pleased him to what made him comfortable content and happy but somewhere between these two apexes of physical and spiritual longing there came another peak a mental and judicial apex so she framed it to herself a thing solid and reliable a kind of bleak umpire that gave inexorable decisions already in their fortnight of married life it had several times asserted itself it was her will she supposed clear eyed and unbribable which was as distinct from the blindness of love as it was from the abandonment of physical desire peter had suggested for instance that he should chuck his work in the foreign office this was the most notable of these instances and live just live now at howes now in london always with her they would travel they would entertain they would have plenty of interests to keep him busy enough he had urged he had argued he had appealed to her for her mere acquiescence willing or not and she had steadily and unshakably refused to give it here to night was another test for this umpire of the mind it would have been infinitely easier for her to tell mr mainwaring herself and she knew quite convincedly that she would have proved a far more sympathetic breaker of shocking tidings than peter would be peter would now on his way to the state rooms be framing adroit sentences be schooling his anticipatory impatience at a melodramatic reception of that news by his father into tolerance and gentleness but she had as little temptation to be intolerant or ungentle as he had to be the reverse she would naturally have stood in an attitude which peter would find it gymnastically difficult to maintain but he had got to do his best not to let her do so infinitely better it took but a moments stiffening of herself to baffle any inclination to follow peter and shoulder his mission for him and her thoughts went back to mrs mainwarings letter and its startling effect or want of effect on peter that had produced so she found now when she was no longer under the spell of his presence a certain incredulous dismay you arent like that she had assured him but now she found herself saying he cant be like that he appeared to have received this intelligence with a savage or if not a savage a wholly unpitiful comment he had seemed and indeed seemed now to have applauded this tragic sequel to years of resentful companionship he had confessed to a desire to laugh this was the ruthlessness it might be that the logical result of such years was that mrs mainwaring given that she retained any independent identity of her own should have been goaded into this assertion of it it might in the ultimate weighing of souls be better that she should have cut the knot like this rather than have been strangled by it it was all very well for peter to take her side but to take her side competently included an appreciation of what she had suffered and what she had failed in anyone could form a fair idea of what she as exhibited now had suffered by the smallest recognition of what it must have been to be tied to the present occupant of the state rooms and the same exhibition showed exactly her tragic failure in allowing herself to be driven into this hermetical compartment where all that reached her was the contemplation of her escape as shown by her study of hotels but peter turned over all this which was the root of the matter as he might turn over the leaves of a dull book and only saw a dramatic comedy in it deserving of applause for its fitness of an exclamation serve him right or a laughing well done mother you couldnt deal with people like that at that rate the whole world would become a relentless machine always grinding always seeing others ground always being diverted at the pitiless revolution of the wheels compassion tenderness these were the qualities that just saved and redeemed the world from hell or at least from being a wounding comedy at which no human person could laugh for fear of crying instead silvia got up from the seat where she and peter had read his mothers letter definitely desiring to avoid the conclusion to which her thoughts were leading her he had wanted to laugh that was certain but she must forget that probably he had not meant it it was only incongruousness and surprise like funny things in church which would not be in the least funny elsewhere which had made a spasm peter assuredly was not like that really and the loyalty of love derided her for supposing it he was her heart insisted on that all that her love adored him for being the dressing bell had already sumptuously sounded from the central turret and still quite ignorant of what had been the result of the disclosure but conscious of a yearning anxiety to know she went up to her bedroom she was not so much anxious to know how mr mainwaring was taking it how he took it seemed to matter very little but how peter had done his part between his dressing room and her bedroom were a couple of bathrooms and she heard with a certain clinging to the usualness of life splashings and hissings of water coming from one of these whatever had happened there was peter having his bath and soon most likely he would tap at her door barefooted he never would wear slippers as he paddled about between his room and hers with the blue silk dressing gown tied with a tasselled cord about his waist peter had a wondrous ritual for his bath he had to immerse himself first of all and then stand on the mat while he soaped himself from head to foot then still slippery and soapy in order to get cold and heighten the enjoyment of the next immersion he turned on more hot taps and put spoonful after spoonful of verbena salts into the water then he got in again and stewed himself in this fragrant soup when he was too hot to bear it any longer he retired into a small waterproof castle at the end of the bath and turned on all the cold water douches and squirts and syringes then without drying himself at all he put on the famous blue silk dressing gown which had a hood to it lit a cigarette and tapped at her door to ascertain whether he could sit and finish his cigarette there silvia by this time knew precisely the interpretation of these splashings and hissings of water and she would hurry up her own dressing or slow it down so that she could admit him fresh from his scrubbings and soapings with the glow of the cold water on his skin he was paganly sensuous in his enjoyment of the physical conditions of the moment and sitting by her dressing table talked the most amazing nonsense he dried his feet on the tail of his dressing gown he rubbed his hair on the hood of it there was the scent of soap and verbena and cigarette and more piercing to her sense than these his firm smooth skin the cleansedness and the freshness of him at such chattering undress sances she was most of all conscious of him to the exclusion of herself for whereas his kiss his caress united her with him and she had part in it when he came in thus rough haired bare legged wet footed with a smooth shoulder emerging from his dressing gown while enveloped in it he rubbed himself dry she felt herself merely a spectator of this beautiful animal but if he came in now he might or might not she knew that to night she would be involved so to speak with him his character the essence of him as exhibited in such account as he might give her of the interview with his father would come like a cloud or a brightness that would obstruct this purely spectator like view of him he would not only be the clean lithe animal which for these few minutes she could look at without passion without love without friendship even and be absorbed in the mere joy that there should be in this world so young and wild and perfect a creature there came his knock and the usual inquiry and he entered while her maid with chaste averted face rustled out not waiting to be dismissed through the other door he sat down in the big low chair by her dressing table oh the simplest pleasures are so much the best he said just washing you know just being hungry and sleepy i never enjoy a play or a book or a joke nearly so much as a bath and food and getting my head well down into the pillow but i hate sponges why should i scrub my nose with a piece of dead seaweed listen as she might with all the delicacy of divination that love had given to her ear she could find in his voice no inflection no hesitation nor on the other hand any glibness as of a lesson learned and faultlessly repeated that showed that he was speaking otherwise than completely naturally the topics of bath and dinner and bed came to his lips with quite spontaneous fluency as if he had not in this last hour been the bearer to his father of a tragic situation one that at least must wound the vanity which was so predominant a passion in him or had mr mainwaring taken it with the same ruthlessness the same cynical amusement as peter had appeared to silvia could not believe that he must have been hurt been astounded but why in pitys name did not peter tell her about that interview he must have known how she longed to be told whether there was good or bad to tell a revolving brush covered with wash leather continued peter like a small boxing glove you would cover it with soap and work it with your foot but a sponge odious in texture dull in colour and full of horrible dark holes which probably contain the pincers of defunct crabs and the fins of dead fish oh by the way i quite forgot i did really darling i was thinking so much about substitutes for sponges silvia could not doubt the sincerity of this he had been thinking about sponges there was the full statement of the case and with his acknowledgment of that his mere physical presence the mere glamour of his radiant animalism which after all was part of his essence and his charm captured her again whisking away for the moment all possibility of criticism or of wishing that he could be other than he was she knew that her misgivings they amounted to that would come flooding back but just for the moment they were like some remote line of the low tide lying miles away across shining levels oh peter she cried if you can design a small revolving wash leather boxing glove to use for a sponge ill promise to have it made for you but you must explain just how its to work she broke off and about your father she said yes i was just going to tell you when you interrupted about the sponge plan said he by the way ill draw you the revolving boxing glove a foot pedal below below mind the water so that your foot doesnt get cold and of course you hold the socket of the boxing glove the wrist so to speak in your hand and it goes buzzing round as you work with your foot and you apply it well soaped to your face no more dead seaweed and lobster claws my father now peter gathered up his knees in his arms and sat there nursing them his dressing gown had fallen off his shoulder he looked like some domesticated satyr wild with the knowledge of the woodland but tamed to this sojourn enforced or voluntary in human habitations i went to him as you told me to do he began silvia interrupted him she wanted him to do himself justice no my dear you went quite of your own accord she said i never urged you peters eyelids hovered and fell and raised themselves again often and often had silvia noticed that shade of gesture on nellies face but never so it struck her had she seen a man do just that the gesture seemed to imply acquiescence without consent well i went anyhow he said i tapped on his door and as there was no answer i went in he was standing in front of that big italian mirror in well in an attitude he is intending to paint his own portrait when he has finished that daub of you silvia leaned forward towards him oh dont talk like that she said dont be ironical not that quite dont feel ironical peter turned on her a face of mild injured innocence i was telling you the bald facts he said the balder the better said she i told him i had read my mothers letter he continued and that there was news in it which he had better know at once i got him to sit down and i got hold of his hand and then i told him just the fact that she had gone away peter shifted himself a little further back in his chair and drew his legs more closely towards him so that his chin rested on the plateau of his knees i am not being ironical he said i am trying to tell you precisely what happened he made a noise a gurgle i think i should call it and he asked who the damned villain was with whom she had gone and to be quite bald that seemed to me to be unreal i said that there wasnt any damned villain and that she had gone just because she felt she must be free he wanted to see the letter and i told him that i had torn it up then he began throwing his hair brushes and dress clothes into a bag in order to start off and look for her and asked me where she was when i told him that i hadnt the slightest idea he accused me of collusion with her i merely denied that and said that her letter was as great a surprise to me as it was to him peter threw away the end of his cigarette then he began to guess why she had gone now the point of my tearing up my mothers letter was that he shouldnt know wasnt it darling silvia heard herself assent there was a sickness of the heart coming over her something too subtle for her to diagnose as yet so he began to guess continued peter and as he tried to guess i was sorry for him really sorry you understand silvias heart began to thrive again yes yes i knew you would be she cried he soon hit on the reason said peter quietly there could only have been one reason so he thought and it filled him with the utmost remorse he had been too big for her that was what it came to too great he had not in the exaltation of his art this is quite what he said remembered the limitations of of the rest of us she had fainted before the furnace of his genius it was all his fault he hadnt made allowance for the prodigious strain on her for the effects cumulative no doubt of the high pressure he strode about the room he knocked over a chair some fierce antagonism to his narrative blazed up in silvia she had wanted the facts and here they were but she had not allowed for the baldness of their presentation though she had asked for it ah dont talk like that peter she said youre not a newspaper reporter peter gave no reply at all there he sat with his chin on his knees quite silent if silvia chose to speak to him like that it was clear that she must either go on or draw back anyhow the next word was with her but all the time that he thus tacitly insisted on his rights resenting what she had said there was within him some little focus of light breaking through from her sunlit altitudes that illumined and justified her protest good lord wasnt she right wasnt his sentiment towards his father immeasurably ignoble compared to the comprehension of her love and that very fact his own unavowable condemnation of himself that is to say irritated him if she was like that there was no use in his continuing his story silvia spoke first humanly she could not bear this silence in which peter seemed to mock her but divinely she must be ever so humble humble how love sanctified humility and transformed it into an ineffable pride she pushed back her chair and knelt by his she longed to unclasp the brown lean hands that enclosed him in himself and make them embrace her also but that might annoy peter there was a suggestion of claiming him about it she did not want to claim him i dont know why i spoke like that she said i asked you what happened and you are telling me will you forgive me and go on peter had never seemed so remote from her as then in the frantic telegraphy of her spirit which seemed to be sending all the love that the waves of ether would bear there came no response from him in spite of his answer i never heard such nonsense he said we should be a pretty pair if we had to forgive how silly you know it to ask me to forgive you show you do by going on she said it was clear to him that what she wanted was to know not his fathers part in this interview but his own whether she liked it or not he was going to be perfectly honest about it when he knocked over a chair and strode about he repeated and found out the reason for my mothers going away i began to be less sorry for him he enjoyed himself it was all a tribute to his impossible greatness from then onwards i acted because he was acting the alternative was to tell him that my mother simply found his egoism intolerable that wouldnt have done any good so i agreed with him that was the best thing to do he is in despair a rather luxurious despair i had either to explode that or let him enjoy it so it was no use being sorry for him any longer silvia broke out again it was her love for peter that spoke my dear you ought to have been a million times sorrier she cried if he had been just simply broken hearted about it it would have been so much better cant you see that can you help feeling it she was shedding the gleam on him i know what you mean he said but im telling you what happened i was less sorry for him when he began to console himself i suppose im made like that silvia bit her lip indeed you are not she said youre making yourself out to be hard and unloving at the moment the clang of the dinner bell from the turret just above silvias room broke in the whole neighbourhood must know when the family at howes were warned that it was time to dress and that three quarters of an hour later it was time to dine peter on the first evenings he had spent here with silvia had asked whether like a court circular such publicity need be given to their domestic affairs but silvia confessing herself sentimental had told him that her father had delighted in the installation of that sonorous announcement the brazen proclamation hurt nobody and daddy liked it certainly it served a purpose now and peter jumped up lord theres dinner he said and i havent begun to dress my father by the way wants to dine upstairs will you tell them as you are so much more advanced than i to send up his dinner i must fly peter stood for a moment looking at her if a situation between them had not actually laid hold of them it had thrown a shadow over them and he wanted to get out into sunlight again ah you darling he said with a blend of envy and of admiration somewhere gushing up envy at her immense nobility he could think of no other word for it and admiration at that shrine of love which rose from the ground of her heart it was so beautiful an edifice he despaired of being worthy of it and at times so he confessed to himself he wearied of its white stainless purity somehow this evening there seemed to have opened a little crack on its soaring vault which he must mend somehow give me a kiss then he said chapter xi peter though he often hung a veil over the real workings and processes of his mind for the benefit and admiration of others before whom he was anxious to present a charming appearance was honest with himself and found during the next fortnight without any desire to dissimulate that he was distinctly grateful to silvias insistence that he should not resign his place in the foreign office for in the present conditions and environments at howes it was certainly preferable to spend the solidity of the day in london rather than enjoy uninterrupted leisure at home even then the evenings were full of crashes and crises and intolerable ludicrousness his father who still majestically occupied the state rooms and showed no indications of vacating them moved along peaks and summits of the ridiculous which his son really believed had never before been trodden by foot of man that he was enjoying himself immensely peter made no doubt whatever living as he did on the heights of egoism and free to indulge in the most extravagant exhibition of it his standard victoriously raised his principle his determination announced with magnificent gestures once if not more during the evening was that he would remain rock like and immovable fulfilling the destiny of his own supreme will whatever bombs fate might choose to drop on him that his whole soul was bitter with remorse for his failings and failures he did not deny he should not have isolated himself as he had done in the supernal realms of art he should have remembered that he was a man as well as an artist and had a wife as well as the celestial mistress of his soul he ought to have been kinder more tender more indulgent to the frailty and the weakness of his carissima but remorse so waved his standard if it was the genuine article must express itself not in idle repinings but in a manful facing of the consequences of past error his remorse the right kind of remorse did not weaken but strengthened a man to go forward he must not lose touch with the joy of life he must not get from the severe spanking that remorse gave him only a smarting and a humiliation of the flesh he must draw the lesson from his punishment and proceed more tenderly but not less sublimely than before it must not be supposed that mr mainwaring used such expressions as spanking in actual speech or that the ironical account of his sublimity as given above was verbally his but such anyhow was the manner in which these great tirades delivered to peter when he went up to see his father on his daily arrival at howes an hour or so before dinner impressed themselves on his mind usually there was a note for him on the table in the hall which ran something like this my peter i am very low and despondent to night and i do not know if i can face a sociable evening come up to see me my dear for you are the only link which is left to me of those happy far too happy years and see if your sweet spirit will not like david playing before saul exorcise the demons of remorse and regret which shriek and gibber round the head of your unhappy father i have tried so hard ah so hard all day not to make myself a burden and a shadow to your dear ones but i fear i have acquitted myself very ill come and cheer me up peter peter to do him justice always went and in the majesty of egoism his father without any encouragement at all would talk himself into a splendid courage at whatever cost to himself at whatever effort from worn and debilitated nerve strings he would show that there was some music yet left in his he would twang his mental guitar and if the frayed string snapped well his lawyer would know that his affairs were in order then sooner or later to peters great relief the sonorous dressing bell would ring and he could go and have his bath as likely as not before he definitely quitted the room his father would allude to the magnificent port which formed so admirable a feature in the cellars of howes usually after the bath he went in to see silvia but for some reason or other the spontaneous nonsense of these interviews had wilted and withered silvia so it seemed to him held herself in reserve waiting for something from him peter would give an account of his day of his talk with his father and still silvia seemed to wait she was overbrimming with all that she ever had for him but to his perception what she waited for was for him to turn the winch of the sluice once there had been a really outrageous scene with his father in which after tears mr mainwaring had slid from his chair with a groan and lay an ignoble heap upon the floor peter on this occasion had given silvia a perfectly colourless prcis of the degrading exhibition and had endorsed it brought collateral evidence to bear on its nature by the production of one of the notes which usually awaited him on his return from town he had done that in some sort of self justification silvia could not fail to realize how trying from their very unreality such scenes were for him and he gave her also every evening a very respectable specimen of his patience with his father and yet he felt that silvia was not waiting for that it was not how he behaved how patient and cordial he schooled himself to be that she waited for he was patient he was cordial and though she often gave him a little sympathetic and appreciative word for his reward it was no more than a sugar plum to a child something to keep it quiet what she wanted what she longed for the evidence of was an internal loving driving force which turned the wheels of the machinery of his impeccable conduct and that he had not got for her he spun the wheels with a clever finger from outside but usually these wheels went round merrily enough he reported his fathers despondence he ever so lightly alluded to the fact that he had cheered him up and his estimate was justified for mr mainwaring on the crashing of the dinner bell in the turret would sometimes announce his progress from the state rooms by a jubilant yodelling and would remain for the greater part of dinner in a state of high elation true he would have a spasm now and then if he happened to have his attention called to mrs wardours pearls he might for a brief dramatic moment cover his eyes and say in a choked voice my carissima had some wonderful pearls but then true to his manly determination he would dismiss the miserable association and become master of his soul again peter usually had a second dose of his fathers promethean attitude later in the evening after silvia and her mother had gone upstairs your treasure your pearl of great price your angel he would ejaculate her sweet pity her divine compassion it is she she and you who reconcile me to life but i must not bask too long in that healing effulgence i must get back to london i must reinstate myself in my desolate house and face it all face it all i must stand on my own feet again poor sordid cripple that i am then perhaps if quite overcome he would bury his face in his hands but much more usually he would stand up throw out his chest breathe deeply and draw himself up to the last half inch of his considerable stature work he said work is the tonic that god puts in the reach of all of us remember that my peter if grief and sorrow ever visit you but then you have by your side the sweetest the most sympathetic woman ever sent to enlighten the gloom of this transitory world so had i by god so had i and i did not recognize her preciousness and her fragility enough silvia did you notice her exquisite love towards me at dinner to day when for a moment the sight of mrs wardours pearls unmanned me peter on this occasion was lashed to the extremity of irritation i dont think i did he said i only remember that she instantly asked you if you would have some more pheasant he tried to do better than that certainly there was no use in saying that sort of thing but she looked at you father he added hastily you felt what she was feeling was that it his father clasped his hands a divine beam came to me he said a message of consolation it made me live again surely you saw its effect on me peter at such moments longed for his wet woods he wanted to be by himself or at any rate with someone who could understand and enjoy this stupendous farce if only nellie for instance had been sitting there with him how would their eyes have telegraphed their mental ecstasy silvia at this same moment would not have served the purpose she might see how ridiculous his father was being but below her perception of that which might easily have made her telegraph and smile to him there would have been that huge unspeakable tenderness which when you wanted an answering perception of farce would have spoiled it all that universal embracing compassion required salting before now she had seen and communicated to him her sense of his fathers absurdities but now when he turned trouble into an empty arena for his posturing her sense of comedy completely failed her or if she still possessed it peter could not get at it with a flare of intuition he guessed that it might be unlocked to him if only he could use the right key to it but the key was compassion and it was he for whom she waited to thrust it into the wards if only he loved they could laugh at anything together without that the gate was locked well if it was locked he would enjoy his imperfect vision of what lay within yes i saw its effect on you he said trying to imagine that nellie was here enthralled and wide eyed you amused us all very much immediately afterwards by making that lovely sea sick passenger out of an orange perfectly screaming his father thrust his hands through his hair it stood up like some glorious grey mane yes yes he said i made an effort i wont no my peter i will not lose sight of the dear gaieties of life god knows what it costs me even after a little thing like that i was more than ever plunged in the gulf of despondency i know how wrong i am i must never relax my efforts i mustnt give myself time to think work and laughter those divine twins he poured himself out a glass of whisky and soda and chose a cigar with proper care a word or two on practical affairs he said before i go to my lonely and wakeful bed you will be here i understand till early in december by then i trust i insist indeed on thus trusting that i shall have schooled myself to face the desolation of my home what once was home again may i do you think ask to remain here till then i look upon your beautiful howes as my hospital soon still maimed still limping still in the blue uniform of pain i know that i must indeed i insist on it face the world again and make the best of my shattered existence but till then silvia whom i consulted with regard to this matter told me that you were the master of howes and suggested my speaking to you about it peter saw an opportunity his father it is true was an odious infliction of an evening but there was something to be gained by his own eager tolerance of that which quite outweighed the inconvenience but he must do more than tolerate he must welcome and silvia here was the point must know how splendidly he had risen to it before he answered he made himself remember what the intonation of cordiality sounded like but that is perfectly charming of you he said its lovely that the suggestion came from yourself she and i may be away for a day or two in november peter did not quite know what arrangement he was to suggest about such days when he and silvia would be away for instance on their visit to nellie he was spared the trouble of formulating one by his father who gave a great gesticulation admirably expressive of courage i will go home home for those days he said i will with set teeth and firm mouth begin to grow accustomed to my desolation and loneliness i will learn to bear it taking in long draughts the inestimable tonic of work peter peter and the voice shook when will my carissima come back to me he was unmanned only for a moment and his mastery of himself returned to him was ever a stricken man so blessed by the love of his children he exclaimed god bless you my peter you are going to bed the abruptness of this benediction convinced peter that his father had got what he wanted and had no more use for him that night and he went along the corridor to his room and silvias his first impulse was to tell her how cordially for his part he had welcomed his fathers suggestion the second and wiser one was to say nothing about it mr mainwaring was sure to make the most of it to her he might even attribute to it that force from inside which turned the wheels yes silvia should learn about it like that he let himself very quietly into his room and undressed and went to bed without going in to say good night to her if he went in to see her it was more than likely that she would ask him whether his father had alluded to the question of his remaining with them and he wanted the information concerning that to be conveyed to her by one who would give him peter felt sure a florid testimonial for cordiality he had passed moreover a monotonous and fatiguing evening and wanted not to talk at all but to sleep his father had been slightly more dreadful than usual mrs wardour had more than ever been non existent and silvia so it struck him had been waiting had been watching him not it need hardly be said with fixed eye or stealthy glances but with some steady psychical alertness that was incessantly poised on him without looking at him without any talking to him or talking at him he had felt all evening this perhaps had been the most fatiguing part of it that she had scarcely been conscious of anyone else but him though her eyes were on the cards and she ruefully bemoaned that the goddess of piquet whom she jointly invoked with peters father had been so niggardly in her favours towards herself it had been no more than an automaton that was thus victimized to the extent of three lost games including a rubicon peter as he curled himself up in bed let his mind stray drowsily over such details of the evening coming back always to this impression of silvias watching him whenever he spoke to her of his father she watched him seldom with her eyes in just that manner by aid of his quick perception that felt rather than reasoned peter had he was sure arrived at what she watched for then she watched for some token she listened for some inflection that indicated tenderness sympathy affection towards his father she could not have been watching for any such token as that for herself for he gave her those she knew they were hers but he had never felt more certain about anything in these dim vague regions of sentiment and desire than that she wanted something more than that which he gave her and a certain impatience gained on him what after all had been her own first words to him when he asked her to marry him had not her face flamed with the light of the beacon that welcomed him as she whispered that all she asked was to be allowed to love him at the time that had seemed to him a divine intuition one that in a word precisely defined her way of love and his there came at that door of his bedroom which led to her room the lightest most barely audible of touches he was scarcely sure whether he had heard it or not but he did not reply for either it was imaginary and needed no answer or it was silvia come to see whether he was in his room yet in that case even more an answer must be withheld for after this evening of strain and high pressure all he wanted was to be let alone and to go to sleep but underneath his eyelids not quite closed he watched the door which was opposite his bed and was dimly visible in the glimmer of starshine that came in through the open and uncurtained window round the edge of the door though he had heard no click of a turned handle there came a thin l of light which broadened until in the shaft of it appeared silvia she held a lighted candle which she screened from his bed with her hand the fingers of which close to the flame were of a warm transparent crimson apparently his clothes tumbled together on a chair first caught her notice and from them she looked straight towards the bed her face was vividly illuminated and when she saw him lying there with shut eyes some radiant ineffable tenderness came like dawn over it never had he seen so selfless and wonderful a beam she might have been some discarnate spirit permitted to look upon him who had been the love of her earthly heart that then was how she regarded him when she thought she was unobserved by him he meant that to her next moment round the half open door the light narrowed and disappeared and he was left again in the glimmering dusk never had he seen with half such certainty and directness what silvia was she had thought he was asleep and so she could let free her very soul neither by day nor night had she come to him quite like that all other emotions amusement interest sympathy desire passion even had concealed rather than revealed her they had been webs and veils across the sanctuary illumined indeed by the light that burned there but still hiding it now for one moment peter had seen her with those veils drawn aside the holy place of her and her love was the light of it he was sitting next afternoon in his room at the foreign office rather harassed by the necessity of being polite to everybody the clerk senior to him in his department was on leave and it happened that an extra kings messenger had to be sent off to rome carrying a new cipher that was a perfectly usual incident in peters routine but this messenger was fresh to his job and had been in and out of the office all day fussy and pompous wishing to be assured that he had got reserved compartments and a private cabin there was a strike on the french railways going on and peter had told him that it might be impossible to secure a compartment farther than paris but all that could be done had been done and anyhow he would find a seat reserved for him usually peter rather enjoyed applying soothing ointments to agitated people and his skill as a manipulator of pompous and fussy persons was so effective that by common consent he quite agreeing tiresome officials were often turned on to him for emollient manipulation but to day the telephonings and the interruptions and the pomposity and the prime necessity of remaining dulcetly apologetic for inconveniences which were wholly out of his control had got on his nerves and when finally in answer to inquiries it had been determined that the kings messenger had better in order to secure a journey probably unvexed by strikes go round by southampton and havre peter had been treated to some very acid talk of course the man was an ass no one knew that better than he and it was ludicrous to be infuriated by an ass about six then that afternoon peter had done all that patience and polite inquiries from french station masters could do for the ass and with undiminished civility he had wished him a pleasant journey in half an hour or if he chose now since there was nothing more that could detain him he could telephone for his car and slide down to howes he did not in the least look forward to his evening there it would assuredly be an evening of as high a pressure as the day had been his father would certainly be voluble with blessings and gratitude and peter hated the prospect of these benedictions installed as mr mainwaring now was for a couple of months more he would surely develop the idea which he had before now outlined when he assured peter that during his daily absences in london he himself would act as his vice regent he had already caused the luncheon hour to be changed in order that he might get an extra half hour of work into the morning already he had got the estate carpenter to knock him up an immense frame in which he could see his second cartoon now dismally approaching completion more satisfactorily displayed and then peter thought of that short candle lit glimpse last night when silvia had looked into his room for one moment the remembrance of that magnetically beckoned him the next as by some inexplicable reversal the needle of that true compass swung round and pointed in the opposite direction it no longer gave him his course back to howes it steadily pointed away from howes but even as he told himself how inexplicable that was his subconscious self gave a convincing explanation of it to hurry back to silvia and her watch of love to feel that there were veils which only he could draw aside but which when drawn aside by god knew what aspirations towards a light he did not comprehend would reveal to him again the glory of her sanctuary was a task for saints and lovers he would rise to it in time he would learn to be worthy of an ideal that somehow in spite of its white heat had the chill of asceticism frosting it but just now he longed for ordinary unreflective unstruggling human gaiety she silvia lived naturally on those heights just as his father lived in the cloud or the shroud maybe of his own inimitable egoism he was tidying his table intending to ring up very soon for his motor to take him back to howes if he started in half an hour he would have time to see his father before dressing and to talk to silvia between bath and dinner then he changed his mind and determined not to ring for his motor at all instead he would walk back across the park no not across the park but up whitehall and so by streets all the way to piccadilly he would have time to get a cup of tea at home and start from there immediately afterwards the rather longer route by the streets was infinitely preferable there would be crowds of ordinary human beings all the way people not monstrous on the one hand so far as he knew from swollen egoism nor irradiated by idealisms which made you pant in a rarefied atmosphere there would be just masses of people people gay people sulky ugly people pretty people but above all ordinary people at the moment when his tidying was complete and his table ready for his next days work the telephone on his table tinkled he resigned himself to more inquiries from the incomparable ass but they could not last long for his train left waterloo within a manageable number of minutes but in answer to his intimation that it was indeed he who waited at the end of the wire there did not come the voice which he had listened to so often that day but one quite other and equally recognizable nellie he said yes my dear how lucky i am to catch you youre in town then at the moment said he im going back to howes in half an hour oh what a pity you wont be in town to night then why asked peter only that philip and i were going to the play and philips got a cold and thinks it wiser not to go out i thought perhaps just a lovely off chance that you might come instead oh do peter hold on wait half a minute said he he put the receiver down on the table seating himself on the edge of it here in excelsis was precisely what he longed for dinner a theatre a talk all with nellie who represented to him though in excelsis the ideal epitome of the world of humanity he had thought a moment before with the sense of anticipating a break the mere walk through crowded streets she would in this programme give him all that intimately she would give also the sense of intimate friendship without effort they would jabber and enjoy he took up the receiver again yes all quite easy he said its late already and when its late and i cant get down there i can always sleep in town silvia and i settled that when i began work again in this doleful office nellie appeared to laugh at that silvia evidently spoils you she said but its too lovely to catch you like this will you dine with me at the ritz seven the play cant remember what it is begins at eight so we shant have to hurry and can sit with our elbows on the table for a bit and talk sit with what asked he elbows on the table said nellie with elaborate distinctness no hurry talk this time he laughed oh dont lets go to the ritz he said come and have elbows at my great house ill go back there now and order dinner itll probably be beastly but its more private shall we do that much nicer said nellie how are you peter oh i can ask that afterwards seven then wardour house yes give condolences to philip not congratulations mind peter hung up the receiver and then took it off again at once in order not to give himself time to think there would be clamour and argument if he thought and he wanted nothing of that sort ten minutes afterwards he left the office having telephoned to the jackdaw that he was detained here and would be obliged to sleep in london two months had passed since nellie and he had met but whatever frontier change of limitation or expansion had been decreed for each severally since then their meeting to night had the power to put such aside and they hailed each other without the embarrassment of altered circumstances their compasses were rigidly in accord and as the excellent impromptu meal proceeded the talk sailed towards northern lights in the direction of their steadfast needles soon they were sitting at the elbow stage with their coffee and cigarettes with a quiet quarter of an hour in front of them before they need start motor at ten minutes to eight said peter to the servant glancing at the clock tell me when it comes round he shifted his chair a little sideways towards her oh this is jolly he said for weve gone on just where we left off youre just the same its two months you know since i set eyes on you do say youve missed me what else did you expect said she marriage isnt oh peter whats the name of that river thames asked peter no the forgetting one lethe because im married to philip i dont forget other people but tell me has silvia been giving you lethe to drink instead of early morning tea not a drop shes given me everything else in the world nellie still had that habit of plaiting her fingers together you ought to be very grateful to me she said it was i after all one night at my mothers flat do you remember i was jacob that night remarked peter nellie frowned dont tell me how she said i want to see if we think side by side still ah ive got it philip was esau isnt that clever and i told him i was tired and so you supplanted him right get on said peter yes about your gratitude it was that night that i told you to ask silvia to marry you didnt i yes thank you dear mrs beaumont said peter effusively so good of you to tell me it was a good idea wasnt it nellies mind stiffened itself to attention at that moment before it had been standing very much at ease the best idea in the world he said im awfully glad said she what you say too makes it all the more delightful of you to stop up in town to night instead of going back to her though up till now they had fitted into each other with all the old familiar smoothness it appeared now when they got near in their conversation to what had happened to each of them not so he still felt altering them but putting them into new cases that there was fresh ground to be broken hitherto they had only picked their way over the old ground nellie felt this even more imperatively than he they had got to run the plough so why not at once on this admirable opportunity through the unturned land peters servant had already appeared in the doorway announcing the motor and she had noticed that but peter had not she concluded from that that he easy as their intercourse had up till now been was feeling some pre occupation his hesitation in answering her last acknowledgment of his amiability in remaining in town instead of going back to howes confirmed that impression then before the pause was unduly prolonged so as to amount to embarrassment she put her word in again i appreciate that she said because it shows that the new ties havent demolished the old and on my side i admit far more definitely than you that if my poor philip must have a cold i am glad ever so glad it visited him to night so as to give me an evening with you she swept her plate and coffee cup aside to make room for an advance of the elbows oh my dear i have missed you she said naturally however perfectly philip is himself he couldnt be you my mind perhaps you havent noticed it has wonderfully improved these last months i am learning italian and we read dante but it needs just a little holiday and ive found out such a lot of things about philip and all of them are good worse luck peter looked up at her with that liquid seriousness of eye which to her meant that he was walking in the wet woods oh poor thing he said for some reason which she did not choose to investigate nellie found that remark immensely encouraging certainly a few minutes ago she had tried to provoke him to talk really talk but the ironical perfection of his condolence which so she felt saw all round what she was saying made her more than acquiesce in his listening instead of talking she felt sure that this beloved peter understood i knew you would sympathize she said but theres my tragic prosperity my philip isnt lazy or spiteful and inconsiderate or selfish or bad tempered or greedy or or anything at all except that he knows so much about birds he has taught me a lot and hes quite absolutely devoted to me he never liked anybody so much as me but do you know darling to a woman at any rate having a good nice man quite devoted to her as far as his affections go gives her once in a way a little sense of strain she has to find her hymn book and sing ill lend you mine said peter speaking without thought but only by instinct thanks when will you want it back no i wont borrow it but the fact is that an undilutedly good man wants something to make him fizz you must have humour or a vile temper or cynicism or greediness or something to make you drinkable my dear what am i saying the clock on the mantelpiece struck the hour at which the curtain of their play rose but the chimes eight sonorous thumps preceded by the quarters penetrated peters brain no more than the announcement of the motor ten minutes ago had done youre talking awfully good sense he said at any rate youre talking a language i can understand you always did we quarrelled and wrangled but we were on the same plane so we are now thank heaven said she its time you gave me some news you know whatever pre occupation it was that held peter he seemed to shake himself free of it yes ive got news all right he said domestic tragedy oh my dear what asked she nothing awful he seemed to know for certain that she was figuring in her mind something about himself and silvia so in the upshot the sequel the development he was but he tested her so to speak over the domestic tragedy itself my mother has run away from home he began nellie did not laugh she only bit her tongue with firm purpose dear peter she said when she released it she has simply gone he said round about ten days ago when father arrived to study his first cartoon with a view to the rest of the series mrs wardour bought it by the way gracious me what a lot we have got to talk about never mind the cartoon said nellie with thrilled interest get on with the tragedy quite uncontrollably peters mouth began to lengthen itself he did not quite smile but the promise of a smile was there tragedy then he said my mother sent me a long oh such a priceless letter to say that when my father came home again his home i mean he would find she had gone the dryad the gay conscienceless nellie could not in spite of her improved mind quite contain herself but your mother she asked at her age how absolutely wonderful of her do you know who he is peter tried not to laugh and completely failed in that dutiful endeavour she could but follow his lead and the two drawing psychically nearer to each other every moment abandoned themselves just for natural relief to this irrepressible mirth you are such a damned fool nellie he said at length do listen dont be funny its quite different pologies said she rather shakily it wasnt anything so romantic but it was just as human said peter you know how my mother was hammered into herself that phrase came in her letter by the way its not original but i never guessed there was anything to hammer said nellie nor did i at least i only half guessed but there was a breaking point came and she couldnt stick my father any longer she has just gone away do you remember how she used always to be looking up hotels in railway guides i remember that most of all said she well shes gone to one of them shes just gone away to be free not to lead somebody elses life any more when she has got a good breath of air she may apparently come back but she doesnt promise nellie had grown quite serious again thats even more wonderful of her she said she just went away because she wanted to be herself my dear what a mother and waiting till you were married and your father go on this time peters mouth strayed beyond the limits of mere reflective meditation and smiled broadly he has discovered to his complete satisfaction why she left him he said he knows as if gabriel had told him that his tremendous personality his devotion to art all that sort of thing was too much for her he reproaches himself bitterly and oh my dear how he enjoys it with having failed to realize the frailty not moral the weakness the ordinariness of other people she was scorched in his magnificent flames and escaped from that furnace with her life but how lovely for him said nellie lovely for her too but why tragedy you said it was a tragedy his whole body gave a jubilant jerk if he had been standing up he must have jumped ah you do see that dont you he cried i just rejoice in her at least i would nellie divined perfectly well that if silvia understood really completed the sentence but if peter wished for the present anyhow to leave that unspoken loyalty to their comradeship prevented her from suggesting it another motive not less potent than that dictated her silence on the point for she infinitely preferred that he should volunteer some such information concerning himself and silvia than that she should give away her knowledge of it certainly she longed to know in what real relation he and silvia stood to each other but it would be a tactical error tactical was too businesslike to let him know that his incomplete sentence gave her so certain a hint i see she said quickly you would rejoice in her if it wasnt for your father until the two ultimate words of that were spoken peters eyes had been bright and expectant he evidently waited for the termination which she had refused to utter when her sentence was complete she saw unmistakably again that his eyes accepted and acquiesced in her conclusion quite he said in a level voice so for the present my father is consumed with remorse and is occupying the state rooms youve never seen them gorgeous tapestry and lincrusta walton ceilings till we come up to town he is painting away at the series of cartoons peter poured himself out a second cup of coffee from the tray that had been left between them half an hour or more before aunt joanna he said you never heard such a plot or saw such a person shes my mother in laws sister you know shes got at my father theres no doubt of it and shes secured all the cartoons by bribery and corruption instead of their being painted for the gallery the art gallery i should say at howes aunt eleanor shes my father in laws brothers wife has secured the sketches for the cartoons theyve been to howes once but my father quite dominated them that was before the crash so you may judge how much more with that added string of tragedy to his bow he would dominate them now they are more priceless than words can say there will be a family gathering at christmas i understand nellie do come we would have such a gorgeous time if you were there we would sit quiet and notice and drink in and then we would sit over the fire together when uncle john and uncle abe uncle abe asked nellie in an awed voice yes sir abel darley kbe husband to aunt joanna dont interrupt when uncle john and uncle abe and aunt eleanor and aunt joanna have gone not staggering at all but full up to bed we would have such holy convocations about them nellie had inferred a little more information about silvia by this time but what occupied her most was not what she was inferring about anybody it was quite enough for her to realize that for the duration anyhow of the first act of the play which they had meant to see she was in the old full enjoyment of peter again they had stepped back into the candour and closeness of their friendship and though he had not as she had confessed that he was having a holiday it was transparently clear that this was the case but just there the candour was clouded she guessed that even as she was having a holiday from philip god bless him so peter was having a holiday from silvia only here was the difference he did not or would not own up to that even in the projected scheme of christmas hilariousness at the uncles and aunts silvia did not appear as ever so faintly ridiculous or as ever so faintly partaking in the midnight merriment throughout their talk peter had kept her hermetically apart once or twice nellie conjectured he had pointedly enough refrained from introducing her she could visualize the rest of them down at howes but the part that to peter silvia played was mysteriously shrouded when you were laughing at everybody all round why should you except one person from the compliment of amused criticism it was clear that silvia had no applause for the comedy of peters parents for he had so cordially welcomed her nellies appreciation of it what then was silvias line what was her relation above all to peter she decided not to burn all her boats but to set fire to just a little one wont silvia enjoy them too she asked cant tell said peter if there was a lapse of loyalty there if in a minor degree there was a sense conveyed of disappointment though of accepting that disappointment without comment nellie decided that peter was not intending to enlarge on it she still after that small burned boat clung to the chance of peters volunteering information but clearly she would not get that just now and another heavy booming of quarters from the clock gave her an excellent opportunity of abandoning that which after all had never been a discussion on her own initiative good gracious its a quarter to nine she said you wretch peter weve missed one act if not two lets miss them all he said and have an evening that made her pause but only for a moment peter had consistently shied away from that one topic she wanted to hear about and a break of some sort was much more likely to produce in him the pressure that would eventually go pop than if they remained just sizzling here but we absolutely must go she said philip will ask me about the play and i couldnt tell him that you and i simply sat talking till it was over why not said peter because it isnt done my dear you and i have signed on to the conventionalities of life come along a bore but there it is besides how would you account for your evening to silvia dining at seven you know that requires a theatrical explanation oh dont be vulgar said peter as if silvia wouldnt delight in my spending an evening with you i know that said she dont lose your sense of humour peter it was a mild kind of joke come on then he said and as for its being my fault that were so late the second act was drawing to an end when they stole into their box on the stage there was proceeding the most elementary of muddles to which it was not in the least worth while to devote any ingenuity it was clear at the first glance that these people who pretended to be servants were really landed gentry and that just before the end the earl who had taken the house would propose to the cook and be violently accepted psychologically they presented no point of interest far more engrossing to nellie was the fact that she had got peter with her and the pleasure of that and the general problem it propounded was far more absorbing marriage had certainly quickened her emotional perceptions and she inferred from the extraordinary delight that it was to be with him again how much in the interval she had missed him she had no reason to complain either of the welcome he had given her but it was manifest how she could not definitely have said that the quality of that was different from hers to him to his sense as he had openly stated they had taken up the old attitude the old intimacy without break but as she thought over that in the few minutes that elapsed before the act was finished she found that for her part she did not altogether endorse his view certainly the old intimacy was there firm and unshaken but somehow hovering over it like a mist which to her eyes seemed to be luminous with tears there was some new atmospheric condition sunny and tremulous peter turned to her as the house sprang into light again oh what a waste of time he said we should have done much better to have left our elbows on the table were always doing it too do you remember the last play at which we met that time you were with philip and i with silvia and mrs wardour then we had our talk afterwards to night we had it first i like the other plan best though peter had here stated several things with which she was in cordial agreement his tone was not in tune with the old footing the old intimacy not many minutes ago it had been she who in opposition to his inclination had insisted on breaking their tte tte now with all possible lightness of touch she suggested its resumption ive seen enough she said i can tell philip all about it lets go back my dear and have half an hours more talk it was my fault that we broke up but how could i have told that the play would have been as silly as this we shall talk more sense in five minutes than theyll put into the whole of the next act peters eyes were wandering round the house at this moment they were attracted by a feather fan violently signalling from a box directly opposite and the general buzz of the theatre was quite distinctly pierced with a shrill scream of laughter which came from precisely the same direction as the gesticulating fan it was hardly necessary to put up his glasses to ascertain the authorship of these phenomena mrs trentham he said unerringly with the usual myrmidons she has seen us nellie come round and be conventional oh why said she if she wants to see us she can come here cant she but she doesnt want to see us she only wants to be seen she felt that at that moment she was becoming to peter part of the general foreground a prominent object in it but still only part of it his next words confirmed the impression oh come along he said lets embark on the ordinary ridiculous evening lets all go back to supper with me or perhaps theres a dance going on come round and forage nellie ive been in the country for a month you know besides she knew perfectly well what he had left unsaid and answered it but what does it matter how much she talks she asked peter gave her a glance of brilliant surprise how did you know that that was what i didnt say he demanded because its you of course or if you like because its me the fan waved more vehemently than ever wed better go said he nellie got up in the old days she would almost certainly have been able to superimpose her wish over his now it was the other way about she seemed to be in the grip of some internal necessity of doing what he wanted he had to have his way not because he had become stronger of will but because she had lost her power of self assertion with regard to him it was not any general debility of will on her part she had her way with philip for instance with an effortless ease but then she was not part only of the foreground to philip nor to her was peter part only of the foreground chapter xii peter managed to get away from the foreign office next day in the absence of anything to detain him an hour or so before his usual time and arriving at the gilded gates of the battlemented lodge of howes while the warm october twilight still lingered in the sky he got out to walk across the mile of park that separated him from the house his truant evening in town last night the plunge into the froth and noise and chatter had quieted some sort of restlessness had assuaged some sort of hunger and he was still licking the chops of memory content in a few minutes now to wipe his mouth and go his journey again he just had the sense of having enjoyed an evening out of having lolled in the old familiar tap room with the usual habitus over a pot of beer while a friendly barmaid this was mrs trentham made the usual jokes over the counter as she served him some of these seemed to have sounded better by electric light so to speak than did the timbre of their memory in the dusky crimson of the dying day and he recalled the welcome of screams and shrieks she had given to nellie and himself when at his insistence they had visited her in the box opposite she threatened when she learned they had already dined alone appearing so very late at the play to send anonymous letters to silvia and philip there was a judge in the divorce court she added who was much devoted to her and would no doubt give her admission for the two cases when they came on the robust wit of lord poole had ably seconded her then with the exception of nellie who had to go home to put an end to philips solitary evening they had all gone back to wardour house where peter promised some sort of scratch supper and nellie finding that her husband had already gone to bed joined them again it had been altogether a pleasant ridiculous evening which had made itself in this impromptu and accidental manner an ordinary human evening just twice there had for peter been a slight check a signal momentarily against him once when he found that nellie had left again very soon after her reappearance at supper without a word to him once when without warning it had entered his mind that at just about this time the night before he had seen his bedroom door open and silvias face look in on him as he lay with closed eyelids feigning sleep that was rather a dreadful thing to have done he paused a moment on the bridge that crossed the lake looking at the image of the house duskily reflected on its far margin there was someone coming towards him along the path that led by the edge of the lake and joined the road here and before his eyes had time to tell him who it was she waved a hand at him without the screams without the violent gesticulations by which mrs trentham the night before had made herself known she quickened her pace as he answered her signal and in three minutes more he had joined her the chauffeur told me you had walked from the lodge she said so i came to meet you youre early peter kissed her ill go away again shall i he said no as youve come you can stop she said and what did you do with yourself last night not all alone i hope you found somebody peter smiled at her somebody he said crowds first of all nellie rang up at the fo saying that she had been going to the play with philip but that he had a cold so would i we dined at home and talked so long with elbows on the table that we didnt get to the play till towards the end of the second act ah that was luck to find nellie said silvia i was afraid you might have a horrid lonely evening and then then just one act of downstairs but one act was better than four there had been railway whistles and flags waving from the box opposite that was mrs trentham said silvia it was so we swept in her lot the usual one with lord poole who told me to kiss you for him and they all came to supper at home really that plan of keeping the house open was an admirable one its awful fun we talked and smoked and laughed until everyone melted away she saw and loved to see the brightness and briskness of him she heard and loved to hear his cheerfulness and alacrity oh i am glad you had a nice evening she said i nearly telephoned to say i was coming up to keep you company but then i thought i had better stop and and try to make myself disagreeable at home did you succeed darling asked peter exactly then it struck silvia that if peter had dined had sat so long with elbows on the table and had got to the theatre in time for anything at all he could not have been detained very late at the foreign office she instantly drew down with a rush and a rattle some mental blind in front of that she shut it out she did not choose to see it yes pretty well she said mother went to bed at ten anyhow which is early for her so i must have been fairly successful not proved said peter she may have been sleepy its a sleepy place you know i know she said two nights ago i came and looked into your room as i had not heard you come to bed and there you were fast asleep snoring i suppose youll tell me said he this point about detention at the foreign office with time yet to dine and confabulate and go to the theatre had struck him too he had meant it to be assumed that he had telephoned to signify the knowledge that he would be detained and now by this stupid inadvertence in giving the account of his evening he had shown for all who cared to think that he had not been detained but silvia apparently had quite missed that or she would surely have said something to that effect as it was she had passed it by it was out of sight by now behind another well another misunderstanding she proceeded to put a further corner between her consciousness and it no i dont say snoring she said oh peter your father has told me how delightful how angelic you were to him about his stopping on here till we go back to london it touched him very much she took his arm it touched me too dear she said and i must tell you that it furnished a reason one out of several why i came to meet you ive got a confession peter guessed what this reason was and what the confession when he made a plan he was quite accustomed to find it work itself out as he had meant but now in the very apex of its success he felt ashamed of it if it came to confessions he could make his contribution he interrupted her i dont care about that reason he said tell me the other ones instead the other ones will come afterwards she said if you want to hear them then this has got to come first so dont interrupt darling i will tell you its an affair of conscience and im a conscientious objector said he as it became more and more certain in his mind what silvias confession was the less he wanted to hear it though he himself patting his own back for his cleverness had contrived the plan of which this was the logical sequel but when he did that he had not yet pretended to be asleep one night nor on another telephoned his detention in town silvia went on with a gentle but perfectly determined firmness ive misjudged you altogether peter she said and ive got to confess for days now more days than i like to number i have been watching you looking for something i missed in you i thought you were unkind and sarcastic and cynical about your father and what he told me of the manner in which you welcomed his proposal to stop on here convinced me how utterly i had been wronging you it was owlishly stupid of me to suppose you could be like that and what was worse it was brutally unloving peter laughed any more big words coming he asked owlish stupid brutal unloving thats you all over have you murdered anybody she shook her head its no use making light of it she said it was stupid it was unloving of me i thought that because you saw certain absurdities and unrealities about your father you saw nothing but them and were impatient and untender with him do you forgive me for being such a fool peter tried to imagine himself telling her that she had been perfectly right throughout that only a piece of trickery on his part in getting his father to give an account of the welcome his proposition had met with had deluded her into thinking she was wrong but his vanity the thought of the sorry figure he would present made it quite impossible to contemplate so fundamental an honesty short of being honest he had better be superb he stopped facing her knowing well the effect his physical presence had on her you darling theres one thing i dont forgive you for he said and that is for being such a fool as to think there was anything for me to forgive even as he made this neat phrase the truth of it came home to him there was indeed nothing for him to forgive she gave a long sigh oh you must teach me to be generous she said peter felt himself unutterably mean at that moment but the thing was done he had been superb as well as dishonest and if honesty had been too high for his vanity to attain to it was just as incapable of demolishing the golden image of himself that he had set up for silvia then there was the point concerning his apparent slumber two nights ago there was the point concerning his telephone last night he wished intensely that she hadnt asked him to teach her generosity now for the other reasons why you came to meet me he said there would be balsam and food for his vanity here he had the grace to recognize that even while he asked it because i wanted to see you said she i like that reason have you any more of that brand he knew that the word which took lightly what was so immense would after her confession cause her to smile it was of the species which she had thought cynical and which she now knew was just the everyday garb in which affection and tenderness clothed themselves because it seemed so long since i saw you she said oh peter theres only one reason really which matters because i love you and that brought home to him a meanness a dishonesty against which all the rest was but feathers in a scale weighted on the other side with the world itself often before now he had known how unintelligibly great that was now for the first time he was irritated at himself for his want of comprehension with regard to it he was accustomed to understand things to which he gave his mind but here his mind was brought to a dead stop by this great shining wall that was unscalable and impenetrable but to be honest was his irritation quite confined to himself or did that shining wall from its very incomprehensibility provoke a portion of it silvia seemed to herself to miss something in his silence but with peter there nothing could really be missing how often i say that she whispered but how often i feel that theres nothing else worth saying more of that brand said he not a drop we must go in you havent seen your father yet and after that you must have your bath and after that you must send your maid away so that we can get a few minutes sensible conversation said peter ill begin it now said she sometimes you know your bath goes to your head and youre not quite as serious as you might be say im drunk and have done with it suggested he very well sometimes your bath makes you tipsy but while youre sober i want you to promise me something shall i like it asked peter prudently it isnt to spend a week with uncle abe or anything of that kind nothing of that kind poor uncle abe youll like it at least youll find youll like it youll know it does you good thats not the same thing objected he it does me good to get up bright and early so as to start for town without hurrying but i hate it silvia laughed it will relieve you of that to some extent she said oh do be quick and promise instead of making such a fuss right but if youve deceived me ill never trust you again i promise well for as long as we are here i want you to spend at least one night in the week in town i shall do nothing of the kind said he i dont care an atom about my promise pish for my promise and how will it relieve me oh i see but i shant unless you come too thats to say silvia stopped now listen to me she said you enjoyed last night immensely its perfectly natural that you should have i should think you were ill if you hadnt how do you know i enjoyed it i never said so said he you did better than that you beamed all over your atrocious countenance when you told me about it you were obliged to stop in town and being obliged you found and you know it perfectly well that it was a sort of night out you saw your friends you had a beano silvia kept her finger on the cord of the blind she had chosen to pull down in her mind she refused with a sublime intellectual dishonesty to look at the fact that peter certainly could have come down here by dinner time if he had time to dine early in town she would not see it already so she told herself she had once fallen into an owlishly stupid error and worse by doubting him by watching him now at least she could repair that to some extent by the supreme honesty of trusting him without question something had happened to keep him in town and it was no business of hers to think of that at all he had said he was detained at the foreign office and for her he was detained there she held her eyes open to the intensest light of all which was that of her own love and the more it blinded her to everything else the better it was only creatures like bats and owls things of the night that were blinded by the dayspring you enjoyed it you had a beano she repeated why not say so peter hesitated but for a reason that she had refused to entertain the existence of the fact now shiningly clear that silvia had never so remotely seen that he could easily have got down here in time for dinner made it unintelligibly and unreasonably needful for him to tell her so there was something sordid in not doing so had she shown the smallest suspicion of it he would probably have explained it away in some ingenious manner yes i enjoyed it he said that was why i did it i could easily have got down here in time for dinner up went the blind at that with a snap and a whirr and silvias face beaming and delighted smiled out at him oh peter how lovely of you to tell me she cried of course i guessed only i wouldnt guess theres just the joy of it all that came from her like the stroke of a birds wing that bore it through the sunny air with another stroke she returned to him now youve got no excuse for refusing my beautiful plan she said and it was nice of you not to tell me at once you knew you had to some time and it was all the better for keeping my dear theres the dressing bell just go and see your father for a minute you can talk to him in the smoking room after mother and i have gone to bed as silvia heard through her bedroom door the splashings and the rinsings and the gurglings which regulated her own speed of dressing she was absorbed in the perception of the one thing that was great and its myriad manifestations up the trunk of the tree and through the branches and to the remotest ends of the twigs flowed the sap and all the firmness of the trunk the vigour of the branches the elasticity of the twigs the decoration of flower and leaf and fruit which made the tree lovely were manifestations and embodiments of the sap if there was a wound in its bark the sap healed it if there was a nest among its boughs an external loveliness of life which visited it it was still the sap which had fashioned its anchorage the remotest leaf of that tower of forest greenery was nurtured by it and all the being and the beauty sprang from it there was nothing big or little if you looked at it in that way though just now she had decided that only one thing was big and all the rest was little then came a rare an unusual splash occasionally when peter began to stand up in his bath after the hot soaking he fell down his foot slipped on the smooth surface and this made the rare and enormous splash this always caused her a certain anxiety he might hit his head against the edge of the bath just tap at the bathroom door wilton she said and ask if mr mainwaring is all right but before the chaste wilton could get as far as the door a new splashing began it doesnt matter wilton she said your pearls maam asked wilton then came the tap at the door and wilton slid out of the picture i fell down said peter i might have hurt myself but i didnt i wish you werent so wonderful i cant help that said she you should have thought of it before peter began drying his toes ive had quite a long talk with my father he said and all about you he thinks youre wonderful too he adores you they all adore you particularly lord poole peter dont be tipsy said she i shall be as tipsy as i like i want to know one thing why werent you annoyed with me for saying that i couldnt get back last night silvia held out the pearls for him to clasp round her neck if you dont understand that you must be tipsy she said and if i do he asked she leaned her head a little back why then you understand it all she said you understand for instance why i insist on your having a night in town every week yes i see just that you shall get rid of me now and then he said quite right youre as sober as as a commoner i suppose she moved in her chair and one end of her necklace slipped from his fingers am i putting them on for dinner he asked or am i taking them off for bedtime whatever youre doing you are being wonderfully clumsy said she as his fingers warm and soft from his bath touched the back of her neck she was down before him next morning to give him his breakfast and waiting for him strolled out on to the terrace there had been one of those exquisite early october frosts and in the air was that ineffable fragrance derived from absence of smell the odourless odour of frosted dew the sun was already warm with promise of a hot cloudless day but as the heat had not set in motion the weaving of the scents of earth and grass and flowers which would soon decorate and veil the virginal beauty of the morning last night when she and peter had lingered here in the end of the twilight the air was not less clear and windless but it had been charged with all the myriad scents distilled by the hot hours of autumn sun now there was a precision a crystalline quality some such sort of clear sparkle bathed her spirit also her love basked in some such virginal beauty of young day flamelike and scentless all the evening before from the time when she met peter by the lake she body and soul and spirit had been rising towards some new peak of passion and the true topmost summit seemed to her now to be where she stood in this cool brightness able to see that the upward path which led here was below her they had dined after peter had clasped her necklace for her there had been the usual piquet for her and mr mainwaring and for the latter a triumphant pan of achievement over some effect of lightning in the second cartoon which positively as he stood aside as artist and became spectator appalled him and before they settled down to their cards he must needs conduct them to the masterpiece in question and let them also feel the cold clutch of fear but whatever mr mainwaring did or said whatever her mother it was peter whom in this rising tide of flame and self surrender silvia watched no longer looking for those signs of tenderness and affection which owlish she had missed but in the rapturous contemplation of them often she had seen him charming to her mother and to his own father but always so she had thought she could detect in him politeness and amenity the controlling hand of breeding the practice of pleasant behaviour but this evening there had been no behaviour about him at all he had been radiant with them both divinely natural he had sat next mrs wardour on the sofa as the piquet was in progress and entertained her with ludicrous but hopelessly recognizable caricatures of her and his father over their cards he had held a skein of her wool he had mixed her hot water and lemon juice for her all these things he had often done before and they were all trivial enough he was the same with his father looking over his hand when so bidden dutifully observing exactly how to play that puzzling game eager to anticipate his wants chaffing him sometimes behaving to him this again was the wrong word being to him rather all that his own sonship implied fulfilling in every word and gesture the welcome which he had given to the suggestion of his remaining with them till they went to london and all that was the worlds side which anyone might see and behind it in lights and darks undreamed of was that other aspect and reality of him which was hers alone she was already in bed when she heard him after his smoking room chat with his father come into his room and presently after tapping on her door he looked in coatless and shoeless she pretended in parody of what happened two nights before to be asleep and between her eyelids nearly closed she saw a broad smile overspread his face i dont believe a single word of it he remarked all this all it was and all it meant silvia now as she waited for him looked at looked down on even from this crowning pinnacle as on upward ultimate slopes even as in the cool scentless air of the morning the miracle of the sunshine on the windless world was more itself than when its beams had drawn that response of fragrance from all living things so shone for her untroubled with passion and desire the essence itself of love in its own crystal globe not less precious now that it was conveyed to her in no material manifestation would be the bodily presence of him through whom that essence was conveyed to her who embodied love to her mortal sense but for ever far more precious was it now that she in this pause of content that crowned passion with a royal diadem could for the moment see that in loving him she loved not him alone but love itself that moved the sun and the other stars and being all gave all the duration of the moment in which silvia reached that point not theoretically but as a felt and experienced reality was infinitesimal just as in significance it was infinite at the sound of peters step on the bare boards of the dining room just within the atmosphere of the summit where she stood grew laden and fragrant with the scents of the world she did not come down from it it did not rise up above her she was there still but she was there in body as well as in spirit the fragrance of material sweetness was near her even as when now she stepped back into the dining room a waft of rose scent from the sun warmed wall smothered her nostrils peter was poking about among dishes on the side table and gave her a grunt neither more nor less in answer to her salutation he held that to be in good spirits at breakfast time was a symptom that could not be taken too seriously by that test there was nothing wrong with him this morning he sat down with an ill used sigh ive got a headache he remarked oh im sorry said she where in my left ankle of course said he silvia passing behind him just tweaked the short hair at the back of his neck oh dont finger me said peter angrily he gave her so quick a glance that she could scarcely tell whether he had actually looked at her or not and went on without pause and without hurry clinking out his words like newly minted coins separate and crisply cut and hot just let me alone sometimes he said you know how i hate dabbing and pressing and grasping youre the limit you know he had got her stiff and staring and still without pause and in precisely the same voice he went on dont let me have to speak to you like that again he said and dont be so owlish but confess that youve fallen into that trap still she stood staring and he took one step towards her and flung his arms close round her neck pressing her face to his and then more directly finding and claiming her mouth you utterly divine girl he said i never dreamed i should take you in i did kiss me three times to signify yes and three times more to signify that you are a darling and once more to well once more peter i thought you were cross with me said she when she could say anything how perfectly splendid that joke did come off didnt it she could smile again you brute she said but never take me in over that again darling anything else not that once more before his motor came round they strolled on the terrace outside it was thick now with the web of scents for the suns weaving was busy the late roses gave their fragrance and the verbena and the mignonette but these were but strung like beads on to the smell of the damp fruitful earth by now silvia could laugh at herself about that fierce phantom moment for never had peter seemed more utterly hers usually in these early half hours he was rather silent rather morose to day penitent perhaps or consolatory for the fright it was no less that he had unwittingly given her there was something of the bath intoxication about him if you were in any sense a devoted wife he said you would drive up with me deposit me at the fo and then wait three hours for me in the motor till lunch time i could give you an hour then after which you would wait four hours more and drive back with me therefore shall a woman leave her father and her mother and cleave to her husband yes of course ill come said she if you want me to you must just say you really want me he took hold of her elbows from behind and ran her along the terrace motor bike he observed im pushing you till you get your sense of humour working on its own account its working i swear its working shrieked silvia dont be such a bully a seat on the balustrade of the terrace seemed indicated after this violent exercise theres another thing said peter my mental power of association of ideas is decaying which is a sign of softening of the brain arent you sorry is that the brain in your head asked she no in the same place that ached when i had a headache left ankle dont interrupt but theres something in this house front and i believe its the cornice or whatever they call it which runs all along there underneath the windows on the first floor which thats the cornice reminds me of some other house peter pointed to the broad frieze like band which projected some foot or so from the wall of the house it was of portland stone amazingly carved with masks at intervals and ran as he had said just below the first floor windows from end to end of the faade then he gave a yodel which consciously or not was a hoarse and surprising parody of his fathers favourite method of indicating a general sumptuousness of sensation thats done it he said just speaking of it has reminded me what it was and theres the motor bother and blight it confound and curse it and what is the house it reminds you of she asked the flat belonging to nellies mother just below the windows there ran a band like that i noticed it one day last summer she had said something about it but at that point theres softening of the brain again all i said about the motor holds though send it away walk up to town instead suggested silvia likely with that headache in my ankle but i would so much sooner sit here with you than do either silvia waved to him as he drove off and waiting waved again as he crossed the bridge over the lake the air was thick with earthy fragrances now and her mind with fragrant memories and among them there was some new scent not quite strange to her but one from which she had always whenever it presented itself turned her head now it insisted on being analysed on being recognized when half an hour ago she had just tweaked his hair as she passed him his remonstrance to her ears had been wholly instinctive and sincere he objected to being fingered he had piled that up so she seemed to see making of it a joke against her until the joke grew preposterous then ever so convincingly he had smothered her with kisses yesterday evening too how convincing had been on some other plane his dearness that word must serve with her mother and mr mainwaring on one side were bright tokens of affection and to her of so much more than affection on the other that one little hot coin that clinked with a true ring before with admirable mimicry of himself he had showered out a whole flood of such which was the more real and where in these mists was that austere and shining summit chapter xiii just before christmas after three weeks in london silvia was driving down alone to howes in preparation for the party which was to arrive next day peter would come then he had got a devastating cold and it was far wiser in this grim inclemency of weather that he should not come down with her to day only to come up again for his work next morning it was much more sensible silvia had suggested it that he should nurse his cold that evening and well wrapped up make a single instead of a double journey to morrow but that piece of good sense was subsidiary to the fact that she did not want just for this evening to be alone with him even if his cold had not supplied an excellent argument in favour of this plan she would have suggested her own solitary departure wilton the correct virginal wilton sat opposite her on the front seat wilton had at the start deposited herself next the chauffeur but silvia had made her come inside but there was little use so thought wilton in coming inside if her mistress still kept both windows open the sleet had turned to uncompromising snow and silvia seemed to notice it no more than if she were a polar bear eventually as the car flowed up the long hill through putney wilton had been able to stand the draught no longer youll be catching a worse cold than mr mainwarings maam she said if you sit in that draught that made it more comfortable silvia roused herself for a moment his man doesnt take such care of him as you do of me wilton she said and so much pneumonia about maam observed wilton encouragingly silvia began to think consecutively starting not from far back but from the immediate past nellie had lunched with her alone just before she started for mrs wardour had been out and nellie had hailed this tte tte as the most delightful thing that could have happened nellie had been at wardour house too the night before for a concert during this month of december hardly yet three weeks old she had been there half a dozen times for mrs wardour resuming her social activities with extraordinary vigour after four months in the country had without the aid of any godmother turned december into june you know the real name of this delicious house darling nellie had said everyone calls it the new jerusalem because its gates are never shut day or night your mother brings light into the darkest homes of the upper classes theres such dreadful discontent among them if it wasnt for people angels like your mother they would all go and live in converted garages or in country cottages and pretend to be the proletariat its being amused and entertained that keeps the upper class together otherwise they would be the leaders of bolshevism the order of the british empire now why isnt she the only dame in it the stability of the upper class depends on her and the king depends on the upper class and the empire in fact if you see what i mean im not quite sure that i do but i do mean something we should all have groaned and grumbled if your mother hadnt set such a brilliant example with nellies brilliant presence and charm to help out this engaging nonsense it was a cheerful scintillation last june so silvia told herself she would vastly have enjoyed such a month as she had just spent and nellies rsum of it made her wonder whether she only she had been dull and unappreciative the snow was driven against the glass which wilton had put up she could hear it softly tap at the window and peter nellie had said what have you done to him darling or rather what havent you done to him everybody i think i told you so once used to be devoted to peter we used all to be in love with him for he was so priceless so marvellous in not caring one atom for anybody how long did it take you do tell me to discover his heart did you mine for it and dredge for it and blow up all the rocks round it or did you get an aeroplane and fly up to it perhaps after all it was in the sky so tremendously remote that nobody ever thought of looking for it there you and peter up in the blue like the queen bee and her lover how wildly romantic or were you there and did he fly up to you you met in the blue anyhow and left us all staring up after you till our eyes watered with the glare silvia as the car hooted its way through kingston did not concern herself to recall with what small accompaniment she had sustained those arpeggios she must have said something for nellie had gone on talking talking silvia had blinked before that brilliant vitality which so decorated all that lay under its beams but for the first time when she spoke like that about herself and peter the light hurt her it dazzled rather than illuminated and when it fell on certain dark places it did not illuminate them it only showed up their blackness she with nellies light nellies impressions to help her peered into them such glimpses as she caught between the dazzle and the darkness made her turn away with protest against this bulls eye that now seemed to intrude on privacy what after all had her relations with peter to do with nellie the streets were slippery with the newly fallen snow and at some corner while they were still passing through houses there was a furious hooting of the horn outside which to silvia at that moment was not so much a warning of danger ahead on the road as of danger lying somewhere deep within herself they came to a dead stop which made wilton scream faintly and clutch the jewel case and for a yard or two they slid backwards all that too seemed instantly translated in her mind into interior action and keeping pace with it she slid a little farther back in her journey of thought she brought out from the locked cupboard of her very soul where she had turned the key on it one particular moment it was yesterday that she had put it there she was in a room of a house in welbeck street and at the end of the consultation the great man jovial and kindly had got up from his chair and smoothed the pillow of a sofa on which she had lain just before be quite active dr symes summed up without overtiring yourself appetite good thats all right just go on with your ordinary life what no no doubt of any kind your husband well a cold everyones got a cold silvia paused over that while a wheel of her car slipped and skidded soon it hit the ground again but in that pause she faced the fact that she had not told peter she meant to last night but but he had bewailed his cold he had accepted her proposal that he should stop in london to night he had waved his hand at her and left her not kissing her for fear of giving her his cold but that was not the reason it was only the excuse for not telling him she had welcomed it at the time as an adequate excuse but if she had not found any such she would have done without it for a second or two her thought paused merely contemplating this fact as if looking at some picture it seemed quite incredible that she had not gone straight to him with her news blurted it whispered it kissed him with it yet if he had been sitting here now instead of wilton in this privacy of snow and twilight travel she knew that she would again be struggling and in vain to tell him from that point she swept back to one morning in october it was then that some seed of knowledge which had previously lain dormant in her soul began to sprout for two months now she had been conscious of its growth and for two months she had steadily refused to acknowledge it her relations with him had been of the most normal and friendly but the fact as she saw now of his content and tranquillity was sunshine and rain to the growth of it then at the news dr symes had given her it burst into bitter blossom and she could ignore it no longer peter had never loved her he had never in finding her lost himself mentally and sympathetically she knew that he liked her liked her she was prepared to say immensely physically she attracted and satisfied him to think that he had married her for her money would be an exaggerated and hysterical estimate her wealth had not been a counterweight that overcame some opposing disadvantage but it was so she now believed a determining factor without it he would not have sought her it seemed odd to herself how little that mattered her wealth was an advantage so too was her beauty and even if he had married her for her wealth that would have seemed to her no worse than if he had married her for her beauty or for had she been witty her wit or for any quality whatsoever of mind or body all these were advantages pleasant circumstances but all of them singly or together compared with love were no more than the bright shells on the seashore compared with the sea it was just here that she blamed him with a bitterness that appalled her it was this that had made it possible for her to accept any excuse or if necessary to have done without one for not telling him what she had learned yesterday he had bidden her shut her eyes and picking up a shell had held it to her ear and had told her that what she heard there was the sea he had looked he had spoken he had acted as if he brought close to her that splendid shining vastness she had trusted him and had listened with all the rapture of love to that murmuring therein he had cheated her passed off on her a fake which had she not been blinded by his hand over her eyes he knew she must have recognized as such there was just one excuse for him she hesitated to adopt it because while it excused him it far more terribly accused him it was that he did not know what love meant from the very first from the day when he had asked her to marry him he had not known she had told him that all she wanted in the world was to be allowed to love him and he had never seen that her surrender presupposed his own he could not burn in her love without being alight himself there was the root of it all his ignorance at that compassion deep as love itself inundated her bitterness not diluting it but from its very nature neutralizing it sorrow was there but without sorrow who had said that none liveth in love not as by one drop out of the whole ocean was her love for him diminished but while he did not understand he ploughed his way in drought and desert he could not reach her it was through his constant affection for her and his gentleness rather than through any failure in these that the realization of this had come to her she did not believe that she wearied him she knew that she attracted him physically that he was faithful to her not on principle but by inclination and yet all this was nothing he had not begun say for a minute or two by loving her and then dropped into mere affection mere desire simply he had never loved her at all as she understood loving he did not love anybody else and silvia so far from being consoled by that thought found herself passionately wishing that he did he might love nellie or that fool of a woman who screamed for then at any rate he would know what love meant and they would have common ground to meet on though that very ground parted them that might ruin her own life which already she had given into his cool careful hands and if only by smashing it to atoms he could find his souls salvation there were problems ahead and how they should be solved she did not know she only knew what the upshot must be inconceivably dear as the mere touch of his hand was to her she knew that never again unless he learned what love was or she forgot it could hand clasp hand and mouth meet mouth not again could she give him those symbols of the infinite as the playthings for enjoyment all that she had or was was his except just that unless he loved her the banners of her love must stay unfurled somehow she must let him know that just as somehow and soon she must let him know about what she learned yesterday as the car turned in through the park gates the snow beat in from the other window it fell unheeded on her face and hands till wilton encouraged to take care of her drew up the sash peters head on her shoulder his breath coming soft and slow through his mouth peters eyes close to hers so that if he winked his eyelashes brushed her cheek peters arm lying languid and relaxed across her bosom she would give her body to be burned for him but not with such burning as this anyone not she alone could supply such need as his none could supply hers but he and he only if he loved her loving him as she did she could not so the leaping firelight in her bedroom that night illuminated it for her she could not shut out her ideal in some burning chamber of its own and take the rest of her in ordinary human manner to him nor could she take from him even though it was the highest he could give anything that made its approach on some other plane he must want her as she wanted him surrendered and lost and found again in a new completeness before they could come together as lovers she conjectured that she was singular exceptional in this most men most women gave what they could and got what they could but there was no compromise possible for her that could produce this easily negotiable felicity she could not and if she could she would not have accepted that in exchange for this drawn sword that lay between peter and her she had to tell him that she had to tell him also that the fruit of love on the one side of affection on the other was ripening she must wait her occasion for that some moment must be seized upon when he was most himself most nearly that is to say what she had once thought him she had nothing of her own all was his that was her one inestimable possession that she had given him all whatever happened her utter penury was the one thing she must cling to peter had rung up dr symes before he left the foreign office that evening asking for five minutes of his time at any hour of morning or afternoon next day perhaps it was rather fussy to consult a physician over a cold but really there never had been such a cold dr symes gave you a cabalistic slip of paper which being duly interpreted proved to be some marvellous tonic stuff or when he had felt a pulse and looked at a tongue and tapped you on a stomach or made your knee jump in a curious manner he even more probably told you that you had the constitution of an armadillo and roared you out of his room for wasting his time with a week of uncles and aunts ahead even though nellie was to partake in the secret joys of them peter felt he would like some robust reassurance of that sort or on the other hand since there never was such a cold these speculations as he drove to welbeck street next morning were cut short by his arrival and his internment in a waiting room there were several persons there reading illustrated papers with sad faces who looked up when he entered and thereafter regarded him with evident suspicion fearing so peter figured it that he might though the latest arrival be summoned before those who had waited longer this in fact happened and to the accompaniment of sour looks he was conducted down a long passage into the consulting room as he went he considered whether he slept well and whether he had a feeling of oppression on his chest or a pain in his right side how de do said dr symes ive managed to squeeze you in between two of my patients and i can give you just a couple of minutes which will be quite enough naturally you wanted to see me well theres nothing that should give you a moments anxiety at present dont think about it at all and dont let your wife think youre thinking about it he turned backwards over the leaves of his engagement book yes as you know i saw her the day before yesterday he said all healthy and normal but dont be fussed yourself and certainly spare her all fuss of course as i told her theres no doubt at all let her if she doesnt want to make her lead an ordinary active normal life peter had arrived by this time my wife he asked dr symes gave his great rollicking laugh yes and your grandmother too for that matter he said dont let her confuse child bearing with invalidism theyre radically opposed mind you the way she spends these months is important make her go out make her busy and employed dont let her get fancies into her head that she must coddle herself theres no greater mistake i see said peter just use your common sense said the doctor shes got to bear a healthy child and so shes got to be just as fit as we can make her but take care of her too whats her age now twenty two i suppose well regard her as a woman of forty in robust health make her behave like an older woman than she is he rang a bell that stood on his table ive told you everything he said you look fit enough anyway though youve got a bit of a cold havent you getting down into the country for christmas eh change of air i wish i was going to get some he looked at his table of appointments ask mrs lucas to step this way he said to the maid good bye good luck as peter drove down to whitehall he kept detached as by some dexterous jerk such part of his mind as dealed in emotion and contemplated with the same isolation as through his closed car window he looked out on the snow slushy street what he had just learned he wanted to assimilate it before in any sense he studied it and to do that he had first to wipe off his sheer surprise which stood like condensed vapour on the glass of this astounding picture which had just been presented to him again and again he had to wipe that away before he could get any clear vision of the fact itself that silvia knew that she was with child and had not told him when he had assimilated that he could perhaps arrive at what it meant the glass was clear now he had got it and the enigma of it all stared him in the face and the more he contemplated it the greater grew his bewilderment as to the meaning of it how often with the hesitation of an intensity that choked utterance had she said a word or two given him a glance a smile that conveyed better than any stamped symbol of speech what the incarnation of their union his and hers would be to her she had wondered how just how she would tell him no one knew into what shapes such joy would crystallize and now it had come and she had not told him at all except for a trivial visit of his own a superficial unnecessary visit he would still be ignorant she had chosen to leave him in ignorance of what he had learned by accident nellie had often told him that he went walking in the wet woods and telling nobody and silvia in some frank chaffing discussion had affirmed that she knew precisely what nellie meant certainly thought peter now it was likely enough she did know had anyone ever gone solitary so far into the wet woods as silvia had anyone ever so immeasurably told nobody he searched back through his impressions and memories of these last two months to see if he could discover any clue that should lead him to an interpretation as far as he knew their relations had been uniformly harmonious without hitch or check there had been no sign no warning of any sort on her part of an emotional change as for himself yes there had been a change a change was here and as it was not in her it must be in him some psychical pigment grain after grain had been dropping continually dropping into his clean cup of life each sinking down into it quietly lying there at the bottom now it seemed that the astonishment of this mornings discovery had violently stirred up the whole and the whole so he saw was tinged with the colour of that which had been dissolving in the cool depths for often and often increasingly and ever more vividly here was the dropping of those grains of colour he had had the image of silvia moving splendidly on sunny heights the rays from which shone down on him through rent clouds and patches of blue there those grains had settled dissolving perhaps but only locally tinging minute remote areas of his consciousness they had not affected the full contents of the cup that clear cool untroubled self of his now with this rough shaking and stirring he was suffused with the colour of them there high above was silvia and her splendour felt now not only recognized he had scrambled to his feet was that it stung into standing finger on mouth instead of remotely contemplating the ray that had merely shone on him now shone in him and its light pierced the fogs of his egoism it was the news itself beyond doubt not silvias withholding of it which gave him that enlightenment for to his feminine nature the fact of his impending fatherhood struck more intimately than it would have done on one more virile it evoked too a dormant virility his fatherhood was the sequel of another relationship clearer shone the ray he must climb he must go to her he must give close on the heels of that and swiftly as reflection answers light came the remembrance lost for that moment that silvia had withheld the knowledge from him he could guess now with a conjecture that verged on certainty what the reason for that was and his egoism his deep rooted vanity returned and reinforced cried out against the outrage of it she from those heights shining no longer but merely superior looked down on him and judged him unworthy to share that white joy which crowned and enveloped her love all his pride stiffened at the thought he knew how to walk in the wet woods sufficient unto himself of intention peter had started from london rather late so that he should find the little party already assembled his father he rested assured would have taken on himself the mantle of host and would be wearing it far more superbly than he that he found to be the case john mainwaring had complete possession of the place and all the members of what was with the exception of nellie and her husband the same unique little family gathering which had preceded peters marriage there was aunt eleanor stout and seal like there was a column of locomotive floral decoration around aunt joanna there was uncle abe now possessor of three monstrous cartoons and uncle henry the possessor of a nice stiff brandy and soda for tea still continued to burn his heart the cartoons in fact and the original sketches were the subject as peter entered of debate between the aunts to the glory and honour of their creator who sat in clouds of incense mrs wardour had already got reconciled to the fact that her sister had been the purchaser and bore it well lovely they look said aunt joanna all three in a row with the rest to come opposite many a half hour do i spend at my buhl writing table there not getting along at all with my correspondence by reason of looking at them im sure i dont know which i like best tea peter asked silvia she had looked up at his entry now she kept her eyes on her tray yes indeed said aunt eleanor im sure they look very fine joanna three already finished thats wonderful i suppose mr mainwaring youll be soon wanting to borrow the fourth of my sketches dear lady i hesitate i positively hesitate to ask you said he for i know how you will hate parting with it even for a week or two but without it i can never paint the larger version the inspiration the first rapture is there i must study it again aunt eleanor turned triumphantly to nellie you must positively come to see those sketches mrs beaumont she said i have all the original sketches of mr mainwarings great cartoons such a treat im sure theyre charming said nellie charming indeed masterpieces such fire such inspiration as never could be realized again the three great cartoons said aunt joanna firmly while the floral decorations trembled fill up the whole side of sir abes last addition to our house a new wing i may call it with bedrooms above my sweet little sitting room said aunt eleanor absently all the sketches the fire yes dear and as i was telling you the great cartoons said aunt joanna that was what i was telling you uncle henry made a diversion he liked peace and plenty capital good brandy this he said you should try my plan abe have a drop of brandy and leave the tea alone amost a pity to put soda into it he had not put much well i dont say youre not right henry said uncle abe but to my mind whats given me at my dinner if its a drop of something good tastes all the better if i havent had theres some old dry ptiot now theres a wine you must get on the right side of peter for that silvia handed peter his cup and your colds better she asked bout the same thanks nellie more than once had tried to catch peters eye in order to telegraph to him her rapt appreciation of the family but though peter had met her glance he had nothing to send in reply i see the whole history of the war in my sketches proclaimed aunt eleanor news from headquarters i call them such insight and the fourth dear joanna the submarine you know ah no you havent seen that yet but if mr mainwarings cartoon from it comes up to the sketch therell be something for you to look at capital good brandy said uncle henry something had to be said peter drifted away from the tea table and established himself next nellie so you got down all right he said she let a circular sweeping glance pause infinitesimally four times once for each of the aunts and uncles yes and what a delicious room she said you hadnt told me half peter was surely rather distrait she thought even now he didnt catch the point of her appreciation its good panelling he said theres more of it in my sitting room next door well go there after tea she held out her cup silvia darling one inch more tea please she said an inch pure greed silvia had an absent smile for her but no speech and took the cup from peters hand without looking at him till he had turned again towards nellie with the desired inch she then followed him quick as a lizard with one glance of mute raised eyebrows nellie got that too plucked it off put it in her book she felt that she was surrounded by interests there were the priceless uncles and aunts there was also something else going on not so farcical not farcical at all perhaps but quite as interesting my dear you have got a cold she said to peter i thought i had said he wheezily i rather like having a cold she went on its an excuse for going to a doctor and being told that one has a brilliant constitution thats dr symess cure youre a symite arent you peter looked right and left then for a single second straight in front of him where silvia sat rather he said were all symites he paused a moment what a pity i didnt go to see him this morning he said very deliberately before i left london i might have been well by this time silvia did not look up she turned away to mr mainwaring who was on her right some jerked movement of her hand caused a teaspoon to clatter from its saucer and fall on the floor his father gave a little yodel adapted to the drawing room let me have a word with you sometime my peter he said yes ill come to see you before i dress just now nellie and i are going to have a talk will that do come nellie peter drew two chairs up to the fire thats nice he said priceless arent they aunt eleanor is really the most wonderful can you bear it for three days do you think they go day after christmas he lit a cigarette and threw it away again muck he said by the way nellie do stop till we go up to town oh my dear i wish i could said she but i know philips got some county business on the twenty eighth that obliges him to go home something ridiculous about forbidding people to shoot golden orioles of which there arent any cant you let him go alone asked peter well yes i think i might ill get my mother to go down mother will always go anywhere for board and lodging dont i remember that feeling said peter so do stop i heard silvia ask my father nellie produced an admirable mimicry of aunt eleanors views on art which however elicited from peter only very funny yes very like her and he subsided into silence and fire gazing again silvia seemed rather silent said nellie at length peter roused himself did she he said the aunts were talking so much that i didnt notice it this is the panelling i spoke to you of by the way charming just the same as in the drawing room isnt it the green drawing room please said peter i beg its pardon she said granted im sure said he without a smile nellie tried a handful of other topics and her curiosity to know what was the matter vastly increased she had narrowed down the field of her conjectures to a certainty that whatever it was it concerned her host and hostess yesterday at lunch when she had been alone with silvia she had the first impression of it yet she had seen peter that same evening in town by way of nursing his cold he had come to the theatre with her and he in spite of that affliction had been immensely cheerful chuckling with prophetic delight at the feast that the uncles and aunts would spread for them and he had not seen silvia since for she had already left london until his entry into the green drawing room half an hour ago she would much have preferred as on that evening a month ago when they dined alone together in london and he had been so pointedly reticent on the subject of silvia that he should volunteer a statement but his reticence then seemed of totally different quality from what it was now she tried one more topic peter dear isnt it lovely she said im going to have a baby peter jerked himself upright in his chair really he said and here are you telling me that he broke off whats the matter my dear she said theres something wrong he got up and drove with his foot into the log fire its really screamingly funny that you should tell me that he said nellie felt that they were getting near it now funny she asked oh lord i said funny didnt i said he she got up too laying a hand on his shoulder my dear were very old friends she said he turned round to her with some unspoken bitterness souring in his eyes then ill let you have the joke he said you tell me that and yet my wife who knows the same thing about herself has not told me he paused a moment i found it out by accident this morning he said i went to see dr symes about my cold odd that you should have spoken of him and before i told him anything he began telling me and that was what he told me of course he assumed i knew thought that i had come to him for some general directions which he gave me silvia had been to him two days before she hasnt said a word to me not a word nellie heard herself give some ejaculation now youre fond of psychological problems he said also youre a woman and know how women feel under what circumstances feeling how in fact would a woman do that interesting point isnt it its beyond me no quarrel no misunderstanding nothing of that sort none ive felt she was watching me sometimes ive well can you describe that she asked ive only thought of that this minute he said and now i dont really see any connexion but when my father knew my mother had gone and was posing and posturing as a lost and stricken man silvia was watching me to see i think if i had real sympathy real pity for him i did feel then as if i was being tested but i made that all right i did it cleverly i gave the most cordial welcome to his stopping on here lord what evenings they were for endless weeks and left him to tell her about it are you quite sure you made it all right she asked she told me she had been wrong she told me she had misjudged me when she thought me feelingless he said but even if she made a reservation or reconsidered it what then nellies hand still rested now with pressure on his shoulder and what if silvia put herself so to speak in your fathers place she said what if it occurred to her that you had been charming with her and clever with her mind thats only a guess again peter thrust the logs together she trusts me too much he said at length she loves me too much this time nellie was silent well said he at length she thinks youve been clever with her and charming with her she said thats it i think that she was quite wrong in keeping this news from you but thats why silvia isnt like us you must remember we may be complicated and clever in our way but shes not like that theres something tremendous about silvia a simplicity a splendour and just when i was beginning to realize that to adore it she does this i cant forgive it said he she felt then as perhaps never before the charm of his egoism it really was such a charming fellow he was egoistic about my dear its just because you as you say are beginning to realize that and to adore it that you feel you cant forgive it you would forgive it easily enough if you didnt care but put yourself in her place assume as i feel sure were right in assuming that we have got at the reason for her not telling you it is exactly what a woman of that simplicity and splendour would do with all there is of her she loves you a charming way of showing it said peter youre hurt youre smarting she said otherwise you wouldnt say that she has spoiled everything exclaimed peter just when all through their talk nellie had been conscious of a dual stirring not only in him that was clear enough but in herself not many weeks ago she would certainly have had her whole sympathies enlisted on his side she would have fanned secretly and stealthily no doubt the flame of his resentment against silvia and with the same hidden action have insinuated into his mind that there was somebody who was eager to console to help him to forget one who gave him a welcome even now some breath of woodland irresponsibility the morality of dryads and satyrs swept over her with the whispering of wild things and the stirrings in the bushes like sought like there deriding the consequences to others should she twang that string let the wind blow on that harp in the trees she knew well that something would answer it he was hurt and sore there were woodland balms something within her again jerked back the finger that hovered over the string ready to pluck it and turned her hand into a shield instead that prevented the wind from making the harp vibrate silvia had her harp too and he had begun ever so faintly to vibrate in answer to silvias harp and not to hers in this second impulse there was compassion for silvia there was motherhood she made her choice you cant say that she spoiled it my dear she said you know how she loved you when you asked her to marry you peter had a frown for this i thought he began i know what you thought silvia very likely told you that she wanted just to be allowed i never told you that said he quickly of course you didnt but wasnt it clear that before you married she loved you as a boy loves with some tempestuous desire of possession but shes got me said he it isnt as if there were anyone else i know that and she knows that for certain its nothing of that kind that revolts her revolts asked he oh my dear short of that wouldnt she have told you what she has known for two days and suspected long before but you would be quite wrong to think that she loves you any less what you dont see especially beyond that is that silvia has become a perfectly changed person she keeps her splendour keeps it good heavens i should think she did but what she learned the other day quite changes her she has become a woman and she must have not just a man to love but a man to love her youve hinted that shes on the way to get one thats the sum of the consolation ive got for you nellie having determined having chosen was being magnificent just then and all the time the dryad within her scolded and derided her you fool you conventionalist the dryad shrieked he might be yours hes as weak as water and vain vain you want him wait a few months and see how you want him idiot nellie heard all that as plainly as she heard the whistle of the wind in the chimney it wont be easy she said youve got to get out of yourself peter a thing by the way that ive never succeeded in doing and when youve got out of yourself youve got to convince her that youve got into herself i wouldnt bet on your chance have i been a brute asked he nellie hesitated she had never yet realized how close to love had been her intimacy with peter or how far from love her own marriage bond and now when bitterly resenting what silvia had done he turned to her peter in her silence repeated his question a brute he asked and now his voice shook she took her hand briskly off his shoulder they had stood there like that comrades and friends for ten minutes now and her fingers had dwelt on his shoulder the bone and the muscle of it not a brute at all she said you couldnt be a brute you darling but a liar and a cheat ha said peter he walked round the room after this with a whistle for her and him and a kick for a footstool that got in his way you dont help me he said whats to be done somehow at his absence of resentment at what she had said and at his appeal to her for help the old delightful level of comradeship smoothed itself out tell her that you know suggested nellie do it nicely i couldnt possibly do it nicely confound it all she considered this if you cant do it nicely it will only make it worse she conceded what then wait for her to tell me demanded peter yes or for you just to know it wont come to that oh you absurd people shall i tell her that you know peter thought over this its becoming comic he said presently thats the silliest thing youve said yet perhaps but it isnt comic my dear i know it isnt thats my ferocious flippancy gravediggers and it isnt comic for silvia she added the spasm of the woodland died away again she hasnt told me said peter hopelessly i cant get over that youve got to get over that otherwise theres nothing ahead shes got to get over more than that all the worst of him returned you speak as if i hadnt given her all i had got he said youre getting more my dear keep on getting it and keep on giving it peter looked at the clock here endeth the first lesson he said not even out of the prophets i must go and see my father more acting necessary you know he flung his arms out i darent be real he said no one knows what an abomination i am quite unexpectedly nellie felt weary and done for she pulled herself together for a final encouragement ah what a hopeful sign she said he lingered a moment quarter to eight he said we dine at half past think of the old quarter to eights ritz opera mrs trentham charlie and bobby and tommy and me and you and sophy and ella and any fool you like to mention lord poole now no that wont do said she he was real i grant you the rest werent but he was real he completely enjoyed himself does still bless him wish i did said peter i used to and i dont you wont as long as you think about it there was the woodland touch to finish with youre only ninety are you she said or is it ninety one ninety said peter grinning chapter xiv the grin soon cleared off his father rose from the sofa on which he had been so elegantly resting as peter entered and clasped his hand though he had seen him at tea a couple of hours before have you heard from your mother he asked my loved and lost one he smoothed his velveteen coat as he spoke my loved and lost one the velveteen coat the little demons swarmed into peters soul the demons of ridicule and cynicism and contempt and all the host of such but rebel and ridicule as he might he knew that he had been sham and charlatan on an immeasurably greater scale than his father i had a report of her a couple of days ago he said just a message through her solicitors mr mainwaring put the tips of his fingers in a neat row into his mouth as if in his suspense to gnaw the nails of them but he committed no such feat of violence he merely sucked them and took them out again tell me he said peter tried to evoke any sort of kindliness or sympathy from his mind and failed she is quite well apparently he said and she she asked after me suggested his father yes she asked after you she hoped you were comfortable i think she said comfortable my god comfortable peter waited till this paroxysm of irony was spent i ought to have written to her to day he said but i didnt i shall write to morrow what shall i tell her about you what your heart bids you said he tell her about me as i am miserable homeless except for the charity of my children i count silvia as a child he explained peter felt absolutely relentless so you long for her to come back to you he said i will tell her he regarded peter with his chin in the hollow of his hand you dont understand my dear the depth he began explain it to me then father said he take your own case then supposing silvia i use your case for the absurdity of it supposing silvia left your house what would you do would you not give her complete freedom to return or not to return would not your heart say my love for her wants only what she wants then i wont say that you long for her to come back to you said peter i only want to know your wishes i will transmit them but but why not do it yourself you know her solicitors anything you send them will be forwarded to her the scoundrels cried mr mainwaring oh i dont see that said peter he stifled a yawn it was all too stupid scoundrels cried mr mainwaring arent they he appeared unable to say exactly what they were and peter got up ill convey any message you like father he said i only suggest that you might just as well send it yourself there are two things you can do you can summon my mother back and if you choose divorce her if she doesnt come on the grounds of desertion the other is to acquiesce in her stopping away as long as she chooses i dont see why you put a hypothetical case about silvia and me you want her to come back or you dont this point of view necessitated some more stridings on the part of mr mainwaring my angel your angel your silvia he said has asked me if i would not like to spend the rest of the winter on the riviera a little sun for me she said only to night a little change a little chance of the healing of my wound she offers me two months on the riviera should not i be wrong if i did not accept her sweet charity leave it over you mean about my mother asked peter till you get back get a little sun first and that sort of thing i think that would be a very sensible arrangement that was a charming idea of silvias he laid his hand on peters shoulder and his voice broke make silvia happier than i have made my maria he said the love of a good woman my god what brutes we men are no not brutes heaven forbid that i should call you or indeed myself a brute but more tenderness my peter more making of allowances experto crede he paused a moment in a fine attitude abe darley he said henry wardour they and their wives their pleasant chaff their gentle fun yes when you begin to step down from the tableland of life you want to find such hands as those in yours a brilliant woman too is joanna darley how she appreciates the cartoons and your aunt eleanor eleanor as she suggested that i should call her we are john and eleanor she has commissioned me to do her portrait before i attack the fourth the tremendous cartoon submarines you remember my sketch for it peter went down the corridor to his room and silvias with the gravity that attaches to the conclusion of a comic interlude the tragic burden all the worse for its temporary suspension must be taken up again and the interlude had hardened rather than softened him he despised his father for being a fake and that contempt stung him also as with the back stroke of his own lash smarting from that his mind went back to what silvia had withheld from him and there was the shrewdest hurt of all his bath was ready for him and as he soaked and sprayed himself some tautness of physical vigour pictured the usual sequence to his bath the dressing gowned and drying sance in the chair close to silvias toilet table he would sink his resentment he would tap at her door and go in to her with a flood of normal nonsense then if she told him now as she must surely do the news she had withheld he would receive it as news hitherto unknown to him he arrived at this stage of resolution finished his bath and came out and at that moment even as his knuckles were raised to inquire at her door his resentment against her seizing upon some new pretext of bitterness poured over him again his hand dropped as he turned and went into his own room he was late also that served for an excuse for at the moment the sonorous bell in the turret above silvias room made its proclamation to the listening earth that dinner was served at howes on the other side of the door silvia fully dressed and following the familiar sounds was waiting for him to enter how often had she waited like that longing for him she longed for him now though dreading his coming and so intertwined were these two that she could not disentangle the one from the other she would tell him just what she had determined that he must know she would ask his pardon for not having told him of the news before she had used up so it seemed to her all the emotion of which she was mistress what lay immediately in front of her covered like some hard integument the longing and dread with which she waited for him though it left her superficial perceptions alert the clink of the coals in the grate the flapping of the flame there were more vivid to her senses than anything else there was the beating of rain on her windows for the snow had ceased and a wind from the south west was beginning to bluster outside then she heard peter come out of his bathroom and presently the door of his bedroom shut already the bell sounded sonorously above her she must tell him then that night when he came up to bed there was relief in that for an hour or two more the only barrier between him and her was in her own knowledge it was not formally erected she was conscious now that her heart had been beating fast in the anticipation of his coming and she sat down for a few minutes peter would be late also to recover her poise before she went downstairs there was to be a jollification that night for tenants and servants a dance for the elders a christmas tree for the children the wind which just now she had heard flinging the rain against her windows rose to a scream and peter hurrying on with his dressing next door saw a cloud of smoke driven out from his grate followed by another and yet another till in a few minutes the room was thick with its pungency he remembered then that the jackdaw had told him that something had gone wrong with the cowl of the chimney and no doubt this change of wind caused this regurgitation these things always happened just before christmas or bank holidays when the british work man became even more deliberate than usual opening the window seemed only to make things worse and heavy with his cold he had no intention on this chill and bitter night of sleeping fireless as with choking throat and streaming eyes he redoubled the speed of his dressing he rang his bell and told his servant to transfer the necessaries for sleep and toilet to some other room the uncles and aunts occupied the next suites but farther along beyond the head of the main stairs was an unoccupied bedroom and dressing room and he ordered that a fire should be lit there and the change made during dinner so that he would find the room ready for his tenancy that night as he came out from that mephitic fog on to the corridor silvia also emerged from her room my chimneys smoking like the devil he said i remember now that the jackdaw told me there was something wrong with it its quite impossible to sleep there im having my room changed he finished buttoning a shirt link as he spoke not looking at her somehow this set a key of coolness of casualness how tiresome for you she said where she stumbled over the question where have you gone oh somewhere down the passage said peter just now if he had come in to talk to her after his bath she would have told him what he had to know now her resolution had a little cooled it was not hot enough to enable her to ask him to come and talk to her when he came upstairs that night nor yet to ask him more definitely where his room was besides with the entertainment for the servants they would all be very late and to morrow would furnish a more convenient occasion or if not then and not spontaneously on her part he would come to her some night seeking her and then she would tell him in the interval there was the family farce of jollity to be kept up it would only add to the difficulty of that if from her communication to him something unconjecturably critical arose she had no idea how peter would take it there could be no mortal wound for that implied that she was to him all that she missed being but his pride his vanity how she longed to kill it and how she hated to hurt it on his side as they went down the broad stairs resentment at what he knew she had withheld out shouted all the counsel nellie had given him out shouted too the authentic whisper of his own heart he had but to listen to that to act when action came and always to think and to feel and to be without forethought just blindly following its suggestions but for that small voice to be heard he must unstopper his ears from that cotton wool of vanity which shut out from his hearing all but the complaints and self justifications which trickled through it it had been and it was her business to tell him my father says you have treated him to a month or two in the south he said that is very good of you he will enjoy it there was the ring as of a duty discharged in this that robbed it of spontaneousness and it gave to her its own woodenness peter had not meant it like that he wanted to thank her for her kindness to let her know that he appreciated it but all that passed now had to travel through the falsity of that situation between them as through some mould which made it take a shape not truly its own and come out at the end grimed and distorted january and february are delightful on the riviera she said a change will do him good to him that seemed to double lock the wards of the gate that should have stood open they looked at each other through its bars the very attempt on both sides to meet the conventional needs of the moment the friendly word or two on the stairs had but served to sever them the femininity of his nature already resentful at what had been withheld from him construed her reply into a further withdrawal of herself overlooking the fact that it was his own resentment that had led him into conventionalities of speech his pride choked him was it nothing to her that she was ripening with his fatherhood had she no inkling that not his head only but his heart was as in some belated dawn beginning to glow with her splendour the male element in him was awaking like adam from the sleep which the lord god had laid on him and was beginning to find to realize that what he expunged and expelled from himself became the living glory and the complement of him all such perception was still clouded with the blanketing vapours of his own resentment and egoism but through the rifts from high above silvia shone his pride choked him what choked her was her love that could not breathe but in its own high air uncle henry on the occasion of his first visit to howes just before silvias marriage had found and deplored a certain standoffishness so he expressed it in his new nephew his wife had not agreed with him she found peter to be very refined but during the three days that now followed uncle henry quite scrapped his previous verdict there could not have been a more seasonable host peter was full of fun and indeed aunt eleanor was almost disposed to follow her husbands example and reconsider her favourable opinion of peters refinement it was really naughty of him to put up that bit of mistletoe without warning her of it and mr mainwarings chaste salute had come as a great surprise to her before she realized the public temptation she was making of herself by standing so squarely and indubitably just below it but there was no harm in a good old fashioned christmas and if peter would insist on having a bowl of wassail to usher in the midnight after all he was the host and it would have been mere churlishness to refuse to drink that second or was it third glass that he filled up for her when she was not looking there were foolish games on these evenings and when the ladies went to bed roars of laughter ascended from the billiard room where the men kept it up till any hour there was no harm in being young so she and aunt joanna agreed melted into unwilling cordiality over this riotous hospitality indeed if there was any standoffishness to be detected it was silvia who must be impeached yet standoffishness even to uncle henrys limited power of analysis did not quite express silvias quality just a bit under the mark not up to romps was the definition that he and uncle abe arrived at as after waving their fat hands from the window of the motor that took them to the station at the conclusion of their visit they lit the first cigars of peters christmas present to them naturally they had not begun on them when they were staying with him for there was always a box open in the smoking room come on wonderful has peter said uncle henry a jolly boy handsome too not much wrong with that marriage uncle abe had a short attack of what he called his morning cough joanna who was in the other motor called it smoke and drink shouldnt wonder if youre right henry he said when he recovered i had the same idea well i must say it occurred to me said henry she seemed a bit thoughtful and that would account for peters high spirits amazing uncle abe put up his window ive a bit of a cough this morning he said and theres a pretty fortune for any child to come into peter was sitting over the fire in his bedroom that night watching it and trying to determine that when a certain coal ceased flaring with its spray of bubbling gas he would go to silvias room and one way or another make an end of an intolerable situation he had no idea so much depended on her what his line would be certainly he would tell her that he knew what she all these days had kept from him but beyond that he could not in the vaguest manner even forecast the development of the situation during these four days she had shown him nothing that he could construe into a signal not once had he seen her privately and when in public he had kept up his rle of the rollicking host he had no idea for instance whether she knew into what lodging his surly chimney not yet coaxed into proper behaviour had driven him she had asked no further question since that general inquiry on the stairs and he had volunteered no information equally had he avoided any private conference with nellie sometimes in a casual meeting of their eyes he had conjectured an unspoken communication but he knew her views as the situation concerned himself and silvia and there was no use in hammering at that any further nothing else comparatively concerned him there had been a general air of fatigued reaction abroad this evening mrs wardour silvia and nellie had gone to bed within a couple of hours of the termination of dinner and he and his father had had but a short sance in the billiard room before parting peter had an excuse for this early dispersal for he must be at whitehall by ten oclock to morrow morning to deal with accumulations yes when that lump of coal collapsed he would go to silvia sleepily he watched it trying in some ill defined manner to abstract himself from agitating thought to give himself a rest before he plunged into some sort of breaking waves he drowsed for a little and still looking at his fire between half closed lids he fell fast asleep the fire had gone out except for a glimmer of dying embers and for the moment of bewildered awakening before he realized that he was still in his armchair in front of the grate he thought that he was back in his old room and that the chimney was smoking as he came to himself he realized where he was and even more keenly realized why his mind had caught hold of that idea of the smoking chimney there was a strong smell of smoke in the room and jumping up he turned on the switch of the electric light which was close to his hand he heard it click but there was no illumination in answer he had matches in his pocket and lighting one kindled one of the candles that stood on the mantelpiece wide awake now he was more than ever conscious of that smell of burning and going to the door he opened it a great swirl of smoke came in bellying up from the main staircase on the left through it there came the noise of crackling wood and a shoot of veiled flame peter gripped his own mind on his right close at hand were the rooms where his father and nellie slept farther along to the right was a second staircase communicating with the ground floor and communicating also with the servants wing half shutting his eyes against the sting of the smoke he groped his way first to nellies door nellie he cried throwing it open get up at once theres a fire in the house he never felt more completely himself all his brain was tinglingly awake and behind his brain something else dont wait a moment he said get along the passage and down the stairs ill send my father to you he saw her on her way and plunged into his fathers room house on fire father he said go straight through to your right into the servants wing and bang on every door wake mrs wardour two doors away then join nellie downstairs dont wait i dont know how serious it is away to the left beyond that column of smoke now pouring up the main staircase was the baize door behind which were the rooms that he and silvia had occupied and where now she was alone he tried to dash along the corridor to reach them but the heat drove him back already tongues of flame licked through the banisters of the main staircase past which he had to go in order to get to her he was cut off from that access suddenly and serenely he remembered another access along the front of the house below the windows of the room he at present occupied and those rooms behind the baize door beyond the flaming staircase there ran externally the coping which had reminded him of that which ran along the flat belonging to nellies mother in london he remembered in the same flash the discussion that nellie and he had held how she had told him that if he ever loved he would be forced to make the passage of such a road at the bidding of that divine compulsion it would not concern him so she had said that he incurred a mortal and a useless risk he might not be able to rescue here was the thesis the beloved of his soul any thought of rescue was outside the question but so she argued he would not be able if he loved to resist the imperishable impulse through the thick scorching air with his candle guttering in the heat he groped his way back to his room and shutting the door against that burning blast he went to the window the gleam of the white stone coping was just visible and taking off his coat and waistcoat so as to be able to get closer to the wall and kicking off his shoes so as to secure a better grip he let himself down on to it there it was some ten or twelve inches in width by standing very straight up with his arms flat out against the wall of the house he had his balance well below him he moved his left foot first and brought the right foot up to it he rocked at this first movement and recovered himself and then when once he had started on his perilous way the dawn and morning of it all broke on him cautiously and clingingly he advanced but the caution there was the sunlight of it was no longer for himself but for her whom he sought for himself it seemed to matter not at all whether an unnerved step terminated his expedition the object of it the necessity sheer as the drop below him of reaching silvia was utterly dominant he could hear a dim roaring inside the house but it neither delayed nor hastened him he had come to the window of her room and now he could lean an elbow on the sill of it while he rattled at the sash and tapped at the glass through her blind he saw her room spring into light and found himself recording the fact that this electric circuit was still working immediately he heard her voice who is it she cried what is it peter he said open the window quickly the sash flew up and she was there close to him give me a hand darling he said just pull me in dont ask any questions the window sill was high above the coping but with her hands firm and strong as a boys on his arm he scrambled into the room the house is on fire he said were cut off the main staircase is blazing but it will be all right dont be frightened my father will have roused the servants by now he paused panting from some retarded terror of his climb unfelt while he made it silvia he said she stared at him a moment but you were safe peter she said what good was it that you came along that coping did you come all the way from your room im here anyhow good broad coping he said now can we do anything more lets be practical lets think for an immortal second she held him close the big bell in the turret she said the rope goes through the corner of the little lobby outside my bathroom oh good thought said he come and help me to pull it well talk afterwards when weve done all we can the sound of that reached the little town a mile away the glare on the sky endorsed the signal outside on the terrace facing the lake and now vividly illuminated were the other occupants from the house busy with rescuings and presently shouted up to the two through the open window by which peter had climbed in came the news conveyed here by telephone that the fire engines were on their way a ladder was being fetched from the stable had they no rope then as the conflagration spread the electric light snapped itself out they had gone back when the bell had done its work to silvias room the angry glare from outside shone in through the window and smoke drifted in from below the baize door that shut them off from the burning corridor already the fog of it obscured the glare thats all we can do said peter come close my dear you mustnt be afraid theres no need we she was clinging to him now i have something to tell you she said you neednt said he quickly i know it you cant said silvia but i do your baby you mean bless you suddenly her mouth began to quiver oh my god why did you come here she said you were safe outside beyond the baize door there was a crash of something falling and she shrank into him why did you come she repeated because i couldnt help myself it wasnt my fault you dont understand you had to do you mean she asked he made no reply to this his presence answered for him oh go back she cried you can go back still if you love me he took her close into one great enfoldment the roaring of the burning house the glare of its great beacon grew momently more vivid then from outside came a yell of voices and they went to the window theyve come said peter quietly a grinding of the gravel below shouted orders a raising of a ladder printed in england by cassell company limited london ec f
