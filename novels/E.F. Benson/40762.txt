by the century co dodo's daughter chapter i nadine waldenech's bedroom was a large square apartment on the ground floor at her mother's cottage at meering in north wales it was rather a large cottage for it was capable of holding about eighteen people but dodo was quite firm in the subject of its not being a house in the days when it was built forty years ago this room of nadine's had been the smoking room but since everybody now smoked wherever he or she chose which was mostly everywhere just as they breathed or talked wherever they chose nadine with her admirable commonsense had argued uselessness of a special smoking room for she wanted it very much herself and her mother had been quite convinced it opened out of the drawing room and so was a convenient place for those who wished to drop in for a little more conversation after bed time had been officially proclaimed bed time it may be remarked was only officially proclaimed in order to get rid of bores who then secluded themselves in their tiresome chambers the room at this period was completely black with regard to the color of carpet and floor and walls and ceiling that was nadine's last plan and since it was the last of necessity a very recent one she had observed that when it was all white people looked rather discolored like mud on snow whereas against a black background they seemed to be of gem like brilliance but since she always looked brilliant herself the new scheme was prompted by a wholly altruistic motive she liked her friends to look brilliant too and she would have felt thus even if she had not been brilliant herself for out of a strangely compounded nature anything akin to jealousy had been certainly omitted there had been a good many friends in her bedroom lately and there were a certain number here to night she expected more collectively they constituted that which was known as the clan the bed was an enormous four poster with mahogany columns at the corners of it at present it was occupied by only three people she herself lay on the right of it with her head on the pillow she had already taken off her dinner dress when her first visitor arrived and had on a remarkable dressing gown of oriental silk which looked like a family of intoxicated rainbows and leaving her arms bare came down to her feet so that only the tips of her pink satin shoes peeped out in the middle of the bed was lying esther sturgis and across it at the foot bertie arbuthnot the younger who was twenty one years old and about the same number of feet in height in consequence his head dangled over one side like a tired and sunburnt lily and his feet over the other he and his hostess were both smoking cigarettes as if against time the ash of which they flicked upon the floor relighting fresh ones from a silver box that lay about the center of the bed they neither of them had the slightest idea what happened to the smoked out ends esther sturgis on the other hand was occasionally sipping hot camomile tea what she did not sip she spilt heredity is such nonsense said nadine crisply speaking with that precision which the english born never quite attain look at me for instance and how nice i am then look at mama and daddy esther spilt a larger quantity of camomile tea than usual you shan't say a word against aunt dodo she said my dear i am not proposing to mama is the biggest duck that ever happened but i don't inherit she had such a lot of hearts it sounds like bridge but she had and here am i without one first of all she married poor step papa is it step papa anyhow the lord chesterford whom she married before she married daddy that is one heart but i think that was only a little one a heartlet rhyme with tartlet said bertie as if announcing a great truth but we are not making rhymes said nadine severely then she married daddy which is another heart and when she married him of course you know she ran away with him at top speed she was engaged to the other lord chesterford who succeeded the first oh 'jack the ripper' said esther bertie raised his head a little who he asked jack chesterford because he is such a ripper said nadine and he's coming here to morrow isn't it a thrill mama hasn't seen him since since she didn't see him one day when he called and found she had run away did he rip anybody asked bertie who was famed for going on asking questions until he completely understood no donkey you are thinking of some criminal mama was engaged to him and she thought she couldn't so she ripped let her rip is it not and got married to daddy instead he was quite mad about darling mama but recovered very soon he made a very bad recovery don't interrupt berts i was talking about heredity well there's mama and daddy well we all know what daddy is and let me tell you he is the best of the family which is poor he is a gentleman after all whatever he has done and he's done a lot indeed he has never had an idle moment except when he was busy esther gave a great sigh she always sighed when she appreciated and appreciation was the work of her life she never got over the wonderfulness of nadine and was in a perpetual state of deep breathing she admired bertie too and they used often to talk about getting engaged to each other some day in a mild and sexless fashion but they were neither of them in any hurry aren't your other people gentlemen he asked i thought in austria you were always all right if you quartered yourself into sixteen parts nadine threw an almost unsmoked cigarette upon the floor with a huge show of impatience of course one has the ordinary number of great grandparents else you wouldn't be here at all she said and you quarter anything you choose two quarterings of my great grandfathers were hung and drawn apart from their quarterings but really i don't think you understand what i mean by gentlemen i mean people who have brains and who have tastes and who have fine perceptions english people think they know the difference between the bourgeoisie and the aristocrats how wrong they are as if living in a castle like poor esther's parents had anything to do with it look at some of your marquises esther darling i don't mean lord ayr what cads your dukes what aunt sallys always making the float face don't you call it the betise the stupidity is that the aristocracy great solemn aunt sallys and the rest brewers show me an idea show me a brain show me somebody with the distinction that thoughts and taste bring about i do not want a mere busy prating monkey thinking it is a man but i want people somebody with a man or woman inside it ah give me a grocer that will do bertie put down his head again let us be calm he said i'll find you a grocer to morrow nadine laughed she had a curiously unmelodious but wonderfully infectious laugh people hearing it laughed too they caught it but there was no sound of silvery bells she gave a sort of hiccup and then gurgled i get too excited over such things she said and when i get excited i forget my english and talk execrably i will be calm again i do not mean that a man is not a gentleman because he is stupid but much more i do not mean that quarterings make him one the whole idea is so obsolete so victorian like the old mahogany sideboards who cares about a grandfather what does a grandfather matter any more they used to say 'move with the times' now we move instead with the 'daily mail' i am half foreign and yet i am much more english than you all the world goes spinning on if we do not wish to become obsolete we spin too i hate the common people but i do not hate them because they have no grandfathers but just because they are common i hate quantities of your de veres for the same reason their grandfathers make them no less common but also i hate your sweet people with blue eyes of whom there are far too many put them in bottles like lollipops and let them stick together with their own sugar there was a short silence bertie broke it how old are you he asked going on twenty two i am as old as there is any need to be there is only one person in the house younger than me and that is darling mama she is twenty esther gave another huge sigh she appreciated nadine very much but she was not sure that she did not appreciate aunt dodo more it may be remarked that there was no sort of consanguinity between them the relationship was one of mere affection she had a mother and dodo must be the next nearest relative frankly she would have liked to change the relationship between the two and yet you could say things to an aunt who wasn't an aunt more freely than to a woman who happened to be your mother apart from natural love esther did not care for her mother she would not that is to say have cared for her if she had been somebody else's mother and indeed there was very little reason to do so she had a roman nose and talked about the norman conquest which in the view of her family was a very upstart affair she had not a kind heart but she had an immense coronet in her own right and had married another indeed she had married another coronet twice there was a positive triple crown on her head like the pope in other respects also she was like a pope and was infallible with almost indecent frequency nadine loved to refer to her as holy mother she felt herself perfectly capable of managing everybody's affairs and instead of being as broad as she was long was as narrow as she was tall and resembled an elderly guardsman her degenerate daughter finished her sigh go on about your horrible family she said to nadine i think it's so illustrious of you to see them as they are the door opened without any premonitory knock and tommy freshfield entered with a large black cigar in his mouth he was rather short and had the misfortune to look extremely dissipated whereas he was hopelessly almost pathetically incapable of anything approaching dissipation he put down his bedroom candle and lay down on the bed next esther sturgis have you been comforting hughie she asked yes until he went to play billiards with the bish dean he used to be a bishop but subsequently became a dean i think aunt dodo believes he is a bishop still lots of bishops do it now he told me it is the same as putting a carriage horse out to grass there is no work but less corn hughie's coming up here when he's finished his game the appreciative esther sat up it's too wonderful of him she said nadine hugh is coming up here soon do be nice to him nadine sat up also of course she said hughie has such tact and i love him for it berts has none he would sulk if i had just refused to marry him and very likely would not speak to me till next day you haven't had the chance to refuse me yet remarked berts that is mere scoring for the sake of scoring berts darling said she but hugh o nadine i wish you would marry him said esther it would make you so gorgeously complete and golden did you refuse him absolutely or would you rather not talk about it nadine turned a little sideways on the bed no we will not talk of it she said what else were we saying ah my family yes it is a wonder that i am not a horror daddy is the pick of the bunch but such a bunch mon dieu such wild flowers and poor daddy always gets a little drunk in the evening now and to night he was so more than a little but he is such an original fancy his coming to stay with mama here only a year after she divorced him i think it is too sweet of her to let him come and too sweet of him to suggest it she is so remembering too she ordered him his particular brandy without which he is never comfortable and it is most expensive as well as being strong well that's daddy then there are my uncles such histories uncle josef murdered a groom there is no doubt whatever about it who tried to blackmail him i think he was quite right and i daresay the groom was quite right but it is a horrible thing to blackmail it is a cleaner thing to kill then there is uncle anthony who ought to have been divorced like daddy but he was so mean and careful and sly that they could do nothing with him there was never anything careful about daddy she was ticking off these agreeable relations on her white fingers then grandpapa waldenech committed suicide she said and grandpapa vane fell into a cauldron at his own iron works and was utterly burnt so ridiculous they could not even bury him there was nothing left except the thick smoke and they had to open the windows then the aunts there was aunt lispeth who kept nothing but white rats in her house in vienna hundreds and hundreds there were the place crawled with them daddy could not go near it he was afraid of their not being real whereas i was afraid because they were real then there is aunt eleanor who stole many of daddy's gold snuff boxes and said the emperor had given them her of course it was a long time before she was ever suspected for she was always going to church when she was not stealing she made quite a collection aunt julia is more modern she only cares about the music of strauss and appendicitis berts gave a sympathetic wriggle i had appendicitis twice he said which was enough and i went to electra once which was too much how often did aunt julia have appendicitis she never had it said nadine that is why she is so devoted to it an ideal she never attains it is about the only thing she has never had and the rest fatigue her but she always goes to the opera whenever there is strauss because she cannot sleep afterwards and so lies awake and thinks about appendicitis i go to the opera too whenever there is not strauss in order to think about hugh and then you refuse him yes but we will not talk of it there is nothing to explain he is like that delicious ginger beer i drank at dinner in stone bottles you can't explain it is ginger beer so is hugh i had a bottle of it too said bertie more than one i think i hate wine wine is only fit for old women who want bucking up there's an old man in the village at home who's ninety five and he never touched wine all his life that proves nothing said nadine if he had drunk wine he might have been a hundred by now but i like wine perhaps i shall take after daddy a long ash off tommy freshfield's cigar here fell into esther's camomile tea it fizzed agreeably as it was quenched and she looked enquiringly into the glass oh that's really dear of you tommy she said i can't drink any more john always insists upon my taking a glass of it to go to bed with your brother john is a prig perhaps the biggest said nadine esther reached out across tommy who did not offer his assistance and put down her glass on the small table at the head of the bed i hope there's no doubt of that she said john would be very much upset if he thought he wasn't considered a prig he is a snob too which is so frightfully victorian and thinks about lineage of course he takes after mother i found him reading debrett once what is that asked nadine oh a red book about peers and baronets said esther rather vaguely you can look yourself up and learn all about yourself and see who you are poor john said nadine he had his camomile tea brought into the drawing room to night while he was talking to the bishop about gothic architecture and the well the state of piccadilly he was asking if confirmation was found to have a great hold on the masses the bishop didn't seem to have the slightest idea john would make that all right said his sister he would tell him nadine why does darling aunt dodo so often have a bishop staying with her nadine sighed nobody really understands mama except me she said i thought perhaps you did esther but it is clear you don't she is religious that's why just as artistic people like artists in their house so religious people like bishops i don't say that bishops are better than other people any more than ra's are finer artists but they are recognized professionals it is so you may think i am laughing or mocking but i am not give me more pillow and berts take your face a little further from my feet or i shall kick it if i get excited again without intending to but it will hurt you just the same bertie followed this counsel of commonsense that seems a simple explanation he said esther frowned she was not quite so well satisfied but is darling aunt dodo quite as religious when a bishop doesn't happen to be here she asked i mean does she always have family prayers no not always nor do you go to your slums if there is anything very amusing elsewhere but what have they got to do with religion asked bertie haven't they something to do with it i thought they had i know esther looks good when she has been to the slums though of course it's quite delicious of her to go still if it makes you feel good it isn't wholly unselfish there is nothing so pleasant as feeling good i felt good the day before yesterday but after all there are exactly as many ways of being religious as there are people in the world no one means quite the same i feel religious if i drive home just at dawn after a ball when all the streets are clean and empty and pearl colored darling daddy feels religious when he doesn't eat meat on thursday or friday whichever it is and he has his immediate reward because he has the most delicious things instead truffles stuffed with mushrooms or mushrooms stuffed with truffles also he drinks a good deal of wine that day because you may drink what you like and he likes tremendously he has a particular chef for the days of meager who has to sit and think for six days like the creation and then work instead nadine gurgled again i suppose i shock you all she said but english people are so unexpected about getting shocked that it is no use being careful but they don't get shocked at what they do or say themselves whatever they do themselves they know must be all right and they take hands and sing 'rule britannia' they are the enfant terrible of europe they put their big stupid feet into everything and when they have spoiled it all so that nobody cares for it any longer they ask why people are vexed with them and then they go and play golf i am getting very english myself except when i talk fast you would not know i was not english esther since her camomile tea was quite spoiled took a cigarette instead which she liked better well darling you know every now and then you are a shade foreign she said especially when you talk about nationalities as a nation i believe you positively loathe us but that doesn't matter it's he and she who matter not they bertie had sat up at the mention of golf and was talking to tommy yes i won at the seventeenth he said i took it in three two smacks and one put gosh said tommy i wish i hadn't mentioned that damned game said nadine very distinctly you will talk about golf now till morning yes but you needn't go on about daddy said esther certainly he is more interesting than golf and gets into just as many holes he is a creature of nature he falls in love every year when the hounds of spring a chorus interrupted her are on winter's traces the mother of months oh ripping said bertie yes how chic to have written that and to have lived at putney said nadine mama once took me to see mr swinburne and told me to kiss his hand as soon as ever i got into the room so when we got in there was one little old man there and i kissed his hand but it was not mr swinburne at all but somebody quite different again the door opened and a woman entered tall beautiful vital there was no mistaking her the others had not been lacking in vitality before but she brought in with her a far more abundant measure she was forty five perhaps but clearly her age was the last thing to be thought about with regard to her you could as well wonder what was the age of a sunlit wave breaking on the shore or of a wind that blew from the sea everybody sat up at once mama darling come here said nadine and talk to us princess waldenech looked round her largely and brilliantly i thought i should find you all here she said nadine dear of course you know best but is it usual for a girl to have two young gentlemen lying about with her on one bed i suppose it must be since you all do it are they all going to bed here have they brought their tooth brushes and nighties berts is that you berts really one can hardly see for the smoke but after all this used to be the smoking room and i suppose it has formed the habit berts you fiend you made me laugh at dinner just when bishop spenser was telling me about the crisis of faith he went through when he was a young man so that he nearly became a buddhist instead of a bishop or do buddhists have bishops too wasn't it dreadful he's a dear and he gives all his money away to endow other bishops both black and white like chess of course he isn't a bishop any more but only a dean but he keeps his bible like one hugh is playing billiards with him now and told me in a whisper that he marked three for every cannon he made of course hughie couldn't tell him it only counted two it would have seemed unkind hugh has such tact what i was saying said nadine mama he proposed to me again this evening and i said 'no' as usual is he depressed no dear not in the least except about the cannons probably you will say 'yes' sometime and i want a cigarette and something to drink and to be amused for exactly half an hour when i shall take myself to pieces and go to bed i hate going to bed and it adds to the depression to know that i shall have to get up again if only i could be a christian scientist i should know that there is no such thing as a bed and that therefore you can't go there on the other hand that would be fatiguing i suppose tommy gave her a cigarette and nadine fetched her mother her bedroom bottle of water out of which she drank freely having refused camomile tea with cigar ash in it too delicious she said nadine darling do marry hugh before you are twenty two nowadays if girls don't marry before that they take a flat or something and read at the british museum till they are thirty and have got spectacles without even getting compromised compromised of course not cried nadine you can't get compromised now there is no such thing as compromise we die in the ditch sooner like poor lord halsbury being compromised was purely a victorian sort of decoration like like crinolines oh do tell us about those delicious victorian days about when you were a girl and people thought you fast and were shocked my dear you wouldn't believe it said dodo you would think i was describing what happened in noah's ark bertie and tommy for instance would never have been allowed to come and lie on your bed oh why not asked esther because you and nadine are girls and they are boys that sounds simple nonsense doesn't it also because to a certain extent boys and girls then did as older people told them to and older people would have told them to go away you see we used to listen to older people because they were older now you don't listen to them for identically the same reason we thought they were bores and obeyed them you are perfectly sweet to them but they have learned never to tell you to do anything you would never do what i told you dear unless you wanted to no mama i suppose not but i always do what you tell me as it is because you always tell me to do exactly what i want to dodo laughed yes that is just what education means now and how nicely we get along nobody is shocked now in consequence which is much better for them you can die of shock so doctors say without any other injury at all so it is clearly wise not to be shocked i was shocked once when i was eight years old because i was taken to the dentist without being told i was told that i was to go for an ordinary walk with my sister maud and then before i knew where i was there was my mouth open as far as my uvula and a dreadful man with a mirror and pincers was looking at my teeth i lost my trust in human honor which i have since then regained i think maud was more shocked than me i think it conduced to her death you didn't remember auntie maud nadine did you you were so little and she was so unrememberable yes a quantity of worsted work but that's why i always want the bishop to come whenever he can i don't see why even now said nadine darling aren't you rather slow bishop spenser you know who was auntie maud's husband surely you've heard me call him algie who ever called a bishop by his christian name unless he was a relation maud knew him when he was a curate she fluffed herself up in him just as she used to do in her worsted and nobody ever saw her any more but i loved maud and i don't think she ever knew it some people don't know you love them unless you tell them so and it is so silly to tell your sister that you love her i never say i love you either and i don't say i love esther and that silly berts and serious tommy but what's the use of you all unless you know it nadine ring the bell please it all looks as if we were going to talk and i had no dinner to speak of because i was being anxious about daddy i thought he was going to talk hungarian he looked as if he was and so i got anxious because he only talks hungarian when he is what people call very much on certainly he wasn't off to night he is off to morrow and so i want food if i am being anxious i want food immediately afterwards as soon as the anxiety is removed at least i suppose daddy has gone to bed you haven't got him here have you fancy me being as old as any two of you you are all so delightful that you mustn't put me on the shelf yet but just think i was nice the other day to berts' sister and she told her mother she had got a new friend who was quite old 'not so old as grannie' she said 'but quite old' and all the time i thought we were being girls together at least i thought i was i thought she was rather middle aged how is your mother berts she doesn't approve of me but i hope she is quite well bertie also was a nephew by affection aunt dodo he said i think mother is too silly for anything i knew something was coming said dodo what's she done now well it is she said she thought you were heartless silly ass said esther go on berts berts felt goaded of course mother is a silly ass he said it's no use telling me that your mother is a silly ass too with her coronets and all that sort of fudge but altogether there is very little to be said for people over forty except aunt dodo beloved berts remarked dodo go on about edith but it is so they're all antiques except you battered antiques let's talk about mothers generally look at esther's mother she doesn't want me to marry esther because my father is only an ordinary mister there's a reason and i don't want to marry esther because her mother is a marchioness after all mine has done more than hers who never did anything except cut william the conqueror when he came over and tell him he was of very poor new family but my mother wrote the 'dods symphony' for instance she's something she was edith staines and when she has her songs sung at the queen's hall she goes and conducts them bertie in a short skirt and boots with enormous nails said esther and why not she may be a silly ass in some things but she's done something bertie uncoiled all his yards of height and stood up you began he said i'm only answering you back lady ayr has never done anything at all except talk about her family she doesn't think about anything but family she's the most antiquated and absurd type of snob there is and your ridiculous brother john is exactly the same you're the most awful family and make one long for grocers like nadine darling what do you want a grocer for asked dodo but berts had not finished yet and as for your brother seymour all that can be said about him is that he is a perfect lady he said but he ought to have been drowned when he was a girl like a kitten esther shouted with laughter oh berts i wish you would be roused oftener she said i absolutely adore you when you are roused but you aren't quite right about seymour he isn't a lady any more than he's a gentleman and after all he has got a brain a real brain well it takes all sorts to make a world said dodo and esther dear i'm often extremely grateful to seymour he will always come to dinner at the very last moment that's because nobody else ever asks him said bertie still fizzing and spouting a little that's one of the objections to marrying you esther you will always be letting him come to dinner be quiet berts as i say he never minds how late he is asked and he invariably makes himself charming to the oldest and plainest woman present here for instance he would be making himself pleasant to me poor chap said berts lighting another cigarette and lying down again a tray with some cold ham a plate of strawberries and a small jug of iced lemonade which had been ordered by nadine for her mother was here brought in by a perfectly impassive footman and placed on the bed between her and nadine no servants in dodo's house ever felt the smallest surprise at anything which was demanded of them and if nadine had at this moment asked him to wash her face he would probably have merely said hot or cold water miss nadine had not contributed anything to this discussion on seymour because she was almost inconveniently aware that she did not know what she thought about him certainly he had brains and for brains she had an enormous respect seeing things to eat always makes me feel hungry said nadine absently taking strawberries just as the sight of a bed makes me very wide awake it is called suggestion really the chief use of going to bed is that you are alone and have time to think and that is so exhausting that i instantly go to sleep remarked tommy you get how do you call it into training if you practise tommy said nadine people imagine that because they have a brain they can think it isn't so you have to learn to think you have a tongue but you must learn to talk you have arms and yet you must learn how to play your foolish golf you don't learn it darling said dodo mama you are eating ham and have not been following really it is so most people can't think esther can't she confesses it it's quite true said esther i felt full of ideas this morning and so i went away all alone along the beach to think them out but i couldn't there were my ideas all right and that was all i couldn't think about them there they were ideas just that framed and glazed tommy rose i'm worse than that he said i never have any ideas in some ways it's an advantage because if we all had ideas i suppose we should want to express them as it is i am at leisure to listen dodo took a long draught of lemonade i have one idea she said and that is that it's bed time i shall go and exhaust myself with thought the process of exhaustion does not take long besides if i sit up much later than twelve my maid always pulls my hair and whips my head with the brush instead of treating me kindly i should dismiss her said nadine i couldn't dear she is so imbecile that she would never get another situation ah there's hugh hugh did poor algie balearic isles beat you a very large young man had just appeared in the doorway he held in his hand a sandwich out of which he had just taken an enormous semi circular bite the rest of it was in his mouth and he spoke with the mumbling utterance necessary to those who converse when their mouths are quite full oh is that where he comes from he asked no my dear that is where he went to then of course since he is here he did come from them in a sense dear me if he had been bishop there about fifty years earlier he might have copied chopin how thrilling yes the isles won said hugh his voice clearing as he swallowed oh aunt dodo this again was a relationship founded only on affection he said your price was beyond rubies so i said 'what price rubies' and as he didn't understand nor did i we parted what a lot of people there seems to be here i came to talk to nadine oh there she is or would it be better taste if i didn't perhaps it would i shall go to bed instead then what you call taste is what i call peevishness said nadine succinctly i don't understand what is better peevishness then you take me at the foot of the letter said she you see what i mean yes i see that you mean 'literally' but in any case there are too many people chiefly upside down from where i am that's esther isn't it and berts tommy is the right way up nadine upside down also esther got up why of course if you want to talk to nadine we'll go she said bertie gave a long sigh i shall lie here he said like the frog footman on and off for days and days so long as you lie off now said hugh bertie got up you can all come to my room if you like he said as long as you don't mind my going to bed good night nadine thanks awfully for letting me lie down it has made me quite sleepy hugh graves went to the window as soon as they had gone and threw it open the room smells of smoke and stale epigrams he said in explanation that's not very polite hugh said she since i have been talking most and not smoking least but i suppose you will answer that you didn't come here to be polite in a moment even as the physical atmosphere of the room altered so also did the spiritual it seemed to nadine that she and hugh took hands and sailed through the surface foam and brightnesses in which they had been playing into some place which they had made for themselves which was dim and sub aqueous the foam and brightness was all perfectly sincere for she was never other than sincere but it had no more than the sincerity of soap bubbles no i didn't come here to be polite said hugh though i didn't come here to be rude i came to ask you a couple of questions nadine had lain down on the bed again having put all the pillows behind her so that she was propped up by them her arms were clasped behind her head and the folds of her rainbow dressing gown fell back from them leaving them bare nearly to the shoulder the shaded light above her bed fell upon her hair burnishing its gold and her face below it was dim and suggested rather than outlined the most accomplished of coquettes would after thought have chosen exactly that attitude and lighting if she wanted to appear to the greatest advantage to a man who loved her but nadine had done it without motive it may have been that it was an instinct with her to appear to the utmost advantage but she would have done the same without thought if she was talking to a middle aged dentist hugh had seated himself at some little distance from her and the same light threw his face into strong line and vivid color he had still something of the rosiness of youth about him but none of youth's indeterminateness and he looked older than his twenty five years when he was moving he moved with a boy's quickness when he sat still he sat with the steadiness of strong maturity you needn't ask them she said i can answer you without that the answer to them both is that i don't know how do you know the questions yet said he i do you want to know whether my answer to you this evening is final you want also to know why i don't say 'yes' his eyes admitted the correctness of this he need not have spoken after all there was not much divination wanted he said i am as obvious as usual and you understand me as well as usual she shook her head at this not denying it but only deprecating it i always understand you too well she said if only i didn't understand you just as i don't understand seymour you have suggested a reason for why i don't say 'yes' i think it is correct ah don't quote silly proverbs about love's being complete understanding most of the proverbs are silly solomon was so old when he wrote them his mouth uncurled from its gravity that wasn't one of solomon's he said then it might have been in any case exactly the opposite is true if love is anything at all beyond the obvious physical sense of the word it is certainly not understanding it is the not understanding mis understanding no the not understanding the mysterious the unaccountable nadine gathered her legs up under her and sat clasping them round the knees and her utterance grew more rapid her face young and undeveloped and white and exquisite was full of eager animation that is what i feel anyhow she said of course i can't say 'this is love' and 'this is not love' and label other people's emotions there is one way of love and another way of love and another and another there are as many modes of love i suppose as there are people who are capable of it and don't tell me everybody is capable of it at least tell me so if you like but allow me to disagree all i am certain of is that i look for something which you don't give me perhaps i am incapable of love and if i was sure of that hughie i would marry you do you see she as was always the case with her made him forget himself when he was with her she absorbed his consciousness his only desire was to follow her not caring where she led this desire to apprehend her corrugated his forehead into the soft wrinkles of youth and narrowed his eyes tell me why that is not a bad reason he said because i should see that the highest would be denied me she said look what quantities of people marry quite without love i don't refer to the obvious reason of marrying for position or wealth but to the people who marry from admiration or from fear mama for instance she married daddy because she was afraid of him then she learned he was a bogey with a brandy bottle i am neither said he nadine gave a little sigh and he saw his stupidity i am supplying the answer to my own question he said another answer is that i don't understand you somehow to nadine this was unexpected but almost instantly she recognized the truth of it that is true she said i want to be the inferior mentally spiritually of the man i marry i am just the opposite of those terrible people who want a vote and say they are the equal of men that is so bourgeois an idea what woman with any self respect could stand being her husband's equal if she felt herself capable of loving it is that you are too easy hugh i understand you and you don't understand me i wish it was the other way round oh you do wish that he asked yes of course my dear then you have answered the other question your answer to me to day is not final i'll puzzle you yet you speak of it all as if it was a conjuring trick she said don't make conjuring tricks don't let me see your approaching engagement to somebody else be announced that would not puzzle me at all i shall simply see that it was meant to conjuring tricks don't mystify you you know you have been cheated and don't care no i shan't make conjuring tricks he said nadine unclasped her knees and got up and began walking to and fro across the big room hugh i wish i was altogether different she said i wish i was like one of those simple girls whom you never by any chance meet outside the covers of six shilling novels they are quite human only no human girl was ever like them they like music and food and sentiment and sea bathing and playing foolish games just as we all do but there is nobody behind them they are tastes without character if only one's character was nothing more than the sum total of one's tastes how extraordinarily simple it would all be we should spend our lives in making ourselves pleasant and enjoying ourselves but there is something that sits behind all our tastes and though those tastes express it they do not express it all nor do they express its essence i am something beyond and back of the things i like and the people i like something inside me says 'i want i want' i daresay it wants the moon and has as much chance of getting it as i have of reaching up into the sky and pulling it down oh hugh i want the moon and what will the moon be like will it be hard and cold or soft and warm i don't care i shall slip it between my breasts and hold it close she paused a moment opposite him am i talking damned rot she asked i daresay i am i am a rotter then because all i say is me another thing too morally i am not in the least worthy of you i don't know any one who is i don't really and i'm not flattering you because i don't rate the moral qualities very high they are compatible with such low organizations earwigs i read the other day are excellent mothers how that seems to alter one's conception of the beauty of the maternal instinct it does not alter my conception of earwigs in the least and i shall continue to kill any excellent mothers that i find in my room hugh laughed suddenly and uproariously and then became perfectly grave again your moral organization is probably extremely low he said but i settled long ago to overlook that ah there we are again said nadine you deliberately propose to misconceive me with the kindest intentions i know but with how wrong a principle you shut your eyes to me as if as if i was a smut you settle to overlook the fact that i have no real moral perception could you settle to overlook the fact if i had no nose and only one tooth i assure you the lack of a moral nature is a more serious defect but poor devil that i am how was i to get one we were talking about heredity before you came in nadine paused a moment as a matter of fact she said i was telling them that there was no truth in heredity we will now take the other side of the question how was i considering my family to have moral perceptions are you being quite consistent asked hugh why should i be consistent who is consistent except those simple people whom you buy so many of for six shillings and they are consistently tiresome how i said was i to have got moral perception there is daddy if i was a doctor i would certify any one to be insane who said daddy was a moral organism there is darling mama i would horse whip any one who said the same of her for his gross stupidity and insolence the result is me i am more pagan than heliogabalus i do not think that anything is right or that anything is wrong i want the moon but i am afraid you are not the man in it and now you are flippant flippant serious moral immoral cried nadine do not label me like luggage you will tell me my destination next shall we call it abraham's bosom dear hugh you enrage me sometimes chiefly you enrage me because you have such an angelic temper yourself i am not sure that an angelic temper is an advantage it is always set fair and there are no surprises ah how it all leads round to that there are no surprises i understand you too well i am very sorry do me the justice to believe that really i believe that i am as sorry that i can't marry you as you are hugh got up i don't think i do quite believe that he said and now as regards the immediate future i think i shall go away to morrow this time he succeeded in surprising her himmel but why she said if you understood me as well as you say you would know he said i don't find my own heart a satisfactory diet of course if i thought you would miss me nadine was quite silent for a moment you shall go if you like of course she said but you do me the most frightful injustice you understand nothing about me if you think i should not miss you you cannot be so dull as not to know that i should miss you more than if everybody else went literally everybody leaving me alone but go if you wish she walked across to the window which hugh had thrown open and leaned out a moon rode high in mid sky and to the west a quarter of a mile away and far below the sea glimmered like a shield of dim silver below the window the ground sloped sharply away down to the gray tumbled sand dunes that fringed the coast and all lay blurred and melted under the uncertain light and when she turned round again hugh saw that her eyes were blurred and melted also do exactly as you please hughie she said he laughed would you be surprised if i did not go he asked she came towards him with both hands out ah that is dear of you she said look out of the window with me a moment how dim and mysterious there is my moon which i want so much too i will build altars and burn incense to any god who will give it me if only i knew what it was my moon i mean now perhaps as it is nearly two o'clock we had better go to bed hughie and i am so sorry that things are as they are chapter ii it had been said by edith arbuthnot perhaps unkindly but with sufficient humor to neutralize the acidity that there was always somebody awake day and night in dodo's house tending the flame of egoistic introspection edith did not generally use long words but chose them carefully when she indulged in polysyllables she had not been so careful in the choice of her confidant for she had fired this withering criticism at her son berts who in the true spirit of an affectionate nephew instantly repeated it to dodo who had roared with laughter and sent edith an enormous telegram costing nine shillings and a halfpenny including sixpence for a paid reply in case edith wanted to continue the discussion describing a terrible accident that had just happened to herself a most extraordinary and tragic affair this was all written out in full has just occurred at meering at the house of princess waldenech the unfortunate lady has just died of a sudden though not unexpected attack of spontaneous egoism loud screams were heard from her room and mr bertie arbuthnot son of the celebrated edith arbuthnot the musical composer rushed in to find the princess enveloped in sheets of blue flame the efforts made to quench her were of no avail and in a few moments all that was left of her was a small handful of ashes which curiously enough as they cooled assumed the shape of a capital 'i' fear is felt that this outbreak may prove to be contagious and all those who have been in contact with the combusted princess are busy disinfecting themselves by talking about each other it is believed that mrs arbuthnot has begun to write a funeral march for her friend for whom she felt an adoring affection amounting almost to worship in the unusual key of ten sharps and eleven flats it is in brisk waltz time and all the performers will blow their own trumpets she is sending copies to nearly all the crowned heads of europe edith's reply was equally characteristic dodo i love you the truth in edith's criticism was certainly exemplified in the night of which we are speaking for hugh did not leave nadine's room where she had been engaged on the self analysis given in the last chapter till two o'clock and at that precise moment dodo who had gone to bed more than an hour before woke up and began thinking about herself with uncommon intensity and indeed there was sufficient to think about in the circumstances with which she had at this moment allowed herself to be surrounded for the last two days the husband whom she had divorced with such extreme facility had been staying with her and to morrow directly on his departure jack chesterford to whom she had been engaged when she ran away with the husband she had just divorced was arriving all her life dodo had liked drama as long as it occurred outside the walls of english theaters but better than the theaters even of paris were the dramas which came into real life especially when you could not possibly tell even though you were acting yourself what was going to happen next best of all she liked acting herself having a part to play without the slightest idea what she or anybody else was going to do or say dodo's zest for life did not decrease with years nor did her interest in it in the least diminish as the time of her youth began to recede into horizons far behind her for all the time other horizons were getting closer to her and she could imagine herself being quite old as old as grannie in fact without any of the tragic envy of past years that so often make wormwood of the present she had indeed settled the mode of her procedure for those years which were still far enough off with some exactitude and was quite determined to have a mob cap with a blue riband in it and gold rimmed spectacles also she would read thomas a kempis a great deal she had read a little already and was now deliberately keeping the rest until she was seventy and walk about her garden with a tall cane and pick lavender she had moreover promised herself to make no attempts at sprightliness or to have her hair dyed since one of the few classes of women whom she really objected to were those whom she called grizzly kittens who dabbed at you with their rheumatic old paws and pretended that they had no need of spectacles though it was quite clear they could not read the very largest print but she fully intended to remain exceedingly happy when those years came for happiness so it seemed to her was a gift that came from within and could not be taken from you by any amount of external calamities or accumulation of decades certainly in the years that had passed she had had her share of annoyances and in support of her theory with regard to happiness it must be confessed that they had not deprived her of one atom of it her late husband's conduct for instance had for years been of the most disagreeable kind and she had borne with it not in the least like a tearful lamb but more like a cheerful lion it had not in the least discouraged her with life in general but only disgusted her with him for the last two years before she got her divorce he had been as she expressed it too bacchic for anything and she had sent nadine away from their homes in austria to live with a variety of old friends in england eventually dodo had decided that she would waste no more time with her husband and got her freedom coupled with an extremely handsome allowance she continued to call herself princess waldenech because it was still rather pleasant being a princess and waldenech told her that as far as he was concerned she might call herself dowager empress waldenech or anything else she chose so for a year now she had been in england and had stepped back or rather jumped back into the old relations with almost all that numerous body of people who twenty years ago had helped to make life so enchanting and with the same swiftness and sureness she had established herself in the hearts of the younger generation that had grown up since so that the sons and daughters of her old friends became her nephews and nieces nadine with the beauty the high spirits and power of enjoyment that was hers by birthright had so it seemed to her mother succeeded to a place that was very like what her own had been rather more than twenty years ago of course there was a tremendous difference in their modes for the manners and outlook of one generation are as divergent from those of the last as are the clothes they wear but the same passionate love of life the same curiosity and vividness inspired her daughter's friends even as they had inspired her own and since she herself had lost not one atom of her own vitality it was not strange that the years between them and her were easily bridged over there were one or two voices that were silent in the chorus of welcome with which dodo's reappearance had been hailed one of these was edith arbuthnot who though she did not desire to put any restrictions on berts' intimacy which was lucky since berts was a young gentleman hideously gifted with the power of getting his way loudly proclaimed that she could never be friends with dodo again but the answer she had sent to dodo's remarkable telegram about combusted egoism a few days before seemed to indicate that she had surrendered and though she had subsequently announced that dodo was heartless might be regarded as a convert especially since jack had at last yielded too and had invited himself down here another fortress hitherto impregnable was mrs vivian for whom dodo in days gone by had felt as solid an affection as she was capable of consequently she regretted that mrs vivian was invariably unable to come and dine and never manifested the slightest desire that dodo should come to see her her regret was slightly tempered by the fact that mrs vivian had an ear trumpet in these days which she presented to people whose conversation she desired to hear rather in the manner that elephants at the zoo hold out their trunks for refreshments somehow that seemed to make her matter less and dodo had not at present made any determined effort to beleaguer her but she intended when she went back to town in july to capture what was now practically the only remaining stronghold of the disaffected when dodo drowsily awoke that night just at the time that hugh and nadine had finished their talk it was the thought of jack that first stirred in her mind instantly she was perfectly wide awake during this last year though he was great friends with nadine he had absolutely avoided coming into contact with herself he never went to a house where dodo was expected and once finding she was staying for a saturday till monday with the granthams had left within ten minutes of his arrival miss grantham had conceived this misbegotten plan of bringing them unexpectedly face to face with the only result that the party numbered thirteen and her father was very uncomfortable for weeks afterwards once again they had been caught in a block in taxi cabs exactly opposite each other dodo taking the bull by the horns had leaned impulsively toward him with both hands outstretched and cried ah jack are we never to meet again on which the bull so to speak paid his fare and continued his journey on foot dodo had been considerably disappointed by this rebuff it had seemed to her that no man should have resisted her direct appeal on the other hand jack on seeing her had nailed to his face so curiously icy a mask that his appearance became quite ludicrous also he knocked his hat against the roof of the closed half of his cab and it fell into the road in the middle of an unusually deep puddle she noticed that he was not bald yet which was a great relief since she detested the sight of craniums and now jack had yielded had walked out of his citadel without any further assault being delivered and was to arrive to day at the thought when she woke in the stillness of earliest morning dodo's brain started into fullest activity and as always as much interested in the motives that inspired actions as in the actions themselves she set herself to ponder the nature of the impulse which had caused so complete a volte face but the action itself interested and charmed her also all this year she had wanted to see jack again he had understood her better than any one and in spite of the vile way in which she had used him she had more nearly loved him than either of the men she had married her first husband had never been more to her than an old darling and often something not nearly that of waldenech she had simply been afraid under the fascination of fear she had done what he told her but jack dodo felt for the switch of her electric light the darkness was too close to her eyes and she wanted to focus them on something clearly there were several possibilities any of which would account for this change in him he might perhaps merely wish to resume ordinary and friendly relations with her but that did not seem a likely explanation since if that was all he would more naturally have waited till she returned to town again after this sojourn in the country there must have been in his mind a cause more potent than that naturally the more potent cause occurred to her and she sat up in bed it is too ludicrous she said to herself it cannot possibly be that and yet he had remained unmarried all these years with how many charming girls about who would have been perfectly willing to share his wealth and title not to speak of himself dodo got out of bed altogether and went across the room to where a big looking glass set in the door of her wardrobe reflected her entire figure she wished to be quite honest in her inspection of herself to see there not what she wanted to see but what there was to be seen the room was brightly lit and through her thin silk nightdress she could see the lines of her figure molded in the soft swelling curves of her matured womanhood yet something of the slimness and firm elasticity of youth still dwelt there even as youth still shone in the smooth unwrinkled oval of her face and sparkled in the depths of her dark eyes right down to her waist hung the thick coils of her black hair still untroubled by gray and slim and shapely were her ankles soft and rosy from the warmth of her bed her exquisite feet and at the sight of herself her mouth uncurled itself into a smile the honesty of her scrutiny had produced no discouraging revelations then frankly laughing at herself she turned away again and wholly unconsciously and instinctively took half a dozen dance steps across the persian rugs that were laid down over the polished floor she could no more help that impulse of her bubbling vitality than she could help the fact that she was five feet eight in height the coolness and refreshment of the two hours before dawn streamed in through her open window and she put on the dressing gown with its cascades of lace and blue ribands that lay on the chair by her dressing table supposing it was the case that jack was coming for her that he wanted her now as in the old days when she had thrown his devotion back at him like a pail of dirty water what answer would she make him really she hardly knew neither of her marriages had been a conspicuous success but for neither of her husbands had she felt anything of that quality of emotion which she had felt for the man she had treated so infamously she gave a great sigh and began ticking off certain events on her fingers first of all i refused him before i married poor darling chesterford the first she said to herself secondly having married chesterford the first i asked jack to run away with me but that was in a moment of great exasperation it might have happened to anybody thirdly as soon as chesterford i was taken i got engaged to jack which i ought to have done originally and fourthly i jilted him and married waldenech dodo had arrived at her little finger and held her other hand poised over it what the devil is fifthly to be she said aloud she got out of her chair again it is very odd but i simply can't make up my mind she thought and i usually can make it up without the slightest trouble indeed it is usually already made up just as one used to find eggs already boiled in that absurd machine that always stood by chesterford at breakfast i hate boiled eggs but i wonder if i owe it to jack to marry him if he wants me to supposing he says i have spoiled his life and he wants me to unspoil it now is it my duty apart from whatever my inclination may be and i wish i knew what it was dodo felt herself quite unable to make up her mind on this somewhat important point she felt herself already embarked on an argument with jack as she had been so often embarked in the old days and on how pleasant and summery a sea she would certainly tell him that nobody ought to let his life be spoiled by anybody else and she would point to herself as a triumphant instance of how she had refused to let her joy of life get ever so slightly tarnished by the really trying experiences in her partnership with waldenech here was she positively as good as new and then unfortunately it occurred to her that jack might say but then you didn't love him and the ingenious dodo felt herself unable to frame any reply to this very bald suggestion it really seemed unanswerable there was a further reason which might account for jack's coming nadine dodo knew that the two were great friends she had even heard it suggested that jack had serious thoughts with regard to her very likely that was only invented by some friend who was curious to know how she herself would take the suggestion but clearly this was not an improbable far less an impossible contingency but that nadine had serious thoughts with regard to jack was less likely dodo felt that her daughter took after herself in emotional matters and was probably not at that age seriously thinking about anybody yet after all she herself had married at that age though without serious thought and the experiment which seemed so sensible and promising had been a distinct disappointment ought she to warn nadine against marrying without love or would that look as if for other reasons she did not wish her to marry jack that would be an odious interpretation to put on it and the worst of it was that she was not perfectly certain whether there was not some sort of foundation for it something within her ever so faintly resented the idea of jack's marrying nadine dodo's thought paused and was poised over this for a little and she made an eager and a conscious effort to root out from her mind this feeling of which she was genuinely ashamed then suddenly all her meditations were banished for from outside there came the first faint chirrupings of an awakening bird deep down in her below the trivialities and surface complications of life below all her warm heartedness and her egoism there lay a strain of natural untainted simplicity and these first flutings of birds in the bushes roused it she went to the window and drew up the blind the dusk still hovered over the sea and low lying land and in the sky already turning dove colored a late star lingered remotely burning the bird that had called her to look at the dawn had ceased again and a pause holy and sweet and magical brooded over this virginal meeting of night and day but far off to the right the hill tops had got the earliest news of what was coming and were flecked with pale orient reflections and hints of gold and scarlet and faint crimson but here below the dusk lay thick still like clear dark water just below her window lay the lawn garlanded round with sleeping and dew drenched flower beds and the incense of their fragrant buds and folded petals still slept in the censer till in the east should rise the gold haired priest and swing it tossing high to heaven the fragrance of its burning and then from out of the bushes beyond there scudded a thrush perhaps the same as had called dodo to the window he scurried over the shimmering lawn with innumerable footfalls and came so close underneath her window that she could see his eyes shining then he swelled his throat and sang one soft phrase of morning paused as if listening and then repeated it all the magic of youth and joy of life was there there was also in dodo's heart the indefinable yearning for days that were dead the sense of the fathomless well of time into which forever dropped beauty and youth and the soft sweet days but that lasted but a moment for as long as the thrush paused another voice and yet another sounded from the bushes there were other thrushes there and in the ivy of the house arose the cheerful jangling of sparrows fresh feathered forms ran out upon the lawn and the air was shrill with their pipings every moment the sky grew brighter with the imminent day the last star faded in the glow of pink translucent alabaster and in the green crowned elms the breeze of morning awoke and stirred the tree tops then it came lower and began to move in the flower beds and the wine of the dew was spilled from the chalices of new blown roses and the tall lilies quivered there was wafted up to her the indescribable odor of moist earth and opening flowers and on the moment the first yellow ray of sunlight shot over the garden dodo stood there dim eyed unspeakably and mysteriously moved she thought of other dawns she had seen when coming back perhaps from a ball where she had been the central and most brilliant figure all night long she thought of other troubled dawns when she had wakened from some unquiet dream and yet dreaded the day but here was a perfect dawn and it seemed to symbolize to her the beginning of the life that lay in front of her she looked forward to it with eager anticipation she gave it a rapturous welcome she was in love with life still she longed to see what delicious things it held in store for her she felt sure that god was going to be tremendously kind to her and in turn for she had a certain sense of fairness she felt most whole heartedly grateful and determined to deserve these favors there were things in her life she was very sorry for such omissions and commissions should not occur again she felt that the sight of this delicious dawn had been a sort of revelation to her and with a great sigh of content she went back to bed and without delay fell fast asleep and did not awake till her maid came in at eight o'clock with a little tray of tea that smelt too good for anything and a whole sheaf of attractive looking letters large stiff square ones which certainly contained cards that bade her to delightful entertainments she always breakfasted in her room and when she came downstairs about half past ten and looked into the dining room she found to her surprise that waldenech was there eating sausages one after the other this was a very strange proceeding for him since in general he adopted slightly shark like hours and did not breakfast till at least lunch time time or at any rate his habits and method of spending it had not been so kind to him as to dodo and though it had not robbed him of that look of distinction which was always his it had conferred upon him the look of being considerably the worse for wear he seemed as much older than his years as dodo appeared younger than hers and she was no longer in the least afraid of him indeed it struck her that morning as she came in with a sense of wonder that she had ever found him formidable good morning my dear she said but how very surprising has everybody else finished and gone out waldenech i am so glad you suggested coming here and i hope you haven't regretted it i have not enjoyed any days so much since you left me he said how dear of you to say that every one thought it so extraordinary that you should want to come here or that i should let you but i am delighted you did he left his place and came to sit in a chair next her the remains of nadine's breakfast were on a plate opposite half a poached egg some melon rind marmalade and a cigarette end he pushed these rather discouraging relics away it is not extraordinary that i should want to come here he said for the simple reason that you are the one woman i ever really cared about i always cared for you there are others who think you occasionally cared for them remarked dodo that may be so now i should like to stop on may i do so no my dear i am afraid that you certainly may not she said jack comes to day and the situation would not be quite comfortable not to say decent do you think that matters he asked it certainly is going to matter you haven't really got a european mind waldenech your mind is probably thibetan is it thibet where you do exactly as you feel inclined the place where there are llamas i do as i feel inclined wherever i am said he dodo remembered again with wonder the awful mastery that that sort of sentence as delivered by him used to have for her now it had none of any kind his personality had simply ceased to be dominant with regard to her but then you won't be here said she you will go by that very excellent train that never stops at all i have reserved a carriage for you he lit a cigarette i must have been insane to behave to you as i did he said it was most intensely foolish from a purely selfish point of view she patted his hand which lay on the table cloth certainly it was she said if you wanted to keep me i told you so more than once i told you that there were limits but you appeared to believe there were not that was quite like you my dear you always thought yourself a czar i do not think we need to go into past histories he got up dodo would you ever under any circumstances come back to me he said there is nadine you know it gives her a better chance dodo interrupted him you are not sincere when you say that it isn't of nadine that you think as for your question i have never heard of any circumstances which would induce me to do as you suggest of course we cannot say that they don't exist but i have never come across them don't let us think of it waldenech it is quite impossible if you were dying i would come but under the distinct understanding that i should go away again in case you got better as i am sure i hope you would i don't bear you the slightest ill will you didn't spoil my life at all though it is true you often made me both angry and miserable as regards nadine she has an excellent chance as you call it under the present arrangements all my friends have come back to me except mrs vivian mrs vivian said he oh yes an english type earnest widow with an ear trumpet now continued dodo and i shall get her some day and jack comes this afternoon voila the round table again i take up the old life anew with the younger generation as well not a penny the worse you are a good many pennies the better said he in self justification as regards lord chesterford why is he coming here i suppose because like you he wants to see me and nadine or both of us do you suppose he wants to marry you he asked will you marry him dodo got up reveling in her sense of liberty waldenech you don't seem to realize that certain questions from you to me are impertinent she said my dear what i do now is none of your business you have as much right to ask mrs vivian whether she is thinking of marrying again you have been so discreet and pleasant all these days don't break down now i have not the slightest idea if jack wants to marry me now as a matter of fact and i have really no idea if i would marry him in case he did it is more than twenty years since i spoke to him oh i spoke to him out of a taxi cab the other day but he did not answer and i have no idea what he is like in twenty years one may become an entirely different person however that is all my business and no one else's now if you have finished let us take a stroll in the garden before your carriage comes round i ask then a favor of you he said and what is that that you be yourself just for this stroll that you be as you used to be when we met that summer at zermatt dodo was rather touched she was also relieved that the favor was one so easy to grant she took his arm as they left the dining room and came out into the brilliant sunshine that is dear of you to remember zermatt she said oh waldenech think of those great mountains still standing there in their silly rows with their noses in the air how frightfully fatiguing and they all used to look as if they were cuts with each other and there they'll be a thousand years hence not having changed in the least but i'm not sure we don't have the better time scampering about for a few years and running in and out like mice though we get uglier and older every day look there is poor john sturgis coming towards us let us quickly go in the opposite direction ah he has seen us dear john nadine was looking for you i believe i think she expected you to read something to her after breakfast about goths or gothic architecture or was it bishop algie you were talking to last night about cathedrals one or the other i am sure he said he so much enjoyed his talk with you waldenech felt that dodo was behaving exactly as she used to behave at zermatt somehow in his sluggish and alcoholic soul there rose vibrations like those he had felt then talk to him or me it does not matter he said in german to her but talk like that that is what i want dodo gave him one glance of extraordinary meaning this little muttered speech strangely reminded her of the paean in the thrush's song at dawn it recalled a poignancy of emotion that belonged to days long past but the same poignancy of feeling was hers still she could easily feel and habitually felt in spite of her forty and more years the mere out bubbling of life that expressed itself in out bubbling speech she also rather welcomed the presence of a third party it was easier for her to bubble to anybody rather than to waldenech she buttonholed the perfectly willing john bishop algie is such a dear isn't he she said he is accustomed not to talk at all and so talking is a treat to him and he loved you he is taking a cinematograph show all about the acts of the apostles round the country next autumn to collect funds for maud's orphanage the orphanage is already built but there are no orphans i think the money he collects is to get orphans to go there scholarships i suppose he made all his friends group themselves for scenes in the acts and he is usually st paul there is a delicious shipwreck where they are tying up the boat with rug straps and ropes he had it taken in the bay here and it was extremely rough which made it all the more realistic because dear algie is a very bad sailor and while he was being exceedingly unwell over the side his halo fell off and sank we did not talk about the acts of the apostles last night said john firmly we talked about gothic architecture and piccadilly and wagner but how entrancing said dodo i particularly love siegfried because it is like a pantomime do you remember when the dragon comes out of his cave looking exactly like paddington station with a red light on one side and a green one on the other and a quantity of steam and whistlings and some rails then afterwards a curious frosty female appears suddenly in the hole of a tree and tells wotan that his spear ought to be looked to before he fights waldenech we went together to baireuth and you snored but luckily on the right note and everybody thought it was fafner john i was sitting in my window at dawn this morning and all the birds in the world began to sing it made me feel so common nobody ought to see the dawn except the birds and i suppose the worms for the sake of the birds waldenech turned to her and again spoke in german you are still yourself he said after all these years you are still yourself dodo's german was far more expressive than his it was also ludicrously ungrammatical and intensely rapid there are no years she said years are only an expression used by people who think about what is young and what is old every one has his essential age and remains that age always this man is about sixty the age of his mother john sturgis smiled in a kind and superior manner perhaps i had better tell you that i know german perfectly he said also french and italian in case you want to say things that i shan't understand dodo stared for a moment then pealed with laughter darling john she said i think that is too nice of you if you were nasty you would have let me go on talking isn't my german execrable how clever of you to understand it but you are old aren't you of course it is not your fault nor is it your misfortune since all ages are equally agreeable we grow up into our ages if we are born old and we grow out of them like missing a train if our essential age is young when you are eighty you will still be sixty which will be delightful for you i make plans for what i shall be when i am old but i wonder if i shall be able to carry them out when i am old i shall be what i shall be i suppose the inevitable doesn't take much notice of our plans it sits there like the princess on the top of the glass hill while we all try without the slightest success to get at it ah my dear waldenech there is the motor come round for you you will have to start because i have at last trained my chauffeur to give one no time to wait at the station and you must not jilt the compartment i have engaged you to it will get to london all alone so bad for a young compartment he made no further attempt to induce her to let him stop and dodo with a certain relief of mind saw him drive off and blew a large quantity of kisses after him he was such a dear about the year you were born john she said but you are too old to remember that now i must be martha and see the cook and all the people who make life possible then i shall become mary again and have a delicious bathe before lunch certainly the good part is much the pleasantest as is the case always at private theatricals i think we must act this evening we have not had charades or anything for nearly two days john like most prigs was of a gregarious disposition and liked that his own superiority of intellect of which he was so perfectly conscious should be made manifest to others and literally he could not imagine that dodo should not seem to prefer burying herself in household affairs when he was clearly at leisure to converse with her he did not feel himself quite in tune with the younger members of the party and sometimes wondered why he had come here that wonder was shared by others his tediousness in ordinary intercourse was the tediousness of his genus for he always wanted to improve the minds of his circle unfortunately he mistook quantity of information for quality of mind and thought that large numbers of facts even such low facts as dates held in themselves the germ of culture but since at the present moment dodo showed not the smallest desire to profit by his leisure he wandered off to the tennis courts where he had reason to believe he should find companions his faith was justified for there was a rather typical party assembled berts and hugh were playing a single while esther was fielding tennis balls for them they were both admirable performers equally matched and immeasurably active at the moment esther standing as before ahasuerus with balls ready to give to berts had got in his way and he had claimed a let thanks awfully esther he said as he took a couple of balls from her but would you get a little further back you are continually getting rather in my way oh berts i'm so sorry she said you are playing so well i know esther was in the light hugh oh rather lot of course said hugh nadine took no active share she was lying on the grass at the side of the court with tommy and was reading pride and prejudice aloud when esther had a few moments to spare she came to listen john joined the reading party and wore an appreciative smile nadine came to the end of a chapter yes art oh great art she said shutting the book but i am not enchained it corresponds to madame bovary or the dutch pictures it is beautifully done none but an artist could have done it but i find a great deal of it dull john's smile became indulgent ah yes he said but what you call dull i expect i should call subtle surely nadine you see how marvelous esther groaned john you make me feel sick she began balls please said hugh esther sprang up yes hugh i'll get them she said aren't those two marvelous she added to nadine john is more marvelous said nadine john i wish you would get drunk or cheat at cards it would do you a world of good to lose a little of your self respect you respect yourself far too much nobody is so respectable as you think yourself we were talking of you last night i wish you had been there to hear but you had gone to bed with your camomile tea perhaps you think camomile tea subtle also whereas i should only find it dull i think you are quibbling with words he said but i too wish i had heard you talking last night i always welcome criticism so long as it is sincere it was quite sincere said nadine you may rest assured it was unanimous too we were all agreed john found this not in the least disconcerting i am not so sure that it matters then he said when several people are talking about one thing you tell me you were talking about me they ought to differ if they all agree it shows they only see one side of what they are discussing nadine sat up while tommy buried his dissipated face in his hands we only saw one side of you she said and that was the obvious one you will say that it was because we were dull but since you like criticism you shall know we all thought you were a prig esther said you would be distressed if we thought differently she said you like being a prig do tell me is it pleasant or i expect what i call prig you call cultured are you cultured tommy sat up come and listen esther he shouted those glorious athletes can pick up the balls themselves for a minute esther emerged from a laurel bush triumphant with a strayed reveler oh is nadine telling john what she thinks she asked nadine is said tommy nadine meantime collected her thoughts when she talked she ascertained for herself beforehand what she was going to say in that respect she was unlike her mother who ascertained what she thought when she found herself saying it but the result in both cases had the spontaneous ring john somehow or other you are a dear she said though we find you detestable you think anyhow that gives you the badge anybody who thinks hugh like mr longfellow with his arrow flung his racquet into the air without looking where it went he had a moment previously sent a fast drive into the corner of the court which raised whitewash in a cloud and won him the set nadine are you administering the oath of the clan he said you haven't consulted either berts or me nadine looked pained did you really think i was admitting poor john without consulting you she said though he complies with the regulations hugh streaming with the response that a healthy skin gives to heat threw himself down on the grass i vote against john he said i would sooner vote for seymour and i won't vote for him also it is surely time to go and bathe i don't know what you are all talking about said john i daresay it doesn't matter but what is the clan hugh sat up the clan is nearly prigs he said but not quite but you are quite we are saved because we do laugh at ourselves and you are not saved because you don't added nadine and is the whole object of the clan to think asked john no that is the subject also you speak as if we all had said 'let there be a clan and it was so' said nadine you mustn't think that there was a clan and we discovered it like newton and the orange apple surely said john nadine looked brilliantly round i knew he would say that she said you see you correct what i say whereas a clansman would be content to understand what i mean bishop algie is clan by the way said hugh i went down to bathe before breakfast and found him kneeling down on the beach saying his prayers that is tremendously clannish i don't see why said john esther sighed no of course you wouldn't see she said try him with another said nadine esther considered attend john she said when the last stevenson letters came out berts bought them and looked at one page then he took a taxi to paddington and took a return ticket to bristol swindon said berts the station is immaterial so long as it was far away i daresay swindon is quite as far as bristol john smiled there you are quite wrong he said swindon comes before bath and bristol after bath no doubt it does not matter though it is as well to be accurate esther looked at him with painful anxiety but don't you see why berts went to swindon or bristol she said poor dear you do see now that is hopeless you ought to have felt to reason out what should have been a flash is worse than not to have understood at all john again like all other prigs was patient with those not so gifted as himself i daresay you will explain to me what it all amounts to he said all i am certain of is that berts wanted to read stevenson's letters and so got into a train where he would be undisturbed wouldn't it have answered the same purpose if he had taken a room at the paddington hotel nadine turned to berts oh berts that would have been rather lovely she said not at all said he i wanted the sense of travel john got up then i should have recommended the underground he said you could have gone round and round until you had finished it would have been much cheaper nadine waved impotent arms of despair now you have spoiled it she said there was a possibility in the paddington hotel which sounds so remote but the underground you might as well say why do i bathe i who cannot swim i can get clean in a bath though i only get dirty in the sea and if i want the salt i can put tiddle de wink salt or whatever the name is in my bath tidman said john i am sure you are right though who cares i am knocked down by cold waves i am cut by stones on my soles i am pinched by crabs and homards at least i think i am the wind gnaws at my bones and my hair is as salt as almonds between my toes is sand and bits of seaweed make me a plaster and my stockings fall into rock pools but do i go with rapture to have a bath in the bathroom i hate washing there is nothing so sordid as to wash my face except to brush my teeth but to bathe in the sea makes me think it gives me romance poor john you never get romance you amass information and make a blue book but we all we make blue mountains which we never reach if we reached them they would probably turn out to be green as it is they are always blue because they are beyond it is suggestion that we seek not attainment to attain is dull to aspire is the sugar and salt of life don't you see to realize an ideal is to lose the ideal it is like a man growing rich he never sees his sovereigns when he has gained them he flings them forth again into something further if he left them in a box the real sovereigns under his bed what chance would there be for him to grow rich but out they go he never uses them except that he makes them breed it is the same with the riches of the mind an idea an ideal is yours do you keep it personally you do but we no we invest it again it is to our credit at this bank of the mind we do not hoard it and spend it piecemeal we put it into something else what i have perceived in music i put into plays what i have perceived in plays i put into pictures i never let it remain at home but when i shall be a millionaire of the mind what what then yes that makes me pause perhaps it will all be converted as they convert bonds is it not and i shall put it all into love who knows la la nadine paused a moment but nobody spoke hugh was watching her with the absorption that was always his when she was there but after a moment she spoke again we talk what you call rot she said but it is not rot the people who always talk sense arrive at less there are sparks that fly as when you strike one flint with another your english philosophers who are they mr chesterton i suppose is he not a philosopher or some machiavelli or other they sit down soberly to think and when they have thought they wrap up their thought in paradox as you wrap up a pill for your dog so that he swallows it and his inside becomes bitter that is not the way you must start with pure enjoyment and when a thought comes you must fling it into the air they hit a bird or turn into a rainbow or fall on your head but what matter you others sit and think and when you have thought of something you put it in a beastly book and have finished with it you prigs turn the world topsy turvy that way you do not start with joy and you go forth in a slough of despondent information ah yes the child who picks up a match and rubs it against something and finds it catches fire removes the romance of the match more than mr bryant and may and boots is it who made the match matches are made on earth but the child who knows nothing about them and strikes one is the person who is in heaven you are not content with the wonder and romance of the world you prefer to explain the rainbow away instead of looking at it it is a sort of murder to explain things away you kill their souls and demonstrate that it is only hydrogen she looked up at hugh we talked about it last night she said we settled that it was a great misfortune to understand too well a footman arrived at this moment with a telegram which he handed to berts who opened it he gave a shout of laughter and passed it to nadine what shall i say he asked but of course 'yes' she said it is quite unnecessary to ask mama berts scribbled a couple of words on the reply paid form it's only my mother he said in general explanation she wants to come over for a day or two and see aunt dodo again but she doesn't feel sure if aunt dodo wants to see her are you sure there's a room nadine there always is some kind of room said nadine she can sleep in three quarters of my bed if not i'm so glad she is tired of being a silly ass as we settled she was last night said berts perhaps i ought to ask aunt dodo nadine pish posh said nadine john got up and prig like had the last word i see all about the clan he said you have a quantity of vague enthusiasm and a lack of information you swim like jelly fish without any sense of direction and admire each other nadine considered this i do see what he means she said and don't live what you mean added john chapter iii this sojourn at meering in the month of june when london and its diversions were at their midmost was nadine's plan whatever nadine was or was not she was not a poseuse and her contention that it was a waste of time to spend all day in talking to a hundred people who did not really matter and in dancing all night with fifty of them was absolutely genuine as long as anything amuses you she had said it is not waste of time but when you begin to wonder if it really amuses you it shows that it does not darling mama may i go down to meering for a week or ten days i do not want any one to come but if anybody likes to come we might have a little cheerful party besides it is coronation next week and great corvee i think it is likely that esther would wish to escape and perhaps one or two others and it would be enchanting at meering now it would be a rest cure a very curious sort of rest since we shall probably never cease bathing and talking and reading but anyhow we shall not be tired over things that bore us that is the true fatigue you are never tired as long as you are interested but i am not interested in the coronation nadine's solitary week had proved in quality to be populous and in quantity to exceed the ten days and it was already beginning to be doubtful if july would see any of them settled in london again dodo's house in portman square had been maintained in a state of habitableness with a kitchen maid to cook and a housemaid to sweep and a footman to wait and a chauffeur to drive and an odd man to do whatever the other servants didn't and occasionally one or two of the party made a brief excursion there for a couple of nights if any peculiar attraction beckoned the whole party had gone up for a shakespeare ball at the albert hall but had returned next day and dodo had hurried to st paul's cathedral to attend a thanksgiving service especially since she on leaving london had taken a season ticket being convinced she would be continuously employed in rushing up and down subsequently she had defrauded the railway company by lending it though strictly non transferable to any member of the party who wished to make the journey with the result that bertie had been asked by a truculent inspector whether he was really princess waldenech his passionate denial of any such identity had led to a lesser frequency of these excursions nadine with the same sincerity had mapped out for herself a course of study at meering and she read plato every afternoon in the original greek with an admirable translation at hand from three o'clock till five during these hours she was inaccessible and when she emerged rather flushed sometimes from the difficulty of comprehending what some of the dialogues were about she was slightly socratic at tea and tried to prove as dodo said that the muse of mr harry lauder was the same as the muse of sir george alexander and that she ought to be rude to hugh if she loved him she was extremely clear headed in her reason and referred them to the symposium and the dialogue on lysis to prove her point but as nobody thought of contradicting her since the socratic mood soon wore off they did not attempt to find out the hellenic equivalents for those amazing doctrines she was markedly socratic this afternoon when the whole party were having tea on the lawn esther and bertie had been down to bathe after lunch and since everybody was going to bathe again after tea they had left their clothes behind different rocky screens above the probable high water level on the beach and were clad in bathing dress moderately dried in the sun with dressing gowns above berts had nothing in the shape of what is called foot gear on his feet since it was simpler to walk up barefoot and he was wriggling his toes one after the other in order to divest them of an excess of sand but pain and pleasure are so closely conjoined said nadine in answer to an exclamation of his concerning stepping in a gorse bush it hurts you to have a prickle in your foot but the pleasure of taking it out compensates for the pain that's socratic said hugh when they took off his chains just before they hemlocked him you didn't think of that nadine i didn't claim to but it is quite true there is actual pleasure in the cessation of pain if you are unhappy and the cause of your unhappiness is removed your happiness is largely derived from the fact that you were unhappy for instance did you ever have a fish bone stick in your throat hugh as a matter of fact never said hugh but as i am meant to say 'yes' i will and did you cough violently said hugh upon which the fish bone returned to your mouth no said hugh i swallowed it it never returned at all it does not matter which way it went said nadine but your feeling of pleasure at its going was dependent on the pain which its sticking gave you is that all said hugh does it not seem to you to be proved oh yes it was proved long ago but it's a pedantic point the sort of point john would have made he absently whistled the first two lines of am stillen herd and nadine was diverted from her platonisms ah that is so much finer than the finished 'preislied' she said he has curled and oiled his verse like an assyrian bull he and sachs had cobbled at it too much they had brushed and combed it it had lost something of springtime and sea breeze a finished work of art has necessarily less quality of suggestiveness look at the leonardo drawings is the 'gioconda' ever quite as suggestive i am rather glad it was stolen i think leonardo is greater without it john drew in his breath in a pained manner 'mona lisa' was the whole wonder of the world he said i had sooner the thief had taken away the moon do you remember perhaps you didn't notice it the painting of the circle of rock in which she sat you are going to quote pater said nadine pray do not it is a deplorable passage and though it has lost nothing by repetition for there was nothing to lose it shows an awful ignorance of the spirit of the renaissance the eyelids are not a little weary they are a little out of drawing only esther looked across at berts berts is either out of drawing she said or else his dressing gown is i think both are he is a little too long and also the dressing gown is too short they ought to proceed as far as the ankles but berts' got a little weary at his knees i barked my knees on those foul rocks said berts examining those injured joints barking them is worse than biting them said nadine i never bite my knees said he it is a greedy habit worse than doing it to your nails if you are not careful you will talk nonsense said nadine i don't agree if you are not careful you can't talk nonsense if you want to talk nonsense you've not got to be not careful there are too many 'nots' remarked nadine not at all if you are careless some sort of idea creeps into what you say and it ceases to be nonsense there are lots of creeping ideas about like microbes any of which spoil it hardly anybody can be really meaningless for five minutes that is why the mad tea party is a supreme work of art you can't attach the slightest sense to anything that is said in it the question is what you mean by nonsense said nadine is it what mr bernard shaw writes in his plays or what mrs humphry ward writes in her books they neither mean anything but they are not at all alike in fact they are as completely opposed to each other as sense is to nonsense berts threw himself back on the turf true he said but they are neither of them nonsense the lame and the halt and the blind ideas creep into both they both talk sense mortally wounded esther gave her appreciative sigh oh berts how true she said i went to a play by mrs humphry ward the other day or else i read a book by bernard shaw i forget which and all the time i kept trying to see what the sense of it had been before it had its throat cut but no one ever tried to see what alice in wonderland meant or what aunt dodo means mama is wonderful said nadine she lives up to what she says too her whole life has been complete nonsense i do hope jack will persuade her to do the most ridiculous thing of all and marry him is that why he is coming asked esther oh i hope so it would be the greatest and most absurd romance of the century hugh was eating sugar meditatively out of the sugar basin i don't see that you have any right to lay down the law about nonsense nadine he said you are constantly reading plato and making arguments which are meant to be consecutive i do that to relax my mind said nadine berts is quite right nonsense is not the absence of sense but the negative of sense just as sugar is the negative of salt to get non salt with your egg you must eat sugar with it not only abstain from salt you will get a remarkably nasty taste remarked john dear john nobody ever wronged you so much as to suggest that you would like nonsense when was leonardo born and how old was he when he died and how many golden crowns did francis of france give him for the 'gioconda' your mind is full of interesting facts that is why you are so tedious you are like the sand they used to put on letters which instantly made it dry berts got up we will go and bathe again he said and john shall remain on the beach and look older than the rocks he sits among the rocks by the way are old red sandstone they will blossom as the rose when granite john sits among them his is the head on which all the beginnings of the world have come and he is never weary dear me if i was not a teetotaller i should imagine i was drunk i think it is the sea what a heavenly time the man who stole the 'gioconda' must have had he just took it away i can imagine him going to the abbey at the coronation and taking away the king's crown there is genius and it is also nonsense it is pure nonsense to imagine going to the louvre and taking 'la gioconda' away i wonder what he has done with it said nadine i think he must be a jig saw puzzle maniac and have felt compelled to cut it up probably the louvre will receive bits of it by registered post the nose will come and then some rocks and then a rather weary eyelid i think john stole it he was absorbed in jig saw puzzles all morning now that seems to me nonsense wrong again said berts when it is put together it is sense if people cut up the pictures and then threw the bits away it might be nonsense but they keep the pieces and these become the picture again the process of cutting it up is nonsense said nadine yes and the process of putting it together is nonsense said esther and the two make sense said berts let's go and bathe nadine take down some proper book and read to us in the intervals 'pride and prej' said nadine oh do you think so not good for the sea shore why not 'poems and ballads' john will be shocked said nadine not at all he will be old red sandstone i know aunt dodo has a copy i think mr swinburne gave it her said esther she may value it said nadine and it may fall into the sea not if you are careful besides that would be rather suitable swinburne loved the sea and also understood it i think his spirit would like it if a copy was drowned but mama's spirit wouldn't said nadine on the moment of her mentioned name dodo appeared at the long window of the drawing room that opened upon the lawn simultaneously there was heard the buzz of a motor car stopping at the front door just round the corner oh all you darlings said dodo in the style of the 'omnia opera' are you going to bathe or have you bathed berts dear we know that above the knee comes the thigh without your showing us surely there are bigger dressing gowns somewhere of course it does not matter don't bother and you've got beautiful legs berts aren't they lovely said esther they ought to be put in plaster of paris but if you have bathed why not dress said dodo and if you haven't why undress at present oh but it's both said berts and so is esther we have bathed and are going to do it again as soon as we've eaten enough tea dodo looked appreciatively round you refreshing children she said if i bathed directly after tea i should turn blue and green like a bruise i have wasted all afternoon in looking at a box of novels from melland's i don't know what has happened to the novelists their only object seems to tell you about utterly dull and sordid people there is no longer any vitality in them they are like leaders in the papers full of reliable information one instance shocked me the heroine in 'no lambeth walk' went to birmingham by a train that left euston at p m and her ticket cost nine shillings and twopence halfpenny an awful misgiving seized me that it was all true and i rang for an abc and looked out birmingham it was so there was a train at that hour and the tickets cost exactly that how wretched said nadine in a pained voice darling don't take it too much to heart and one of those novels was about home rule and another about soap and another about tariff reform and a fourth about christianity which was absolutely convincing but one doesn't go to a novel in order to learn christianity or soap making one reads novels in order to be entertained and escape from real life into the society of imaginary and fiery people another one dodo stopped suddenly as a man came out of the drawing room window then she held both her hands out ah jack she said welcome welcome a very kind face grizzled as to the hair and mustache looked down on her from its great height a face that was wonderfully patient and reasonable and trustworthy jack chesterford wore his years well but he wore them all he did not look to be on the summer side of forty five he was spare still life had not made him the unwilling recipient of the most voluminous and ironic of its burdens obesity but his movements were rather slow and deliberate as if he was tired of the senseless repetition of the days but there seemed to be no irritation mingled with his fatigue he but yawned and smiled and turned over fresh pages but at the moment as he stood there with both dodo's hands in his there was no appearance of weariness and indeed it would have been a man of dough who remained uninspired by the extraordinary perfection and cordiality of her greeting it was almost as if she welcomed a lover it was quite as if she welcomed the best of friends long absent that she had thought out the manner of her salutation said nothing against its genuineness but she could have welcomed him quite as genuinely in other modes she had thought indeed of putting pathos penitence and shamefacedness into her greeting she could with real emotion to endorse it have just raised her eyes to his and let them fall again as if conscious of the need of forgiveness or with perhaps a little less genuineness she could have adopted the matronly and 'too late' attitude but this would have been less genuine because she did not feel at all matronly or think that it was in the least 'too late' but warm and unmixed cordiality with no consciousness of things behind was perhaps the most genuine and least complicated of all welcomes and she gave it she did not hold his hands more than a second or two for nadine and others claimed them but after a few minutes he and dodo were alone again together for jack declined the invitation to join the bathers on the plea of senility and feeling cold like david then when the noise of their laughter and talk had faded seawards he dropped the trivialities that till now had engaged them and turned to her i have been a long time coming dodo he said indeed i meant never to come at all but i could not help it i do not think i need explain either why i stopped away or why i have come now apart from the perfectly authentic pleasure that dodo felt in seeing her old friend again there went through her a thrill of delight at jack's implication of what she was to him she loved to have that power over a man she loved to know how potent over him still was the spell she wielded in days gone by she had not behaved well to him it would be truer to acknowledge that she had behaved just as outrageously as was possible for anybody not a pure bred fiend but he had come back it was unnecessary to explain why and then suddenly with the rush of old memories revived memories of his unfailing loyalty to her his generosity his unwearying loving kindness her eyes grew dim and her hands caught his again jack dear she said i want to say one thing i am sorry for all i did for my my treachery my my damnedness i was frightened i have no other excuse and my dear i have been punished but i tell you that what hurts most is your coming here your forgiveness she had not meant to say any of this it all belonged to one of the welcomes of him which she had rejected but the impulse was not to be resisted it is so she said with mouth that quivered wipe it all out dodo he said we start again to day dodo's power of rallying from perfectly sincere attacks of emotion was absolutely amazing and quite unimpaired only for five seconds more did her gravity linger dear old jack she said it is good to see you oh jack the gray hairs what a lot but they become you and you look just as kind and big as ever i used to think it would be so dreadful when we were all over forty but i like it quite immensely and the young generation are such ducks and i am not the least envious of them but aren't some of them weird i wonder if we were as weird i was always weirdish i suppose and i'm too old to change now but i've still got one defect though you would hardly believe it i can't get enough into the day and i haven't learned how to be in two places at once but i have just had three telephone lines put into my house in town even that isn't absolutely satisfactory because the idea was to talk to three people at once and i quite forgot that i hadn't three ears i really ought to have been one of the people in the central exchange who give you the wrong number you must feel really in the swim if you are the go between of everybody who wants to talk to everybody else but i should want to talk to them all have you had tea yes then let us go down to the sea because i must have a bathe before dinner oh by the way edith is coming to night i have not seen her yet you and she were the remnant of the old guard who wouldn't surrender jack but went on sullenly firing your muskets at me i forgot mrs vivian but her ear trumpet seems to make her matter less they went together across the lawn which that morning had been so sweetly bird haunted and down the steep hillside that led across the sand dunes to the sea here a mile of sands was framed between two bold headlands that plunged steeply into the sea and jack and dodo walked along the firm shining beach towards the huge boulders which had in some remote cataclysm been toppled down from the cliff and formed the rocks than which john was so much older like brown amphibious sheep with fleeces of seaweed they lay grazing on the sands and dotted about in the water and from the end of them a long reef of cruel forked rocks jutted out a couple of hundred yards into the sea higher up on the beach were more monstrous fragments as big as cottages behind which the processes of dressing and undressing of bathers could discreetly and invisibly proceed dodo had forgotten about this and talking rapidly was just about to advance round one of them when an agonized trio of male voices warned her what sight would meet her outraged eyes the tide was nearly at its lowest and but a little way out at the side of the reef these rocks ended altogether giving place to the wrinkled sand and in among them were delectable rock pools with torpid strawberry looking anemones and sideways scuttling crabs with a perfect passion for self effacement which if effacement was impossible turned themselves into wide pincered grotesques and tried to make themselves look tall bertie and esther who were already prepared for the bathe were pursuing marine excavations in one of these and dodo ecstatically pulled off her shoes and stockings one of which fell into the rock pool in question oh jack if you won't bathe you might at least paddle she said berts do you see that very red faced anemone isn't it like nadine's maid esther do take care there's an enormous crab crept under the seaweed by your foot don't let it pinch you darling isn't cancer the latin for crab it might give you cancer if it pinched you here are the rest of them i must go and put on my bathing dress it's in the tent i put up a tent for these children jack at great expense and they none of them ever use it nadine are you going to read to us all in the water do wait till i come what book is it 'poems and ballads' and so suspiciously like the copy mr swinburne gave me don't drop it into the water more often than is necessary you shall read us 'dolores our lady of pain' as we step on sharp rocks and are pinched by crabs how mr swinburne would have liked to know that we read his poems as we bathed and there's that other delicious one 'swallow my sister oh sister swallow' it sounds at first as if his sister was a pill and he had to swallow her jack dear you make me talk nonsense somehow come up with me as far as the tent and while i get ready you shall converse politely from outside it is so dull undressing without anybody to talk to jack though cordially invited to take part in the usual symposium in nadine's room that night at bed time preferred to go to his own though he had no intention of going to bed he wanted to think to ascertain how he felt he imagined that this would be a complicated process instead he found it extraordinarily simple that there were plenty of things to think about was perfectly true but they all faced one way so to speak one dominant emotion inspired them all he was as much in love with dodo as ever he did not because he could not consider how cruelly she had wronged him all that she had done was but a rush light in the mid day sun of what she was he was amazed at his stupidity in letting a day not to speak of a year elapse without seeing her since she was free again it had been a wanton waste of twelve golden months to do so often during these last two years he had almost fancied himself in love with nadine now he saw so clearly why it was because in face and corporal presence no less than in mind she reminded him so often of what dodo had been like she reproduced something of dodo's inimitable charm but now that he saw the two together how utterly had the image of nadine faded from his heart in his affection in his appreciation of her beauty and vitality she was still exactly where she was but out of the book of love her name had been quite blotted out blotted out too were the years of his anger and the scars of a bleeding heart and years of indignant suffering but he had never let them take entire possession of him in his immense soul there had ever been alight the still secret flame that no winds or tempests could make to flicker and to day at the sight of her that flame had shot up again a beacon that reached to heaven hard work had helped him all these years to keep his nature unsoured his great estates were managed with a care and consideration for those who lived on his land unequaled in england and politically he had made for himself a name universally respected for the absolute integrity of which it was the guarantee but all that so it seemed to him now had been his employment not his life his life all these years had lain like some enchanted and sleeping entity waiting for the spell that would awaken it again now the spell had been spoken for a moment his thought paused wondering at itself it seemed incredible that he should be so weak so wax like yet that seemed to matter not at all he might be weak or wax like or anything else that a man should not be but the point was that he was alive again for a little he let himself drift back upon the surface of things he had passed a perfectly amazing evening edith arbuthnot had arrived bringing with her a violinist a viola player and a 'cellist but neither maid nor luggage her luggage except her golf clubs and a chest containing music as she was only coming for a few days was certainly lost but she was not sure whether her maid had ever meant to come for she could not remember seeing her at the station so the violinist had her maid's room and the viola player and 'cellist young and guttural germans had quarters found for them in the village since dodo's cottage was completely crammed but they had given positively the first performance of edith's new quartette and at the end the violinist had ceremoniously crowned her with a wreath of laurels which he had picked from the shrubbery before dinner then they went into wild ecstasies of homage and drank more beer than would have been thought possible while edith talked german even more remarkably than dodo and much louder with her laurel wreath tilted rakishly over one ear a mug of beer in her hand and wearing an exceedingly smart dinner gown belonging to dodo and rather large walking boots of her own since nobody else's shoes would fit her she presented so astounding a spectacle that jack had unexpectedly been seized with a fury of inextinguishable laughter and had to go outside followed by dodo who patted him on the back when they returned edith was lecturing about the music they had just heard apparently it was impossible to grasp it all at one hearing while it was obviously essential that they must all grasp it without delay in consequence it was performed all over again while she conducted with her wreath on there was more homage and more beer then they had had charades by dodo and edith and edith sang a long song of her own composition with an immense trill on the last note but one which was 'shake' and her band played a quantity of siegfried while dodo with a long white beard made of cotton wool was wotan and edith truculently broke her walking stick and that was 'spear' and they did whatever they could remember out of macbeth which wasn't much but which was 'shakespeare' it was all intensely silly but jack knew that he had not laughed so much during all those years which to night had rolled away then he left the surface and dived down into his heart again there was no question of forgiving dodo for the way in which she had treated him the idea of forgiveness was as foreign to the whole question as it would have been to forgive the barometer for going down and presaging rain it couldn't help it it was like that but in stormy weather and fine in tempest and in the clear shining after rain he loved dodo what his chances were he could not at present consider for his whole soul was absorbed in the one emotion jack for all his grizzled hair and his serious political years had a great deal about him that was still boyish and with the inconsistency of youth having settled that it was impossible to think about his chance proceeded very earnestly to do so the chance seemed a conspicuously outside one she had had more than one opportunity of marrying him before and had felt herself unable to take advantage of it it was very little likely that she would find him desirable now twice already she had embarked on the unaccountable sea both times her boat had foundered once the sea was made in her estimate of cotton wool the second time in anybody's estimate of amorous brandy it was not to be expected that she would experiment again with so unexpected a proteus meantime a parliament of the younger generation in nadine's room were talking with the frankness that characterized them about exactly the same subject as jack was revolving alone for dodo had gone away with edith in order to epitomize the last twenty years and begin again with a fresh twenty to morrow it is quite certain that it is mama he wants to marry and not me said nadine i thought it was going to be me i feel a little hurt like when one isn't asked to a party to which one doesn't want to go you don't want to go to any parties said hugh rather acidly but i believe you love being asked to them nadine turned quickly round to him that is awfully unfair hughie she said in a low voice if you mean what i suppose you do do you mean that what i mean is quite obvious he said nadine got up from the window seat where she was sitting with him i think we had all better go to bed she said hugh is being odious if you meant what you said he remarked the odiousness is with you it is bad taste to tell one that you feel hurt that the ripper doesn't want you to marry him nadine was silent a moment then she held out her hand to him yes you are quite right hugh she said it was bad taste i am sorry is that enough he nodded and dropped her hand again the fact is we are all rather cross said esther we haven't had a look in to night mother is quite overwhelming said berts she and aunt dodo between them make one feel exactly a hundred and two years old as old as john here we all sit we old people nadine and esther and hugh and i and we are really much more serious than they your mother is serious enough about her music said nadine and jack is serious about mama the fact is that they are serious about serious things do you really think of mother as a serious person with her large boots and her laurel crown asked berts certainly all that is nothing to her she doesn't heed it while we who think we are musical can see nothing else i couldn't bear her quartette either and i know how good it was i really believe that we are rotten before we are ripe i except hugh nadine got up and began walking up and down the room as she did when her alert analytical brain was in grips with a problem look at jack the ripper she said why he's living in high romance he's like a very nice gray headed boy of twenty fancy keeping fresh all that time hugh and he are fresh berts is a stale old man who can't make up his mind whether he wants to marry esther or not i am even worse i am interested in plato and in all the novels about social reform and dull people who live in sordid respectability which mama finds so utterly tedious nadine threw her arms wide i can't surrender myself to anybody or anything she said i can be cool and judge but i can't get away from my mind it sits up in a corner like a great governess whereas mama takes up her mind like one of those flat pebbles on the shore and plays ducks and drakes with it throws it into the sea and then really enjoys herself lets herself feel if for a moment i attempt to feel my mind gives me a poke and says 'attend to your lessons miss nadine' the great judy if only i could treat her like one and take her out and throw brickbats at her but i can't i am terrified of her also i find her quite immensely interesting she looks at me over the top of her gold rimmed spectacles and though she is very hard and angular yet somehow i adore her i loathe her you know and want to escape but i do like earning her approbation silly old judy berts gave a heavy sigh what an extraordinary lot of words to tell us that you are an intellectual egoist he said and you needn't have told us at all we all knew it nadine gave her hiccup laugh i am like the starling she said i can't get out i want to get out and go walking with hugh and he can't get in for what a pack of miseries was le bon dieu responsible when he thought of the world i should have been exceedingly annoyed if he had not thought of me said berts nadine paused opposite the window seat where hugh was sitting silent oh hugh she said speaking very low there is a real me somewhere i believe but i cannot find it i am like the poor thing in the fairy tale that lost its shadow indeed i am in the more desperate plight i have got my shadow but i have lost my substance though not in riotous living for god's sake find it he said and then give it me to keep safe she looked at him with her dim smile that always seemed to him to mean the whole world when i find it you shall have it she said and last night it was the moon you wanted said he not yourself nadine shrugged her shoulders what would you have she said that was but another point of view do not ask me to see things always from the same standpoint and now since my mama and berts have made us all feel old let us put on our night caps and put some cold cream on our venerable faces and go to bed perhaps to morrow we shall feel younger chapter iv seymour sturgis who berts thought ought to have been drowned when he was a girl was employed one morning in july in dusting his jade he lived in a small flat just off langham place with a large capable middle aged frenchwoman who worshiped the ground on which he so delicately trod with the cloth topped boots which she made so resplendent she cooked for him in the inimitable manner of her race she kept his flat speckless and shining she valeted him she did everything in fact except dust the jade highly as seymour thought of antoinette he could not let her do that he always alluded to her as my maid and used to take her with him as valet to country houses it must however be added that he did this largely to annoy and he largely succeeded the room which was adorned by his collection of jade seemed somehow strangely unlike a man's room a french writing table stood in the window with a writing case and blotting book stamped with his initials in gilt by the pen tray was a smelling bottle with a gold screw top to it thin lace blinds hung across the windows and the carpet was of thick fawn colored fabric with remarkably good persian rugs laid down over it on the chimney piece was a louis seize garniture of clock and candlesticks and a quantity of invitation cards were stuck into the mirror behind there were half a dozen french chairs a sofa a baby grand a small table or two and a book case of volumes all in morocco dress clothes on the walls there were a few prints and in glazed cabinets against the wall was the jade nothing except perhaps the smelling bottle suggested a mistress rather than a master but the whole effect was feminine seymour rather liked that he had very little liking for his own sex they seemed to him both clumsy and stupid and his worst enemies of whom he had plenty could not accuse him of being either the one or the other on their side they disliked him because he was not like a man he disliked them because they were but while he detested his own sex he did not regard the other with the ordinary feeling of a man he liked their dresses their perfumes their hair their femininity more than he liked them he was quite as charming to plain old ladies even as dodo had said as he was to girls and he was perfectly happy when staying in the country to go a motor drive with aunts and grandmothers he had a perfectly marvelous digestion ate a huge lunch sat still in the motor all afternoon and had quantities of buttered buns for tea he dressed rather too carefully to be really well dressed and always wore a tie and socks of the same color which repeated in a more vivid shade the tone of his clothes he had a large ruby ring a sapphire ring and an emerald ring they were worn singly and matched his clothes he spoke french quite perfectly all these depressing traits naturally enraged such men as came in contact with him but though they abhorred him they could not openly laugh at him for he had a tongue when he chose of quite unparalleled acidity and was markedly capable of using it when required and taking care of himself afterwards in matters of art he had a taste that was faultless and his taste was founded on real knowledge and technique so that really great singers delighted to perform to his accompaniment and in matters of jewelry he designed for cartier in fact from the point of view of his own sex he was detestable rather than ridiculous while considerable numbers of the other sex did their very best to spoil him for none could want a more amusing companion and his good looks were quite undeniable but somewhere in his nature there was a certain grit which quite refused to be ground into the pulp of a spoiled young man in his slender frame too there were nerves of steel and most amazing of all when not better employed in designing for cartier or engaged in bloodless flirtations he was a first class golfer but he preferred to go for a drive in the afternoon and smoke a succession of rose scented cigarettes which could scarcely be considered tobacco at all he was fond of food and drank a good many glasses of port rather petulantly after dinner as if they were medicine this morning he was particularly anxious that his jade should show to advantage for nadine was coming to lunch with him to ask his advice about something which she thought was old venetian point lace he had taken particular pains also about the lunch everything was to be en casserole there were eggs in spinach and quails and a marvelous casseroled cherry tart he could not bear that anything about him whether designed for the inside or the outside should be other than exquisite and he would have been just as sedulous a martha if that strange barbarian called berts was coming only he would have given berts an immense beefsteak as well the bell of his flat tinkled announcing nadine he did not like the shrill treble bells and had got one that made a low bubbling note like the laugh of sir charles wyndham and nadine came in enchanted he said how is philistia not being the least glad of you she said i wish i could make people detest me as berts detests you it shows force of character oh seymour what jade it is almost shameless isn't it shameless jade i mean is any one else coming to lunch of course not i don't dilute you with other people i prefer nadine neat now let's have the crisis at once bring out the lace nadine produced a small parcel and unfolded it pretty said he then he looked at it more closely and tossed it aside i hoped it was more like venetian point than that he said it's all quite wrong the thread's wrong the stitch is wrong it smells wrong don't tell me you've bought it no i shan't tell you she said he took it up again and pondered you got it at ducane's he said i remember seeing it well take it back to ducane and tell him if he sold it as venetian that he must give you back your money my dear it is no wonder that these dealers get rich if they can palm off things like that c'est fini ah but that is an exquisite aquamarine you are wearing those little diamond points round it throw the light into it how odd people usually are about jewelry they think great buns of diamonds are sufficient to make an adornment you might as well send up an ox's hind leg on the table what makes the difference is the manner of its presentation who is that lady who employs herself in writing passionate love novels she says on page one that he was madly in love with her on page two that she was madly in love with him on page three that they were madly in love with each other and then come some asterisks how much more artistic by the way if they printed the asterisks and left out the rest then we should know what it really was like you can appreciate nothing until it is framed or cooked then you can see the details the poor lady presents us with chunks of meat and informs us that they are amorous men and women i will write a novel some day from the detached standpoint observing and noting then i shall go away abroad it is only bachelors who can write about love do you like my tie seymour had a trick of putting expression into what he said by means of his hands he waved and dabbed with them they fondled each other and then started apart as if they had quarreled sometimes one finger pointed sometimes another and they were all beautifully manicured antoinette did that and as she scraped and filed and polished he talked his admirable french to her and asked after the old home in normandy where she learned to make wonderful soup out of carrots and turnips and shin bones of beef at the moment she came in to announce the readiness of lunch oh is it lunch already said nadine can't we have it after half an hour i should like to see the jade oh quite impossible said he she has taken such pains it would distress her for me i should prefer not to lunch yet but she is the artist now they are fragile things nadine eggs in spinach you must come at once how greedy you are she said for you that is a foolish thing to say i am simply thinking of antoinette's pride it is as if i blew a soap bubble all iridescent and you said you would come to look at it in ten minutes you shall tell me news if you talk you can always eat what has happened in philistia nadine frowned you think of us all as philistines she said because we like simple pleasures and because we are enthusiastic ah you mistake he said you couple two reasons which have nothing to do with each other to be enthusiastic is the best possible condition but you must be enthusiastic over what is worth enthusiasm is it so lovely really that aunt dodo has settled to marry the ripper surely that is a rechauffee you wrote me the silliest letter about it of course it does not matter at all much more important is that you look perfectly exquisite antoinette the spinach is sans pareil give me some more spinach but it is slightly bourgeois in jack the r to have been faithful for so many years it shows want of imagination also i think a want of vitality only to care for one woman that is one more than you ever cared for remarked nadine i know i said it was bourgeois to care for one there is a difference it is also like a troubadour i am not in the least like a troubadour but i think i shall get married soon it gives one more liberty people don't feel curious about one any more english people are so odd they think you must lead a double life and if you don't lead the ordinary double life with a wife they think you lead it with somebody else and they get curious i am not in the least curious about other people they can lead as many lives as a piano has strings for all i care and thump all the strings together or play delicate arpeggios on them nadine that hat pin of yours is simply too divine i will eat it pin and all if it is not faberge nadine laughed i can't imagine you married she said you would make a very odd husband i would make a very odd anything said he i don't find any recognized niche that really fits me whereas almost everybody has some sort of niche indeed in the course of hundreds of years the niches that is the manners of life have been evolved to suit the sorts of types which nature produces they live in rows and respect each other but why it should be considered respectable to marry and have hosts of horrible children i cannot imagine but it is and i bow to the united strength of middle class opinion but neither you nor i are really made to live in rows we are bedouins by nature and like to see a different sunrise every day there shall be another tent for antoinette that admirable lady was just bringing them their coffee and he spoke to her in french antoinette we start for the desert of sahara to morrow he said we shall live in tents antoinette's plump face wrinkled itself up into enchanted smiles bien m'sieur she said a quelle heure nadine crunched up her coffee sugar between her white teeth you are as little fitted to cross the desert of sahara as any one i ever met she said i should not cross it i should you would be miserable without your jade or your brocade and the sand would get into your hair and you would have no bath she said but every one who thinks has a bedouin mind it always wants me to go on and find new horizons and get nearer to blue mountains the matter with you is that you want and you don't know what you want said he nadine nodded at him sometimes when she was with him she felt as if she was talking to a shrewd middle aged man sometimes to a rather affected girl then occasionally and this had been in evidence to day she felt as if she was talking to some curious mixture of the two who had a girl's intuition and a man's judgment fond as she was of the friends whom she had so easily gathered round her gleeful as was the nonsense they talked serious as was her study of plato she felt sometimes that all those sunny hours concerned but the surface of her that as she had said before the individual the character that sat behind was not really concerned in them and seymour when he made mixture of his two types had the effect of making her very conscious of the character that sat behind he had described it just now in a sentence it wanted it knew not what and i want it so frightfully she said it is a pity i don't know what it is because then i should probably get it one gets what one wants if one wants enough a convenient theory he said and if you don't get it you account for it by saying you didn't want it enough i don't think it's true in any case the converse isn't one gets a quantity of things which one doesn't want in the least whereas you ought not to get on the same theory the things you passionately desire not to have nadine finished her sugar and lit a cigarette oh don't upset every theory she said i am really rather serious about it he regarded her with his head on one side for a moment what has happened is that somebody has asked you to do something and you have refused you are salving your conscience by saying that he doesn't want it enough or you would not have refused she laughed you are really rather uncanny sometimes she said only a guess he said guess again then define she said the obvious suggestion is that hugh has proposed to you again you would have been burned as a witch two hundred years ago said she i should have contributed fagots oh seymour that was really why i came to see you i didn't care two straws about the foolish lace they all tell me i had better marry hugh and i wanted to find somebody to agree with me i hoped perhaps you might he is such a dear you know and i should always have my own way i could always convince him i was right most girls would consider that an advantage in that case i am not like most girls i often wish i was i wrote an article a month or two ago about tolstoi and read it him and he thought it quite wonderful well it wasn't it was silly rot i wrote it and so of course i know it came out in a magazine i read it remarked seymour in a strictly neutral voice well wasn't it very poor stuff asked nadine to be quite accurate said seymour i only read some of it i thought it very poor indeed if was ignorant and affected nadine gave him an approving smile there you are then and with hugh it would be the same in everything else he would always think what i did was quite wonderful they say love is blind don't they so much the worse for love it seems to me a very poor sort of thing if in order to love anybody you must lose with regard to her any power of mind and judgment that you may happen to possess i don't want to be loved like that i want people to sing my praises with understanding and sit on my defects also with discretion if i was perfectly blind too i suppose it would be quite ideal to marry him but i'm not and i'm not even sure that i wish i was again if hugh was perfectly critical about me it would be quite ideal it seems to me you must have the same quality of love on both sides or at any rate the same quality of affection people make charming marriages without any love at all if they have affection and esteem and respect for each other they had gone back to the drawing room and seymour was handing pieces of his most precious jade to nadine who looked at them absently and then gave them back to him with the same incuriousness as people give tickets to be punched by the collector this seymour bore with equanimity for nadine was interesting on her own account and he did not care whether she looked at his jade or not but at this moment he screamed loudly for she put a little round medallion of exquisitely carved yellow jade up to her mouth as if to bite it oh seymour i'm so sorry she said i wasn't attending to your jade which is quite lovely and subconsciously this piece appeared like a biscuit tell me do you like jade better than anything else it is part of a larger question which is 'do you like things better than people' personally i like people so far more than anything else in the world but i don't like any particular person nearly as much i like them in groups i suppose if i married at all i should probably be a polyandrist certainly if i could marry four or five people at once i should marry them all but i don't want to marry any one of them seymour put the priceless biscuit back into its cabinet who he asked are this quartette of fortunate swains well hugh of course would be one said she and i think berts would be another and if it won't be a shock to you you would be the third and jack the r would be the fourth i should then have a variety of interests this would be the world and the flesh and the devil and a saint st seymour said he as if trying how it sounded like a liberal peer selecting his title i am afraid you are cast for the devil said nadine candidly berts is the world because he thinks he is cynical and jack is the flesh because he is so thin partly but also because he is so rich seymour turned the key on his jade this interested him much more but he had to make further inquiries if every girl wanted four husbands he said there wouldn't be enough men to go round round what asked nadine still entirely absorbed in what she was thinking round the marriageable females or does your plan include poly womany whatever the word is for men but of course there are such lots of bachelors who would marry if they could have two or three wives just as there are such lots of girls who would marry if they could have two or three husbands all those laws about 'one man one wife' were made by ordinary people for ordinary people and ordinary people are in the majority there ought to be a small county set apart for ridiculous people with a rabbit fence all round it and any one who could be certified to be ridiculous in his tastes should be allowed to go and live there unmolested that would be much better than your plan of going to the sahara with antoinette you would have to get five householders to certify you as ridiculous in order to obtain admission then you would do what you chose within the rabbit fence but when you wanted to be what they call sensible again you would come out and be bound to behave like anybody else as long as you were out under penalty of not being admitted again seymour considered this there's a lot in it he said and there would be a lot of people in the rabbit fence i should go there to morrow and never come out at all but a smaller county would be no use i should start with kent not rutlandshire and be prepared to migrate to yorkshire i accept the position of one of your husbands that is sweet of you i think he interrupted i shall have some more wives he said i should like a lunch wife and a dinner wife i want to see a certain kind of person from about mid day till tea time is that a hint that it is time for me to go asked nadine nearly don't interrupt but then if one is not in love with anybody at all as you are not and as i am not you want a perfectly different kind of person in the evening to be allowed only one wife has evolved a very tiresome type of woman a woman who is like a general servant and can so to speak wait at table cook a little and make beds you look for somebody who on the whole suits you it is like buying a reach me down suit which i have never done it probably fits pretty well but if it is to be worn every day until you die it must fit absolutely if it doesn't there are fifty other suits that would do as well translate said nadine surely there is no need what i mean is that occasionally two people are ideally fitted but the fit only occurs intermittently it is not common short of that as long as people don't blow their noses wrong or walk badly or admire carlo dolci or fail to admire bach so long in fact as they do not have impossible tastes any phalanx of a thousand men can marry a similar phalanx of a thousand women and be as happy the one with the other as with any other permutation or combination of the thousand there is a high big tremulous romantic attachment possible and it occasionally occurs short of that with the limitation about carlo dolci and bach anybody would be as happy with anybody else as anybody would be with anybody we are all on a level except the highest of all and the lowest of all life not death is the leveler still life is as bad as still death said she seymour groaned and waved his hands you deserve a good scolding nadine for saying a foolish thing like that he said you are not with your philistines now there is not esther here to tell you how marvelous you are nor berts to wave his great legs and say you are like the moon coming out of the clouds over the sea i am not in the least impressed by a little juggling with words such as they think clever it isn't clever it is a sort of parrot talk you open your mouth and say something that sounds paradoxical and they all hunt about to find some sense in it and think they do seymour got up and began walking up and down the room with his little short stepped waggling walk it is the most amazing thing to me he said that you who have got brains should be content to score absurd little successes with your dreadful clan who have the most ordinary intelligences i love your philistines but i cannot bear that they should think they are clever they are stupid and though stupid people are excellent in their way they become trying when they think they are wise you are not made wise by bathing all day in the silly salt sea and reading a book how did you know asked nadine i didn't it is merely the sort of thing i imagine you do at meering aunt dodo is different there is no rot about aunt dodo nor is there about hugh but esther my poor sister and the beautiful berts nadine took up the cudgels for the clan ah you are quite wrong she said you do us no justice at all we are eager we are really we want to learn we think it waste of time to spend all day and night at parties and balls we are critical and want to know how and why seymour i wish we saw more of you whenever i am with you i feel like a pencil being sharpened i can make fine marks afterwards keep them for the clan he said no i can't stand the clan nor could they possibly stand me when esther squirms and says 'o nadine how wonderful you are' i want to be sick and when i wave my hands and talk in a high voice as i frequently do i can see berts turning pale with the desire to kill me poor berts once i took his arm and he shuddered at my baleful touch i must remember to do it again really i don't think i can be one of your husbands if berts is to be another very well i'll leave out berts said she this is almost equivalent to a proposal said seymour in some alarm she laughed i won't press it she said and now i must go thanks for sharpening me my dear though you have done it rather roughly i am going down to meering again to morrow london is a mere rabble of colonels and colonials come down if you feel inclined god forbid said seymour piously nadine had spent some time with him but long after she had gone something of her seemed to linger in his room some subtle aroma of her too fine to be purely physical still haunted the room and the sound of her detached crisp speech echoed in the chambers of his brain he had never known a girl so variable in her moods on one day she would talk nothing but the most arrant nonsense on another as to day there mingled with it something extraordinarily tender and wistful on a third day she would be an impetuous scholar on the fourth she threw herself heart and soul if she had a heart into the gay froth of this london life indeed moods seemed to be too superficial a word to describe her aspects it was as if three or four different personalities were lodged in that slim body or directed affairs from the cool brain in that small poised head it would be scarcely necessary to marry other wives according to their scheme if nadine was one of them for it was impossible to tell even from minute to minute with which of her you were about to converse or which of her was coming down to dinner but all these personalities had the same vivid quality the same exuberance of vitality and in whatever character she appeared she was like some swiftly acting tonic that braced you up and unlike mere alcoholic stimulant was not followed by a reaction she often irritated him but she never resented the expression of his impatience and above all things she was never dull and for once seymour left incomplete the dusting of the precious jade and tried to imagine what it would be like to have nadine always here he did not succeed in imagining it with any great vividness but it must be remembered that this was the first time he had ever tried to imagine anything of the kind edith had left meering with dodo two days before and was going to spend a week with her in town since she was rather tired of her own house but she had seen out of the railway carriage window on the north coast of wales so attractive looking a golf links that she had got out with berts at the next station to have a day or two golfing the obdurate guard had refused to take their labeled luggage out and it was whirled on to london to be sent back by dodo on arrival but edith declared that it gave her a sense of freedom to have no luggage and she spent two charming days there and had arrived in london only this afternoon she had gone straight to dodo's house and had found jack with her and then learned the news of their engagement which had taken place only the day before upon which she sprang up and remorselessly kissed both dodo and jack i can't help it if you don't like it she said but that's what i feel like of course it ought to have happened more than twenty years ago and it would have saved you both a great deal of bother dodo i haven't been so pleased since my mass was performed at the queen's hall you must get married at once and must have some children it will be like living your life all over again without any of those fatal mistakes dodo jack i shall call you jack now jack you have been more wonderfully faithful than anybody i ever heard of you have seen all along what dodo was without being put off by what she did dodo screamed with laughter are these meant to be congratulations she said it is the very oddest way to congratulate a man on his engagement by telling him that he is so wise to overlook his future wife's past it is also so pleasant for me edith was still shaking hands with them both as if to see whether their hands were fixtures or would come off if violently agitated you know what i mean she said it is useless my pretending to approve of most things you have done it is useless for jack also but he marries the essential you not a parcel of actions jack kept saying thanks awfully at intervals like a minute gun and trying to get his hand away eventually edith released it i am delighted with you both she said and to think that only a fortnight ago i was still not on speaking terms with you dodo and jack wasn't either i love having rows with people if i know things are going to come straight afterwards because then you love them more than ever and i knew that some time i should have to make it up with you dodo though if i was jack i don't think i could have forgiven well you don't wish me to go on about that anyhow you are ducks and i shall leave the young couple alone and have a wash and brush up i have been playing golf quite superbly edith banged the door behind her and they heard her shrilly whistling as she went off down the passages then dodo turned to jack jack dear i thought i should burst when edith kissed you she said you half shut your eyes and screwed up your face like a dog that is just going to be whipped but i love edith now come and sit here and talk i have hardly seen you since well since we settled that we should see a good deal more of each other in the future i want you to tell me oh such lots of things how often a month on the average have you thought about me during all these years jack dear i want to be wanted so much you have always been wanted by me he said it is more a question of how many minutes in the month i haven't thought about you they are easily counted he sat down on the sofa by her as her hand indicated dodo he said i don't make demands of you except that you should be yourself but i do want that we are all made differently if we were not the world would be a very stupidly simple affair and you must know that in one respect anyhow i am appallingly simple i have never cared for any woman except you that is the fact let us have it out between us just once i have never worn my heart on my sleeve for any woman to pluck at and carry away a mouthful of there are no bits missing i assure you it is all there and it is all yours it is in no way the worse for wear because it has had no wear i feel as if jack paused a moment he knew the meaning of his thought but found it not so easy to make expression of it i feel as if i had been sitting all my life at a window in my heart he said looking out and waiting for you to come by but you had to come by alone you came by once with my cousin you came by a second time with waldenech you were bored the first time you were frightened the second time but you were not alone i believe you are alone now i believe you look up to my window ah how stupid all language is as if you looked up to it dodo was really moved and when she spoke her voice was unsteady i do look up to it jack she said oh my dear how the world would laugh at the idea of a woman already twice married having romance still in front of her but there is romance jack you see you see you have run through my life just as a string runs through a necklace of pearls or beads beads perhaps is better yet i don't know chesterford gave me pearls all the pearls a necklace of pearls before swine shall we say i was swine if you understand but you always ran through it all which sounds as if i meant you were a spendthrift but you know what i do mean really i wonder if anybody ever made a worse mess of her life than i have done and found it so beautifully cleaned up in the middle but there you were i ought to have married you originally i ought to have married you unoriginally but i never trusted my heart you might easily tell me that i hadn't got one but i had i daresay it was a very little one so little that i thought it didn't matter i suppose i was like the man who swore something or other on the crucifix and when he broke his oath he said the crucifix was such a small one she paused again jack are you sure she asked i want you to have the best life that you can have are you sure you give yourself the best chance with me my dear there will be no syllable of reproach on my lips or in my mind if you reconsider you ought to marry a younger woman than me you will be still a man at sixty i shall be just a thing at fifty eight dodo took a long breath and stood up marry nadine she said she is so like what i was you said it yourself and she hasn't been battered like me i think she would marry you i know how fond she is of you anyhow and the rest will follow i can't bear to think of you pushing my bath chair god knows i have spoiled many of your years but god knows i don't want to spoil more of them she will give you all that i could have given you twenty years ago ah my dear the years how cruel they are how they take away from us all that we want most you love children for instance jack perhaps i shall not be able to give you children nadine is twenty one that is a long time ago you should consider i said 'yes' to you yesterday but perhaps i had not thought about it sufficiently i have thought since before you came down to meering i was awake so long one night wondering why you came i was quite prepared that it should be nadine you wanted and oh how gladly i would give nadine to you instead of giving myself i should see i should understand at first i thought that i should not like it that i should be jealous to put it quite frankly of nadine but somehow now that i know that your first desire was for me i am jealous no longer take nadine jack i want you to take nadine it will be better we know each other well enough to trust each other and now that i tell you that there will be nothing but rejoicing left in my heart if you want nadine you must believe that i tell you the entire truth i know very well about nadine she will not marry hugh she wants somebody who has a bigger mind she wants also to put hugh out of the question she does not mean to marry him and she would like it to be made impossible woo nadine dear jack and win her she will give you all i could once have given you all that i ought to have given you at that moment dodo was making the great renunciation of her life she had been completely stirred out of herself and she pleaded against her own cause she was quite sincere and she wanted jack's happiness more than her own she believed even while she renounced all claim on him that her best chance of happiness was with him for it had taken her no time at all to make up her mind when he proposed to her yesterday and she had not exaggerated when just now she told him that he ran through her life like a string that keeps the beads of time in place she had never felt for another man what she had felt for him and her declaration of his freedom was a real renunciation made impulsively but most generously and completely she really meant it and she did not pause to consider that the offer was one of which no man could conceivably take advantage and jack felt and knew her sincerity you are absolutely free my dear she said absolutely and i will come to your wedding and dance at it if you like for joy that you are happy he got up too there will be no wedding unless you come to it he said dance at it dodo but marry me nobody else will do dodo looked him full in the face edith was quite right to remind you of of what i have done she said and i am quite right to forget it said he she shook her head smiling a little tremulously oh jack she said in a sigh he took her close to him my beloved he said and kissed her chapter v dodo's wedding which took place at the end of july in westminster abbey was a very remarkable and characteristic affair in the first place she arrived so late that people began to wonder whether she was going to throw jack over again this time at the very last moment jack himself did not share these misgivings and stood at the west door rather hot and shy but quite serene waiting till his bride should come eventually nadine who was to have come with her mother appeared in a taxi going miles above the legal limit with the information that dodo was in floods of tears because she had been so horrible to jack before and wanted to be so nice now she said she would stop crying as soon as she possibly could but would nadine ask jack to be a dear and put off the wedding till to morrow since her tears had made her a perfect fright on which the bridegroom took a card and wrote on it i won't put off the wedding and if you don't come at once i shall go away do be quick there are millions and millions of people all staring oh jack what a brute you are said nadine as she read it i don't think i can take it you can and will said he you will also take dodo by the hand and bring her here bring her do you understand tell her that in twenty minutes from now i shall go somehow dodo's marriage had seized the popular imagination and the abbey was crammed so also for half a mile were the pavements the traffic by the abbey had been diverted and all round the windows were clustered with sight seers the choir was reserved for the more intimate friends and bishop algie who was to perform the ceremony was endorsed by a flock of eminent clergy the news that dodo was in tears but that nadine had been sent by the bridegroom to fetch her traveled swiftly up the abbey and a perfect babel of conversation broke out almost drowning the rather debussy like wedding march which edith had composed for the occasion she had also written an anthem thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine a highly original hymn tune and two chants for the psalms written for full orchestra with percussion and an eight part choir she had wanted to conduct the whole herself and expressed her perfect willingness to wear a surplice and her music doctor's hood and keep on her cap or not exactly as the dean preferred but the dean preferred that she should take no part whatever beyond contributing the whole of the music which annoyed her very much and several incisive letters passed between them in which the topics of conventionalism pharisees and cant were freely introduced edith had to give way but consoled herself by arranging that the whole of the marriage suite should be shortly after performed at the queen's hall where no dean or other unenlightened person could prevent her conducting in any costume she chose but temporarily she had been extremely upset by this ridiculous bigotry dodo arrived before the twenty minutes were over and she came up the choir on jack's arm looking quite superb and singing edith's hymn tune very loud and occasionally incorrectly she had just come opposite edith who had in default of conducting secured a singularly prominent position when she sang a long bell like b flat and edith had said b natural dodo in a curdling sibilant whisper there were of course no bridesmaids but dodo's train was carried by pages both of whom she kissed when they arrived at the end of their long march up the choir mrs vivian who on dodo's engagement had finally capitulated was next to edith and dodo said vivy dear into her ear trumpet as she passed up the aisle miss grantham alone among the older friends was absent she had said from the beginning that it was dreadfully common of dodo to marry jack as it was a lived happily ever afterwards kind of ending to dodo's unique experiences she knew that they would both become stout and serene and commonplace instead of being wild and unhappy and interesting and to mark her disapproval made an appointment with her dentist at the hour at which the voice would be breathing over eden in the exceedingly up to date music which edith had composed but so far from her dentist finding change and decay he dismissed her five minutes after she had sat down and seized by a sudden ungovernable fit of curiosity she drove straight off to the abbey to find that dodo had not arrived and it seemed possible that there was a thrill coming and everything might not end happily but when it became known that dodo was only late for sentimental reasons she left again in disgust and ran into dodo at the west door and said i am disappointed dodo dodo sang edith's psalm with equal fervor but thought it would be egoistic to join in the anthem since it was about herself but she whispered to jack jack dear it's much the most delicious marriage i ever had hush you must be grave because dear algie is going to address us i hope he will give us a nice long sermon the register was signed by almost everybody in the world and there were so many royalties that it looked at first as if everybody was going to leave out their surnames but the time of ambassadors and peers came at last and then it looked as if the fashion was to discard christian names in fact said dodo i suppose if you were much more royal than anybody else you would lose your christian name as well your royal highness and simply answer to hie or to any loud cry oh are we all ready again we've got to go first jack darling i hope you won't shy at the cinematographs i hear the porch is full of them like gatling guns and to night you and i will be in all the music halls of london where are my ducks of pages that's right one on each side now give me your arm jack here we go listen at edith's wedding march i wonder if it's safe to play as loud as that in anything so old as the abbey i should really be rather afraid of its falling down if algie hadn't told me not to be afraid with any amazement it took the procession a considerable time to get down the choir since dodo had to kiss her bouquet not having a hand to spare to such an extraordinary number of people but in course of time they got out faced the battery of cameras and cinematograph machines and got into their car jack effaced himself in a corner but dodo bowed and smiled with wonderful assiduity to the crowds they have come to see us she explained so it is essential that we should look pleased to see them i should so like to be the queen say on saturdays only like the train you always want to go by on other days in the week darling can't you smile at them or put out your tongue and make a face they would enjoy it hugely eventually as they got further away from the abbey it became clear to dodo that the people in the street were concerned with their own businesses and not hers and she leaned back in the carriage oh jack she said it is you and i at last but i can't help talking nonsense dear i only do it because i'm so happy i am indeed and you it is morning with me he said they left town that afternoon though dodo rather regretted that they would not see themselves in the cinematograph to make sure that she had smiled and that jack's hair was tidy and went down to winston jack's country place where so many years ago dodo had arrived before as the bride of his cousin he had wondered whether for her sake another place would not be more suitable as a honeymoon resort but she thought the plan quite ideal it will be like the renewal of one's youth she said and i am going to be so happy there now jack we were neither of us happy when you used to come to stay there before and to go back like this will wipe out all that is painful in those old memories and keep all that isn't is it much changed i should so like my old sitting room again if you haven't made it something else it is exactly as you left it said he i couldn't alter anything dodo slipped her hand into his did you try to jack she asked yes i meant to alter it entirely i meant to put away all that could remind me of you in fact i went down there on purpose to do it but when i saw it i couldn't i sat down there and cried said dodo softly sympathetically no i didn't cry i smoked a cigarette and looked round in a stupid manner then i took out of its frame a big photograph of myself that i had given you in order to tear it up but i put it back in its frame again and put the frame exactly where it was before dodo gave a little moan oh jack how you must have hated me she said i hated what you had done i hated that you could do it but the other never and dodo let us never talk about all those things again don't let us even think of them it is finished and what is real is just beginning it was real all along she said and i knew it was real all along you and me that is to say but i chose to tell myself that it wasn't i have been like the people who when they hear the scream of somebody being murdered say it is only the cat i have been a little brute all my life and in all probability it is past half time for me already in fact it certainly is unless i am going to live to be ninety i'm not sure that i want to and yet i don't want to die one bit i should be very much annoyed if you ventured to do anything of the sort remarked jack yes and that is so wonderful of you you ought to have wished me dead a hundred times what's the phrase 'yes she would be better dead' just now i want to be better without being dead i often think we all have a sort of half time in our lives like people in foot ball matches when they stop playing and eat lemons the lemons you understand are rather sour reflections that we are no better than we might be but a great deal worse and somehow that gives one a sort of a fresh start and we begin playing again they arrived at winston late in the afternoon the village had turned out to greet them flags and arches made rainbow of the gray street with its thatched houses and air of protected stability and from the church tower the bells pealed welcome dodo always impressionable and impulsive was tremendously moved and with eyes brimming over leaned out of one side of the carriage and then the other to acknowledge these salutations oh jack isn't it dear of them she said of course i know it's all for you really but you've endowed me with everything and so this is mine too look at that little duck whom that nice faced woman is holding up waving a flag hark to the bells do you remember the poem by browning 'the air broke into a mist with bells' this is a positive london fog of bells can't you taste it is it the foghorns in that case that make the fogs and here we are at the lodge and there's the lake and the house ah what a gracious thing a summer evening is but how fragile jack and how soon over that wistful underlying tenderness in her nature almost melancholy but wholly womanly rose for the moment to the surface it was not the less sincere because it was seldom in evidence it was as truly part of her and a growing part of her as her brilliant enjoyment and insouciance and the expression of it gleamed darkly in her soft brown eyes as she leaned back in the carriage and took his hand i will try to make you happy she said he bent over her don't try to do anything dodo he said just just be for a moment a queer little qualm came over her had she followed her immediate impulse she would have said i don't know how to love like that i have to try i want to learn but that would have done no good and in her most introspective moments dodo was always practical the qualm lasted but a moment as the door was opened when they drew up but it lasted long enough to cause her to wonder whether it would be the past that would be entered again instead of the future entered too not by another door but by the same on the doorstep she paused lift me over the threshold jack she said it is such bad luck for a bride to stumble when she enters her home my dear what nonsense very likely but let's be nonsensical let us propitiate all the gods and demons lift me jack he yielded to her whim that is dear of you she said that was a perfect entry aren't i silly but no austrian would ever dream of letting his wife walk over the threshold for the first time and and that's all about austria she added rather hastily dodo looked swiftly round the old remembered hall opposite was the big open fireplace round which they so often had sat preferring its wide flaring homely comfort to the more formal drawing rooms to day no fire burned there for it was midsummer weather but as in old times a big yellow collie sprawled in front of it grandson perhaps so short are the generations of dogs to the yellow collies of the time when she was here last he too gave good omen for he rose and stretched and waved a banner of a tail and came stately towards them with a thrusting nose of welcome the same pictures hung on the walls high up there ran round the palisade of stags' heads and dodo with a conscious sense of most creditable memory recognized the butler as having been her first husband's valet she also remembered his name why vincent she said holding out her hand it is nice to see another old face and you don't look one day older any more than his lordship does tea yes let us have tea at once jack i am so hungry happiness is frightfully exhausting and i don't mind how exhausted i am suddenly dodo caught sight of the portrait of herself which had been painted when this house was for the first time her home oh jack look at that little brute smiling there she said i was rather pretty though but i don't think i like myself at all dear me i hope i'm not just the same now with all the prettiness and youth removed i don't think i am quite and oh jack there's poor dear old chesterford ah that hurts me it gives me a bitter little heart ache would you mind jack if jack felt horribly annoyed with himself in not having seen to this my dear he said it was awfully thoughtless of me of course it shall go it was stupid but dodo i was so happy all this last month that i have thought of nothing except myself dodo turned away from the picture to him and all the time i thought you were thinking about me she said jack what a deceiver he shook his head no it is that you don't understand you are me am i i should be a much nicer fellow if i was jack don't have that picture moved it only hurt for a moment it was a ghost that startled me merely because i did not expect it it is a dear ghost it is not jealous it will not spoil things or come between us it it wants us to be happy for he told me you know it was the last thing he said that i was to marry you it is a long time ago oh how long ago though i say it to my shame besides if you are to pull down or put away all that reminds me of that dreadful young woman dodo put out her tongue and made a face at her own picture you will have to pull down the house and drink up the lake and cut down the trees ah how lovely the garden looks i was never here in the summer before we only came for the shooting and hunting and the garden invariably consisted of rows of blackened salvias and decaying dahlias but it is summer now jack there was no mistaking the figurative sense in which she meant him to understand the word summer it had been winter winter of discontent so the glance she gave him inevitably implied when she was here before and she rejoiced in and admired this excellent glory of summer time and yet but a moment before the picture in the hall had hurt her until she remembered that even on his death bed her first husband had bidden her marry the man who had brought her back here to day she had neglected to do as she was told for about a quarter of a century and had married somebody else instead and yet this amazing variety of topics that concerned her heart any one of which you would have expected was of sufficient import to fill her mind to the exclusion of all else but bowled across it as the shadows of clouds bowl across the fields on a day of spring winds leaving the untarnished sunshine after their passage it was not because she was heartless that she touched on this series of somewhat tremendous topics it was rather that her vitality instantly reasserted itself it was undeterred impervious to discouraging or disturbing reflections dodo ate what may be termed a good tea and smoked several cigarettes then noticing that a small golf links had been laid out in the fields below the garden she rushed indoors to change her dress and play a game with her husband it won't be much fun for you darling she said because my golf is a species of landscape gardening and i dig immense hollows with my club and alter the lie of the country generally also i sometimes cheat if nobody is looking so admire the beauties of nature if you hear me say that i have a bad lie because if you looked you would see me pushing the ball into a pleasanter place and that would give you a low opinion of me but a little exercise would be so good for us both after being married the abbey was terribly stuffy the fifth hole brought them near the memorial chapel in the park where her first husband was buried darling that puts you five up she said and would you mind waiting here a minute while i go in alone i don't want even you with me i want to go alone and kneel for a minute by his grave and say my prayers and tell him i have come back again with you will you wait for a minute jack i shan't be long dodo wasn't long she said her prayers with remarkable celerity and came out again wiping her eyes oh jack she said what a beautiful monument it wasn't finished you know when i went away and i hadn't seen it and it's so touching to have just those three words 'lead kindly light' the dear old boy was so fond of that hymn it's all so lovely and peaceful and if ever there was a saint in the nineteenth century it was he somehow i felt as if he knew about us and approved and i remember we had 'lead kindly light' on the very last sunday evening of all i am so glad i went in dodo gave a little sigh where are we she said am i one hole up or two two isn't it do let it be two and what a lovely piece of marble it looks like the most wonderful cold cream turned to stone it must be carrara oh jack what a beautiful drive it went much faster than the legal limit the flames of the summer sunset were beginning to fade in the sky when they got back to the house and it was near dinner time dodo's spirits and appetite were both of the most excellent order and all the memories that this house brought back to her so far from causing any aching resuscitation of past years were owing to the incomparable alchemy of her mind but transformed into a soft and suitable background for the present afterwards they sat on the terrace in the warm dusk i must telegraph to nadine to morrow she said and tell her how happy i am jack sometimes nadine seems to me exactly what i should expect a very attractive aunt to be do you know what i mean i feel she could have warned me of all the mistakes i have made in my life before they happened if she had been born and she approves of you and me isn't it lucky i wonder why i feel so young on the very day on which i should most naturally be thinking what a lot of life has passed jack i don't want any more events some people reckon life by events and that is so unreasonable events are thrust upon you what counts is what you feel he moved his chair a little nearer to hers i am satisfied with what i feel he said and though i have felt it for very many years it has never lost its freshness i have always wanted and now i have got suddenly dodo's mood changed oh you take a great risk she said who is to assure you that i shan't disappoint you disappoint you horribly i can't assure you of that jack it is easy to understand other people but the silly proverb that tells you to know yourself makes a far more difficult demand if i disappoint you what are we to do you can't disappoint me if you are yourself he said you say that to me too who have outraged every sort of decency with regard to you he was silent a moment yes i say that to you he said dodo gave a little bubbling laugh you are not very polite she said i say that i have outraged every sort of decency and you don't even contradict me no what you say is is perfectly true but the comment of you and me sitting here on our bridal night is sufficient is it not dodo there is no use in your calling yourself names leave it all alone we are here you and i and it is getting late my darling the same night lady ayr was giving one of her awful dinner parties her family john esther and seymour were always bidden to them and went in to dinner in exactly their proper places as sons and daughters of a marquis before now it had happened that seymour had to take esther in to dinner and it was so to night but in the general way they saw so little of each other that they did not very much object they usually quarreled before long but made their differences up again by their unanimity of opinion about their mother that had already happened this evening mother is bursting with curiosity about aunt dodo's wedding said esther she wasn't asked i told her it was a very pretty wedding i went said seymour and i am going to write an account of it for the lady if you will tell me how you were dressed i will put it in that is supposing you were decently dressed mother asked me about it too and i think i said the bridesmaids looked lovely but there weren't any said esther of course there weren't but it enraged her by the way there is some awful stained glass put up in the staircase since i was here last a ruby crown has apparently had twins one of which is a sapphire crown and the other a diamond crown i shouldn't mind that sort of thing happening if it wasn't so badly done i shall try to break it by accident after dinner did you design it my dear i forgot we had finished quarreling let us talk about something else nadine came to see me the other day and if you will not tell anybody i think it quite likely that i shall marry her she likes jade and she looks quite pretty to night doesn't she esther had already alluded to nadine who was sitting opposite as the dream of dreams and further appreciation was unnecessary you don't happen to have asked her yet she said with marked neutrality no one doesn't ask that sort of thing until one knows the answer said he that is unless you are one of the ridiculous people who ask for information i hate the information i get by asking unless i know it already and then you don't get it no esther that is a charming emerald you are wearing but it is atrociously set if you will send it round to morrow i will draw a decent setting for it do look at mother she has got the family lace on which is made of string i think it is saxon oh of course the coronets are about her how foolish of me not to have guessed it is more foolish of you to think that nadine would look at you said esther i didn't ask her to look at me and i shan't ask her to look at me i shall recommend her not to look at me but i shall marry her or antoinette i don't see why you are so stuffy about it or perhaps you would prefer antoinette for a sister in law if she is to be your wife dear i think i should said esther seymour laid his hand on hers his smelt vaguely of wall flowers how disagreeable you are he said i don't think i shall say anything about your dress in the lady i shall simply say that lady esther sturgis was there looking very plain and tired i shall describe my own dress instead i had an emerald pin properly set instead of its being set like that sort of cheese cake you are wearing no it's not exactly a cheese cake it is as if you had spilt some creme de menthe and put a little palisade of broken glass round it to prevent it spreading what a disgusting dinner we are having aren't we i never know what to do before i dine with mama whether to eat so much lunch that i don't want any dinner or to eat none at all so that i can manage to swallow this sort of garbage to night i am rather hungry won't you come away early with me and have some supper at home perhaps nadine will come too if nadine will come i will said esther i suppose we can chaperone each other certainly if it amuses you shall we ask anybody else i see hardly anybody here whom i know by sight i think they must all be earls and countesses it's funny how few of one's own class are worth speaking to look at mama i know i keep telling you to look at mama but she is so remarkable she said 'sir' just now to the man next her he must be a saxon king i wish she was responsible for the wine instead of father teetotalers usually give one excellent wine because they don't imagine they know anything about it and tell the wine merchants just to send round some champagne and hock so of course they send the most expensive i think we ought to talk to our neighbors said esther mama is making faces that is because she has eaten some of this entree i expect i make no face because i haven't but i can't talk to my neighbor i tried but she is unspeakable to i wish my nose would bleed because then i should go away one of the frequent pauses that occurred at lady ayr's dinners was taking place at the moment and seymour's rather shrill voice was widely audible a buzz of vacant conversation succeeded and he continued that was heard he said and really i didn't mean it to be heard i am sorry i shall make myself agreeable but tell nadine we shall go away soon after dinner if you will be ready i shall not go up into the drawing room at all seymour turned brightly to the woman seated on his right have you been to 'the follies' he asked i hope you haven't because then we can't talk about them since i haven't either there are enough follies going about without going to them how amusin' you are said his neighbor seymour felt exasperated i know i am he said do be amusing too then we shall be delighted with each other but i don't know who you are said his neighbor well that is the case with me said he but my mother his neighbor's face instantly changed from a chilly neutrality to a welcoming warmth oh are you lord seymour she asked i should find it very uncomfortable to be anybody else said he i should not know what to do then do tell me because of course you know all about these things are we all going to wear slabs of jade next year and did you see me at princess waldenech's wedding this morning and who manicures you i hear you have got a marvelous person seymour really wished to atone for the unfortunate remark that had broken the silence and exerted himself but of course he said it is antoinette she cooks for me and calls me she dusts my rooms and brushes my boots she stirs the soup with one hand and manicures me with the other fancy not knowing antoinette she is fifty two by the time you are fifty two you ought to be known anywhere if she marries i shall die if i marry she will still live i hope now do tell me do you recommend me to marry doesn't it depend upon whom you marry not much do you think but perhaps you are married and so know are you married and would you mind telling me who you are as i have told you you never told me i guessed guess who i am seymour looked at her attentively she was a woman of about fifty with a shrewd face like a handsome monkey and his millinerish eyes saw that she was dressed without the slightest regard to expense i haven't the slightest idea he said but please don't tell me if you have any private reason for not wishing it to be known i can readily understand you would not like people to be able to say that you were seen dining with mama of course you are not english why do you think that because you talk it so well english people always talk it abominably but he looked at her again and a vague resemblance both in speech and in the shape of her head struck him i will guess he said you are a relation of nadine's quite right go on seymour was suddenly agitated and upset a glass of champagne that had just been filled he took not the slightest notice of this is it too much to hope that you are the aunt who who had so many snuff boxes he asked i mean the one to whom the emperor gave all those lovely snuff boxes or is it too good to be true just good enough she said how wildly exciting will you come back to my flat as soon as we can escape from this purgatory and antoinette shall manicure you do tell me about the snuff boxes i am sure they were beauties or you would not i mean the emperor would not have given you them of course not but i am afraid i can't come to your flat to night as i am going to a dance ask me another day i hear you have got some lovely jade and are going to make it the fashion then i suppose you will sell it seymour determined to insure his jade before countess eleanor entered his rooms for fear of its subsequently appearing that the austrian emperor had followed up his present of snuff boxes with a present of jade but he let no suspicion mar the cordiality of his tone yes that's the idea he said you see no younger son can possibly live in the way he has been brought up unless he has done something honest and commercial like that or cheats at bridge but that is so difficult i am told you have to learn bridge first and then go to a conjurer during which time you probably forget bridge again but otherwise you can't live at all unless you marry and the only thing left to do is to take to drink and die my brother took to it and lives said she i know but you are a very remarkable family a footman had wiped up the greater part of the champagne seymour had spilt and now stood waiting till he could speak to him her ladyship told me to tell you that you seemed to have had enough champagne my lord he said seymour paused for a moment and his face turned white with indignation tell her ladyship she is quite right he said and that the first sip i took of it was more than enough very good my lord and tell her that the fish was stale said seymour shrilly yes my lord and tell her began seymour again countess eleanor interrupted him you have sent enough pleasant messages for one time she said you can talk to your mother afterwards at present talk to me did you go to the wedding this morning yes seymour rather frequently allowed himself to be ruffled but he always calmed down again quickly it is so like mama to send a servant in the middle of dinner to say i am drunk he said but she will be sorry now look she is receiving my message and is turning purple that is satisfactory she looks unusually plain when she is purple yes i am describing the wedding for a lady's paper i shall get four guineas for it you do not look as if that would do you much good if you take four guineas often enough they they purify the blood said he though certainly the dose is homeopathic it is called the gold cure about the wedding i thought it was very vulgar and it was frightfully bourgeois in spirit it is very early victorian to marry a man who has waited for you since about but they will be very happy so are the bourgeoisie who change hats at least i should have to be frightfully happy to think of putting on anybody else's hat i recommend you not to eat that savory unless you have a bad cold that prevents your tasting anything shall i send another message to mama about it ah my dear young man said countess eleanor we are all common when we fall in love you will find yourself being common too some day and the people who are least bourgeois become the most common of all nadine for instance there is no one less bourgeoise than nadine but if she ever falls in love she will be so common that she will be perfectly sublime she will be the embodiment of humanity but she is not in love with that great boy next her who is so clearly in love with her dear me what beautiful sevres dessert plates i once collected sevres as well as snuff boxes did you did you get together a fine collection asked seymour pretty well it is easier to get snuff boxes my brother has some that used to be mine ah they are all getting up let me come to see your jade some other day nadine and esther escaped very soon after dinner from this dreadful party and went to seymour's flat where he had preceded them and was busy cooking with antoinette in the kitchen when they arrived he opened the door for them himself with his shirt sleeves rolled up above his elbows showing an extremely white and delicate skin round one wrist he wore a gold bangle i've left the kitchen door open he said so that the whole flat shall smell as strong as possible of cooking there is nothing so delicious when you are hungry we will open the windows afterwards you and esther must amuse yourselves for ten minutes and then supper will be ready oh may i come and cook too seymour asked nadine certainly not antoinette is the only woman in the world who knows how to cook you would make everything messy go and rock the cradle or rule the world or whatever you consider to be a woman's sphere until we are ready seymour disappeared again into the kitchen from which came rich cracklings and odors of frying and nadine turned to esther with a sigh my dear i have got remorse and world yearnings to night she said i attribute it to your mother's awful party but i daresay we shall all be better soon you know if i had asked hugh to let me come and cook he would have given me a golden spoon to stir with and eaten till he burst because i cooked it and i don't care he was so dear and so utterly impossible this evening i told him i wasn't going to the dance at the embassy and he said he should go in case i changed my mind and if it had been hugh cooking in there i should have gone and cooked too even if he hadn't wanted me to it's no use esther i can't marry hugh there's the end of it up till to night i have always wondered if i could now i know i can't i think i shan't see so much of him i shall miss him don't think i shan't miss him but i want to be fair to him as it is now whenever i am nice to him which i always am he thinks it means that i am beginning to love him whereas it doesn't mean anything whatever i wish people hadn't got into the habit of marrying each other but bought their babies at a shop instead and kissing is so disgusting the only person i ever like kissing is mama because her skin is so delicious and smells very faintly of raspberries hugh smells of cigarettes and soap darling nadine you haven't been kissing hugh have you asked esther yes i kissed him this evening when he was putting my cloak on but there were ninety five footmen there so it wasn't compromising we were heavily chaperoned and i would just as soon have kissed any of the other ninety five but he wanted me to and so i did and then suddenly i saw how unfair it was for me it didn't mean anything i kissed him just as i kiss my dog because he is such a duck also because he wanted me to which tobias never does he always cleans his face on the rug after i have kissed him and sneezes did he ask you to said esther not toby hugh no but i can see by a man's face when he wants i saw one of the footmen wanted too and perhaps i ought to have kissed him as well to show hugh it did not mean anything nadine sat down and spread her hands wide with a surprisingly dramatic gesture of innocence and despair it isn't my fault she said it's me c'est moi son' io i would translate it into all the languages of the world like the bible if that would make hugh understand people can't be different from what they are it's a grand mistake to suppose otherwise they can act and talk in accordance with what they are or they can act and talk otherwise but they the personalities are unchangeable except by miracles i could act contrary to my own self and marry hugh but it would be no particle of good i want him to understand that i can't love him and i am too fond of him to marry him without i wish to heaven he would marry somebody else he won't do that said esther i am afraid not i think it is rather selfish it is putting it all on me i shall have to marry somebody else i suppose and that will be very unselfish of me because i don't want to marry of course one has to i don't want to grow old but i shall have to grow old they are both laws of nature and perhaps neither the one nor the other is so disagreeable really esther gave her long appreciative sigh it would be too wonderful of you to marry somebody else in order to make it clear to hugh that you couldn't marry him she said it would be the most illustrious thing to do and it shows that really you are devoted to hugh but you really think that people don't change nadine not unless a moral earthquake happens and earthquakes are not to be expected only an upheaval of that kind makes any difference in the essential things their tastes change as their noses and hair change but the thing that sits behind like some beastly idol in a temple never moves and looks on at all that changes round it with the same wooden eyes oh dear i am so tired of myself and i can't get out of sight of myself nadine looked at herself in a louis seize mirror that hung above the fireplace and pointed a contemplative finger at the reflection of her pale loveliness i wish i was anything in the world except that thing she said i am genuine when i say that but having said that there is nothing else about me but what is intolerable but i am aware that i don't really care about anybody in the world the only thing that can be said for me is that i detest myself i wish i was like you esther because you care for me i wish i was like aunt eleanor because she cares for stealing i wish i was like daddy because he cares for old brandy you are all better off than i i envy anybody and everybody who cares for anybody with her heart no doubt having a heart is often a very great nuisance and often leads you to make a dreadful fool of yourself but it gets tedious to be wise and cool all the time like me seymour entered at this moment carrying a little silver censer with incense in it the smell of food is sufficiently strong he said and supper is ready also the smell of incense reminds one of stepping out of the blazing sunlight into st mark's at venice nadine you look too exquisite but depressed has not the effect of mama worn off yet oh it's not your mother it's me said she you think about yourself too much observed seymour i know the temptation so well and generally yield to it it is a great mistake one occasionally has doubts whether one is the nicest person in the world and whether it is worth while doing anything even collecting jade but such doubts never last long with me don't you ever wish you had a heart seymour she asked you and i have neither of us got hearts i know and i am so exceedingly comfortable without one that i should be sorry to get one if you have a heart sooner or later you get into a state of drivel about somebody who probably doesn't drivel about you that must be so mortifying even if two people drivel mutually they are deplorable objects but a solitary driveler is like a lonely cat on the tiles and is a positive nuisance poor hugh nadine you suit my wall paper quite exquisitely also it suits you don't let any of us go to bed to night but see the morning come the early morning is the color of a wood pigeon's breast and looks frightfully tired as if it had sat up all night too most people look perfectly hideous at that moment but i really don't believe you would do sit up and let me see i look the color of an oyster at dawn said esther it is just as if i had gone bad her brother looked at her thoughtfully yes my dear i can imagine your looking quite ghastly he said you had better go away before dawn it might make me seriously unwell i shall i shall go to the dance at the embassy i think madame tavita is so hideous that she makes me feel good looking for a week you always behave as if you were pretty which matters far more than being pretty said seymour it matters very little what people look like if they only behave as if they were venuses just as it does not matter how tall you are if you consistently look at a point rather above the head of the person you are talking to nadine was recovering a little under the influence of food that is quite true she said and if you want to look really rich you must be shabby or not wash your face seymour let us try and write a little book together 'fifty ways of appearing enviable' you should eat a great deal in order to make it appear you have a good digestion although you may be quite sick afterwards and refuse a great many invitations to show what a wild social success you are even though you dine all by yourself at home my dear what delicious food did you cook it or antoinette both we each threw in what we thought would be good and stirred it together i am sorry for people who are not greedy i am told that when you are old food and saving money are the only pursuits that don't pall at present food and spending money are particularly attractive and a piquancy is added if you haven't got any money and now we all feel better seymour had a piece of needlework which he often produced when he was staying with friends in order to irritate them he seldom worked at it when at home but to night he got it out in order to irritate his sister into going to the ball without delay for esther was always exasperated to a point almost beyond her control by the sight of her brother with his thimble and needle so before long she took her departure leaving nadine to follow which was seymour's design and he put the needlework back into its embroidered bag again i am afraid my methods are a little obvious he said but poor esther sees nothing but the most obvious hints you have to say things very loud and clear to her like the man in 'alice in wonderland' who was that asked nadine absently and what did you want esther to do to go away of course i wanted to talk to you nadine i have never known you look so beautiful as to night you look troubled too troubles make people feel plain but look beautiful nadine shifted her position so that she faced him yes do talk to me she said see if you can distract me a little from myself my mind hurts me seymour i wish i had a hard bright mind as some people have their minds are like i don't know what they are like i can't trouble to think to night how stupid are all the jinkings and monkey tricks we go through i have worn an inane smile all day and when i tried to read my plato it merely bored me nothing seems worth while and don't be commonplace and say that it is liver it is nothing of the sort would you be surprised if i burst into tears you have been thinking of the old 'un remarked seymour whom do you mean hugh of course do you know you are rather like a boy watching the struggle of a butterfly he has impaled you are sorry for it but you don't let it go he impaled himself said nadine well you gave him the pin but as you don't mean to marry him make that quite clear to him but how marry me said seymour chapter vi edith arbuthnot had conceived the idea an unhappy one as regards her family and neighbors that every one who aspired to the name of musician it is not too much to assert that she did should be able to play every instrument in the band just now she was learning the french horn and double bass simultaneously she kept her mind undistracted by the hideous noises she produced and expected others to do so thus unless she was practising some instrument that required the exclusive use of the mouth she would talk and did so while she learned just now she was seated on the terrace wall at winston which was of a convenient height for playing the double bass which rested on the terrace below and conversing at the top of her voice to dodo who sat a yard or two away these stentorian tones of course were necessary in order that she should be heard above the vibrating roar of the ill played strings she could not at present get much tone out of them but for volume it was as if all the bumblebees in the world were swarming in all the threshing machines in the world which were threshing everything else in the world i used to think you were heartless dodo she shouted but compared to nadine you are a sickly sentimentalist when dodo did not feel equal to shouting back she spoke in dumb show now she concisely indicated rot on her fingers it isn't rot shouted edith ah what a wonderful thing a double bass is i shall write a suite for the double bass unaccompanied i really mean it if you seemed to me without a heart nadine would seem to have an organ which is all that a heart is not very highly developed probably she inherited a tendency from you and has developed and cultivated it what do you say i said do stop that appalling noise darling screamed dodo i shall burst a blood vessel if i try to talk against it very well i must just play two or three scales said edith the hoarse clamor grew more and more vibrant and dodo stopped her ears eventually the bow as edith brought it down upon the first note of a new scale flew from her hands and describing a parabola in the air fell into a clump of sweet peas in the flower bed below the terrace i must learn not to do that she said it happened yesterday and i shan't consider myself proficient until i am safe not to hit the conductor in the face about nadine she is going to perpetrate the most horrible cruelty marrying that dreadful young man while hugh is just dying for her hugh reminds me of what jack was like dodo oh do you think so said dodo except that jack was once twenty five which is what hugh is now i don't see the smallest resemblance jack was so good looking and hugh only looks good and though hugh is a darling he is just a little slow and heavy which jack never was you will be able to compare them by the way because hugh is coming here this afternoon i asked him not to but he is coming just the same i told him nadine and seymour were both here perhaps he means to kill seymour said edith thoughtfully it certainly would be the obvious thing to do hughie would always do the obvious thing said dodo i will finish my sentence said edith it certainly would be the obvious thing to do provided that the public executioner would not hang him and that nadine would marry him but things would probably go the other way about which would not be so satisfactory for hugh really the young generation is very bloodless it talks more than we did but it does absolutely nothing we used to talk a good deal remarked dodo and we are not silent yet at least you and i are not edith has it ever struck you that you and i are middle aged or is middle age do you think not a matter of years but of inclination i think it must be for it is simply foolish to say that i am forty five though it would be simply untrue to say that i was anything else that is by the way we will talk of ourselves soon where had i got to oh yes hugh is coming down this afternoon though i implored him not to nadine says i was wrong she wants me to be very nice to him as she has been so horrid they have not seen each other for a whole week ever since her engagement was announced i am sure nadine misses him she will be miserable if hugh deserts her edith plucked impatiently at the strings of the double bass and aroused the bumblebees again that's what i mean by bloodless she said they are all suffering from anemia together their blood has turned to a not very high quality of gray matter in the brain nadine wants you to be kind to hugh because she has been so horrid dodo don't you see how fishlike that is and he since he can't marry her takes the post of valet de chambre and looks on while seymour gives her little butterfly kisses and small fragments of jade i saw him kiss her yesterday dodo it made me feel quite faint and weak and i had to hurry into the dining room and take half a glass of port it was the most debilitated thing i ever saw berts is nearly as bad and though he is nine feet high and plays cricket for his county he is somehow ladylike i can't think where he got it from certainly not from me and as for hugh i suppose he calls it faithfulness to hang about after nadine but i call it anemia i am surprised at hugh i should have thought he was sufficiently stupid to have more blood in him he ought to box nadine's ears kick seymour and instantly marry somebody else and have dozens of great red faced white toothed children bah dodo had subsided into hopeless giggles over this remarkable tirade against the anemic generation and edith plucked at her double bass again as she concluded with this exclamation of scorn and i can't think how you allow nadine to marry that that jade said edith dodo became momentarily serious if you were nadine's mother she said you would be delighted at her marrying anybody she is the sort of girl who doesn't want to marry and afterwards wishes she had i am not like that i was continually marrying somebody and then wishing i hadn't but nadine doesn't make mistakes she may do things that appear very odd but they are not mistakes she has thought it out very carefully first you see quite a quantity of eligible youths and several remarkably ineligible ones have wanted to marry her and she has never felt any dear me what is it a man with a small income always feels when a post with a large income is offered him oh yes a call nadine has never felt any call to marry any of them there are many girls like that in whom the physical makes very little appeal but what does appeal to nadine very strongly is the mental and seymour however many times you call him a jade is as clever as he can be in him also i should say the physical side is extremely undeveloped and so i think that he and nadine may be very happy now hugh is not clever at all he has practically no intellect and that to nadine is an insuperable defect now don't call her prig or blue stocking she is neither the one nor the other but she has a mind so have you so for that matter have i and it has led me to do weird things edith thrummed her double bass again dodo i can't tell you how i disapprove of you she said and how i love you you are almost entirely selfish and yet you have charm most utterly selfish people lose their charm when they are about thirty i made sure you would but i was quite wrong now i am utterly unselfish i live entirely for my husband and my art i live for him by seldom going near him since he is much happier alone but then i never had any charm at all now you have always lived and do still completely for your own pleasure dodo clapped her hands violently in edith's face for it required drastic measures to succeed in interrupting her ah that is an astonishingly foolish thing for you to say she said if i lived for my pleasure do you know what i should do i should have a hot bath go to bed and have dinner there i should then go to sleep and when i woke up i should go for a ride have another hot bath and another dinner and go to sleep again there is nothing so pleasant as riding and hot baths and food and sleep but i never have sought my pleasure what i always have sought is my happiness and that on the whole is our highest duty don't swear there is nothing selfish about it if you are made like i am because the thing that above all others makes me happy is to contrive that other people should have their own way that is why i never dream of interfering in what other people want if they really want it i do all i can to get it for them i was not ever thus as the hymn says but i am so now the longer i live the more clearly i see that it is impossible to understand why other people want what they want but it seems to me that all that concerns me is that they do want i can see how they want but never why i can't think darling for instance why you want to make those excruciating noises but i see how here's jack jack come and tell us about utopia edith had laid her double bass down on the ground of the terrace yes but i want to sit down he said may i sit on it edith edith screamed he took this as a sign that he might not and sat on the terrace wall utopia he asked you've got to be a man to begin with and then you have to marry dodo it does the rest what is it that which does it your consciousness dodo it would send up rents in utopia if seymour went to a nice girls' school he is rather silly and wants the nonsense knocked out of him but there you make a mistake said she almost every one who is nice is nice because the nonsense has not been knocked out of him people without heaps of nonsense are merely prigs indeed that is the best definition of a prig one who has lost his capability for nonsense look at edith she doesn't know she's nonsensical but she is and she thinks she is serious all the time with her great boots and her great double bass and her french horns oh me oh me the reasonable people in the world are the ruin of it they spoil the sunshine look at the abominable liberal party with terrible reasonable schemes for scullery maids they are all quite excellent and it is for that reason they are so hopeless it is moreover a great liberty to take with people to go about ameliorating them i should be furious if anybody wanted to ameliorate me darling bishop algie the other day said he always prayed for my highest good i begged him not to because if his prayers were answered providence might think i should be better for a touch of typhoid you can't tell what strange roundabout ways providence may have so he promised to stop praying for me because he is so understanding and knew what i meant but when lloyd george wants to give scullery maids a happy old age with a canary in the window it is even worse it is so sensible i can see them sitting dismally in the room listening to their canary when they would be much more comfortable in a nice work house with edith and me bringing them packets of tea and flannel don't let us talk politics there is nothing that saps the intellect so much edith and i have not talked much yet observed jack no you are listening to utopia which as i said consists largely of nonsense if you are to be happy you must play you must be ridiculous you must want everybody else to be ridiculous but everybody must take his own absurdities quite seriously dodo sat up pulled jack's cigarette case from his pocket and helped herself the greeks and romans were so right she said they had a slave class though with them it was an involuntary slave class we ought to have a voluntary slave class consisting of all the people who like working for a cause there are heaps of politicians who naturally belong to it and clergymen and lawyers and nationalists all the people in fact who die when they retire and are disappointed when they have not got offices and churches to go to you can recognize a slave the moment you see him he always socially wants to open the door or shut the window or pick up your gloves the moment you see that look in a man's eye that sort of itch to be useful you should be able to give secret information and make him a slave at l a year instead of making him a cabinet minister or a bishop or a director of a company he wants work let him have it edith darling you would be a slave instantly and the state would provide you with double basses and cornets i haven't thought it all completely out since it only occurred to me this minute but it seems to me an almost painfully sound scheme now that i mention it think of the financiers you would get there would be poor mr carnegie and rockefeller and and the whole of the rothschild house and barings and speyers all quite happy because they are happy when they work and all the millions they make how they make it i don't know unless they buy gold cheap and sell it dear which i believe is really what they do all the money they make would be at the disposal of those who know how to spend it i suppose i am a socialist edith put her forehead in her hands i don't know what you are talking about she said i have my doubts myself said dodo ingenuously it began about nadine's marriage and then drifted you get to all sorts of strange places if you drift both morally and physically it really seems very unfair that if you don't ever resist anything you go to the bad it looks as if evil was stronger than good but algie shall explain it to me he can explain almost anything including wasps jack dear do make me stop talking you and the sunshine and edith have gone to my head and given me the babbles i insist on your going on talking said edith i want to know how you can let nadine marry without love because a great many of our unfortunate sex dear never fall in love as i mean it at all but i would not have them not marry they often make excellent wives and mothers and i think nadine is one of those she is as nearly in love with hugh as she has ever been with anybody but she quite certainly will not marry him here she is i daresay she will explain it all herself my darling come and talk matrimony shop to edith jack and i are going for a short ride before lunch will you be in when hugh comes nadine sat down in the chair from which dodo had risen she was dressed in a very simple linen dress of cornflower blue that made the whites and pinks of her face look absolutely dazzling yes i will wait for him she said seymour thought it would be kinder if he went to meet him at the station so that hughie could get rid of some of the hate on the way up he has perception des apercus tres fins and i will explain anything to anybody in the interval i want to be married and so does seymour and we think it will answer admirably if we marry each other there is very little else to say we are not foolish about each other i find you are extremely modern interrupted edith you speak as if you did not like that said nadine but surely somebody has got to be modern if we are going to get on at all otherwise the world remains stock still or goes back i do not think it would be amusing to be victorian again indeed there would be no use in us trying we should be such obvious forgeries seymour particularly i consider it lucky that he was not born earlier if he had grown up as he is in victorian days they would certainly have done away with him somehow or his mother would have exposed him in battersea park like oedipus edith leaned over the terrace wall and took the double bass bow out of the tall clump of sweet peas there are exactly two things in the world worth doing she said to love and to work certainly you don't work nadine and i don't believe you love nadine looked at her a moment in silent hostility that is a very comfortable reflection she observed for you who like working better than anything else in the world except perhaps golf i wonder you did not say there were three things in the world worth doing making that damned game the third edith had spoken with her usual cock sure breezy enthusiasm and looked up surprised at a certain venom and bitterness that underlay the girl's reply my dear nadine she said what is the matter nadine glared at her a moment and then broke into rapid speech do you think i would not give the world to be able to love she said do you think i send hugh marching through hell for fun you say i am heartless as if it was my fault would you go to a blind man in the street and say 'you beast you brute why don't you see' is he blind for fun am i like this for fun she got up from her seat and came and stood in front of edith flushed with an unusual color and continued more rapidly yet emphasizing her points by admirable gesticulations of her hands indeed they seemed to have speech on their own account they were extraordinarily eloquent do you know you make me lose my temper she said that is a rare thing with me i seldom lose it but when i do it is quite gone and i don't care what i say so long as it is what i mean for the minute my temper is absolutely vanished and i shall make the most of its absence who are you to judge and condemn me and give me rules for conduct how work and love are the only things worth doing what do you know about me either you are absolutely ignorant about me or so stupid that the very cabbages seem clever by you and you go telling me what to do and what do you know about love to look at you as little as you know about me yes no wonder you sit there with your mouth open staring at me you and your foolish great fat bellied bloated violin you are not accustomed to be spoken to like this it never occurred to you that i would give the world to be able to love as jill and polly and mary and minnie love i do not go about saying that any more than a cripple calls attention to his defect he tries to be brave and conceal it but that is me a dwarf a hunchback a cretin of the soul that is the matter with me and you are so foolish that it never occurred to you that i wanted to be like other people you thought it was a pose of which i was proud i think there now do not do that again nadine paused and then sighed i feel better she said but quite red in the face however i have got my temper back again if you like i will apologize for losing it edith jumped up and kissed nadine when she intended to kiss anybody she did it whether the victim liked it or not my dear you are quite delightful she said i thoroughly deserve every word i was utterly ignorant of you but i am not stupid if you will go on you will find i shall understand suddenly nadine felt utterly lonely all she had said of herself in her sudden exasperation was perfectly genuine and now when her equanimity returned she felt as if she must tell somebody about this isolation which for the moment in any case was sincerely and deeply hers that she was a girl of a hundred moods was quite true but it was equally true that each mood was authentically inspired from within many of them no doubt were far from edifying but none could be found guilty of the threadbare tawdriness of pose she nodded at edith it is as i say she said i hate myself but here i am and here soon will hugh be it is a disease this heartlessness i suffer from it it is rather common too but commoner among girls than boys then queerly and unexpectedly but still honestly her intellectual interest in herself that cold egoism that was characteristic of another side of her awoke yet it is interesting she said because it is out of this sort of derangement that types and species come for a million years the fish we call the sole had a headache because one of its eyes was slowly traveling through its head for a million years man was uncomfortable where the tail once came because it was drying up for a million years there will be girls like me poor wretches and at the end there will be another type of woman a third sex perhaps who from not caring about these things which nature evidently meant them to care about have become different and all the boys like seymour will be approximating to the same type from the other side so that eventually we shall be like the angels my dear why angels asked edith neither marrying nor giving in marriage la la and i was saying only the other day to him that i wished to marry half a dozen men what a good thing that one does not feel the same every day it would be atrociously dull but in the interval it is lonely now and then for those of us who are not exactly and precisely of the normal type of girl but if you have no heart you have to follow your intelligence to go where your intelligence leads you and then wave a flag perhaps nobody sees it or only the wrong sort of person who says 'what is that idiot girl waving that rag for' but she only waves it because she is lost and hopes that somebody will see it nadine laughed with her habitual gurgle we are all lost she said but we want to be found it is only the stupidest who do not know they are lost well i have what is hugh's word ah yes i have gassed enough for one morning ah and there is the motor coming back from the station i am glad that hugh has not thrown seymour out and driven forwards and backwards over him the motor at this moment was passing not more than a couple of hundred yards off through the park which lay at the foot of the steep garden terraces below them from there the road wound round in a long loop towards the house i shall go to meet hugh at once and get it over said nadine and thereupon she whistled so shrilly and surprisingly on her fingers that hugh who was driving looked up and saw her over the terrace she made staccato wavings to him and he got out you whistled the octave of b in alt remarked edith appreciatively and my courage is somewhere about the octave of b in profundis said nadine i dread what hugh may say to me i will go and talk to him said edith i understand you now nadine i will tell him nadine smiled very faintly that is sweet of you she said but i am afraid it wouldn't be quite the same thing nadine walked down the steep flight of steps in the middle of the terrace and out through the venetian gate into the park hugh had just arrived at it from the other side and they met there no word of greeting passed between them they but stood looking at each other he saw the girl he loved neither more nor less than that and did not know if she looked well or ill or if her gown was blue or pink or rainbowed to him it was nadine who stood there but she saw details not being blinded he was big and square he looked a picture of health brown eyed clear of skin large mouthed with a habit of smiling written strongly there he had taken off his hat as was usual with him and as usual his hair looked a little disordered as if he had been out on a windy morning there was that slight thrusting outwards of his chin which suggested that he would meet argument with obstinacy but that kind and level look from his eyes that suggested an honesty and kindliness hardly met with outside the charming group of living beings known as dogs he was like a big kind dog polite to strangers kind to friends hopelessly devoted to the owner of his soul but to day his mouth did not indulge its habit he was quite grave why did you kiss me the other night he said nadine had already repented of that rash act being conscious of her own repentance it seemed to her rather nagging of him to allude to it i meant nothing she said hughie are we going to stand like posts here shan't we stroll i don't see why let us stand like posts you did kiss me or do you kiss everybody nadine considered this for a moment no i don't kiss everybody she said i never kissed a man before it was stupid of me the moment after i had done it i wanted to kiss anybody to show you it didn't mean anything you are like the inquisition my next answer is that i have kissed seymour since i i don't particularly like kissing him but it is usual and you are going to marry him nadine's courage which she had confessed was a b in profundis sank into profundissima yes i am going to marry him she said why you don't love him and he doesn't love you i don't love anybody said nadine quickly i have said that so often that i am tired of saying it girls often marry without being in love it just happens what do you want would you like me to go on spinstering just because i won't marry you that i will not do you know why you love me i can't marry you unless i love you ah mon dieu it sounds like ollendorf but i should be cheating you if i married you and i will not cheat you you would expect from me what you bring to me and it would be right that i should bring it you and i cannot if you didn't love me like that i would marry you to morrow and the trousseau might go and hang itself mama would give me some blouses and stockings and you would buy me a tooth brush yes this is very flippant but when serious people are goaded they become flippant oh hughie i wish i was different but i am not different and what is it you came down here about is it to ask me again to marry you and to ask me not to marry my dear little seymour little he asked it was a term of endearment besides it is not his fault that he does not weigh fourteen stones stone said he with the tremor of a smile no stones said nadine i choose that it should be stones fourteen great square lumps hughie don't catch my words up and correct me i am serious and all you can answer is 'stone' instead of 'stones' i did it without thinking he said i only fell back into the sort of speech there used to be between us it was like that serious one moment and silly the next i spoke without thinking as we used to speak i won't do it again and why not demanded nadine because now that you tell me you really are going to marry seymour everything is changed between us this is what i came to tell you i am not going to hang about a mixture between a valet and an ami de la maison you have chosen now when you refused me before there was always in my mind the hope that some day you would give me a different answer i waited long and patiently and willingly for that chance now the chance no longer exists you have scratched me nadine drew her eyebrows together scratched you she said oh i see a race not nails and i am definitely and finally out of it you mean you are no longer among my friends asked nadine i shall not be with you so much or so intimately we must talk over it just this once we will stroll if you like it is too hot for you standing in the sun without a hat no we will settle it here and now said she quickly you don't understand my marriage with seymour will make no difference in the quality of affection i have always had for you why should i give up my best friend why should you because you are much more than my best friend and i am obliged to give up at last that idea of you you have forced me to see that it is not to be realized and i won't sit about your house to have people pointing at me and saying to each other 'that's the one who is so frightfully in love with her' it may sound priggish but i don't choose to be quite so unmanly as that nor would you much respect me if i did so choose but i never did respect you said nadine quickly i never thought of you as respectable or otherwise it doesn't come in you may steal and cheat at cards and i shall not care i like whom i like i like you tremendously what do you mean you are going to do go to burmah or bengal i don't want to lose you hughie it is unkind of you besides we shall not marry for a long time yet and even then ah it is the old tale the old horror called me all over again i don't love anybody many are delightful and i am so fond of them but the other the absorption the gorgeous foolishness of it all it is away outside of me a fairy tale and i am grown up now and say 'for me it is not true' hugh came a step nearer her you poor devil he said gently tears as yet unshed gathered in nadine's eyes they were fairly creditable tears they were not at any rate like the weepings of the great prig prince and compounded merely of languor and self pity but sorrow for hugh was one ingredient in them yet in the main they were for herself since the only solvent for egoism is love yes i am that she said i'm a poor devil i'm lost as i said to that foolish arbuthnot woman with her feet and great violin hark she is playing it again she is a big 'c major' she has been scolding me though if it comes to that i gave it her back with far more gamin in my tongue and now you say you will not be friends any longer and mama does not like my marrying seymour though she does not argue and there is no one left but myself and i hate myself oh i am lost and i wave my flags and there is no one who sees or understands i shall go back to daddy i think and he and i will drink ourselves drunk and i shall have the red nose but you are the worst of them all hugh it is a very strange sort of love you have for me if all it can do is to desert me and yet the other day i felt as you feel i felt it would only be fair to you to see you less i am a damned weathercock i go this way and that but the wind is always cold i am sorry for you i want you to be happy i would make you happy myself if i could nadine's eyes had quite overflowed and as she poured out this remarkable series of lamentations she dabbed at her moistened cheeks yet hugh though he was so largely to blame as it seemed for this emotion and though all the most natural instincts in him longed to yield knew that deep in him his determination was absolutely unsoftened it and his love for nadine were of the quality of nether mill stones but all the rest of him longed to comfort her oh nadine don't cry he said i'm not worth crying about to begin with it is not you alone i cry about said nadine with justice i cry a little for you every third drop is for you the rest is quite for myself it is never worth while to cry for oneself he said who wants it to be worth while i feel like crying therefore i cry hardly anything i do is worth while yet i go on doing and i get tired of it before it is done already i am tired of crying and besides it gives me the red nose without going to daddy not you and i together are worth making myself ugly for but you are so disagreeable hughie first i wanted to stroll and you said 'no' and then when i didn't want to stroll you said 'yes' and you aren't going to be friends with me and i feel exactly as i used to feel when i was six years old and it rained come let us sit down a little and you shall tell me what you mean to do and how it will be between us i will be very good i will bless any plan you make like a bishop it shall all be as you will i owe you so much and there is no way by which i can ever repay you i don't want to be a curse to you hughie i don't indeed she sat down leaning against a great beech trunk and he lay on the coarse meadow grass beside her i know you don't he said he looked at her steadily as she finished mopping her cheeks her little burst of tears had not made her nose at all red it had but given a softness to her eyes never before had he so strongly felt her wayward irresistible charm which it was so impossible to analyse or explain indeed if it came to analysis there were strange ingredients there there was egoism as complete and yet as disarming as that of a persian kitten there was the unreasonableness of a spoilt child there was the inconsiderateness and unreliability of an april day which alternates its gleams of the saffron sun of spring with cold rain and plumping showers yet he felt that there was something utterly adorable wholly womanly that lay sheathed in these more superficial imperfections something that stirred within them conscious of the coming summer just as the life embalmed within the chrysalis stirs giving token of the time when the husk shall burst and that which was but a gray crawling thing shall be wafted on wings of silver emblazoned with scarlet and gold then there was her beauty too which drew his eyes after the wonder of its perfection and was worthy of the soul that he divined in her and finally and this perhaps to him was the supreme magnet there was the amazing and superb quality of her vitality that sparkled and effervesced in all she did and said so that for him her speech was like song or light and to be with her was to be bathed in the effulgence of her spirit and hugh looking at her now felt as always that his self slipped from him so that he was conscious of her only she possessed him and he lay like the sea with the dazzle of sunlight on it that both reflects the radiance and absorbs it then he sat up and half turned from her for there were things to be said yet that he could scarcely say while he looked at her i know you don't mean to be a curse to me he said and you couldn't be if you tried whatever you did and you are going to do a pretty bad thing now in marrying that chap must be almost insignificant compared to the love which you have made exist in me he paused a moment i have thought it all out he said but it is difficult and you must give me time i'm not quick like you as you know very well but sometimes i get there it is like this she was watching him and listening to him with a curious intentness and nervousness as a prisoner about to receive sentence may watch the judge her hands clasped and unclasped themselves her breath came short and irregular it seemed as if she for once had failed to understand him whom she had said she knew too fatally well just now at any rate and on this topic it was clear she did not know what he was going to propose yet it was scarcely a proposal she waited for she waited for his word his ultimatum till now she had dominated him completely with her quick wit her far more subtle intelligence her beauty her vitality but for once now he was her master she felt she had to bow to his simplicity and his uncomplicated strength his brute virility it was but faintly that she recognized it the recognition came to her consciousness but as an echo but the voice that made the echo came from within i have received my dismissal from you he said as head of your house as your possible husband as i said i won't take the place of the tame cat instead god knows i don't want to cut adrift from you and i can't cut adrift from you but my aspiration is rendered impossible and therefore both my mental attitude to you and my conduct must be altered i daresay berts and tommy and esther and all the rest of them will go lying about on your bed and smoking in your bedroom just as before well i can't be intimate in that sort of way any longer you said you never reckoned whether you respected me or not and that may be so but without wanting to be heavy about it i have got to respect myself i can't help being your lover but i can help tickling my love so to speak making it squirm and wriggle whether i am respectable or not it is and i shan't as i said i shan't tickle it also though i would be hurt in any other way for your sake i won't be hurt like that don't misunderstand me it is because my love for you is not one atom abated that i won't play tricks with it but when it says to me 'i can't bear it' i shall not ask to bear it you always found me too easy to understand i think this is another instance of it he paused a moment and nadine gave a little sobbing sigh oh hughie she began no don't interrupt he said i want to go through with it without discussion there is no discussion possible i wouldn't argue with god about it i should say 'you made me an ordinary human man and you've got to take the consequences in the same way you have chosen seymour and i am telling you what is the effect now you are tired of hearing it i love you and therefore i want your happiness without reservation you have decided it will conduce to your happiness to marry seymour therefore nadine this is quite simple and true i want you to do so i may rage and storm on the surface but essentially i don't somewhere behind all i may say and do there is as you once said to me the essential me well that says to you 'god bless you' that's all he unclasped his hands from round his knees and stood up i'm going away now he said i thought when i came down it might take a long time to tell you this but it has taken ten minutes only i thought perhaps you would have a lot to say about it and i daresay you have but i find that it doesn't concern me don't think me brutal any more than i think you brutal i am made like this and you are made otherwise by all means let us see each other often i hope but not just yet i've got to adjust myself you see and you haven't you never loved me and so what you have done makes no difference in your feelings towards me but i've got to get used to it she looked up at him as he stood there in front of her with the green lights through the beech leaves playing on him you make me utterly miserable hugh she said no i don't there is no such thing as misery without love you don't care for me in the way that you could could give you the privilege of being miserable for one half second she did not follow him but immediately the quickness of her mind grasped what came so easily and simply to him ah i see she said her intelligence leading her away from him by the lure of the pleasure of perception when you are like that it is even a joy to be miserable is that so yes i suppose that is it your misery is a a wireless message from your love bad news perhaps but still a communication she got up ah my dear she said that must be so i never thought of it but i can infer that you are right somehow you are quickened hughie you are giving me a series of little shocks you were never quite like that before i was always exactly like that he said i have told you nothing that i have not always known again her brilliant egoism asserted itself then it is i who am quickened she said there is nothing that quickens me so much as being hurt it makes all your nerves awake and active yes you have hurt me and you are not sorry i do not mind being hurt if it makes me more alive ah the only point of life is to be alive if life was a crown of thorns how closely i would press it round my head so that the points wounded and wounded me it is so shallow just to desire to be happy i do not care whether i am happy or not so long as i feel give me all the cancers and consumptions and decayed teeth and gout and indigestion and necrosis of the spine and liver if there is such a thing so that i may feel i don't feel it is that which ails me i have a sane body and a sane mind and i am tired of sanity kick me hughie strike me spit at me make me angry and disgusted anything oh anything i want to feel and i want to feel about you most particularly and i can't and there is edith playing on her damned double bass again i hear it i am conscious of it and it is only the things that don't matter which i am conscious of i am conscious of your brown eyes my dear and your big mouth and your trousers and boots and the cow that is wagging its tail and looking at us as if it was going to be sick its dinner i remember goes into its stomach and then comes up again and then it becomes milk or a calf or something it has nine stomachs or is it a cat that has nine lives or nine tails i am sure about nine oh hughie i see the outside aspect of things and i can't get below i am a flat stone that you send to make chickens is it no ducks and drakes over a pond flop flop the foolish thing and somehow you with your stupidity and your simplicity you go down below and drown and stick in the mud and are so uncomfortable and miserable and i am sorry for you i hate you to be uncomfortable and miserable and oh i envy you you suffer and are kind and don't envy and are not puffed up and i envy your misery and am puffed up because i am so desirable and i don't really suffer you are quite right and i am not kind hugh i can't bear that cow drive it away it will eat me and make milk of me and there look are mama and papa jack coming back from their ride papa jack loves her his face is like a face in a spoon when he looks at her and i know she is learning to love him she no longer thinks when she is talking to him as to whether he will be pleased that is a sure sign she is beginning to be herself at her age too she doesn't think about thinking about him any more it comes naturally and i am not myself i am something else rather i am nothing else i am nothing at all just some intelligence and some flesh and blood and bones i am not a real person it is that which is the matter i long to be a real person and i can't i crawl sideways over other things like a crab i wave my pincers and pinch i am lost i am nothing and yet i know how horribly i know it there is something behind more than the beastly idol with the wooden eye which is all i know of my real self if only i could find it if only i could crack myself up like a nut and get to a kernel for god's sake hughie take the nut crackers and crack me it is idle to ask you to do it you have tried often enough you will have to get a stronger nut cracker meantime i am a nut just a nut with its hard bright shell seymour is another nut there we shall be hugh caught her by the wrists i can't stand it nadine he said you feel nothing for him he is nothing to you how can you marry him it's profane it's blasphemous you say you can give nothing to anybody well make the best of yourself i can give all i am to you isn't that better than absolute nil you can't give but let me give it's worship it's all there is she stood there with her wrists in his hands his strong fingers bruising and crushing them she could have screamed for the pain of it no and a thousand times no she said i won't cheat i ask you to cheat and i won't hughie dear press harder hurt me more so that you may see i am serious you may bite the flesh off me you may strangle me and i will stand quite still and let you do it but i won't marry you i won't cheat you my will is stronger than your body and i would die sooner then your marriage is a pure farce said he come and laugh at it she said chapter vii hugh's intention had been to stay several days at the least with the chesterfords and he had brought down luggage that would last any reasonable person a fortnight unluckily he had not foreseen the very natural effect that the sight of seymour would have on him and as soon as lunch was over he took his hostess into a corner and presented the situation with his usual simplicity it is like this aunt dodo he said i didn't realize exactly what it meant to me till i saw seymour again he drove me up from the station and it got worse all the time i thought perhaps since nadine had chosen him i might see him differently i think perhaps i do but it is worse it is quite hopeless the best thing i can do is to go away again at once dodo had lit two cigarettes by mistake and since during their ride jack had wantonly so she thought accused her of wastefulness she was smoking them both holding one in each hand in alternate whiffs but she threw one of them away at this and laid her hand on hugh's knee i know my dear and i am so dreadfully sorry she said i was sure it would be so and that's why i didn't want you to come here i knew it was no good i can see you feel really unwell whenever you catch sight of seymour or hear anything he says and about nadine did you have a nice talk with her hugh considered i don't think i should quite call it nice he said i think i should call it necessary anyhow we have had it and and i quite understand her now as that is so i shall go away again this afternoon it was a mistake to come at all yes but probably it was a necessary mistake in certain situations mistakes are necessary i mean whatever one does seems to be wrong if you had stopped away you would have felt it wrong too and will you answer two questions aunt dodo he asked yes i will certainly answer them if they are very awkward ones i may not answer them quite truthfully well i'll try do you approve of nadine's marriage has it your blessing yes my dear truthfully it has but it is right to tell you that i give my blessings rather easily and when it is clearly no use attempting to interfere in a matter it is better to bless it than curse it but if you ask me whether i would have chosen seymour as nadine's husband out of all the possible ones why i would not i thought at one time that perhaps it was going to be jack but then jack chose me and as we all know a girl may not marry her stepfather particularly if her mother is alive and well but i should not have chosen you either hughie if your question implies that i used to think i would but when nadine explained to me the other day i rather agreed with her of course she has explained to you hugh looked at her with his honest trustworthy brown eyes several times he said but if i agreed i shouldn't be worrying now another question do you think she will be happy yes up to her present capacity if i did not think she would be happy i would not bless it dear edith for example thinks it is a shocking and terrible marriage for her i daresay it would be but then it isn't she whom seymour proposed to marry they would be a most remarkable couple would they not i think edith would kill him with the intention of committing suicide after and then determine that there had been enough killing for one day and the next day suicide would appear quite out of the question so she would write a funeral march dodo held the admirable sensible view that if discussion on a particular topic is hopeless it is much better to abandon it and talk as cheerfully as may be about something different but this entertaining diversion altogether failed to divert hugh you said she would be happy up to her present capacity he reminded her yes that is simple is it not we develop our capacity for happiness and misery also develops as well whether nadine's capacity will develop much i cannot tell if it does she may not be happy up to it but who knows we cannot spend our lives in arranging for contingencies that may never take place and changes in ourselves that may never occur dodo looked in silence for a moment at his grave reliable face and felt a sudden wonder at nadine for having chosen as she had done and yet her reason for rejecting this extremely satisfactory youth was sound enough their intellectual levels were such miles apart but dodo though she did not express her further thought had it very distinct in her mind if she does develop emotionally like a woman she said to herself there will not be a superfluity of happiness about and she will look at you and wonder how she could have refused you but necessarily she did not say this and hugh got up well then at the risk of appearing a worse prig than john sturgis he said i may tell you that as long as nadine is happy the main object is accomplished my own happiness consists so largely in the fact of hers dear me i wonder you are not sick at my sententiousness i am quite too noble to live but i don't really want to die would it make nadine happier if i told seymour i should be a brother to him dodo laughed no hughie it would make her afraid that your brain had gone or that you were going to be ill it would only make her anxious is the motor around i am sorry you are going but i think you are quite right to do so always propose yourself whenever you feel like it i don't feel like it at present said he but thanks awfully aunt dodo dodo felt extremely warmly towards this young man who was behaving so very well and simply god bless you dear hugh she said and give you your heart's desire at present my heart's desire appears to be making other plans for itself said hugh esther had said once in a more than usually enlightened moment that nadine's friends did her feeling for her and she observed them and put what they felt into vivacious and convincing language and applied it to herself certainly hugh when he drove away again this afternoon was keenly conscious of what nadine had talked about to edith he felt lost and the flag he had industriously waved so long for her seemed to be entirely disregarded he hardly knew what he had hoped would have come of this ill conceived visit which had just ended so abruptly but a vague sense of nadine's engagement being too nightmare like to be true had prompted him to go in person and find out also it had seemed to him that when he was face to face with nadine asking her at point blank range whether she was going to marry seymour it was impossible that she should say yes something different must assuredly happen either she would say it was a mistake or something inside him must snap but there was no mistake about it and nothing had snapped the world proposed to proceed just as usual and he could not decline to proceed with it unless you died you were obliged to proceed however intolerable the journey however unthinkable the succession of days through which you were compelled to pass life was like a journey in an express train with no communication cord you were locked in and could not stop the train by any means some people of course threw themselves out of the window so to speak and made violent ends to themselves but suicide is only possible to people of a certain temperament and hugh was incapable of even contemplating such a step he felt irretrievably lost profoundly wretched and yet quite apart from the fact that he was temperamentally incapable of even wishing to commit suicide the fact that nadine was in the world whatever nadine was going to do made it impossible to think of quitting it that was the manner and characteristic of his love his own unhappiness meant less to him than the fact of her until she had suggested it the thought of traveling had not occurred to him now as he waited for his train at the station he felt that at all costs he wanted to be on the move to be employed in getting away from the intolerable anywhere that he might happen to be in wherever he was it seemed that any other place would be preferable and this he supposed was the essence of the distraction that travel is supposed to give his own rooms in town he felt would be soaked with associations of nadine so too would be the houses where he would naturally spend those coming months of august and september not till october when his duties as a clerk in the foreign office called him back to town had he anything with which he felt he could occupy himself an exceptional capacity for finding days too short and few even though they had no duties to make the hours pass had hitherto been his only brilliance now all gift of the kind seemed to have been snatched from him he could not conceive what to do with to morrow or the next day or any of the days that should follow an allowance of seven days to the week seemed an inordinate superfluity he was filled with irritation at the thought of the leisurely march of interminable time he spent the evening alone feeling that he was a shade less intolerable to himself than anybody else would have been also he felt incapable of the attention which social intercourse demands his mind seemed utterly out of his control as unable to remain in one place as his body even if he thought of nadine it wandered and he would notice that a picture hung crooked and jump up to straighten it one such was a charming water color sketch by esther of the beach at meering with a splash of sunlight low in the west that shining through a chimney in the clouds struck the sea very far out and made there a little island of reflected gold esther had put in this golden islet with some reluctance she had said that even in nature it looked unreal and would look even more unreal in art especially when the artist happened to be herself but nadine had voted with hugh on behalf of the golden island just because it would appear unreal and incredible it is only the unreal things that are vivid to us she had said and the incredible things are just those which we believe in isn't that so hughie how well he remembered her saying that her voice rang in his ears like a haunting tune and while esther made this artistic sacrifice to the god of things as they are not he and nadine strolled along the firm sandy beach shining with the moisture of the receding tide she had taken his arm and just as her voice now sounded in his ears so he could feel the pressure of her hand on his coat you live among unrealities she said although you are so simple and practical you are thinking now that some day you and i will go to live on that golden island but there is no island really it is just like the rest of the sea only the sun shines on it the bitter truth of that struck him now as applied to her and himself though she had refused him before the sun shone on those days and not until she had engaged herself to seymour did the gold fade not until to day when he had definite confirmation of that from her own lips had he really believed in her rejection of him he well knew her affection for him he believed and rightly that if she had been asked to name her best friend she would have named none other than himself it had been impossible for him not to be sanguine over the eventual outcome and he had never really doubted that some day her affection would be kindled into flame he had often told himself that it was through him that she would discover her heart as she had suggested he would some day crack the nut for her and show her her own kernel and she would find it was his and now all those optimisms were snuffed out he had completely to alter and adjust his focus but that could not be done at once to night he peered out as it were upon familiar scenes and found that his sight of them was misty and blurred the whole world had vanished in cold gray mists he was lost quite lost and and there was a letter for him on the table which he had not noticed the envelope was obviously of cheap quality and was of those proportions which suggest a bill a bill it was from a bookseller of four shillings and sixpence incurred over a book nadine had said she wanted to read he had passed the bookseller's on his way home immediately afterwards and of course he had ordered it for her she had not cared for it she had found it unreal the man is meant to arouse my sympathy she had said and only arouses my intense indifference i am acutely uninterested in what happens to him hugh felt as if she had been speaking of himself but the moment after knew that he did her an injustice even now he could not doubt the sincerity of her affection for him but there was something frozen about it it was like sleet and he like a parched land longed for the pity of the soft rain hugh had a wholesome contempt for people who pity themselves and it struck him at this point that he was in considerable danger of becoming despicable in his own eyes he had been capable of sufficient manliness to remove himself from nadine that afternoon but his solitary evening was not up to that standard he might as well have remained at winston if he was to endorse his refusal to dangle after her with nothing more virile than those drawling sentimentalities she was not for him he had made this expedition to day in order to convince himself on that point and already his determination was showing itself unstable if it suffered him to dangle in mind though not in body and yet how was it possible not to nadine physically and tangibly was certainly going to pass out of his life but to eradicate her from his soul would be an act of spiritual suicide physically there was no doubt that he would continue to exist without her spiritually he did not see how existence was possible on the same terms but he need not drivel about her there were always two ways of behaving after receiving a blow which knocked you down and the one that commended itself most to hugh was to get up again lady ayr at the end of the london season had for years been accustomed to carry out some innocent plan for the improvement and discomfort of her family one year she dragged them along the castles by the loire another she forced them as if by pumping through the picture galleries of holland and this summer she proposed to show them a quantity of the english cathedrals these abominable pilgrimages were made pompously and economically they stayed at odious inns where she haggled and bargained with the proprietors but on the other hand she informed the petrified vergers and custodians whom she conducted rather than was conducted by round the cathedrals or castles in their charge that she was the marchioness of ayr was directly descended from the occupants of the finest and most antique tombs that the castle in question had once belonged to her family or that the gem of the holbeins represented some aunt of hers in bygone generations here pomp held sway but economy came into its own again over the small silver coin with which she rewarded her conductor on english lines she had a third class carriage reserved for her and beguiled the tedium of journeys by reading aloud out of guide books an account of what they had seen or what they were going to visit generally they put up at temperance hotels and she made a point of afternoon tea being included in the exiguous terms at which she insisted on being entertained john aided and abetted her in those tours exhibiting an ogreish appetite for all things gothic and mental improvement and her husband followed her with a white umbrella and sat down as much as possible esther's part in them was that of a resigned and inattentive martyr and she fired off picture postcards of the places they visited to nadine and others with this is a foul hole or the beastliest inn we have struck yet written on them while seymour revenged himself on the discomforts inflicted on him by examining his mother as to where they had seen a particular rose window or portrait by rembrandt and then by the aid of a guide book proving she was wrong why none of them revolted and refused to go on these annual journeys now that they had arrived at adult years they none of them exactly knew any more than they knew why they went when summoned to their mother's dreadful dinner parties and it must be supposed that there was a touch of the inevitable about such diversions you might grumble and complain but you went this year the tour was to start with the interesting city of lincoln and the party assembled on the platform at king's cross at an early hour the plan was to lunch in the train so as to start sight seeing immediately on arrival and continue with a short excursion to the hotel in order to have the tea which had been included in the terms until the fading light made it impossible to distinguish ancestral tombs or norman arches lady ayr had not seen seymour since his engagement and as she ate rather grisly beef sandwiches she gave him her views on the step though they were all together in one compartment the conversation might be considered a private one for lord ayr was sleeping gently in one corner john was absorbed in the account of the roman remains at lincoln lindum colonia as he had already announced and esther with a slightly leaky stylograph was writing a description of their depressing journey to nadine what you are marrying on seymour i don't know she said neither your father nor i will be able to increase your allowance and nadine waldenech has the appearance of being an expensive young woman i hope she realizes she is marrying the son of a poor man and that we go third class she is aware of all that said seymour wiping his long white finger tips on an exceedingly fine cambric handkerchief after swallowing a sandwich or two and we are marrying really on her money i am not sure that i approve of that said his mother the remedy is obvious remarked seymour you can increase my allowance i have no objection mother would you kindly let me throw the rest of that sandwich out of the window it makes me ill to look at it we are not talking about sandwiches why do you not earn some money like other younger sons i do i earned four pounds last week with describing your party and other things and there is my embroidery as well which i shall work at more industriously i shall do embroidery in the evening after dinner while nadine smokes lady ayr looked out of the window and pointed magisterially to the towers of some great church in the town through which the train was passing peterborough she said we shall see peterborough on our way back peterborough john ayr and esther we are passing through peterborough esther looked out upon the mean backs of houses the sooner we pass through peterborough the better she observed john turned rapidly over the leaves of his guide book peterborough is seventy eight miles from london and contains many buildings of interest he informed them lady ayr returned to seymour i hope you will insist on her leaving off smoking when you are married to her she said i cannot say she is the wife i should have chosen for you i chose her myself observed seymour tell me more about her certainly the waldenechs are a very old family there is that to be said is she serious does she feel her responsibilities or is she like her mother seymour brushed a few remaining sandwich crumbs off his trousers i think aunt dodo is one of the most serious people i know he said she is serious about everything she does everything with all her might nadine is not quite so serious as that she is rather flippant about things like food and dress however no doubt my influence will make her more serious but as a matter of fact i can't tell you about nadine a fortnight ago when i proposed to her i could have i could have given you a very complete account of her but i can't any longer i am getting blind about her i only know that it is she not so long ago i told her a quantity of her faults with ruthless accuracy but i couldn't now i can't see them any more there's a glamor esther looked up oh seymour she said are you talking about nadine are you falling in love with her how very awkward does she know seymour pointed a withering finger at his sister little girls should mind their own business he said oh but it is my business nadine matters far more than any one else she might easily think it not right to marry you if you were in love with her lady ayr turned a petrifying gaze from one to the other she seems a very extraordinary young person she said and in any case esther has no business to know anything about it whether she thinks it right or not she is going to marry me said seymour esther shook her head you are indeed blind about nadine she said if you think she would ever do anything she thought wrong you might be describing john said seymour rather hotly anyhow nadine is not like john i see no resemblance said lady ayr but it is something to know she would not do anything she thought wrong when you say it in that voice mother said esther you make nonsense of it the same words in any voice mean the same thing said lady ayr seymour sighed i am on esther's side for once he said esther turned to her brother seymour you ought to tell nadine you are falling in love with her she said i really don't think she would approve why you might become as bad as hugh of course you are not so stupid as hugh ah stupid is the wrong word you haven't got such a plain kind of intellect as hugh which was nadine's main objection seymour patted esther's hand with odious superiority you are rather above yourself my little girl he said because just now i agreed with you it has gone to your head and makes you think yourself clever shut your eyes till we get to lincoln you will feel less giddy by degrees and when you open them again you can mind your own business and mother will tell you about the goths and vandals who built the cathedral you are a vandal yourself you will have a fellow feeling mother dear put down that window i am going to see cathedrals to please you but i will not be stifled to please anybody the carriage reeks of your beef sandwiches but i think i have some scent in my bag i am quite sure you have said esther scornfully i am writing to nadine by the way i shall tell her you are falling in love with her you can tell her exactly what you please said seymour suavely ah here is some wall flower scent it is like a may morning yes tell nadine what you please but don't bother me what is the odious town we are coming to i think it must be lincoln john here is lincoln and all the people are ancient romans seymour obligingly sprayed the expensive scent about the carriage even though they were so shortly to disembark the river witham said john pointing to a small and fetid ditch remains of roman villas the inhabitants of which died of typhoid said seymour tell nadine we are enjoying lincoln esther had father better be allowed to sleep on or shall i wake him there is a porter call him mother i won't carry my bag even to save you sixpence but don't tell him we are marchionesses and lords and ladies because then he will expect a shilling i perceive a seedy looking 'bus outside that is probably ours it looks as if it came from some low kind of inn i wish i had brought antoinette and yet i don't know she would probably have given notice after seeing the degradation of our summer holiday seymour you are making yourself exceedingly disagreeable said his mother it is intentional you made yourself disagreeable to me you began as for you esther you must expect to see a good deal less of nadine after she and i are married i will not have you mooning about the house reminding her of all the damned yes i said damned nonsense you and she and berts and hugh talked about the inequality of marriages where one person is clever and the other stupid or where one loves and the other doesn't you have roused me you and mother between you and i am here to tell you that i will manage my own affairs which are nadine's also without the smallest assistance from you put that in in your ginger beer or whatever we have for dinner and drink it you thought i was only a sort of thing that waved its hands and collected jade and talked in rather a squeaky voice and walked on its toes well you have found out your mistake and don't let me have to teach it you again you can tell nadine in your letter exactly what i have said and don't rouse me again it makes me hot but mind your own business instead and remember that when i want either your advice or mother's i will ask for it till then you can keep it completely to yourselves you needn't answer me i don't want to hear anything you have got to say let us go to the cathedral i suppose it is that great cockshy on the top of the hill i know it will prove to have been built by our forefathers the verger will like to know about it but bear in mind i don't want to be told anything about nadine seymour had become quite red in the face with the violence of the feelings that prompted these straightforward remarks and before putting the spray of wall flower scent back into his bag he shut his eyes and squirted himself in the face in order to cool himself while esther stared at him open mouthed she hardly knew him for he had become exactly like a man a transformation more unexpected than anything that ever happened at a pantomime and she instantly and correctly connected this change in him with what he had been saying for the reason of the change was perfectly simple and sufficient during those last days at winston after the departure of hugh he had fallen in love with nadine and his nature which had really been neither that of man or woman had suddenly sexed itself he had not in the least cast off his tastes and habits to spray himself and a stuffy railway carriage with wall flower scent was still perfectly natural to him and no doubt unless nadine objected very much he would continue to take antoinette about with him as his maid but he had declared himself a man and found even as his sister found that the change in him was as immense as it was unexpected he thought with more than usual scorn of nadine's friends such as esther and berts who all played about together like healthy but mentally anemic children for he the most anemic of them all had suddenly had live blood as it were squirted into him indeed the only member of the clan whom he thought of with toleration was hugh with whom he felt a bond of brotherhood for hugh like himself loved nadine like a man already also he felt sorry for him recognizing in him a member of his own sex hitherto he had disliked his own sex because they were men now he found himself detesting people like berts because they were not for men so he had begun to perceive are essentially those who are aware of the fact of women the rest of them to which he had himself till so lately belonged he now classified as more or less intellectual amoebae and the corresponding members of the other sex were just as bad esther had no sense of sex nor perhaps and here he paused had nadine that it is true gave him long pause he knew quite well that nadine had been no more in love with him when they had got engaged than he had been with her they had both been and she so he must suppose was still quite undeveloped as regards those instincts hugh with all his devotion and developed manliness awoke no corresponding flame in her and seymour was quite clear sighted enough to see that there was no sign of his having succeeded where hugh had failed she belonged as dodo had remarked to that essentially modern type of girl which unless she marries while quite young will probably be spinster still at thirty they had brains they had a hundred intellectual and artistic interests and studied mummies or logic or greek gems or themselves and lived in flats eagerly and happily and smoked and substituted tea for dinner they knew of nothing in their natures that gave them any imperious call on the other hand they called imperiously though unintentionally to others nadine had called like that to hugh and was dismayed at the tumult she had roused regretting it but not comprehending it and now she had called like that to seymour she was like the sleeping beauty in the wood calling in her sleep hugh had answered her first and had fought his way through thicket and briar but his coming had not awakened her then she had called again and this time seymour stood by her she had given him her hand but her sleep had been undisturbed she smiled at him but she smiled in her sleep the seedy 'bus of the type not yet quite extinct with straw on the bottom of it proved to be sent for them and they proceeded over cobbled streets half deafened by the clatter of ill fitting windows after a minute or two of this seymour firmly declined to continue for he said the straw got up his trousers and tickled his legs and the drums of his ears were bursting so he got delicately out in order to take a proper conveyance and promised to meet the rest of them at the west door of the cathedral here he sat very comfortably for ten minutes till they arrived and entering in the manner of a storming party they literally stumbled over an astonished archdeacon who was superintending some measurement of paving stone immediately inside and proved to be a cousin of lady ayr's this fact was not elicited without pomp for the cathedral was not open to visitors at this hour as he informed them on which lady ayr said i suppose there will be no difficulty in the way of the marquis of ayr ayr this is an archdeacon and his wife and family seeing it upon which an archdeacon said oh are you susie ayr explanations of cousinship luckily satisfactory followed and they were conducted round the cathedral by him free of all expense and dined with him in the evening at a quarter to eight returning home at ten in order to get a grip of all they were going to see next day by a diligent perusal of the guide books they were staying at an ancient hostelry called the goat and compasses a designation the origin of which john very obligingly explained to them but seymour still perhaps suffering from the straw at the bottom of the 'bus thought that the flea and compasses would be a more descriptive title no room was on the level with any other room or with the passage outside it and short obscure flights of steps designed to upset the unwary communicated between them a further trap was laid down for unsuspicious guests in the matter of doors and windows for the doors were not quite high enough to enable the person of average height to pass through them without hitting his forehead against the jamb and the windows when induced to open descended violently again in the manner of a guillotine the floors were as wavy as the pavement of st mark's at venice the looking glasses seemed like dusky wells at the bottom of which the gazer darkly beheld his face and the beds had feather mattresses on them altogether it was quite in the right style except that it was not a temperance hotel for the accommodation of lady ayr on a tour of family culture and she and john after a short and decisive economical interview with the proprietor took possession of the largest table in the public drawing room ejecting therefrom two nervous spinsters who had been looking forward to playing patience on it and spreading their maps of the town over it read to each other out of guide books while lord ayr propped himself up dejectedly in a corner where he hoped to drop asleep unperceived the troublesome interview with the proprietor had been on the subject of making a deduction from the agreed terms since they had all dined out he was finally routed by a short plain statement of the case by lady ayr if you can afford to take us in for so much dinner included she said you can afford to take us in for less without dinner i think there is no more to be said on the subject breakfast please at a quarter past eight punctually and i shall require a second candle in my bedroom i think your terms which i do not say are excessive included lights thank you seymour had declined to take part in this guide book conference saying with truth that he felt sure it would all be very completely explained to him next day and let himself out into the streets of the town which were already growing empty of passengers above the sky was lucent with many stars and the moon which had risen an hour before cleared the house roofs and shone down into the street with a very white light making the gas lamps look red last night it had been full and from the terrace at winston they had all watched it rise full flaring over the woods below the house then he and nadine had strolled away together and in that luminous solitude with her he had felt himself constrained and tongue tied he had no longer at command the talk that usually rose so glibly to his lips that gay witty inconsequent gabble that had truthfully represented what went on in his quick discerning brain his brain now was taken up with one topic only and it was as hard for him to speak to her of that as it was for him to speak of anything else he knew that she had entered into her engagement with him in the same spirit in which he had proposed to her they liked each other each found the other a stimulating companion by each no doubt the attraction of the other's good looks was felt she he was certain regarded him now as she had regarded him then while for him the whole situation had undergone so complete a change that he felt that the very fortress of his identity had been stormed and garrisoned by the besieging host and what was the host that tall girl with the white slim hands who without intention had picked up a key and cursorily so it seemed had unlocked his heart so that it stood open to her honestly he did not know that it was made to unlock he had thought of it always as some toy swiss chalet not meant to be opened but she had opened it and gone inside the streets grew emptier lights appeared behind blinds in upper windows and only an occasional step sounded on the pavements he had come to an open market place and from where he paused and stood the western towers of the cathedral rose above the intervening roofs and aspired whitely into the dark velvet of the night hitherto seymour would have found nothing particular to say about moonlight in which he took but the very faintest interest except that it tended to provoke an untimely loquaciousness in cats but to night he found his mind flooded with the most hackneyed and commonplace reflections it reminded him of nadine it was white and chaste and aloof like her he wanted her and he was going to get her and yet would she really be his in the sense that he was hers then for a moment habit asserted itself and he told himself he was being common that he was dropping to the level of plain and barbarous hugh it was very mortifying yet he could not keep off that level he kept on dropping there as he stared at the moonlit towers of the cathedral unsatisfied and longing but it may be doubted whether he would have felt better satisfied if he had known how earnestly nadine had tried to drop or rise to the moonlit plane or how sincerely even with tears she had deplored her inability to do so for it was not he whom she had sought to join there chapter viii dodo was seated in her room in jack's house in town intermittently arguing with him and miss grantham and edith and berts and in intervals looking up as many of her friends as she could remember the names of and asking them to her dance the month was november and the dance was for to day week which was the first of december and as far as she had got at present it appeared that all her friends were in town and that they would all come nadine was similarly employed next door and as they both asked anybody who occurred to them the same people frequently got asked twice over which said dodo is an advantage as it looks as if we really wanted them very much oh is that esther esther we are having a dance on december the first and will you all come yes wasn't it a good idea that is nice of course delighted if your mother cares to come too then i shan't said berts berts shut up said dodo in a penetrating whisper yes darling esther berts said something but i don't know what it was as they are all talking together yes a cotillion good by look out hendrick's stores grantie but i really won't lead the cotillion with berts it is too ridiculous a man may not lead the cotillion with his grandmother it comes in the prayer book three thousand and seven said miss grantham p'd'n't'n three double o seven padd said dodo briskly please miss i always say 'please miss' and then they are much pleasanter i used to say 'i'm princess waldenech please miss' but they never believed it and said 'garn' but i was darling jack i was no my days of leading the cotillion came to an end under william the fourth there is nothing so ridiculous as seeing an old thing no i'm not the warwick hotel do i sound like the warwick hotel dodo's face suddenly assumed an expression of seraphic interest it's too entrancing she whispered i'm sure it's a nice man because he wants to marry me he says i didn't meet him in the warwick hotel this morning that was forgetful yes oh he's rung off he has jilted me i wish i had said i was the warwick hotel it was stupid of me i wonder if you can be married by telephone with a clergyman taking the place of 'please miss' where had we got to oh yes hendrick's three double o seven you idiot i mean please miss what thank you miss no nadine and berts shall lead it i would sooner lead with lady ayr said berts nadine always forgets everything oh hendrick's is it said dodo yes lady chesterford i am really and i want a band for the evening of december the first no not a waistband music yes send somebody round dodo put down the ear piece let us strive not to do several things together she said for the moment we will concentrate on the cotillion jack dear why did you suggest i should lead it has led to so much talking of which i have had to do the largest part i want you to he said i'll take you to egypt in the spring if you will i won't otherwise darling you are too unfair for words you want to make an ass of me you want everybody to say 'look at that silly old grandmama' i probably shall be a grandmama quite soon if nadine is going to marry seymour in january 'silly old grandmama' they will say 'capering about like a two year old' because i shall caper if i lead i shan't be able to resist kicking up jack came across the room and sat on the table by her don't you want to dodo he asked quietly yes darling i should love to i only wanted pressing oh my beloved berts what larks we'll have hoops and snowballs and looking glass and wooly bear don't you know wooly bear and paper bags and obstacles and balance and then the very next day i shall settle down and behave as befits my years and riches and honor i am old and jack is rich and has endowed me with all his worldly goods and we are both strictly honorable but i feel it's a hazardous experiment if i hear somebody saying as no doubt i shall 'surely lady chesterford is a little old' i shall collapse in the middle of the floor and burst into several tears and then i shall wipe my eyes both of them if both have cried and if not one and say 'beloved berts come on' and on we shall go you haven't asked hugh yet said miss grantham looking at the list nadine did said dodo he said he wasn't certain they argued they do said berts aunt dodo may i come to dine this evening and have a practice afterwards yes my dear are you going till this evening then dodo turned to jack and spoke low oh jack she said waldenech's in town nadine saw him yesterday glad i didn't said jack i'm sure you are darling but here we all are you know you can't put him out like a candle about the dance i mean i think i had better ask him he won't come if i ask him he won't come anyhow my dear said jack you can't tell i know him better than you he's nasty you know poor dear if i didn't ask him he might come he might think he ought to have been asked and so come instead whereas if he was asked he would probably think it merely insulting of me and so stop at home don't whisper to each other said edith loudly i can't bear a husband and wife whispering to each other it looks as if they hadn't got over the honeymoon dodo i haven't had a single word with you yet darling edith you haven't if you only would go to the other end of the telephone i would talk to you for hours simply to thwart the 'please miss' who asks if we haven't done yet the only comfortable conversation is conducted on the telephone then you say 'hush' to everybody else in the room indeed it isn't usually necessary to say 'hush' anybody with a proper interest in the affairs of other people always listens to what you say trying to reconstruct what the inaudible voice says jack was babbling down the telephone the other day when i particularly wanted to talk but when he said 'never let him shave her again' how could i interrupt did he shave her again asked miss grantham who was she you shouldn't have said that said dodo because now i have to explain it was the poodle who had been shaved wrong and she had puppies next day and they probably all had hair in the unfashionable places please talk to each other and not about poodles jack and i have a little serious conversation to get through i will speak said edith because it matters to me we've let our house dodo at least bertie let it and has gone to bath because he is rheumatic berts can stay at the bath club because he isn't but i want to stay with you the house is becoming like basle railway station remarked jack yes dear every proper house in town is said dodo a house in london isn't a house it is a junction people dine and lunch and sleep if they have time i haven't yes edith do come jack wants you too only he doesn't say so because he is naturally reticent edith instantly got up then may i have some lunch at once she said cold beef will do but i have a rehearsal at half past one the telephone bell rang and dodo took up the ear piece no lady chesterford is out she said but who is it it's waldenech jack she said in a low voice no she hasn't come in yet what no she isn't expected at all she is quite unexpected she replaced the instrument i recognized his voice she said and i oughtn't to have said i was unexpected because perhaps he will guess but he sounded a bit thick don't they say yes dear edith have some cold beef because it is much nicer than anything else i shall come and have lunch in one minute too as i didn't have any breakfast take grantie away with you and i will join you i won't have cold beef whatever happens said grantie dodo turned round facing jack as soon as the others had left the room and laid her hand on his knee jack i feel sure i am right she said i don't want waldenech here any more than you do but after all he is nadine's father i wish madge or belle or somebody who writes about society would lay down for us the proper behavior for re married wives towards their divorced husbands i can tell you the proper behavior of divorced husbands towards re married wives said jack yes darling but you must remember that waldenech has nothing to do with proper behavior he always behaved most improperly if he hadn't i shouldn't be your wife now i think that must be an instance of all things working together for good as st peter says paul remarked jack very likely though peter might be supposed to know most about wives jack dear let us settle this at once because i am infernally hungry and the thought of edith's eating cold beef makes me feel homesick i think i had much better ask waldenech to our dance there he is i've known him pretty well and it's just because he is nothing more than an acquaintance now that i wish to ask him to ask him will show the the gulf between us jack shook his head i prefer to show the gulf by not asking him he said dodo frowned and tapped the skirt of her riding habit with her whip she was rather tired and very hungry for she had been playing bridge till two o'clock the night before and had got up at eight to go out riding and meaning to have breakfast afterwards had found herself plunged in the arrangements for her ball which had lasted without intermission till this moment but she felt unwilling to give this point up unless jack absolutely put his foot down with regard to it i think i am right she said he is rather a devil all the more reason for not asking him do you mean that you forbid me she asked he thought for a moment yes i forbid you he said dodo got up at once flicked him in the face with the end of her riding whip and before he had really time to blink kissed him on exactly the same spot which happened to be the end of his nose that is finished then she said in the most good humored voice and now i have both the whip and the whip hand if anything goes wrong darling i shall say 'i told you so' till you wish you had never been born he caught her whip and her hands in his you couldn't make me wish that he said her whole face melted into a sunlight of adorable smiles oh jack do you really mean that she asked and because of me he pulled her close to him i suppose i should mean in spite of you he said go and eat with that ogre edith and then darling will you rest a little you look rather tired she raised her eyes to his but i am tired she said it would be a disgrace not to be tired every day it would show you hadn't made the most of it i don't like you to be tired he said especially since it isn't lunch time yet you haven't got much more to do to day i hope but lots and all so jolly oh my dear the world is as full as the sea at high tide it would be wretched not to fling oneself into it but it is only high tide till after my dance then we go down to meering and snore and sleep like pigs and eat like kittens and sprout like mushrooms you've asked a houseful there objected jack yes darling but it's only people like you and esther and hugh i shan't bother about you is hugh coming there he asked yes he goes abroad directly afterwards as he has exchanged from the foreign office into the embassy at rome for six months he is wise i think he doesn't want to be here when nadine is married nor for some time afterwards but he wants to see her again first the rest is wise said jack but that is abominably foolish perhaps it is but how one hates a young man to be altogether wise a wise young man is quite intolerable in fact wisdom generally is intolerable it would be intolerable of me to lie down after lunch and not eat and drink what i chose you would be intolerable if you didn't make yourself so utterly foolish about me oh jack let us die if necessary but don't let us be wise before that jack had nothing to say to this remarkable aspiration and dodo went out to join edith but he sat still on the edge of the table after she had gone not altogether at ease during the last month or so he had several times experienced impulses not to be accounted for rationally which had made him ask her if she felt quite well and now that he collected these occasions in his mind he could not recollect any very reassuring response on her part she had told him not to fuss she had stood before him radiant brilliant and said do i look particularly unwell why do you want to spoil the loveliest time of all my life but she did not seem to have given him any direct answer at all and the cumulative effect of those possible evasions troubled him a little but he soon told himself that such a cloud was born of his imagination only for it was impossible to conceive when he let himself contemplate the memory of those days since last july that there could be anything wrong behind them in so serene a beneficence of happiness were they wrapped he had never dreamed that the world held such store and he had not ever so faintly realized how jejune and barren his life had been before he for all his fifty years had not yet lived one half of them for less than half himself had passed through the months that made them up it was as if all his life he had dreamed dreamed with god knew what shocks and catastrophes that dodo was his and last july only he awoke to find that his arms were indeed about her and that she herself was pressed close to him and she too had told him that she was happy not pleased merely or excited or thrilled but happy incredible as it seemed to his modest soul her happiness was one with his it seemed there was nothing left to ask god for the only possible attitude was to stand up and praise and thank him jack did that every day and night that passed dodo when she left her husband had not gone straight to the dining room to join edith and the cold beef for half an hour before she had been conscious of a queer and rather sickening pain that had made it an effort to continue enthusiastically telephoning and arguing she had had no real doubt in her own mind that it was the result of a rather strenuous morning without any food except the slice of bread and butter that had accompanied her early bedroom tea but she thought that she would go upstairs and have her hot bath which was sure to make her quite comfortable before she ate her bathroom which opened out of her bedroom was prepared for her the water steaming and smelling of the delicious verbena salts which her maid had put into it and convinced that she would feel perfectly fit again after it she quickly undressed and went in with bare feet to enjoy herself but even as she took off her dressing gown she had a start of pain that for the moment frightened her and caused her to stand naked by her bath holding on to the edge of it then the pain gradually drew away as if pulled out of her by a string and in a minute more she was quite herself again but there was the memory of it left like a black patch so it seemed even when it had quite ceased however it had gone now and instinctively obeying the habit of years she swiftly turned her mind to contemplate the thoroughly delightful things that lay in front of her rather than the disturbing moment that had passed now leaving only a black patch in memory but before she slipped into the hot aromatic water she wiped the sweat from her forehead she splashed the steaming water over her back wriggling a little at the touch of it o lord how nice she said to herself and it's hardly possible to bear it and that reminds me that i utterly forgot to say my prayers this morning because i was in such a hurry any one would have been on such a lovely morning with such a lovely horse waiting at the door but i am having the nicest time that anybody ever had and i'll try not to be quite such a disgrace as i used to be dodo gave a loud sigh of reverent content and splashed again it must be understood that she was saying her forgotten prayers and jack's a perfect darling she went on and i am so pleased to love somebody i never loved anybody before really if you know what i mean by love except perhaps nadine it makes the most tremendous difference and one doesn't think about oneself absolutely all the time though i daresay very nearly of course i was always fond of people but i think that was chiefly because they were mostly so nice to me i must go to church next sunday which is to morrow and do all this properly but it would have been much more convenient if it had been the day after to morrow as i think i promised jack to play golf with him to morrow but i'll see what can be done now i've dropped the soap and isn't everything extraordinarily mixed up oh please don't let me have any more pain like what i had just now if it's all the same but of course if i must have it well there it is but i hope it doesn't mean anything nasty dodo dropped the soap which she had just rescued from the bottom of the cloudy water and looked up with bright eyes oh my dear can it be that she said aloud is it possible she recollected that she had said my dear when she was by way of saying her forgotten prayers and so added amen very loudly and piously then quite revivified she got out dried herself with great speed and went downstairs half dressed with an immense fur coat to cover deficiencies since it was impossible to wait any longer for food she felt no fatigue any more but a sudden intense eagerness at the thought of what possibly that pain might mean it seemed almost incredible but she found herself almost longing for a return of that which had frightened her before it was impossible for her to cram any more engagements into that day since they already fitted into each other like the petals of a rose not yet fully blown but she made an appointment with her doctor for next morning the interview was not a long one but dodo came out from it wreathed in smiles immensely excited and hurried home where she went straight up to jack's room she seized him with both hands and kissed him indiscriminately oh my dear you can't possibly guess she said because it is quite too ridiculous and only a person like me could possibly have done anything of the kind and you're zacharias but you needn't be dumb oh jack don't you see yes it's that i'm going to have a baby instead of cancer i was prepared at least not quite for its being cancer which i shouldn't have enjoyed at all but dr ingram says it's the other thing did you ever hear anything so nice and i am a very wonderful woman aren't i and pray god it will be a boy oh jack think how bored i was with the bearing of my first child i didn't deserve it and you used to come and cheer me up and then poor little innocent it was taken from me poor little chap he would have been lord chesterford now instead of you if he had lived won't it seem funny giving birth to the same baby so to speak twice ah my dear but it's not the same it's your child this time jack and i shan't be bored this time you see i didn't really become a woman at all till lately i was merely a sprightly little devil and so i suppose god is giving me another chance jack it simply must be a boy i shall love to hear lord harchester cry this time jack though informed that he needn't be like zacharias had been dumb because there was no vacant moment to speak in the news had amazed and astounded him oh dodo he said next to yourself that is the best gift of all but i'm not sure i forgive you for suspecting you were ill and not telling me then i shall get along quite nicely without your forgiveness said she forgiveness indeed or will it be twins wouldn't that be exciting but a boy anyhow i've ordered him and he shall have one blue eye because he's yours and one brown eye because he's mine and so he'll be like a welsh collie and every one will say 'what a pretty little dog does he bite' jack i hope he'll be rather a rip when he grows up and make his love to other people's wives i suppose i oughtn't to wish that but i can't help it i like a boy with a little dash in him he shall be about as tall as you but much better looking and oh to think that i once had a boy before and didn't care my conscience i care now and only yesterday i said i should probably soon be a grandmother and now i've got to leave out the grand and be just a humble mother first i'm not humble i'm just as proud as i can stick together suddenly this amazing flood of speech stopped and dodo grew dim eyed and laid her head on her husband's shoulder my soul doth magnify the lord she whispered the night of dodo's ball had arrived and she was going to lead the cotillion but not dance more than she felt to be absolutely necessary she had told everybody what was going to happen to her in strict privacy which was clearly the best way of keeping it secret for the present since she was not going to dance more than a step or two she had put on all the jewels she could manage to attach to herself including the girdle of great emeralds that waldenech had given her this was a magnificent adornment far too nice to give back to him when she divorced him and she meant to let nadine have it as soon as she could bear to part with it herself which did not seem likely to happen in the immediate future it consisted of large square stones set in brilliants and long pear shaped emeralds depended from it jack had once asked her how she could bear to wear it and she had said darling when emeralds are as big as that they help you to bear a good deal they make a perfect spartan of me in other respects she wore what she called the nursery fender which was a diamond crown so high that children would have been safe from falling over it into the fire the famous chesterford pearls and a sort of breast plate of rubies like the high priest i suppose it's dreadfully vulgar to wear so many jewels she said to jack as they took their stand at the top of the stairs where dodo intended to remain and receive her guests as long as she could bear not being in the ball room but most people who have got very nice stones like me i notice are vulgar the truly refined people are those who have got three garnets and one zircon they also say that big pearls great eggs like these are vulgar and seed pearls tasteful what a word 'tasteful' and they talk of people's being very simply and exquisitely dressed thank god no one can say i'm simply dressed to night i'm not i'm the most elaborate object for miles round jack when my baby dear lady ayr how nice to see you and esther and john seymour dined here and he has been taking notes of our clothes for the new paper called gowns as in the old days when dodo piped the world danced and she was as vital as charged with that magnetism that spreads enjoyment round itself more infectiously than influenza to night as ever her beauty too was like a rose full blown but without one petal yet fallen and she stood there in the glory of her incomparable form jeweled and superb a juno decked for a feast among the high gods all the world of her friends streamed up the stairs to be welcomed by that wonderful smiling face and many instead of going in to the ball room waited round the balustrade at the stair head watching her by degrees the tide of arriving guests slackened and she turned to jack jack dear the band is turning all my blood into champagne she said come and have one turn with me round the ball room why are they all standing about instead of going to dance do they want to be shown how just once round or perhaps twice and then i will stop quiet until the cotillion dodo suddenly knit her eyebrows and looked sharply down into the hall below i was right and you were wrong she said there's waldenech just come in he is not going to come upstairs wait here for me jack stepped forward no that's for me to do he said dodo laid her hand on his arm do as i tell you my dear she said wait here it won't take me a minute she went straight down into the hall all smiles and gaiety had left her face but its vitality was quite unimpaired the color that was in her cheeks had left them but it was not fear that had driven it away but anger he was just receiving a ticket for his hat and coat and she went straight up to him waldenech take your hat and coat and go away she said you must have come to the wrong house you were not asked here he turned at the sound of her voice and looked up at her you incomparable creature he said rather thickly you pearl give the prince his hat and coat said dodo now go waldenech before i disgrace you i mean it if you do not go quietly and at once you shall be turned out his eyes wandered unsteadily from her face to her bosom and down to her waist where the great girdle gleamed and shone you still wear the jewels i gave you he said dodo instantly undid the clasp and the girdle fell on to the carpet i do not wear them any more she said take them and go he stood there for a moment without moving then he bent down and picked them up i ask your pardon most humbly he said i am a gentleman really please let me see you put the girdle on again before i go and say you forgive me if your husband knows i am here ask his pardon for me also some great wave of pity came over dodo utterly quenching her anger oh waldenech you have all my forgiveness my dear she said but take the jewels i ask you to give me that sign of your forgiveness he said dodo smiled at him fasten it yourself then she said his fingers halted over this but in a moment he had found and secured the clasp good night he said the whole scene had lasted not more than a minute and scarcely half a dozen people had seen her speaking to him or knew who it was berts who had just arrived was one of these dodo turned to him ah there you are berts she said we are going to begin the cotillion exactly at twelve yes poor dear waldenech looked in but he couldn't stop you might remember not to tell nadine and why wasn't edith here for dinner or isn't she staying here now now i come to think of it i haven't seen her all day she left you yesterday said berts and i've just left her at home eating a chop and correcting proofs of a part song she was also singing she's coming though and says she will lead the cotillion with me and she's sure you oughtn't to she didn't say why dodo went up to jack he went like a lamb poor dear she said though i thought for a moment he was going to stop like a lion it gave me a little heart ache jack for after all you know now we are going twice round the ball room it isn't much of a heart ache it's only a little one and i expect it will soon stop this it may be expected was the case for certainly dodo did not behave as if she had any kind of ache however little anywhere and whether she danced or sat still was the sun and center of the brilliant scene wall flowers raised their heads on her approach and were galvanized into vitality she ordained that there should be a waltz in which nobody should take part who was not over forty led off herself with lord ayr who had not had a wink of sleep all evening and was far too much surprised to be capable of resistance and convinced him that his dancing days were not nearly over yet all manner of women who had hoped that nobody dreamed that they were more than thirty five at the most followed her reckless of the antiquity which they had publicly and irrevocably acknowledged while edith arbuthnot arriving in the middle of this and being quite unable to find a disengaged gentleman of suitable years pirouetted up and down the room all by herself until she clawed hold of jack who was taking the breathless lady ayr to get some strictly unalcoholic refreshment i don't know how i came to do it said this lady to esther as she drank her lemonade i haven't danced for years somehow i feel as if it was lady chesterford's fault she has got into everybody's head it seems to me we're all behaving like boys and girls fancy ayr dancing too ayr i saw you dancing lord ayr had come in with dodo at the end of this unutterably briskened up and i saw you dancing my dear he said and i hope you feel all the better for it because i do we all do said dodo and we'll all do it again i want everything at once a cigarette and an ice and a glass of champagne and berts esther be angelic and fetch me berts don't tell him only i want him but fetch him oh jack isn't it fun yes darling we're going to begin the cotillion immediately and i'm going to be ever so quiet edith it was dear of you to offer to take my place but i wouldn't give it up to terpsichore herself or even salome jack dear go and make every one go and sit down in two rows round the ball room and if anybody finds a rather large diamond about it's probably mine though i never wrote my name on it wasn't it careless it resembles the koh i noor oh berts there you are now don't lose your head but give all the plainest women the most favors then the pretty ones will easily see the plan and the plain ones won't it's the greatest happiness for the plainest number certainly it was the most successful cotillion as dodo had arranged all the more unattractive people got selected first and all the more attractive as dodo had foreseen saw exactly what was happening the style was distinctly anti leap year and in the mirror figure men instead of women rejected the faces in the glass and lord ayr had nothing whatever to say to his wife who was instantly accepted by jack and at the end the band preceding they danced through the entire house from cellar to garret they waltzed through drawing rooms and dining room and up the stairs and through dodo's bedroom and through jack's dressing room where his pajamas were lying on his bed berts put them on en passant and into cul de sacs and impenetrable servants' rooms and somehow it was dodo all the time who inspired these childish orgies those near her saw her those behind danced wildly after her there was no accounting for it except in the fact that while she was enjoying herself so enormously it was impossible not to enjoy too sometimes it was she shrieking yes straight on sometimes it was her laugh choked voice saying no don't go in there but the fact that she was leading them with her nursery fender and her vitality and her ropes of pearls and her complete abandon to the spirit of dancing with berts for partner in jack's pajamas made a magnet that it was impossible not to follow they passed through bedroom and attic they went twice round the huge kitchen where the chef at dodo's imperious command laid down his culinary implements which at the moment meant an ice pail and joined the dance with the first kitchen maid then dodo saw a footman standing idle and called to him take my maid william and william with a broad grin embraced a perfectly willing frenchwoman of great attractions and joined in the dance like the fairies in a midsummer night's dream they danced the whole hour through dodo with berts the chef with the kitchen maid william with dodo's maid lord ayr with nadine lady ayr with somebody whom nobody knew by sight who had probably come there by mistake and the first twenty couples or so finished up in the cellar this though it seemed improvised had been provided for and there were cane chairs to rest in and bottles instantly opened the rest following the band danced their way back to the supper room where they were almost immediately joined by the cellar party who were hungry as well as thirsty and had nothing to eat down below it was between three and four o'clock that the last guests took their ways as the dance had been announced to take place from ten till two the cordial spirit of the invitation had been made good and at length dodo found herself alone with jack lovely just lovely she said as he unclasped her diamond collar oh jack what a darling world it is not tired dodo faced round and her brilliance and freshness was a thing to marvel at look at me she said tell me if i look tired he laid the collar down on her table her neck seemed to him so infinitely more beautiful than the gorgeous bauble with which it had been covered a beauty released from beauteous bonds not very ah dodo and this is the best of all when they have all gone and you are left she put her face up to his why of course she said do you suppose i wasn't looking forward to this one minute alone with you all the evening i was my dear though if i said i thought of it all the time i should be telling a silly lie but it was anchored firmly in my mind all the time oh what pretty speeches for a middle aged old couple to make to each other but the fact is that we get on very nicely together good night old boy it's all too lovely oh daddy fancy becoming daddy oh by the way did hugh come i didn't see him yes he sat out a couple of dances with nadine and then went away poor old chap said dodo as has been mentioned dodo proposed to take her family and a great many other people as well to spend christmas down at meering which at this inclement time of the year often had spells of warm and genial weather scattered through the same weeks there were to be several shooting parties at winston but motor cars driven at a sufficiently high speed made light of the difficulty of being in two places at the same time and on the day after the dance she talked these arrangements over with nadine in any case she said you can be hostess in one house and i in the other so that we can be in two places at once quite easily so jack is wrong as usual jack dear i said 'as usual' jack got up it was he who had made the ill considered remark that you can't be in two places at once i heard he said and you may hear too that i will not have you going up to north wales every other day and flying down again the next otherwise you may settle what you like personally i shall be at winston almost all the time as there's a heap of business to be done and as nadine hates shooting parties oh a story said nadine well my dear you always do your best to spoil them by making a large quantity of young gentlemen who have been asked to shoot sit round you and talk to you instead papa jack if you want to call me a flirt pray do so i will forgive you instantly and to save you trouble i will tell you what you are driving to at said jack driving to repeated nadine with considerable asperity for she was aware she was wrong you want me to be at meering and mama to be at winston so why not say so without calling me a flirt this daughter of eve began jack my name is dorothea interrupted dodo but they call me dodo for short i was never called eve either before during or after baptism all i mean said jack is that dorothea is not going to divide the week into week ends and be twenty four hours at meering and then twenty four at winston the master of the house has spoken what a bully said nadine then i shan't give you a wedding present said jack darling papa jack you are not a bully let's all go down to meering in a few days and stop there over christmas then you and dorothea shall go to winston and i shall be left all alone at meering and you shall have your horrid shooting parties and she shall do the flirting instead of me strictly speaking will you be all alone at meering not absolutely i have asked a few friends who is going to chaperone you all darling said dodo we shall chaperone each other as usual that you and dodo can settle said jack good by don't quarrel indeed that will be all right mama said nadine or i daresay edith would come anyhow we were often all together before like that in the summer yes my dear but it's a little different now said dodo you are engaged to seymour and hugh is going to be there too yes but that makes it all the simpler dodo got up i wonder if you realize that seymour is in love with you she said in love with you like hugh is i mean perfectly and he is charming about it said nadine and i practise every morning being in love with him like that i think i am getting on very well i dreamed about him last night i thought he gave me a great box of jade and when i opened it there was a rabbit inside that shows great progress said dodo mama i think you are laughing at me but what would you have i am very fond of him he is handsome and clever and charming i expected to find it tiresome when he told me he was in love like that but it is not the least so memories of the man she had married when she was even younger than nadine came unbidden into dodo's mind she remembered her first husband's blind dog like devotion and her own ennui when he strove to express it to communicate it to her nadine she said treat it reverently my dear there is nothing in the world that a man can give a woman that is to be compared to that it is better than a rabbit in a jade box when i was even younger than you papa jack's cousin gave it me and and i didn't reverence it don't repeat my irreparable error weren't you nice to him asked nadine i was a brute beast to him my darling oh i shan't be a brute beast to seymour said nadine besides i don't suppose you were you didn't know wasn't that all dodo wiped the mist from her eyes no that wasn't nearly all but be tender with it and pray oh my dear pray that you may catch that that 'noble fever' who calls it that it is so true and hughie i never saw him last night nadine made a little gesture of despair ah dear hughie she said that is not very happy that is so largely why i wanted to marry seymour quickly in january instead of later so that it may be done and hughie will not fret any more i hate seeing him suffer and i can't marry him it would not be fair it would be cheating him as i told him before but you are not cheating seymour asked dodo not in the same way he is not simple like hugh hugh has only one thought seymour has plenty of others he has such a mind it is subtle and swift like a woman's hughie has the mind of a great retriever dog and the eyes of one there is all the difference in the world between them seymour knows what he is in for and still wants it hugh thinks he knows but he doesn't i understand hugh so well i know i am right and i would have given anything to be able to be in love with him it was a pity there was something here that dodo had not known and there was a dangerous sound about it do you mean you wish you were in love with him she asked oh yes mama but i'm not i used to practice trying to be for months and months just as i am practising for seymour now la la what a world nadine paused a moment of course i've quite stopped practising being in love with hugh since i was engaged to seymour she said with an air of the most candid virtue that would be cheating nadine got up looking like a tall white lily seymour is so good for me she said he doesn't think much of my brain you know and i used to think a good deal of it he doesn't say i'm stupid but he hasn't got the smallest respect for my mind i am not sure whether he is right but i expect seeing so much of hugh made me think i was clever i wonder if being in love makes people stupid he himself seems to me to be not quite so subtle as he was and perhaps it's my fault what do you think mama chapter ix it was the morning after christmas day and dodo and jack had just driven off from meering on their way to winston where a shooting party was to assemble that day leaving behind them a party that regretted their departure but did not mean to repine edith arbuthnot had promised to arrive two days before to take over from dodo the duty of chaperone but she had not yet come nor had anything whatever been heard of her which shows said berts lucidly that nothing unpleasant can have happened to mother or we should have heard until she came nadine had very kindly consented to act as regent and in that capacity she appeared in the hall a little while after dodo had gone with a large red contadina umbrella a book or two and an expressed determination to sit out on the hillside till lunch time it is boxing day i know she said but it is too warm to box even if i knew how the english climate has gone quite mad and i have told my maid to put my fur coat in a box with those little white balls until may now i suppose you are all going to play the foolish game with those other little white balls till lunch seymour was seated in the window sill stitching busily at a piece of embroidery which antoinette had started for him i am going to do nothing of the sort he said it is much too fine a day to do anything so limited as to play golf besides there is no one here fit to play with nadine will you be very kind and ring for my maid i am getting in a muddle berts who was sitting near him got up looking rather ill also he resented being told he was not fit to play with may i have my perambulator please nadine he asked seymour grinned berts you are easier to get a rise out of than any one i ever saw he remarked it is hardly worth while fishing for you for you are always on the feed and if you attempt to rag i shall prick you with my needle nadine lingered a little after the others had gone and as soon as they were alone seymour put down his embroidery may i come and sit on the hillside with you he asked or is the the box seat already engaged hugh suggested it she said i was going out with him seymour picked up his work again it seems to me i am behaving rather nicely he said at the same time i'm not sure that i am not behaving rather anemically i haven't seen you much since i came down here and after all i didn't come down here to see esther nadine frowned and laid her hand on his arm but she did not do it quite instinctively it was clear she thought it would be appropriate certainly that was quite clear to seymour take that hand away he said you only put it there because it was suitable you didn't want to touch me nadine removed her hand as if his coat sleeve was red hot you are rather a brute she said no i am not unless it is brutal to tell you what you know already i repeat that i am behaving rather nicely it was owing to him to do him justice i know you are she said you are behaving very nicely indeed but it is only for a short time seymour i don't mean that you won't always behave nicely but that there are only a limited number of days on which this particular mode of niceness will be required of you or be even possible hugh is going away next week after that you and i will be darby and joan before he sees me again you are all behaving nicely he is too he just wanted one week more of the old days when we didn't think but only babbled and chattered i can't say that he is reviving them with very conspicuous success he doesn't babble much and i am sure he thinks furiously all the time but he wanted the opportunity it wasn't much to give him especially since i pay said seymour quickly he saw the blood leap to nadine's face i'm sorry he said i oughtn't to have said that though it is quite true but i pay gladly you must believe that also and i'm glad hugh is behaving nicely that he doesn't indulge in in embarrassing reflections also when does he go away tuesday i think morning asked seymour hopefully nadine laughed he had done that cleverly making a parody and a farce out of that which a moment before had been quite serious you deserve it should be she said then it is sure to be in the afternoon now i've finished being spit fire i want to ask you something you haven't been up to your usual form of futile and clannish conversation you have been rather plaintive and windy windy asked nadine yes full of sighs and i should say it was shakespeare are you worrying about anything she looked up at him with complete candor why of course about hughie she said how should i not i don't care two straws about that said seymour as long as your worrying is not connected with me i mean i am sorry you worry but i don't care of course you worry about hugh i understand that because i understand what hugh feels and one doesn't like one's friends feeling like that but it's not about about you and me nadine shook her head and seymour got up well let us all be less plaintive he said i have been rather plaintive too i think i shall go and take on that great foolish berts at golf he will be plaintive afterwards but nobody minds what berts is whatever plaintiveness there was about was certainly not shared by the weather which if it was mad as nadine had suggested was possessed by a very genial kind of mania an octave of spring like days with serene suns and calm seas and light breezes from the southwest had decreed an oasis in midwinter warm halcyon days made even in december the snowdrops and aconites to blossom humbly and bravely and set the birds to busy themselves with sticks and straws as if nesting time was already here new grass already sprouted green among the grayness of the older growths and it seemed almost cynical to doubt that spring was not verily here indeed where hugh and nadine sat this morning it was may not march that seemed to have invaded and conquered december there lay upon the hillside a vernal fragrance that set a stray bee or two buzzing round the honied sweetness of the gorse with which the time of blossoming is never quite over and to day all the winds were still and no breeze stirred in the bare slender birches or set the spring like stalks of the heather quivering only very high up in the unplumbed blue of the zenith thin fleecy clouds lay stretched in streamers and combed feathers of white showing that far above them rivers of air swept headlong and swift nadine had a favorite nook on this steep hillside below the house reached by a path that stretched out to the south of the bay it was a little hollow russet colored now with the bracken of the autumn and carpeted elsewhere by the short napped velvet of the turf just in front the cliff plunged sheer down to the beach where they had so often bathed in the summer and where the reef of tumbled sandstone rocks stretched out into the waveless sea like brown amphibious monsters that were fish at high tide and grazing beasts at the ebb down there below a school of gulls hovered and fished with wheelings of white wings but not a ripple lapped the edges of the rocks only the sea breathed softly as in sleep stirring the fringes of brown weed that had gathered there but no thinnest line of white showed breaking water along the sandy foreshore of the bay there was the same stillness heaven and earth and ocean lay as if under an enchantment the sand dunes opposite and the hills beyond lay reflected in the sea as if in the tranquillity of some land locked lake there was a spell a hush over the world to be broken by god knew what gentle awakening of activity or catastrophic disturbance the two had walked to this withdrawn hollow of the hill almost in silence he had offered to carry her books for her but she had said that they were of no weight and after pause he had announced a fragment of current news to which she had no comment to add but had noticed the windless unnatural calm of the day something in this unusual stillness of weather had set her nerves a quiver and perhaps the position she was in bound as she was to seymour not struggling against it but quite accepting it made ordinary intercourse difficult for she had it all her own way hugh was behaving with exemplary discretion seymour was behaving with admirable tolerance and just because they both made her own part so easy for her she womanlike found the smoothed out performance of it to be difficult had she instructed each of them how to behave her instructions were carried out to the letter's foot they were impeccable as lover and rejected lover and therefore she wanted something different the situation was completely of her own making her actors played their parts exactly as she would have them play and yet there was something wanting they were too well drilled too word perfect too certain to say all she had designed for them from the right spot and in the right voice true for a moment just now seymour had shown signs of individualism when he called attention to the fact that he was behaving very nicely and that he would be glad when the scene was over but hugh had shown none whatever except for the fact that he had been asked to be allowed a few days like the old days agone before he left england he had assured her in the summer that he would never seek to get back into the atmosphere of unthinking intimacy again but poor fellow when there were to be so few days left him before the situation was sealed and made irrevocable his heart had cried out against the edict of his will and foolish though it might be he had asked for this week of meering days but from his point of view no less than from hers they had been but a parody of what he had hoped for they had been frozen and congealed by the reserve and restraint that he dared not break below that surface ice he knew how swiftly ran the torrent in his soul but the ice quite stretched from shore to shore it was this which disappointed nadine for she equally with hugh had expected that he could realize the impossible and that he loving her as he did and knowing that she was so soon to give herself to another man could cast off the knowledge of that and resume for a space the unshackled intimacy of old the ethiopian and the leopard would have found their appropriate feats far easier for it was hugh's bones and blood he had to change not mere skin and hair and the very strength of the bond that bound him to her made the insuperableness of the barrier he felt every moment the utter failure of his attempt while she who thought she understood him so well had no notion how radical the failure was not loving she could not understand he knew that now and thought bitterly of the little fireworks of words she had once lit for him on that same text believing that by the light of those quick little squibs she could read his heart so when they were settled in their nook once again she tried to recapture the old ease she pointed downwards over the edge of the cliff oh hughie what a morning she said quiet sea and gulls and bees and gorse what a summer in december a truce with winter isn't it i've brought a handful of nice books shall i read oh soon said he but your summer in december isn't going to last long there is a wind coming and a big one look at the mare's tails of clouds up above can't you smell the wind coming i always can and the barometer has dropped nearly an inch since last night he put back his head and sniffed moving his nostrils rather like a horse oh how fascinating said nadine if i do that shall i smell the wind it made her sneeze instead i don't think much of that she said i expect you looked at the barometer before you smelt the wind besides how is it possible to smell the wind before there is any wind to smell and when it comes you feel it instead it will be a big storm said hugh even as he spoke some current of air stirred the surface of the sea below them shattering the reflections it was as if some great angel of the air had breathed on the polished mirror of the water dimming it next moment the breath cleared away again and the surface was as bright and unwavering as before but some half dozen of the gulls that had been hovering and chiding there rose into the higher air leaving their feeding ground and after circling round once or twice glided away over the sand dunes inland almost immediately afterwards another relay followed and another till the bay that had been so populous with birds was quite deserted they did not pause in their flight but went straight inland in decreasing specks of white till they vanished altogether the gulls seem to think so too said hugh then they are perfectly wrong said nadine the instincts nature implants in animals are almost invariably incorrect for instance the siberian tigers at the zoo for several years they never grew winter coats and all the naturalists went down on their knees and said 'o wonderful mother nature their instincts tell them this is a milder climate than siberia' but this winter the mildest ever known the poor things have grown the thickest winter coats ever seen so all the naturalists had to get up again and dust their trousers where they had knelt down put your money on the gulls and me said hugh look there again far away along the sands to nadine the most attractive feature about hugh was his eyes they had a far away look in them that had nothing whatever spiritual or sentimental in it but was simply due to the fact that he had extraordinarily long sight she obediently screwed up her eyes and followed his direction but saw nothing whatever of import it's getting nearer you'll see it soon said hugh soon she saw a whirlwind of sand was advancing towards them along the beach below revolving giddily as it came nearer they could see the loose pieces of seaweed and jetsam being caught up into it it came forward in a straight line perhaps as fast as a man might run getting taller as it approached and gyrating more violently then in its advance it came into collision with the wall of cliff on which they sat and was shattered they could hear like the sound of rain the sand and rubbish of which it was composed falling upon the rocks oh but did you invent that hughie she said it was quite a pretty trick was it a sign to this faithless generation which is me that you could smell the wind or did the gulls do it prophesy to me again he lay back on the dry grass trouble coming trouble coming he said just the storm she asked or is this more prophecy oh just the storm he said i always feel depressed and irritated before a storm are you depressed and irritated she asked sorry i thought it was such a nice calm morning hugh took up a book at random which proved to be swinburne's poems and ballads at random he opened it and saw the words and though she saw all heaven in flower above she would not love oh do read said nadine anything just where you opened it hugh sat up a bitterness welling in his throat he read and though she saw all heaven in flower above she would not love nadine flushed slightly and was annoyed with herself for flushing she could not help knowing what must be in his mind and tried to make a diversion i don't think she was to be blamed she said a quantity of flowers stuck all over the sky would look very odd and i don't think would kindle anybody's emotions that sounds rather a foolish poem read something else hugh shut the book 'though all we fell on sleep she would not weep' is the end of another stanza he said nadine looked at him for a long moment her lips parted as if to speak but they only quivered no words came there was no doubt whatever as to what hugh meant but still with love unawakened and with her tremendous egotism rampant she saw no further than he was behaving very badly to her he had come down here to renew the freedom and intimacy of old days till to day he had been silent stupid but when he spoke like this silence and stupidity were better she was sorry for him very sorry but the quiver of her lips half at least consisted of self pity that he made her suffer too you mean me she said speaking at length and speaking very rapidly it is odious of you you know quite well i am sorry i have told you so i cried i remember i cried when you made that visit to winston and the cow looked at me i daresay you are suffering damned torments but you are being unfair though i don't love you like that i wish i did do you think i make you suffer for my own amusement is it fun to see my best friend like that is it my fault you have chosen to love this heartless person me if i had no liver or no lungs instead of no heart you would be sorry for me instead you reproach me oh not in words but you meant me when you said that where is the book out of which you read there i do that to it i send it into the sea and when the gulls come back they will peck it or the sea will drown it first and the wind which you smell will blow it to america you don't understand you are more stupid than the gulls she made one swift motion with her arm and poems and ballads flopped in the sea as the book dived clear of the cliff into the high water sea below more imminent than the storm which hugh had prophesied was the storm in their souls he with his love baffled raged at the indifference with which she had given herself to another she distrusting for the first time the sense and wisdom of her gift raged at him for his rebellion against her choice don't speak she said for i will tell you more things first you are jealous of seymour hugh threw back his head and laughed jealous of seymour he cried do you really think i would marry you if you consented in the spirit in which you are taking him once it is true i wanted to you refused to cheat me those were your words and i begged you to cheat me i implored you to cheat me so long as you gave me yourself i didn't care how you took me so long as you took me but now i wouldn't take you like that now for this last week i have seen you and him together and i know what it is like you haven't seen us together much said nadine i have seen you enough i told you before that your marriage was a farce i was wrong it's much worse than a farce you needn't laugh at a farce but you can't help laughing at least i can't at a tragedy so ludicrous nadine got up the situation was as violent and sudden as some electric storm what had been pent up in him all this week had exploded something in her exploded also i think i hate you she said i am sure i despise you said he he got up also facing her it was like the bursting of a reservoir the great sheet of quiet water was suddenly turned into torrents and foam i despise you he said again you intended me to love you you encouraged me to let myself go all the time you held yourself in though there was nothing to hold in you observed you dissected you cut down with your damned scalpels and lancets to my heart and said 'how interesting to see it beating' then you looked coolly over your shoulder and saw seymour and said 'he will do he doesn't love me and i don't love him' but now he does love you and you probably guess that so very soon your lancet will come out again and you will see his heart beating and again you will say 'how interesting' but there will be blood on your lancet you are safe of course from reprisals no one can cut into you and see your blood flow because you haven't any blood you are something cold and hellish you often said you understood me too well now you understand me even better toast my heart fry it eat it up i am utterly at your mercy and you haven't got any mercy but i can manage to despise you i can't do much else nadine stood quite still breathing rather quickly and that movement of the nostrils which she had tried to copy from him did not make her sneeze now it is well we should know each other she said with an awful cold bitterness even though we shall know each other for so little time more it is always interesting to see the real person if you mean me he said hotly i always showed you the real person i have never acted to you nor pretended and i have not changed i am not responsible if you cannot see nadine passed her tongue over her lips they seemed hard and dry not flexible enough for speech it was my blindness then she said but we know where we are now i hate you and you despise me we know now then suddenly an impulse wholy uncontrollable and coming from she knew not where seized and compelled her she held out both her hands to him hughie shake hands with me she said this has been nightmare talk a bad thing that one dreams shake hands with me and that will wake us both up what we have been saying to each other is impossible it isn't real or true it is utter nonsense we have been talking how he longed to take her hands and clasp them and kiss them how he longed to wipe off all he had said all she had said but somehow it was beyond him to do it it was by honest impulse that the words of hate and contempt had risen to their lips the words might be canceled but what could not be quenched until some mistake was shown in the workings of their souls was the thought fire that had made them boil up she stood there lovely and welcoming the girl whom his whole soul loved whose conduct his whole soul despised eager for reconciliation yearning for a mutual forgiveness but her request was impossible god could not cancel the bitterness that had made him speak he threw his hands wide it's no good he said i am sorry i said certain things for there was no use in saying them but i can't help feeling that which made me say them cancel the speeches by all means let the words be unsaid with all my heart but let us be prepared to say them again said nadine quietly it comes to that yes it comes to that i am not jealous of seymour i laughed when you suggested it and i am not jealous because you don't love him if you loved him i should be jealous and i should say 'god bless you' as it is as it is you say 'damn you' said nadine hugh shook his head you don't understand anything about love he said how can you until you know a little bit what it means i could no more think or say 'damn you' than i could say 'god bless you' nadine had withdrawn from her welcome and desire for reconciliation neither would make any difference to me she said i don't suppose they would since i make no difference to you said he but there is no sense in adding hypocrisy to our quarrel nadine sat down again on the sweet turf i cancel my words then even if you do not she said i don't hate you i can't hate you any more than you can despise me we must have been talking in nightmare i am used to nightmare said hugh i have had six months of nightmare i thought that i could wake i thought i could could pinch myself awake by seeing you and seymour together but it's still nightmare nadine looked up at him oh hughie if i loved you she said hugh looked at her a moment and then turned away from her outside of his control certain muscles worked in his throat he felt strangled i can say 'god bless you' for that nadine he said huskily i do say it god bless you my darling nadine had leaned her face on her hands when he turned away she divined why he turned from her she heard the huskiness of his voice and the thought of hughie wanting to cry gave her a pang that she had never yet known the like of there was a long silence she sitting with hand buried face he seeing the sunlight swim and dance through his tears then he touched her on the shoulder so we are friends again in spite of ourselves he said just one thing more then since we can talk without without hatred and contempt why did you refuse to marry me because you did not love me and yet consent to marry seymour like that she looked up at him oh hughie you fool she said because you matter so much more he smiled back at her i don't want to wish i mattered less he said you couldn't matter less he had no reply to this and sat down again beside her after a little nadine turned to him and i said i thought it was such a calm morning she said and i said that storm was coming said he she laid her hand on his knee and will there be some pleasant weather now she said oh hughie what wouldn't i give to get two or three of the old days back again when we babbled and chattered and were so content speak for yourself miss said hugh and for god's sake don't let us begin again i shall quarrel with you again and and it gives me a pain look here it's a bad job for me all this but i came here to get an oasis also to pinch myself awake metaphors are confusing things bring on your palms and springs they haven't put in an appearance yet let's try anyhow nadine sat up talking of the weather she began i wasn't yes you were before we began to exchange compliments she broke off suddenly oh hughie what has happened to the sun she said i know it is the moon said hugh you needn't quote that the shrew is tamed for a time it's a shrew mouse a lady mouse with a foul temper do you think about the sun look it was worth looking at right round it two or three diameters away ran a complete halo a pale white line in the abyss of the blue sky the little feathers of wind blown clouds had altogether vanished and the heavens were untarnished from horizon to zenith but the heat of the rays had sensibly diminished and though the sunshine appeared as whole hearted as ever it was warm no longer this is my second conjuring trick said hugh i make you a whirlwind and now i make you a ring round the sun and cut off the heating apparatus things are going to happen look at the sea too my orders the sea was also worth looking at an hour ago it had been turquoise blue reflecting the sky now it seemed to reflect a moonstone it was gray white a corpse of itself as it had been then even as they looked it seemed to vanish altogether the horizon line was blotted out for the sky was turning gray also and both above and below over the cliff edge there was nothing but an invisible gray of emptiness the sun halo spread both inwards and outwards so that the sun itself peered like a white plate through some layer of vapor that had suddenly formed across the whole field of the heavens and still not a whistle or sigh of wind sounded hugh got up as i have forgotten what my third conjuring trick is he said i think we had better go home it looks as if it was going to be a violent one he paused a moment peering out into the invisible sea then there came a shrill faint scream from somewhere out in the dim immensity hold on to me nadine he cried or lie down he felt her arm in his and they stood there together the scream increased in volume becoming a maniac bellow then like a solid wall the wind hit them it did not begin out of the dead calm as a breeze it did not grow from breeze to wind it came from seawards like the waters of the red sea on the hosts of pharaoh an overwhelming wall of riot and motion nadine's books all but the one she had cast over the cliff's edge turned over and lay with flapping pages then like wounded birds they were blown along the hillside the hat she had brought out with her but had not put on rose straight in the air and vanished hugh with nadine on his arm had leaned forward against this maniac blast and the two were not thrown down by it the path to the house lay straight up the steep hillside behind them and turning they were so blown up it that they stumbled in trying to keep pace to that irresistible torrent of wind that hurried them along it took them but five minutes to get up the steep brae while it had taken them ten minutes to walk down and already there flew past them seaweed and sand and wrack blown up from the beach below above the sun was completely veiled a riot of cloud had already obscured the higher air but below all was clear and it looked as if a stone could be tossed upon the hills on the farther side of the bay they had to cross the garden before they came to the house already two trees had fallen before this hurricane blast and even as they hurried over the lawn an elm screaming in all its full foliaged boughs leaned towards them and cracked and fell then a chimney in the house itself wavered in outline and next moment it crashed down upon the roof and a covey of flying tiles fell round them it required hugh's full strength to close the door again after they had entered and nadine turned to him flushed and ecstatic hughie how divine she said it can't be measured that lovely force it's infinite i never knew there was strength like that why have we come in let's go out again it's god it's just god his eyes too were alight with it and his soul surged to his lips yes god he said and that's what love is rather rather big isn't it and then for the first time nadine understood she did not feel but she was able to understand oh hughie she said how splendid it must be to feel like that the section of the party which had gone to play golf on this changeable morning were blown home a few minutes later and they all met at lunch edith arbuthnot had arrived before any of them got back and asked if the world had been blown away as it had not she expressed herself ready to chaperone anybody and berts is happy too said seymour when he came in very late for lunch since he wished to change all his clothes first as they 'smelled of wind' because berts has at last driven a ball two hundred yards don't let us mention the subject of golf it would be tactless there was no wind when he accomplished that remarkable feat at least not more wind than there is now what there was was behind him and he topped his ball heavily i said 'good shot' but i have tact since i have tact i don't say to nadine that it was a good day to sit out on the hillside and read i would scorn the suggestion a sudden sound as of drums on the window interrupted this tactful speech and the panes streamed anyhow i shall play golf said edith what does a little rain matter i'm not made of paper that's a good thing mother said berts if you want to win a match play with berts said seymour pensively but if you only want to be blown away and killed anybody will do i shall get on with my embroidery this afternoon and my maid will sit by me and hold my hand dear me i hope the house is well built for the moment it certainly seemed as if this was not the case for the whole room shook under a sudden gust more appalling than anything they had felt yet then it died away again and once more the windows were deluged with sheets of rain flung it seemed almost horizontally against them for a few minutes only that lasted and then the wind settled down so it seemed to blow with a steady uniform violence nadine had finished lunch and gone across to the window the air was perfectly clear and the hills across the bay seemed again but a stone's throw away overhead straight across the sky stretched a roof of cloud but away to the west just above the horizon line there was an arch of perfectly clear sky of pale duck's egg green and out of this it seemed as out of a funnel the fury of the gale was poured the garden was strewn with branches and battered foliage and the long gravel path flooded by the tempest of rain was discharging itself upon the lawn where pools of bright yellow water were spreading across it too lay the wreck of the fallen trees the splintered corpses of what an hour ago had been secure and living things waiting warm and drowsy for the tingle of springtime and rising sap like the bodies of young men on a battlefield with their potentialities of love and life unfulfilled there by the blast of the insensate fury of the wind they lay stricken and dead and the birds would no more build in their branches nor make their shadowed nooks melodious with love songs no more would summer clothe them in green nor autumn in their liveries of gold they were dead things and at the most would make a little warmth on the hearth before the feathery ash all that was left of them was dispersed on the homeless winds but the pity of this blind wantonness of destruction was more than compensated for in the girl's mind by the savagery and force of the unlooked for hurricane and she easily persuaded hugh to come out with her and be beaten and stormed upon always sensitive to the weather this portentous storm had aroused in her a sort of rapture of restlessness she rejoiced in it and somehow feared it for its ruthlessness and indifference they took the path that led downward to the beach for it was the tumult and madness of the sea that nadine especially wished to observe though as yet the gale had been blowing only an hour or two it had raised a monstrous sea and long before they came down within sight of it they heard the hoarse thunder and crash of broken waters penetrating the screaming bellow of the gale and the air was salt with spray and flying foam to the west there was still clear that arch of open sky through which the gale poured somewhere behind the clouds to the left of it the sun was near to its setting and a pale livid light shone out of it catching the tops of the breakers as they streamed landwards between these foam capped tops lay gray hollows and darknesses out of which would suddenly boil another crest of mountainous water the tide was only at half flood but the sea packed by the astounding wind was already breaking at the foot of the cliffs themselves while in the troughs of the waves as they rode in there appeared and disappeared again the scattered rocks from some remote cliff fall that were strewn about the beach sometimes a wave would strike one of these full and be shattered against it spouting heavenwards in a column of solid water oftener the breakers swept over them unbroken until with menace of their toppling crests they flung themselves with huge tongues of hissing water on the rocks at the foot of the cliffs then with the scream of the withdrawn shingle the spent water was furiously dragged back to the base of the next incoming wave and was caught up again to hurl itself against the land sometimes a sudden blast of wind would cut off the crest of the billow even as it curled over and fling it a monstrous riband of foam through the air sometimes two waves converging rose up in a fountain of water and fell back without having reached the shore this way and that rushing and rolling in hills and valleys of water the maddened sea crashed and thundered and every moment the spray rose more densely from the infernal cauldron then as the tide rose higher the waves came in unbroken and hurled their tons of water against the face of the cliff itself above continuous as a water fall rose the roar and scream of the gale ominous insensate bewildering it was as if the elements were being transferred back into the chaos out of which they came nadine and hugh clinging together for support stood there for some minutes half way down the side of the cliff watching the terror and majesty of the spectacle she utterly absorbed in it and cruelly unconscious of him then since they could no longer get down to the base of the cliff they skirted along it till they came to the sandy foreshore of the bay there from water level they could better see the hugeness of the tumult the strange hardness and steepness of the wave slopes it was as if a line of towers and great buildings were throwing themselves down upon the sands and breaking up into walls and eddies of foam sheeted water while behind them there rose again another street of toppling buildings which again shattered itself on the beach great balls of foam torn from the spent water trundled by them on the sands and bunches of brown seaweed torn from the rocks were flung in handfuls at their feet once from the arch in the sky westwards a dusky crimson light suddenly burned turning the wave crests to blood and then as the darkness of the early winter sunset gathered they turned and were blown up the steep cliff path again wet and buffeted conversation had been altogether impossible and they could but communicate with pointing finger and nodding head yet somehow to be together thus cut off by the rise of winds and waves from all sense of the existence of others in that pandemonium of tempest gave to hugh at least a closer feeling of intimacy with nadine than he had ever yet known she clung to him she sheltered under his shoulder unconsciously instinctively as an animal trusts his master without knowing it is trusting and that to his aching hunger for her was something but the gale was to bring them closer together yet chapter x all the evening and all night long the gale continued now and then the constant scream of it would leap upwards a couple of octaves as a shriller blast struck the houses and again for a moment the mad chant would drop into silence from time to time like a tattoo of drums the rain battered at the window panes but through it all whether in hushes of the wind or when its fiercest squall descended the beat of the surf sounded ever louder and all through the night the result perhaps of his agitated talk with nadine in the morning or of his intimate gale encompassed isolation with her in the afternoon hugh turned and tossed midway between sleeping and waking sometimes he seemed to himself to be yelling round the house among the spirits of the air seeking admittance sometimes it seemed to him that he was being beaten on by the hammer of the surf and whether he was homelessly wandering outside among the spirits of the wind or was being done to death by those incessant blows of the beating waves it was nadine that he sought and as the night went on the anguish of his desire grew ever more acute and the beating of the waves a more poignant torture until while yet no faintest lightening of winter's dawn had touched the gross blackness of the night he roused himself completely and sat up in bed and turned on his light to him awake the riot outside was vastly magnified compared with the dimmer trouble of his dream so was his yearning for nadine his windows looked eastwards away from the quarter of the gale and getting out of bed he lifted a sash and peered out nothing whatever could be seen it was as if he gazed into the darkness of the nethermost pit out of which blown by the blast of the anger of god came the shrieks of souls that might not rest driven forever along drenched by the river of their unavailing tears even though he was awake the strange remote horror of nightmare was on him and it was in vain that he tried to comfort himself by saying like some child repeating a senseless lesson a deep depression has reached us traveling eastwards from the atlantic he tried to read but still the nightmare sense possessed him and he fancied he had to read a whole line neither more nor less between the poundings of the waves then as usually happens towards the end of these walpurgis nights he got back to bed again and slept calmly and dreamlessly he and seymour alone out of the party put in an appearance at breakfast time it seemed probable that the others were compensating themselves for a disturbed night by breakfasting upstairs and afterwards the two went out together to look at the doings of the night by this time the wind had considerably moderated the rain had ceased altogether and the thick pall of cloud that had last night overlain the sky was split up into fragments and islands and flying vapors so that here and there pale shafts of sunlight shone upon land and sea but the thunder of the surf had immeasurably increased and when they went to the cliff edge which he and nadine had passed down yesterday afternoon they looked upon an indescribable confusion of tremendous waters the tide was low but the bay was still packed with the sea heaped up by the wind and the end of the reef with its big scattered rocks was out beyond the walls of breaking water the sea appeared to have been driven distraught by the stress of the night cross currents carried the waves in all directions it almost seemed that some shrinking from the wall of cliff in front were trying to beat out to sea again quite out away from land they jousted and sparred with each other not jestingly but it seemed with some grim purpose as if they were practising their strength for deeds of earnest violence as for some fierce civil war among themselves it was round the furthest rocks of the reef that this sport of billowy giants most centered right across the bay ran some current that set on to the end of the reef and there it met with the waves coming straight in shore from the direction of the blowing of the gale then they spouted and foamed together yet not in play some purpose so regular were these rounds of combat seemed to underlie their wrestlings hugh threw away a charred peninsula of paper once a cigarette which the wind had smoked for him he never had felt much sense of comradeship in the presence of seymour and their after breakfast stroll had no more virtue than was the reward of necessary politeness there is something rather senseless in this display of wasted energy said seymour each of those waves would probably cook a dinner if its force was reasonably employed hugh in spite of his restless night had something of nadine's thrilled admiration for the turmoil and felt slightly irritated they would certainly cook your goose or mine he remarked seymour wondered whether it would be well to say do you allude to nadine as our goose but perhaps wisely refrained that would be to the good he said goose is a poor bird at any time but uneatable unless properly roasted hugh did not attend to this polite rejoinder for he had caught sight of something incredible not so far out at sea and he focused his eyes instantly on it for the moment what he thought he had seen completely vanished directly afterwards he caught sight of it again a fishing boat with mast broken reeling drunkenly on the top of a huge wave his quick long sighted eye told him in that one moment of slewing deck that it presented to them before it was swallowed from sight in the trough of the next wave that there were two figures on it clinging to the stump of the broken mast look he said there is a boat out there it rose again to the crest of a wave and again plunged giddily out of sight the incoming tide was bearing it swiftly shorewards swiftly also the cross current that set towards the end of the reef was bearing it there hugh did not pause he laid hold of seymour by the shoulder run up to the house he said and fetch a couple of men bring down with you as much rope as you can find don't say anything to nadine and the women but be quick he ran down to the beach himself as seymour went on his errand seeing at once that there were two things that might happen to this stricken wanderer of a ship in one case the incoming tide with its following waves might bear it straight on to the sandy beach in the other the cross current in which now it was laboring might carry it across to the reef where the waves were wrestling and roaring together it was in case of this first contingency that he ran down upon the sands to be ready the beach was steep there it would ride it until it was flung down by that fringe of toppling hard edged breakers in that tumble and scurry of surf it might easily be that strong arms could drag out of the fury of the backwash whatever was cast there the boat a decked fishing boat would be dumped down on the sand there would be a half minute or a quarter minute when something might be done on the other hand this greedy sucking current might carry it on to the reef then by the mercy of god a rope might be of some avail if a man could reach them as he ran down the cliff a sudden splash of sunlight broke through the clouds making a bright patch of illumination round the boat as it swung over another breaker there was only one figure there now lying full length on the deck and clinging with both hands to the stump of the mast then once again the water broke over it lucidly green in the sunlight and all hugh's heart went out to that solitary prone body lying there helpless in the hands of god and the gale his heart stood still to see whether when next the drifting boat reappeared it would be tenantless and with a sob in his throat oh thank god he said when he saw it again it was still doubtful whether the current or the tide would win and hugh pulled off his coat and waistcoat and threw them on the beach in order to be able to rush in unimpeded of hand and muscle then with a strange sickness of heart he saw that the boat was getting in nearer but moving sideways across to the left where the reef lay and he waited in the suspense of powerlessness the wind now had quite abated it was as if it had done its work in making ready this theater of plunging water now waited to observe what drama should be moving across the stage of billows soon from behind he heard across the shingle at the top of the beach the approach of the others seymour had brought berts and two men with him and they brought with them half a dozen long coils of rope part of the fire rescue apparatus of the house while watching and waiting for them his plan was quite made it was no longer possible to hope that the boat would come to land on the sandy beach where without doubt two or three able bodied men could rescue any one cast up but was driving straight on to the rocks once there rescue was all but impossible the only chance lay in reaching it before it was smashed to atoms on the immense boulders and sharp toothed fangs quickly he tied three of the ropes together and fastened the end round his body just below the shoulders and took off his boots i'm going in he said you all hold the rope and pay it out if i come near the end of it tie a fresh piece on suddenly across the shingle came footsteps and a cry nadine ran down the beach towards them she was clad only in a dressing gown that rainbow hued one in which one night last june she had entertained a company in her bedroom and slippers so that her ankles showed white and bare she saw what hugh intended and something within her some denizen of her soul who till that moment had been unknown to her took possession of her no hughie not you not you she screamed seymour anybody but not you the cry had come from her very heart she could no more have stifled it than she could have stopped the beating of it then suddenly she realized what she had said and sank down on the beach burying her face in her hands take care of her seymour said hugh and there was more heroism required for these few little words than for the desperate feat he was about to attempt he did not look round again nor wish to say anything more and there was no time to lose now you chaps he called out and ran forward to the edge of the water at the moment an immense billow poised and curled just in front of him the wash of it covered him waist deep and he floundered and staggered as the rush of water went by him then as it drew out to sea again he ran with it to where another breaker was toppling in front of him with a low outward spring he dived into the hollowed water head foremost and passed through it the beach was very steep here and coming up again through and beyond the line of surf he found himself in deep water behind him lay the breaking line of billows but in front the huge mountains of water rose and fell unbroken as he was lifted up on the first of these swimming strongly against it he saw not a hundred yards from him his helpless and drifting goal he could see too who it was who lay there desperately clinging to the stump of the mast with white slender wrists it was quite a young boy and at that sight hugh's pity and determination were strung higher than ever here was a young creature in desperate plight among these desperate waterways one who should not yet have known what peril meant and at the risk of spending a little strength when strength was so valuable hugh gave a great shout of notice and encouragement then he was swallowed up in the trough of a wave again but when he rose next he saw that the boy had raised his head and that he saw him the current that swept towards the rocks swept also a little shorewards and hugh measuring the distance between the boat and the fatal breakers with his eye and measuring again the distance between the boat and himself knew that he must exert himself to the point of exhaustion to get to the boat before it was drifted to its final destruction but as he swam he knew he had made a mistake in not taking off his shirt and trousers also and giving himself an unimpeded use of his limbs his trousers particularly dragged and hampered him then suddenly he remembered a water game at which he used to be expert at school namely taking a header into the bathing place in flannels and undressing in the water it seemed worth while to sacrifice a few seconds to accomplish that and as cool and collected as when he was doing it for mere sport at school he trod water slipped his legs out of his trousers and saw them float away from him then twice as vigorous he struck out again his shirt did not bother him besides the rope was tied round his chest and there was not time for more disencumbrances for the next five minutes for he was fighting the tide he just swam and swam occasionally rising to a wave it seemed to him that he was making no headway at all but somehow that did not discourage him the only necessity that concerned him was that he must go till he could go no longer and all the time like a dream and yet like a draught of wine to him was nadine's involuntary cry no hughie not you he did not trouble to guess what that meant he was only conscious that it invigorated and inspired him the minutes passed once the rope seemed to jerk him back and he found himself swearing underneath his breath then though it was terribly heavy he realized that it was free again and that he was not being hampered then he suddenly found himself much closer to the boat than he had any idea of and this though he was getting very tired gave him a new supply of nervous force he swam into three valleys more he surmounted three ridges of water and lo the boat was on the peaks directly opposite to him and from opposite sides they plunged into the same valley together not fifty yards off to the left incredible fountains of foam spouted and aspired then oh blessed moment he caught hold of the side of the lurching fishing smack and a pale little boyish frightened face was close to his he clung for a second to the side and they went up and down two big billows together then he got breath enough to speak now little chap he said don't be frightened for we're all right catch hold of the rope here close to my body and just jump in yes that's right plucky boy take hold with both hands of the rope not so cold is it once again before he let go of the boat they rose to an immense wall of water and hugh saw the figures on the beach four of them standing in the wash of the sea paying out the rope and one standing there also a little apart waving seawards clapping her hands and what she said came to him clear and distinct across the hills and valleys of destruction oh hughie well done well done she cried now pull all of you pull him in he was glad she added that for in the hurry of the moment he had given no instructions as to what they were to do when he reached the boat and what seemed so obvious out here might not have seemed so obvious to those on the beach and he was not sure that there was enough power left in him to shout to them but nadine understood once she had said she understood him too well it was enough now that she understood him enough he let go of the boat for a moment it seemed inclined to follow them and he thought the bowsprit was going to hit him then he felt a little pull on the rope under his shoulders and the boat made a sort of bow of farewell and slid away towards the spouting towers of foam hugh was utterly exhausted he could just paddle with a hand or kick downwards to keep his head above water but he gave away one breath yet nothing to be frightened at he said we're all right now the buoyant water for all the wickedness of its foam and savage hunger sustained him sufficiently he turned round seawards in the water so that the great surges did not overwhelm him from behind and put an arm on the rope underneath the boy's neck so as to support them both he forced himself even in his utter weariness to be collected and to remember that for several minutes yet there was nothing whatever to be done except with the minimum possible of exertion to keep afloat while the rope towed them back towards that line of steep towers and curling precipices beyond which lay the shore and those who stood on the shore sometimes the crest of a wave broke over them almost smothering him but then again they found themselves on a downward hillside of water where the panting lungs could be satisfied and the laboring heart supplied somewhere inside of him he knew he wanted to know where this poor foundered fishing smack had come from and how this young boy had managed to cling to it but he had not sufficient strength to give voice to his desire for all that he had must be husbanded to meet that final assault of the row of breakers through which they had to pass and as they got nearer he began to form his plan this young unknown life precious to him now as an unborn baby to a woman was given into his charge it seemed to him that as a woman has to bring the life within her to birth whatever it costs her so he had to save the life of this unknown little fisher boy and take all risks himself whatever lay beyond that line of breakers his business was here and he did not for one second argue the values he did not forget nadine nor her last cry to him as he set forth on his peril but for the moment there was something that concerned him even more than nadine and he had to make the best plans he could for saving this young life that had been put in his hands even if he fought god over it the only question was how to get the best chance of saving it they were close in now and this three minute pause of floating had restored him he was just conscious of bitter cold even as he was conscious of the group on the edge of the sand and of the hissing waters but none of these things seemed to have anything to do with him they were but external phenomena between him and the shore were still three towering lines of breakers sharp edged and steep as rocks the third of these suddenly fumbled and disappeared with a thick thud and an uprising of shattered spray and suddenly his plan proved itself fully finished to his mind he had been swimming for not more than a quarter of an hour and the minutes of that fierce outward struggle which had seemed so long to him had to nadine passed in a flash for once she had got completely outside herself and concentrated and absorbed in another the time had gone by in one flare of triumphant expectation for one moment after that heart's cry had been flung out of her she had sat dazed and bewildered by the consciousness that it seemed to have revealed to her for until she had cried out that seymour that anybody but hugh must make the desperate attempt she had not known her own heart nor could she have for it was not till then that it was unlocked to herself when she looked up again hugh had already plunged through the breakers and was swimming and instantly her soul was with him there in the inhuman sea glorying in his strength proud of the splendid and desperate adventure and not for one moment doubtful of its success none but he she felt could do it and it was impossible that he should fail she would not have had him back by her side saying that the attempt was mere suicide for all the happiness that the world contained and had she been able to change places with the boy who clung to the helpless boat she would have sprung ecstatic to the noble risk for the sake of having hugh battle the seas on his way to rescue her failing that it had been gloriously ordained that he should do this and that she should stand with heart uplifted and be privileged to see the triumphant venture she saw him reach the boat knowing that he would and clapped her hands and called to him and with bright eyes and laughing mouth she eagerly watched him getting nearer then just at the moment when hugh made his plan she realized that between him and her there lay that precipice of water that kept flinging itself down in thunder on the shore and ever re forming again and the light died out of her face and she grew ashen gray to the lips and watched hugh had been floating with his face seawards now he turned round to the shore again she saw him smile at the boy as they rose on the crest of a wave and she saw him speak now we're all right was what he said get on my back and hold on to my shoulders the rope had ceased to pull the men in control of it just held it taut waiting to pull when the exact moment came the boy did as he was told and next moment the two rose up on the crest of the line of breakers twenty feet below him as they topped it hugh looked over upon the backwash of the preceding wave which was being dragged into the billow which bore them and was growing higher as it rose to its ruin but the boy's fall would be broken at least this plan seemed to give the best chance then the wave curled and he was flung forwards twisting as he fell he saw the slim little figure he had been carrying shot over his shoulder and flung clear of the direct impact of the wave on the beach and he heard his mind say that won't hurt him then he felt something stupendous as heavy as the world strike him on the back after that he felt nothing more at all as dusk was closing in nadine sat in the window of her big black painted bedroom where so many well attended sessions had been held hugh had been in the surgeon's hands since they carried him in and all that could be done had been done afterwards nadine had seen the surgeon and learned from him all there was to fear and the little there was to hope for it was possible that hugh might not live till the morning but simply pass away from the shock of his injuries on the other hand his splendid constitution might pull him through that but given that he lived through the immediate danger it was doubtful if he could ever lead an active life again the boy he had saved was practically unhurt and was fast asleep nadine sat there very quiet both in mind and body she did not want to rave or rebel she merely let her mind sit as it were in front of these things and contemplate them like a picture until they became familiar she felt they were not familiar yet though she knew them to be true they were somehow unreal and incredible she did not yet grasp them it seemed to her that her mind was stunned and was incapable of apprehending them so she had to keep her attention fixed on them until they became real yet she found it difficult to control her mind it kept wandering off into concentric circles round the center of the only significant thing in the world out on the sea the sun had set and there were cloud bars of fading crimson on the horizon level across a field of saffron yellow this yellow toned off into pale watery green and high up in the middle of that was one little cloud like an island that still blazed in the sunlight of the upper air somehow that aroused a train of half forgotten reminiscences there had been a patch of sunlight once like an island on the gray of the sea it was connected with a picture yes it was a sketch which esther had made for hugh and she had put in the island reluctantly saying it looked unreal in nature and would be worse in art but hugh had wanted it there and as esther worked she herself had walked with him along the beach from which he had been carried up to day and she had told him that he lived in unrealities and pictured to himself that some day he and she would live on some golden sunlit island together she remembered it all now her mind came back to the center again and started off anew on that splendid deed of the morning she had quite lost her head when she called out no hughie not you it must have been hugh to do it no one else could have done it the idea of berts or seymour wrestling with and overcoming that mountainous and maddened sea was unthinkable only hugh could have done it and the deed was as much part of him as his brown eyes or his white strong teeth and if at the end the sea had flung him down and broken him that was after he had laughed at the peril and snatched its prey out of its very jaws even as things were now with him nadine could not regret what he had done and if time had run back and she saw him again plunging into that riot and turmoil she felt that she would not now cry out to him like that she would have called godspeed to him instead once again her mind rippled away from its center she had called out to seymour or berts to go at the time it had been quite instinctive but she saw now what had prompted her instinct she meant though then she did not know she meant it that she could spare any one but hugh that was what it came to and she wondered if hugh had understood that seymour without doubt must have done so he was so clever probably he would tell her he understood and ask her if it was not that which was implied but all such consideration seemed to her to matter very little there was only one thing that mattered and that was not whether hugh lived or died even but simply the fact of hugh her mother had telegraphed that she was coming at once and nadine remembering that she had not told the servants got up and rang the bell but before it was answered there came an interruption for which she had been waiting one of the two nurses whom the surgeon from chester had brought with him knocked at the door she had been tidying up and removing all traces of what had been done the room is neat again now she said and you may come and just look at him is he conscious or in pain asked nadine no but he may regain consciousness at any time but i don't think he will have any pain they went together up the long silent passages in which there hung that curious hush which settles down on a house when death is hovering by it and came to his door which stood ajar then from some sudden qualm and weakness of flesh nadine halted shrinking from entering do not come unless you feel up to it said nurse bryerley but there is nothing that will shock you nadine hesitated no more but entered they had carried him not to his own room but to another with a dressing room adjoining his bed stood along the wall to the left of the door and he lay on his back with his head a little sideways towards it there was nothing in the room that suggested illness and when nadine looked at his face there was nothing there that suggested it either his eyes were closed but his face was as untroubled as that of some quiet sleeper in the wall opposite were the western looking windows and the room was lit only by that fast fading splendor the cloud island still hung in the sky but it had turned gray as the light left it then even as nadine looked at him his eyes opened and he saw her nadine he said the nurse stepped to the bedside ah you are awake again she said how do you feel rather tired but i want to speak to nadine yes you can speak to her she said and signed to the girl to come nadine came across the room to him and knelt down oh hughie she said well done he looked at her puzzled for the moment with troubled eyes you said that before he said it was the last thing you said why did you oh i remember now yes what a bang i came how's the little fellow the one on my back quite unhurt hughie he is asleep i thought he wouldn't be hurt it was the best plan i could think of i say why did you call to me not to go at first i had to i know now you had to said she i want to ask you something else how badly am i hurt nadine looked up at the nurse a moment who nodded to her she understood exactly what that meant you are very badly hurt dear hughie she said but but it is worth it fifty times over hugh was silent a moment am i going to die he asked nadine did not need instruction about this no a thousand times no she said you're going to get quite well but you must be patient and rest and sleep nadine's throat grew suddenly small and aching and she could not find her voice for a moment you are quite certainly going to live she said to begin with i can't spare you hugh's eyelids fluttered and quivered by jove he said and next moment they had quite closed the nurse signed to nadine to get up and she rose very softly and tiptoed away at the door she looked round once at hugh but already he was asleep then still softly she came back and kissed him on the forehead and was gone again she had been with him but a couple of minutes but as she went back to her room she heard the stir of arrivals in the hall and went down dodo had that moment arrived nadine my dear she said i started the moment i got your telegram tell me all you can how is he how did it happen you only said he had had a bad accident and wanted me nadine kissed her oh mama she said thank god it wasn't an accident it was done on purpose he meant it just like that but you don't know anything i forgot will you come to my room yes let us go now tell me at once we have had a frightful gale she said and this morning hughie saw a fishing boat close in land driving on to the reef there was just one shrimp of a boy on it and hughie went straight in like a duck to water and got him off and swam back with him there was a rope and seymour and berts pulled him in and when they got close in hughie put the boy on his back oh mama thank god for men like that and the breakers banged him down on the beach and the boy was unhurt and hughie may die very soon or he may live nadine's voice choked for a moment all day she had not felt a sob rise in her throat and if he lives she said he may never be able to walk again and i love him then came the tempest of tears tears of joy and sorrow a storm of them fruitful as autumn rain fruitful as the sudden deluges of april with god knows what warmth of sun behind the drought of summer in her the ice of winter in her had been broken up in the rain that makes the growth and the life of the world the frozen ground melted under it the soil cracked with drought drank it in the parody of life that she had lived became but the farce that preceded sweet serious drama tragedy it might be but something human and dodo woman also understood that she too had lived years that parodied herself and knew what the awakening to womanhood was and the immensity of that unsuspected kingdom it had come late to her to nadine early some were almost born in consciousness of their birthright others died without realizing it so mother and daughter they sat there in silence while nadine wept her fill it was the splendidest adventure she said at length lifting her head it was all so gay he shouted to that little boy in the boat to encourage him to cling on and oh those damned reefs were so close and when they rode in hughie like a horse with a child on his back over that that precipice he said something again to encourage him nadine broke down again for a moment hughie never thought about himself at all she said he used always to think about me but when he went on his adventure he didn't think about me he thought only of that little stupid boy god bless him and oh mummie i gave myself away i got down to the beach just before hughie went in and i lost my head and i screamed out 'not you hughie seymour berts anybody but not you' it wasn't i who screamed something inside me screamed and the one who screamed was was my love for hughie and i never knew of it but inside me something swelled and it burst yes hughie heard i am sure and seymour heard and i don't care at all nadine sat up with a sort of unconscious pride in her erectness i saw him just now she said and he quite knew me and asked if he was going to die i told him 'he certainly was not i couldn't spare him' nadine gave a little croaking laugh and he instantly went to sleep she said the veracious historian is bound to state that this was an adventure absolutely after dodo's heart all her life she had loved impulse and disregarded its possibly appalling consequences never had she reasoned before she acted and she could almost have laughed for joy at these blind strokes of fate hugh's splendid venture thrilled her even as it thrilled nadine and for the moment the result seemed negligible a great thing had 'got done' in the world now by all means let them hope for the best in its sequel and do their utmost to bring about the best not with a fainting or regretful heart but with a heart that rejoiced and sang over the glory of the impetuous deed that brought about these dealings of love and life dodo's eyes danced as she spoke danced and were dim at the same time oh nadine and you saw it she said how glorious for you to see that and to know at the same moment that you loved him and my dear if hughie is to die you must thank god for him without any regret there is nothing to regret and if he lives oh mama one thing at a time said nadine if he only lives if only i am going to be allowed to take care of him and to do what can be done she paused a moment i am so glad you have come she said it was dear of you to start at once like that did papa jack want you not to go my dear he hurried me off to that extent that i left the only bag that mattered behind that was nice of him they have been so hopeless all of them here because they didn't understand berts has been looking like a funeral all day the sort with plumes and edith has been running in and out with soup for me soup and mince and glasses of port i think i think seymour understood though because he was quite cheerful and normal oh mama if hughie only lives i will marry seymour as a thank offering dodo looked at her daughter in amazement not if seymour understands she said nadine frowned it's the devil's own mess she observed but the devil never cleans up his messes said dodo that's what we learn by degrees he makes them and we clean them up more or less that is to say she paused a moment and flung the spirit of her speech from her i don't mean that she said it is truer to say that god makes beautiful things and we spoil them and then he makes them beautiful again it is only people who can't see at all that see the other aspect of it i think they call them realists i know it ends in 'ist' but it doesn't matter what you call them they are wrong we have got to hold our hearts high and let them beat and let ourselves enjoy and be happy and taste things to the full it is easier to be miserable my dear for most people we are the lucky ones oh if i had been a charwoman like that thing in the play with a husband who stole and was sent to prison i should have found something to be happy about probably a large diamond in the grate which i should have sold without being traced these remarkable statements were not made without purpose dodo knew quite well that courage and patience and cheerfulness would be needed by nadine and she was willing to talk the most outrageous nonsense to give the sense of vitality to her to make her see that no great happening like this whatever the end was a thing to moan and brood over it must be taken with much more than resignation a quality which she despised and with hardly less than gaiety such at any rate was her private human gospel which she found had not served her so badly i have quite missed my vocation she said i ought to have been born in poverty stricken and criminal classes to show the world that being hungry does not make you unhappy any more than having three diamond tiaras makes you happy you've got that birthright nadine live up to it never anticipate trouble and if it comes embrace and welcome it it is part of life and thus it becomes your friend oh i wish i had been here this morning i would have shouted for glee to see that darling hughie go churning out to sea i am jealous of you just think if papa jack had come a wooing of you as i really thought he might be doing in the summer you would have married him and i should be looking after hughie isn't that like me i want everybody's good times myself these amazing statements were marvelously successful i won't give my good time away even to you said nadine no you are sharper than a serpent's tooth now darling we will go very quietly along the passage and just see if hughie is asleep i should so like to wake him up i know he is asleep in order to tell him how splendid it all is don't be frightened i'm not going to we will just go to the door and that enormous nurse whom i saw peering over the banisters will tell us to go away and then i shall go to dress for dinner and you will too oh mama i can't come down to dinner said nadine yes dear you can and you will there's going to be no sadness in my house if you don't i shall send edith up to you with mince and her 'cello and soup oh nadine and it was all just for a little stupid boy who very likely would have been better dead he will now probably grow up and be an anxiety to his parents if he's got any they usually haven't and come to a bad and early end what a great world chapter xi nadine enquired at hugh's door again that night before she went to bed and found that he was still asleep she had promised her mother not to sit up but as she undressed she almost smiled at the uselessness of going to bed so impossible did it seem that sleep should come near her after her one outburst of crying she had felt no further agitation for something so big and so quiet had entered her heart that all poignancy of anxiety and suspense were powerless to disturb it as has been said it was scarcely even whether hugh lived or died that mattered the only thing that mattered was hugh had she been compelled to say whether she believed he would live or not she would have given the negative and yet there was a quality of peace in her that could not be shaken it was a peace that humbled and exalted her it wrapped her round very close and yet she looked up to it as to a mountain peak on which dawn has broken despite her conviction that sleep was impossible she had hardly closed her eyes when it embraced and swallowed up all her consciousness this cyclone of emotion in the center of which dwelt the windless calm had utterly tired her out though she was unaware of fatigue and her rest was dreamless then suddenly she was aware that there was light in the room and that she was being spoken to and she passed from unconsciousness back to the full possession of her faculties as swiftly as they had been surrendered she found dodo bending over her come my darling she said nadine had no need to ask any question but as she put on her slippers and dressing gown dodo spoke again he has been awake for an hour and asking for you she said the nurse and the doctor are with him they think you had better come it is possible that if he sees you there he may go off to sleep again but it is possible you are not afraid darling nadine's mouth quivered into something very like a smile afraid of hughie she asked they went up the stairs and along the passage together the moon that last night had been hidden by the tempest of storm clouds or perhaps blown away from the sky by the wind now rode high and cloudlessly amid a multitude of stars no wind moved across those ample floors only from the beach they heard the plunge and thunder of the sea that could not so easily resume its tranquillity the moonlight came through the window of hugh's room also making on the floor a shadow map of the bars he was lying again with his face towards the door but now his eyes were vacantly open and his whole face had changed there was an agony of weariness over it and from his eyes there looked out a dumb unavailing rebellion before they had got to the door they had heard a voice inside speaking a voice that nadine did not recognize it kept saying over and over again nadine nadine as she came across the room to the bed he looked straight at her but it was clear he did not see her and the monotonous unrecognizable voice went on saying nadine nadine the doctor was standing by the head of the bed looking intently at hugh but doing nothing the nurse was at the foot he signed to nadine to come and took a step towards her you've got to make him feel you are here he said then with his hand he beckoned to the nurse and to dodo to stand out of sight of hugh so that by chance he might think himself alone with the girl nadine knelt down on the floor so that her face was close to those unseeing eyes and the mouth that babbled her name and the great peace was with her still she spoke in her ordinary natural voice without tremor yes hughie yes she said don't go on calling me here i am what's the use of calling now i came as soon as i knew you wanted me nadine nadine said hughie in the same unmeaning monotone hughie you are quite idiotic she said as if you didn't know in your own heart that i would always come when you wanted me i always would my dear you need never be afraid that i shall leave you i am yours don't you see nadine nadine said hugh nadine's whole soul went into her words hughie you are not with me yet she said i want you too and i mean to have you i didn't know till to day that i wanted you and now i can't do without you hughie do you hear she said oh answer me hughie dear there was dead silence then hugh gave a great sigh nadine he said but it was hugh's voice that spoke then she bent forward oh hughie you have come then she said welcome you don't know how i wanted you yes i'm here all right said hugh in a voice scarcely audible but i'm so tired it's horrible it's like death nadine gave her little croaking laugh it isn't like anything of the kind she said but of course you are tired wouldn't it be a good thing to go to sleep i don't know said hugh but i do i'm tired too hughie awfully tired if i leaned my head back against your bed i should go to sleep too nadine it is you said hugh oh my dear what other girl could be with you no that's true nadine would it bore you to stop with me a bit we might talk afterwards when when you've had a nap that will be ripping said nadine assuming a sleepy voice there was silence for a little then once again but in his own voice hugh spoke her name this time she did not answer and she felt his hand move till it rested against her plaited hair then in the silence nadine became conscious of another noise regular and slow as the faint hoarse thunder of the sea the sound of quiet breathing after a while the doctor came round the head of the bed we can manage to wrap you up and make you fairly comfortable he whispered i think he has a better chance of sleeping if you stop there the light and radiance in nadine's eyes were a miracle of beauty like some enchanted dawn rising over a virgin and unknown land she smiled her unmistakable answer but did not speak and presently dodo returned with pillows and blankets which she spread over her and folded round her the nurse will be in the next room said the doctor call her if anything is wanted dodo and the doctor went back to their rooms and nadine was left alone with hugh that night was the birthnight and the bridal night of her soul there was it born and through the long hours of the winter night it watched beside its lover and its beloved in that stillness of surrender to and absorption in another that lies beyond and above the unrest of passion amid the snows and sunshine of the uttermost regions to which the human spirit can aspire she knew nothing of the passing of the hours nor for a long time did any thought or desire of sleep come near her eyelids but the dim room became to her the golden island of which once in uncomprehending mockery she had spoken to hugh she knew it to be golden now and so far from being unreal there was nothing in her experience so real as it she could just turn her head without disturbing hugh's hand that lay on her plaited hair and from time to time she looked round at him his face still wore the sunken pallor of exhaustion but as his sleep so still and even breathing began to restore the low ebb of his vital force it seemed to nadine that the darkness of the valley of the shadow to the entrance of which he had been so near cleared off his face as eclipse passes from the moon how near he had been she guessed but it seemed to her that for the present his face was set the other way she knew too that it was she who had had the power to make him look life wards again and the knowledge filled her with a sort of abasing pride he had answered to her voice when he was past all other voices and had come back in obedience to it she did not and she could not yet be troubled with the thought of anything else besides the fact that hugh lived as far as was known yet he might never recover his activity of movement again and years of crippled life were all that lay in front of him but in the passing away of the immediate imminent fear she could not weigh or even consider what that would mean similarly the thought of seymour lay for the present outside the focus of her mind everything but the fact that hugh lived was blurred and had wavering outlines as the hours went on the oblongs of moonshine on the floor moved across the room narrowing as they went then the moon sank and the velvet of the cloudless sky grew darker and the stars more luminous one great planet tremulous and twinkling made a glory beside which all the lesser lights paled into insignificance no wind stirred in the great halls of the night the moans and yells of its unquiet soul were still and the boom of the surf grew ever less sonorous like the thunder of a retreating storm occasionally the night nurse appeared at the doorway of the room adjoining where she sat and as often nadine looked up at her smiling once very softly she came round the head of the bed and looked at hugh then bent down towards the girl won't you get some sleep she said and nadine made a little gesture of raised eyebrows and parted hands that was characteristic of her i don't know she whispered perhaps not i don't want to then her solitary night vigil began again and it seemed to her that she would not have bartered a minute of it for the best hour that her life had known before the utter peace and happiness of it grew as the night went on for still close to her head there came the regular uninterrupted breathing and the weight just the weight of a hand absolutely relaxed lay on her hair not the faintest stir of movement other than those regular respirations came from the bed and all the laughter and joy of which her days had been full was as the light of the remotest of stars compared to the glorious planet that sang in the windless sky when weighed against the joy that that quiet breathing gave her she did not color her consciousness with hope she did not illuminate it by prayer there was no room in her mind for anything except the knowledge that hugh slept and lived it was now near the dawning of the winter day the stars were paling in the sky and the sky grew ensaffroned with the indescribable hue that heralds day footfalls muffled and remote began to stir in the house and far away there came the sound of crowing cocks faint but exultant hailing the dawn about that time nadine looked round once more at hugh and saw in the pallid light of morning that the change she had noticed before was more distinct there had come back to his face something of the firm softness of youth there had been withdrawn from it the droop and hardness of exhaustion and turning again she gave one sigh and fell fast asleep lover and beloved they lay there sleeping while the dawn brightened in the sky she leaning against the bed where he was stretched he with his hand on her hair and strangely the moment that she slept their positions seemed to be reversed and hugh in his sleep appeared unconsciously to keep watch over and guard her though all night she had been awake for him once her head slipped an inch or two so that his hand no longer lay on her hair but it seemed as if that movement reached down to him fathom deep in his slumber and immediately afterwards his hand which had lain so motionless and inert all night moved as if to a magnet after that bright hair seeking and finding it again and dawn brightened into day and the sun leaped up from his lair in the east and still nadine slept and hugh slept it was as if until then the balance of vitality had kept the girl awake to pour into him of her superabundance now she was drained and sleep with the level stroke of his soft hand across the furrows of trouble and the jagged edges of injury and exhaustion comforted both alike it had been arranged after these events of storm that the party should disperse and dodo went to early breakfast downstairs with her departing guests who were leaving soon after but first she went into the nurse's room next door to where hugh lay to make enquiries and was taken by her to look into the sick room with daylight their sleep seemed only to have deepened it was like the slumber of lovers who have been long awake in passion of mutual surrender and at the end have fallen asleep like children with mere effacement of consciousness nadine's head was a little bowed forward and her breath came not more evenly than his it was the sleep of childlike content that bound them both and bound them together dodo looked long and then with redoubled precaution moved softly into the nurse's room again with mouth quivering between smiles and tears my dear i never saw anything so perfectly sweet she said do let them have their sleep out nurse and nadine has slept in hugh's room all night what ducks please god it shall so often happen again nurse bryerley was not unsympathetic but she felt that explanations were needed i understood the young lady was engaged to some one else she said dodo smiled but until now no one has quite understood the young lady herself she said least of all has she understood herself i think she will find that she is less mysterious now mr graves will have to take some nourishment soon said nurse bryerley dodo considered then could you not give him his nourishment very cautiously so that he will go to sleep again afterwards she asked i should like them to sleep all day like that but then you see nurse i am a very odd woman but don't disturb them till you must i think their souls are getting to know each other that may not be scientific nursing but i think it is sound nursing it's too bad we can't eternalize such moments of perfect equilibrium certainly the young lady was awake till nearly dawn said nurse bryerley it wouldn't hurt her to have a good rest dodo beamed oh leave them as long as possible she said you have no idea how it warms my heart there will be trouble enough when they awake seymour was among those who were going by the early train and when dodo came down he had finished breakfast he got up just as she entered how is he he asked dodo's warm approbation went out to him it was nice of you to ask that first dear seymour she said he is asleep he has slept all night seymour lit a cigarette i asked that first he said because it was a mixture of politeness and duty to do so i suppose you understand dodo took the young man by the arm come out and talk to me in the hall she said bring me a cup of tea the morning sunshine flooded the window seat by the door and dodo sat down there for one moment's thought before he joined her but she found that no thought was necessary she had absolutely made up her mind as to her own view of the situation and with all the regrets in the world for him she was prepared to support it in a minute seymour joined her nadine came down to the beach just before hugh went in yesterday morning he said and she called out called shouted out 'not you hughie seymour berts anybody but not you' there was no need for me to think what that meant dodo looked at him straight no my dear there was no need she said then i have been a a farcical interlude said he not very kindly you managed that farcical interlude you know you licensed it so to speak like the censor of plays yes i licensed it you are quite right but my dear i didn't license it as a farce there you wrong me i licensed it as what i hoped would be a very pleasant play you must be just seymour you didn't love her then nor she you you were good friends and there was no shadow of a reason to suppose that you would not pass very happy times together the great love the real thing is not given to everybody but when it comes we must bow to it it is royal all his flippancy and quickness of wit had gone from him next conversation remained only because it was a habit and i am royal he said i love nadine like that then you know that when that regality comes she said quickly it comes without control it is the same with nadine it is by no wish of hers that it came i must know that from nadine he said i can't take your word for it or anybody's except hers she made a promise to me she cannot keep it said dodo it is an impossibility for her she made it under different conditions and you put your hand to it under the same and nadine said you understood and behaved so delightfully yesterday all honor to you since behind your behavior there was that knowledge that royalty i had to but don't think i abdicated but she was in terrible distress and really aunt dodo the rest of your guests were quite idiotic berts looked like a frog he had the meaningless pathos of a frog on his silly face nadine said he looked like a funeral with plumes dodo permitted herself to interpolate more like a frog edith kept pouring out glasses of port to take to nadine but i think she usually forgot and drank them herself it was a lunatic asylum but nadine felt ah my dear said dodo with a movement of her hand on to his seymour quietly disengaged his own very gratifying he said but as i said i take nobody's word for it except nadine's she has got to tell me herself where is she i have to go in five minutes but to see her will still leave me four to spare dodo got up you shall see her she said but come quietly because she is asleep if she is only to talk to me in her sleep began he come quietly said dodo but all her pity was stirred and as they went along the passage to hugh's room she slipped her arm into his she knew that her coup was slightly theatrical but there seemed no better way of showing him it might fail he might still desire explanations but it was worth trying and remember i am sorry she said and be sure that nadine will be sorry riddles said seymour yes my dear riddles if you will said she but you may guess the answer dodo quietly turned the handle of the door into the nurse's room and entered with her arm still in his she made a sign of silence and took seymour straight through into the sick room all was as she had left it a quarter of an hour ago nadine still slept and hugh in that same attitude of security and love her head was drooped she slept as only children and lovers sleep but dodo with all her intuition did not see as much as seymour who loved her saw the truth of it was branded into his brain whereas it only shone in hers she saw the situation he felt it then with a signal of pressure on his arm she led him out again she has been there all night she said she only fell asleep at dawn they were in the passage again before seymour spoke there is no need for me to awake her or talk to her he said you were quite right and i congratulate you on your ensemble i should have guessed that it required most careful rehearsal and i should have been wrong and now for god's sake don't be kind and tender he took his arm away from hers feeling for her then more resentment than he might feel against the footman who conveyed cold soup to him he did not want the footman's sympathy nor did he want dodo's and spare me your optimism he said if you tell me it is all for the best i shall scream it isn't for the best as far as i am concerned it is damned bad i was a thing and nadine made a man of me now she is tired of her handiwork and says that i shall be a thing again and don't tell me i shall get over it the fact that i know i shall makes your information which was on the tip of your tongue wanton and superfluous but if you think i shall love hugh because he loves nadine you are utterly astray i am not a child in a sunday school letting the teacher smack both sides of my face i hate hugh and i am not the least touched by the disgusting spectacle you have taken me on tiptoe to see they looked like two amorous monkeys in the monkey house seymour suddenly paused and gasped they didn't he said at any rate nadine looked as i have often pictured her looking the difference is that it was myself not hugh beside whom i imagined her falling asleep that makes a lot of difference if you happen to be the person concerned and now i hope the motor is ready to take me away and many thanks for an absolutely damnable visit don't look pained it doesn't hurt you as much as it hurts me there is a real cliche to finish with dodo's coup had been sufficiently theatrical to satisfy her but she had not reckoned with the possible savageness that it might arouse seymour's temper as well as his love was awake and she had not thought of the two as being at home simultaneously but had imagined they played box and cox with each other in the minds of men here box and cox met and they were hand in hand he was convinced and angry she had imagined he would be convinced and pathetic with that combination she had felt herself perfectly competent to deal but his temper roused hers you are at least interesting she said briskly and i have enjoyed what you call your damnable visit as much as you you seem to have behaved decently yesterday but no doubt that was nadine's mistake not at all it was mine he said which you now recognize said she i am afraid you must be off if you want to catch your train good by good by said he he turned from her at the top of the stairs and went down a half dozen of them then suddenly he turned back again don't you see i'm in hell he said dodo entirely melted at that and ran down the stairs to him oh seymour my dear she said a woman's pity can't hurt you do accept it she drew that handsome tragical face towards her and kissed him do you mind my kissing you she said there's my heart behind it there is indeed thanks aunt dodo he said and and you might tell nadine i saw her like that i am not so very stupid i understand good by and hugh she asked quite unwisely but in that optimistic spirit that he had deprecated don't strain magnanimity he said it's quality is not strained say good by to nadine for me say i saw her asleep and didn't disturb her i never thought much of her intelligence but she may understand that she will have to tell me what she means to do that i require at present our wedding day is fixed seymour broke off suddenly and ran downstairs without looking back dodo was quite sincerely very sorry for him but almost the moment he had gone she ceased to think about him altogether for there were so many soul absorbing topics to occupy her and forgetting she had had no breakfast she went to edith's room edith alone had not the slightest intention of going away to discuss them her optimism was luckily quite incurable she could not look on the darker aspect of affairs for more than a minute or two she found edith breakfasting in bed with a large fur cape flung over her shoulders her breakfast had been placed on a table beside her but for greater convenience she had disposed the plates round her on her counterpane there were also disposed there sheets of music paper a pen and ink bottle and a box of cigarettes the window was wide open and as dodo entered the draught caused the music paper to flutter and edith laid hasty restraining hands on it and screamed with her mouth full shut the door quickly she cried and then come and have some breakfast dodo i don't think i shall get up to day i have been composing since six this morning and if i get up the thread may be entirely broken beethoven worked at the c minor symphony for three days and nights without eating sleeping or washing i see you are eating remarked dodo i hope that won't prevent your giving us another c minor the c minor is much over rated work said edith it is commonplace melodically and clumsily handled if i had composed it i should not be very proud of it which is a blessing you didn't because then you would have composed something of which you were not proud said dodo ringing the bell yes i shall have some breakfast with you oh edith everything is so interesting and hughie has slept all night and nadine with him they are sleeping now nadine on the floor half sitting up with her head against the bed looking too sweet for anything and poor dear seymour has just gone away i took him in to see them by way of breaking it to him whoever guessed that he would fall in love with her it is very awkward for i thought it would be such a nice sensible marriage and now of course there will be no marriage at all at this moment the bell was answered and edith in trying to prevent her music paper from practising aviation upset the ink bottle several minutes were spent in quenching the thirst of sheets of blotting paper at it as you water horses when their day's work is over one of the faults of your mind dodo said edith as this process was going on is that you don't concentrate enough you have too many objects in focus simultaneously now my success is due to the fact that i have only one in focus at a time for instance this stygian pool of ink does not distress me in the slightest no darling it's not your counterpane said dodo it wouldn't distress me if it was but if i opened your mind i should find hugh's recovery nadine's future and your baby in about equally vivid colors and all in sharp outline also you make too many plans for other people do leave something to providence sometimes oh i leave lots said dodo i only try to touch up the designs now and then providence is often rather sketchy and unfinished but yesterday's design was absolutely wonderful i can hardly even be sorry for hugh edith shook her head you are quite incorrigible she said providence sent what was clearly intended to be a terrible event but you see all sorts of glories in it i don't thing it is very polite it is like laughing at a ghost story instead of being terrified dodo's breakfast had been brought in and she fell to it with an excellent appetite there is nothing like scenes before breakfast to make one hungry she said think how hungry a murderer would be if he was taken out to be hanged before breakfast and then given his breakfast afterwards i had a scene with seymour you know i am very sorry for him but somehow he doesn't seem to matter he lost his temper which i rather respected and showed me he had an ideal that i respect too i remember the struggles i used to go through in order to get one were they successful asked edith only by a process of elimination i did everything that i wanted and found it was a mistake so last of all i married jack what a delightful life i have led and how good this bacon is don't you think david is a very nice name i am going to call my baby david it may be a girl said edith then i shall call it bathsheba said dodo without pause or do i mean beersheba bath i think edith why is it that when i am most anxious and full of cares i feel it imperative to talk tommy rot i'm sure there is enough to worry me into a grave if not a vault between seymour and nadine and hugh but after all one needn't worry about nadine it is quite certain that she will do as she chooses and if she wants to marry hugh with both arms in slings and two crutches and a truss and one of those sort of scrapers under one foot she certainly will i brought her up on those lines to know her own mind and then do what she wanted it has been a failure hitherto because she has never really wanted anything but now i think my system of education is going to be justified i am also suffering from reaction last night i thought our dear hughie was dying and i am perfectly convinced this morning that he isn't so too i am sure is nadine otherwise she couldn't have fallen asleep like that and what hughie did was so splendid i am glad god made men like that but it doesn't prevent my eating a huge breakfast and talking rot i hope you don't mean to go away it is so dull to be alone in the house with two young lovers even when one adores them both aren't you getting on rather quick dodo asked edith probably but seymour is congedie how do you say it spun dismissed and quite certainly nadine has fallen in love with hugh there isn't time to be slow nowadays if you are slow you are left gasping on the beach like a fish i still swim in the great waters thank god dodo got up and her mood changed utterly she was never other than genuine but it had pleased nature to give her many facets all brilliant but all reflecting different colored lights oh my dear life is so short she said and every moment should be so precious to everybody i hate going to sleep for fear i may miss something fancy waking in the morning and finding you had missed something like an earthquake or suffragette riot my days are reasonably full but i want them to be unreasonably full and just now jack keeps saying 'do rest do lie down do have some beef tea' just as if i didn't know what was good for david edith he is going to be such a gay dog all the girls and all the women are going to fall desperately in love with him he is going to marry when he is thirty and not a day before and he will be absolutely simple and unspoiled and a wicked little devil on his marriage morning and then all his energies will be concentrated on one point and that will be his wife he will utterly adore her and think of nobody else except me i shall be seventy four you perceive at that time and so i shall be easy to please the older one gets the easier one is to please already little things please me quite enormously and big ones as you also perceive make me go off my head oh i am sure heaven will be extremely nice if i ever die which god forbid but however nice it is it won't be the same as this you agree there i know you want to make all the music you can first as a protest against what seems to be the music of heaven said edith firmly if we may judge by hymn tunes and chants and the first act of parsifal and i suppose the last of faust and handel's oratorios it is very degrading stuff all the changes of key are childishly simple and the proportion of full closes is nearly indecent and i want another ink bottle edith whistled a short phrase on her teeth as a gentle hint to her hostess it's for the flutes she said and the 'cellos take it up two octaves lower she grabbed at her music paper then the horns start it again in the subdominant she said and all the silly audience will think they are merely out of tune that's because they got what they didn't expect to be any good you must surprise the ear i'll surprise them but i want another ink bottle and may i have lunch in my room dodo if necessary i don't know when i shall be able to get up dodo was not attending in any marked manner we will all do what we choose she said genially we will be a sort of harmless medmenham abbey you shall spill all the ink you please and nadine shall marry hugh who will get quite well and i shall go and order dinner and see if nadine is awake i am afraid i am rather fatuously optimistic this morning like mr chesterton and that is always so depressing both to other people at the time and to oneself subsequently dear me what a charming world if there was no such thing as reaction as a matter of fact i do not experience much of it edith gave a great sigh of relief as dodo left the room and concentrated herself with singular completeness on the horn tune in the subdominant she was quite devoted to dodo but the horn tune was in focus just now and she knew if dodo had stopped any longer she would have become barely tolerant of her presence shortly afterwards the fresh supply of ink came also and edith proceeded straight up into the seventh heaven of her own compositions which good or bad were perfection itself to their author dodo found a packet of letters waiting for her and among them a telegram from miss grantham saying deeply grieved can i do anything this she swiftly answered replying darling grantie nothing whatever and went to nadine's room where she found nadine half dressed rosy from her bath and radiant of spirit oh mama i never had such a lovely night she said how delicious it must be to be married i didn't wake till half an hour ago and simultaneously hughie woke which looks as if we suited each other doesn't it and then the doctor came in and looked at him and said he was much stronger much fuller of vitality for his long sleep and he congratulated me on having made him sleep and the nurse told me the first great danger that he would not rally after the shock of the operation was over as far as that goes he will be all right nadine kissed her mother and clung round her neck dewy eyed i'm not going to think about the future she said sufficient to the day is the good thereof it is enough this morning that hughie has got through the night and is stronger if i had been given any wish to be fulfilled i should have chosen that and if on the top of that i had been given another it would have been that i should have helped towards it which i suppose is the old eve coming in i think i had better finish dressing mama instead of babbling have you had breakfast yes dear i had it with edith she is in bed making tunes and pouring ink over the counterpane and not minding nadine's face clouded for a moment in spite of the accomplishment of her wishes and then i must see seymour she said it is no use putting that off but oh mama to think that till yesterday i was willing to marry him with hugh in the world all the time whatever happens to hugh i can't marry him seymour i mean if the ridiculous english pronouns admit of any meaning and i must tell him seymour left half an hour ago said dodo but there's no need for you to tell him i took him into hugh's room and he saw you asleep he understands he couldn't very well help understanding darling he told me he understood before when you called out to hugh not to attempt the rescue but he only understood it pretty well as the ordinary person says he understands french but when he saw you asleep not exactly in hugh's arms but sufficiently close he understood it like a real native poor boy what did he do asked nadine he behaved very rightly and properly and lost his temper with me just as i lose my temper with the porter at the station if i miss my train i had been just porter to him he thanked me for a horrid visit only he called it damnable and so i lost my temper too and we had a few flowers of speech on the staircase not big ones but just promising buds and then poor chap he came back to me and told me he was in hell and i kissed him and he didn't seem to mind much and i suppose he caught his train otherwise he would have been back by now i'm exceedingly sorry for him nadine and you must write him a sweet little letter which won't do any good at all but it's one of the things you have to do darling i wonder if jilting runs in families like consumption and red faces you see i jilted my darling jack to marry into your family but you must write the sweet little letter i spoke of because you are sorry only you couldn't help it did you write a sweet little letter under under the same circumstances to papa jack asked nadine no dear because i hadn't got anybody exceedingly wise to give me that good advice said dodo also because i was a little brute there is no reason why you should be perhaps it runs in the family too suggested nadine then the quicker it runs out of the family the better besides you are sorry for seymour nadine opened her hands wide am i i hope so she said but if you are quite full of gladness for one thing mama it is a little difficult to find a corner for anything else dodo turned to leave the room anywhere will do just under the stairs she said i don't want to put it in the middle of the drawing room after all darling you propose to jilt him there's something in that said nadine oh mama i used not to have any heart at all and now that i've got one it doesn't belong to me no woman's heart belongs to her said dodo if it belongs to her it isn't a heart i should have thought that nonsense yesterday said nadine oh wait while i finish dressing i shan't be ten minutes what meetings we have had in my lovely back room one i remember so particularly you and esther and berts all lay on my bed like sardines in evening dresses and i had just refused to marry hugh who was playing billiards with uncle algie somehow the things like love and devotion seemed to me quite old fashioned or anyhow they seemed to me signs of age they did indeed i thought a clear brain was infinitely preferable to a confused heart especially if it belonged to somebody else i'm not used to it mama it still seems to me very odd like a hat that doesn't fit but it's a fact and i suppose i shall grow into it not that any one ever grew into a hat but when hugh swam out yesterday morning something came tumbling down inside me or was it that only something cracked like the shell of a nut it does not much matter so long as it is not mended again but how queer that it should happen in a second like that i suppose time has nothing to do with what concerns one's soul i believe plato says something about it i don't think i shall look it up he wrote wonderfully but when a thing happens to oneself that seems to matter more than plato's reflections on the subject there was a short pause as nadine brushed her teeth but dodo sitting on the unslept in bed did not feel inclined to break it she wondered whether a particular point in the situation would occur to nadine whether her illumination as regards a woman's heart threw any light on that very different affair a man's heart she was not left long in doubt the question of a man's heart was altogether unilluminated and to dodo there was something poignantly pathetic about nadine's blissful ignorance she came and sat down on the bed close to her mother hughie will see i love him she said because he won't be able to help it i shall just wait oh so happily for him to say again what he has so often said before he will know my answer before i give it him i hope he will say it soon then we shall be engaged and people who are engaged are a little freer aren't they mama dodo felt incapable of clouding that radiant face for she knew in the days that were coming all its radiance would be needed not a single sparkle of light must be wasted but it did not seem to her very likely that hugh whose joyous strength and splendid activity had been so often rejected by nadine would be likely to offer to her again what would be in all probability but a crippled parody of himself but her sense of justice told her that nadine owed him all the strength and encouragement her eager vitality could give him it was only fair that she should devote herself to him and let him feel all the inspiration to live that her care of him could give him but it seemed to her very doubtful if hugh would consent even if he perceived that it was love not warm friendship that she gave him to let himself and his crippled body appeal to her in days gone by she would not marry him for love and it seemed to dodo that a real man as hugh was would not allow her to marry him for pity he had offered her his best and she had refused it it would not be surprising if he refused to offer her his worst the joy that had inspired dodo so that she had softly melted over the sight of nadine asleep by hugh and had exultantly mopped up the spilt ink with edith suddenly evaporated leaving her dry and cold you must wait nadine she said you must make no plans give hughie your vitality and don't ask more she got up now my darling i shall go downstairs she said and order your breakfast you must be hungry and then you can say your prayers and breakfast will be ready nadine absorbed in her own thoughts felt nothing of this prayers she said why i was praying all night till dawn at least i was wanting just wanting and not for myself isn't that prayers dodo loved that it was exactly what she meant in her inmost heart by prayers she drew nadine to her and kissed her darling you have said enough for a week she said if not more and you said them because you must which is the only proper plan if you don't feel you must say your prayers it is just as well not to say them at all but you shall have breakfast whether you feel you must or not i say you must chapter xii one morning a fortnight later jack dodo and edith were sitting together on the cliff above the bay looking down to the sandy foreshore jack finding that dodo was obliged to stop at meering with nadine had personally abandoned his third shooting party leaving berts whom he implicitly trusted to make himself and everybody else quite comfortable in charge among the guests was berts' father whom berts apparently kept in his place jack had just told dodo and edith the contents of berts' letter received that morning all was going very well but berts had arranged that his father should escort two ladies of the party to see the interesting town of lichfield one afternoon instead of shooting the warren beat where birds came high and berts' father was worse than useless but it was certain that he would enjoy lichfield very much and the shoot would be more satisfactory without him if his mother was still at meering berts sent his love and knew she would agree with him edith just now working her way through the entire orchestra was engaged on the cor anglais which while hugh was still so ill dodo insisted should not be played in the house it gave rather melancholy notes and was productive of moisture but she finished a passage which seemed to have no end before she acknowledged these compliments then she emptied the cor anglais into the heather poor bertie is a drone she said he never thinks it worth while to do anything well berts is better he thinks it worth while to sit on his father really properly i thought my energy might wake bertie up and that was chiefly why i married him but it only made him go to sleep lichfield is about his level i don't know anything about lichfield and i don't know much about bertie but they seem to me rather suitable and much more can be done with the cor anglais than wagner ever imagined the solo in tristan is absolute child's play i could perform it myself with a week's practice dodo had been engaged in a small incendiary operation among the heather with the match with which she had lit her cigarette for the moment it seemed that her incendiarism was going to fulfil itself on larger lines than she had intended jack i have set fire to wales like lloyd george she cried stamp on it with your great feet what great large strong feet how beautiful are the feet of them that put out incendiary attempts in wales about bertie edith if you will stop playing that lamentable flute for a moment flute asked edith trombone if you like the point is that your vitality hasn't inspired bertie it has only drained him of his you set out to give him life and you have become his vampire i don't say it was your fault it was his misfortune but berts is calm enough to keep your family going the real question is about mine yes jack that was where hughie went into the sea when the sea was like switzerland and those are the reefs before which though it's not grammatical he had to reach the boat he swam straight out from where your left foot is pointing a humane society medal came for him yesterday and nadine pinned it upon his bed clothes he says it is rot but i think he rather likes it she pinned it on while he was asleep and he didn't know what it meant he thought it was the sort of thing that they give to guards of railway trains the dear boy was rather confused and asked if he had joined the station masters jack shaded his eyes from the sun and a big sea was running he asked but huge it broke right up to the cliffs at the ebb and into it he went like a duck to water edith got up i have heard enough of hugh's trumpet blown she said and i have heard enough of the cor anglais said dodo dear edith will you go away and play it there you see darling jack came out this morning to talk to me and i came out to talk to him or we will go away if you like the point is that somebody must i shall go and play golf said edith with dignity i may not be back for lunch don't wait for me dodo was roused to reply to this monstrous recommendation if i had been in the habit of waiting for you she said i should still be where i was twenty years ago you are always in a hurry darling and never in time i was in time for dinner last night said edith yes because i told you it was at eight when it was really at half past edith blew a melancholy minor phrase leit motif she said describing the treachery of a friend tooty tooty tooty said dodo cheerfully describing the gay impenitence of the same friend edith exploded with laughter and put the cor anglais into its green baize bag good by she said i forgive you thanks darling mind you play better than anybody ever played before as usual but i do said edith passionately dodo leaned back on the springy couch of the heather as edith strode down the hillside it's not conceit she observed but conviction and it makes her so comfortable i have got a certain amount of it myself and so i know what it feels like it was dear of you to come down jack and it will be still dearer of you if you can persuade nadine to go back with you to winston but i don't want to go back to winston anyhow tell me about nadine i don't really know anything more than that she has thrown seymour over and devotes herself to hugh my dear she has fallen head over ears in love with him you are a remarkably unexpected family jack allowed himself to say yes that is part of our charm i think somewhere deep down she was always in love with him but so to speak she couldn't get at it it was like a seam of gold you aren't rich until you have got down through the rock and hugh's adventure was a charge of dynamite to her it sent the rock splintering in all directions the gold lies in lumps before his eyes but i am not sure whether he knows it is for him or not he can't talk much poor dear he is just lying still and slowly mending and very likely he thinks no more than that she is only sorry for him and wants to do what she can but in a fortnight from now comes the date when she was to have married seymour he can't have forgotten that forgotten asked jack yes he doesn't remember much at present he had severe concussion as well as that awful breakage of the hip do they think he will recover completely asked jack they can't tell yet his little injuries have healed so wonderfully that they hope he may they are more anxious about the effects of the concussion than the other he seems in a sort of stupor still he recognizes nadine of course but she hasn't except on that first night seemed to mean much to him what was that he so nearly died then he kept calling for her in a dreadful strange voice and when she came he didn't know her for a time then she put her whole soul into it the darling and made him know her and he went to sleep she slept or rather lay awake all night by his bed she saved his life jack they all said so it seems rather perverse to refuse to marry him when he is sound and the moment he is terribly injured to want to said jack my darling it is no use criticizing people said dodo unless by your criticism you can change them even then it is a great responsibility but you could no more change nadine by criticizing her than you could change the nature of the wildcat at the zoo by sitting down in front of its cage and telling it you didn't like its disposition and that it had not a good temper you may take it that nadine is utterly in love with him and as he has always been utterly in love with her i don't know why you want me to take nadine away bells and wedding cake as soon as hugh can hobble to church oh jack you don't see she said if i know hughie at all he wouldn't dream of offering himself to nadine until it is certain that he will be an able bodied man again and she is expecting him to and is worrying and wondering about it also she is doing him no good now it can't be good for an invalid to have continually before him the girl to whom he has given his soul who has persistently refused to accept it it is true that they have exchanged souls now as far as that goes my darling nadine has so much the best of the bargain but hugh has to begin the the negotiations and he won't even if he sees that nadine is a willing barkis until he knows he has something more than a shattered unmendable thing to offer her consequently he is silent and nadine is perplexed i will go on saying it over and over again if it makes it any clearer but if you understand you may signify your assent in the usual manner clap your great hands and stamp your great feet oh jack what a baby you are do you suppose she would come away said jack coughing a little at the dust his great feet had raised from the loose soil yes if you can persuade her that her presence isn't good for hugh so you will try that's all right nadine has a great respect for papa jack's wisdom and i can't think why i always thought a lot of your heart dear but very little of your head you mustn't retort that you never thought much of either of mine because it wouldn't be manly and i should tell you you were a coward as the suffragettes do when they hit policemen in the face and why should it be i to do all this asked jack because you are papa jack said dodo and a girl listens to a man when she would not heed a woman oh you might tell her which is probably true that edith is going away to morrow and you want somebody to take care of you at winston i think even nadine would see that it would not quite do if she was left here alone with hughie at least it is possible she might see that you could use it to help to preach down a stepdaugher's heart you must think of these things for yourself though because in my heart i am really altogether on nadine's side i think it is wonderful that she should now be waiting so eagerly and humbly for hugh poor crippled hugh as he at present is to speak she has chosen the good part like mary and i want you for the present to take it away from her it's wiser for her to go but am i asked dodo grammatically to supply the ruthless foe which is you with guns and ammunition against my daughter you can't take both sides remarked jack jack i wish you were a woman for one minute just to feel how ludicrous such an observation is our lives not perhaps edith's are passed in taking both sides my whole heart goes out to hugh who has been so punished for his gallant recklessness and then the moment i say 'punished' i think of nadine's awakened love and shout 'no i meant rewarded' then i think of nadine and wonder if i could bear being married to a cripple and simultaneously now that she has shown she can love i cannot bear the thought of her being married to anybody else after all nelson had only one eye and one arm and though he wasn't exactly married to lady hamilton i'm sure she was divinely happy but then best of all i think of hugh making a complete recovery and once more coming to nadine with his great brown doggy eyes and telling her then for once i don't take both sides but only one which is theirs and if it would advance their happiness i would even take away from poor little seymour his jade and his antoinette which is all that nadine left him with without a single qualm of regret jack considered this a moment after all she has left him where she found him said jack who had rather taken edith's view about their marriage he had only his antoinette and his jade when she accepted him and until you make a further raid he will have them still dodo shook her head jack it is rather tiresome of you she said you are making me begin to have qualms for seymour she had found his heart for him you see and now having taken everything out of it she has gone away again leaving him a cupboard as empty as mother hubbard's he will put the jade back and antoinette said jack hopefully dodo got up that is what i doubt she said until we have known a thing we can't miss it we only miss it when we have known it and it is taken away leaving the room empty then old things won't always go back into their places again they look shabby and uninteresting and the room is spoiled it is very unfortunate but what is to happen when a girl's heart is suddenly awakened is she to give it an opiate what is the opiate for heart ache surely not marriage with somebody different yet jilt is an ugly word dodo looked at jack with a sort of self deprecation don't blame nadine darling she said she inherited it it runs in the family jack jumped up and took dodo's hands in his you shall not talk horrible scandal about the woman i love he said but it's true said dodo therefore it is the more abominable of you to repeat it said he but there was a certain obstinacy about dodo that morning i think it's good for me to keep that scandal alive in my heart she said usen't the monks to keep peas in their boots to prevent them from getting too comfortable monks were idiots said jack loudly and any one less like a monk than you i never saw monk indeed besides i believe they used to boil the peas first dodo's face which had been a little troubled cleared considerably that showed great commonsense she said i don't think they can have been such idiots jack if i boil that pea would you mind my still keeping it in my boot rather messy said he better take it out after all you did really take it out when you married me dodo raised her eyes to his david shall take it out she said jack had not at present heard of this nomenclature in fact it does him credit that he instantly guessed to whom allusion was being made oh that's settled is it he said and now david's mother give me a little news of yourself is all well dodo's mouth grew extraordinarily tender oh so well jesse she said so well she was standing a foot or so above him on the steep hillside and bending down to him kissed him and was silent a moment then she decided swiftly and characteristically that a few words like those that had just passed between them were as eloquent as longer speeches and became her more usual self again you are such a dear jack she said and i will forgive your dreadful ignorance of the name of david's mother oh look at the sea gulls fishing for their lunch oh for the wings of a sea gull not to fly away and be at rest at all but to take me straight to the dining room and i feel certain nadine will listen to you and it would be a good thing to take her away for a little she is living on her nerves which is as expensive as eating pearls like cleopatra drinking said jack she dissolved them darling vinegar doesn't dissolve pearls it is a complete mistake to suppose it does she took the pearls like a pill and drank some vinegar afterwards jack pull me up the hill not because i am tired but because it is pleasanter so i am sorry you are going to morrow and i shall make love to hughie after you've gone and pretend it's you i do pray hughie may get quite well and he and nadine and you and i all have our heart's desire edith too i hope she will write a symphony so beautiful that by common consent we shall throw away all the works of beethoven and bach and brahms just as we throw away antiquated bradshaws she was rather out of breath after delivering herself of this series of remarkable statements and jack got in a word and who was david's mother he asked with a rather tiresome reversion to an abandoned topic i don't know or care said dodo with dignity but i'm going to be it required all jack's wisdom to persuade nadine to go away with him more particularly because at the first opening of the subject edith who was present and whom jack had unfortunately forgotten to take into his confidence gave a passionate denial to the fact that she was departing also but in the end she yielded for during this last fortnight she had felt as by the illumination of her love she could not help doing that at present she 'meant' very little to hugh her presence which on that first critical night had not done less than set his face towards life instead of death had she felt since then dimly troubled and perplexed him every day she had thought that he would need her but each day passed and he still lay there with a barrier between him and her yet any day he might want her and she was loth to go but she knew how tired and overstrained she felt herself and the ingenious papa jack made use of this you have given him all you can my dear for the present he said come away and rest and what is dodo's phrase fill your pond again you mustn't become exhausted you will be so much wanted and i may come back if hughie wants me she asked that was easy to answer if hugh really wanted her the difficult situation solved itself but there was one thing more i don't suppose i need ask it said nadine but if hughie gets worse much worse then i may come i i couldn't be there then jack kissed her my dear girl he said what do you take me for an ogre but we won't think about that at all please god you will not come back for that reason nadine very rudely dried her eyes on his rough homespun sleeve you are such a comfort papa she said you're quite firm and strong like like a big wisdom tooth and when we are at winston will you let seymour come down and see me if he wants to and and if he comes will you come and interrupt us in half an hour i've behaved horribly to him but i can't help it and it that we weren't to be married i mean was in the morning post to day and it looked so horrible and cold but whatever he wants to say to me i think half an hour is sufficient i wonder i wonder if you know why i behaved like such a pig i think i might guess said jack then you needn't because there's only one possible guess so we'll assume that you know what a nuisance women are to your poor long suffering sex especially girls jack laughed they are just as much a nuisance afterwards said he look at your mother how she is making life one perpetual martyrdom to me but she used to be a nuisance to you papa jack said nadine there again you are wrong he said i always loved her and does that prevent one's being a nuisance asked nadine are you sure because if you are you needn't interrupt seymour quite so soon i said half an hour because i thought that would be time enough for him to tell me what a nuisance i was you're a heartless little baggage observed jack not quite said nadine well you're an april day said he seeing the smile break through and that is a doubtful compliment said she but you are wrong if you think i am not sorry for seymour yet what was i to do papa jack when i made the discovery well you're not a heartless little baggage conceded jack but you have taken your heart out of one piece of the baggage and packed it in another oh la la said nadine we mix our metaphors nadine left with jack in the motor soon after breakfast next morning it had been settled that she should not tell hugh she was going until she said good by to him and when she went to his room next morning to do so she found him still asleep and the tall nurse entirely refused to have him awakened much better for him to sleep than to say good by said this adamantine woman when he wakes he shall be told you have gone if he asks of course he'll ask said nadine she paused a moment will you let me know if he doesn't she added nurse bryerley's grim capable face relaxed into a smile she did not quite understand the situation but she was quite content to do her best for her patient according to her lights and shall i say that you'll be back soon she asked nadine had no direct reply to this ah do make him get well she said that's what i'm here for and i will say that you'll be back soon shall i if he wants you soon said nadine that minute hugh slept long that morning and dodo was not told he was awake and ready to receive a morning call till the travelers had been gone a couple of hours she had spent them in a pleasant atmosphere of conscious virtue engendered by the feeling that she had sent jack away when she would much have preferred his stopping here but as dodo explained to edith it took quite a little thing to make her feel good whereas it took a lot to make her feel wicked a nice morning for instance she said or sending my darling jack away because it's good for nadine or getting a postal order quite little things like that make me feel a perfect saint whereas the powers of hell have to do their worst as the hymn says to make me feel wicked edith gave a rather elaborate sigh she had to sigh carefully because she had a cigarette and a pen in her mouth while she was scratching out a blot she had made on the score she was revising so care was needed otherwise cigarette and pen might have been shot from her mouth when she spoke her utterance was indistinct and mumbling i suppose you infer that you are more at home in heaven than hell she said since just a touch makes you feel a saint i should say it was the other way about you are so at home in the other place that the most abysmal depths of infamy have to be presented to you before you know they are wicked at all whereas you hail as divine the most infinitesimal distraction that breaks the monotonous round of vice perhaps i am expressing myself too strongly but i feel strongly the world is more high colored to me than to other people darling i never heard such a moderate and well balanced statement said dodo do go on i don't want to but i thought your optimism about yourself was sickly and wanted a a dash of discouragement but you and nadine are both the same if you behave charmingly you tell us to give the praise to you if you behave abominably you say 'i can't help it it was nature's fault for making me like that' now i am not like that whatever i do i take the responsibility and say 'i am i take me or leave me' but i have no doubt that nadine believes it has been too wonderful of her to fall in love with hugh and when she jilts seymour she says 'enquire at nature's workshop this firm is entirely independent' bah dodo laughed but her laugh died rather quickly ah don't be hard edith she said we most of us want encouragement at times and we have to encourage ourselves by making ourselves out as nice as we can otherwise we should look on the mess we make of things as a hopeless job perhaps it is hopeless but that is the one thing we mustn't allow we are like dodo paused for a simile we are like children to whom is given a quantity of lovely little squares of mosaic and we know our souls know that they can be put together into the most beautiful patterns and we begin fairly well but then the devil comes along and jogs our elbow and smashes it all up probably it is our own stupidity but it is more encouraging to say it is the devil or nature something not ourselves good heavens my elbow has jogged often enough and when the pattern gets on well we encourage ourselves by saying 'this is clever and good and wise me doing it now' and then perhaps something very big and solemn comes our way and we bow our heads and know it isn't ourselves at all edith had finished erasing her blot and was gathering her sheets together she tapped them dramatically with an inky forefinger this is big and solemn she said but it's me the artist's inspiration never comes from outside it is always from within i'm going to send it to have the band parts copied to day at the moment the message came that hugh received and dodo got up he had received edith one morning but the effect was that he had eaten no lunch and had dozed uneasily all afternoon edith had been content with the explanation that her vitality was too strong for him and while ready to give him another dose of it did not press the matter anyhow she had other business on hand he lay propped up in bed with a wad of pillows at his back he looked far more alert and present than he had yet done hitherto he had been slow to grasp the meaning of what was said to him and he hardly ever volunteered a statement or question but this morning he smiled and spoke with quite unusual quickness morning aunt dodo he said i'm awfully brisk to day nurse bryerley put in a warning word don't be too brisk she said please don't let him be too brisk she added looking at dodo hughie dear you do look better she said but we'll all be quite calm and self contained like flats hugh frowned for a moment then his face cleared again i see he said bright aren't i aunt dodo i have certainly woke up this morning you look real do you know before i was never quite certain about you you looked as if you might be a good forgery but spurious have a cigarette and why shouldn't i wiser not said nurse bryerley laconically hugh's briskness did not seem to be entirely good natured how on earth could a cigarette hurt me he said perhaps it would be wiser for lady chesterford not to smoke either aunt dodo you mustn't smoke wiser not nurse bryerley smiled with secret content that's right mr graves she said i like to see my patients irritable it always shows they are getting better i should have thought you might have seen that without annoying me said hugh well well i don't mind your having one cigarette to keep lady chesterford company said the nurse but you'll be disappointed dodo took out her case as nurse bryerley left the room here you are hughie she said hugh lit one and blew a cloud of smoke through his nostrils are they quite fresh aunt dodo he said yes dear quite doesn't it taste right yes delicious said hugh absolutely determined not to find it disappointing i say what a sunny morning is it too much in your eyes it is rather will you ask nurse bryerley to pull the blind down why should you chiefly dear because it isn't any trouble dodo pulled down the blind too far on the first attempt to be pleasing not far enough on the second hugh felt she was very clumsy isn't nadine coming to see me this morning he asked but i daresay she is tired of sitting with me every day dodo came back to her chair by the bed again she went off with jack to winston this morning she said just for a change she was very much tired and overdone you've been a fearful anxiety to her you dear bad boy hugh put his cigarette down and shut his mouth as if firmly determined never to speak again she came in to say good by to you she said but you were asleep and they didn't want to wake you there was still dead silence on hugh's part it was only settled she should go yesterday she continued and she had to be persuaded but jack wanted one of us and as i say she was very much overdone now i'm not the least overdone so i stopped but i wish she could have seen how much more yourself you were when you woke to day at length hugh spoke what is the use of telling me that sort of tale he said she is going to be married to seymour in a few days she has gone away for that i suppose in some cold blooded way she thought it better to sneak off without telling me no doubt it was very tactful of her dodo turned round towards him no hughie you are quite wrong she said nadine is not going to marry seymour at all hugh lifted his right hand and examined it cursorily a long cut now quite healed ran up the length of his forefinger i see he said she said she would marry seymour in order to get rid of me and now that i have been got rid of in other ways she has no further use for him isn't that it his face had become quite white and the hand with the healed wound trembled so violently that the bed shook no that is not it said dodo quietly and don't be so nervous and fidgety my dear suddenly the trembling ceased aunt dodo if it is not that what is it he asked in a voice that would have melted rhadamanthus she turned a shining face on him and laid her hand on his oh hughie lie still and get well she said and then ask nadine herself she will come back when you want her she told nurse bryerley to tell you so if you asked hugh moved across his other hand so that dodo's lay between his i must ask you one more thing he said is it because of me in any way that she chucked seymour i entreat you to say 'no' if it is 'no' i can't say 'no' said dodo hugh drew one long sobbing breath it's mere pity then he said nadine always liked me and she was always impulsive like that i daresay she won't marry him till i'm better if i am ever better she will wait till i am strong enough to enjoy it thoroughly dodo interrupted him hughie don't say bitter and untrue things like that she said and don't feel them she is not going to marry seymour either now or afterwards once again hugh was silent and after an interval dodo spoke divining exactly what was in his irritable convalescent mind i have never deceived you before hughie she said and you have no right to distrust me now i am telling you the truth i also tell you the truth when i say you must get bitter thoughts out of your mind ah my dear it is not always easy there's a beast within each of us there's a beast within me said hugh and there's a dear brave fellow whom i am so proud of said dodo hugh's lip quivered but there was a quality in his silence as different from that which had gone before as there was between his callings for nadine on the night when she fought death for him and now that's enough said dodo shall i read to you hughie or shall i leave you for the present he held her hand a moment longer i think i will lie still and and think he said good luck to your fishing dear said she rising good luck to your fishing he said it's on a picture small boy fishing kneeling in the waves dodo beat a strategic retreat is it she said but it seemed to hugh that her voice lacked the blank enquiry tone of ignorance hugh settled himself a little lower down on his backing of pillows after dodo had left him and tried to arrange his mind so that the topics that concerned it stood consecutively but dodo's last remark which certainly should have stood last also in his reflections kept on shouldering itself forward she had wished him good luck to his fishing and he could not bring himself to believe that consciously or unconsciously there was not in her mind a certain picture of a little winged boy kneeling in the waves who dropped a red line into the unquiet sea he could not and did not try to remember the painter but certainly the picture had been at some exhibition which he and nadine had attended together a little winged boy the title was printed after the number in the catalogue nadine was not to marry seymour now or afterwards there came a black speck again over his thoughts he himself had been got rid of by this crippling accident and now she had expunged seymour also 'and though she saw all heaven in flower above she would not love' the lines came into his mind without any searching for them for the moment he could not remember where he had heard them and then memory began to awake hitherto he had not been able to recall anything of the day or two that preceded his catastrophe a few of the immediate events before it he had never forgotten he remembered nadine calling out no hugh not you he remembered her cry of well done he remembered that he had toppled in on that line of toppling waters with a small boy on his back but now a fresh line of memory had been awakened some connection in his brain had been restored and he remembered their quarrel and reconciliation on the day the gale began how she had said oh hughie if only i loved you soon after came the portentous advent of the wind with the blotting out of the sun and the transformation of the summer sea he heard with unspeakable irritation the entry of nurse bryerley that seemed an unwarrantable intrusion for he felt as if he had been alone with nadine and now this assiduous grenadier broke in upon them with a hundred fidgety offices to perform she restored to him a fallen pillow she closed a window through which a breeze was blowing rather freely she brought him a cup of chicken broth it seemed an eternity before she asked him if he was comfortable and made her long delayed exit even then she reminded him that the doctor was due in half an hour but for half an hour he would be alone now and for the first time since his accident he found that he wanted to think hitherto his mind had sat vacant like an idle passenger who sees without observation or interest the transit of the country but dodo's visit this morning and her communications to him had made life appear a thing that once more concerned him till now it was but a manoeuver taking place round him but outside him now the warmth of it reached him again and began to circulate through him and what she had told him was being blown out as it were in his brain even as a lather of soapsuds is blown out into an iridescent bubble on which gleam all the hues of sunset and moonrise and rainbow the rainbow was not one of the vague dreams in which lately his mind had moved it was a real thing not receding but coming nearer to him blown towards him by some steady breeze not idly vagrant in the effortless air should it break on his heart not into nothingness but into the one white light out of which the sum of all lights and colors is made he could not doubt that it was this which dodo meant nadine had thrown over seymour and that concerned him and then swift as the coming of the storm which they had seen together came the thought clear and precise as the rows of thunder clouds that for all he knew a barrier forever impenetrable lay between them for he could never offer to her a cripple the same pride that had refused to let him take an intimate place beside her after she by her acceptance of seymour had definitely rejected him forbade him without possibility of discussion to let her tie herself to him unless he could stand sound and whole beside her he must be competent in brain and bone and body to be nadine's husband and for that as yet he had no guarantee since his accident he had not up till now cared to know precisely what his injuries were nor whether he could ever completely recover from them the concussion of the brain had quenched all curiosity and interest not only in things external to him but in himself and he had received the assurance that he was going on very well with the unconcern that we feel for remote events but now his thoughts flew back from nadine and clustered round himself he felt that he must know his chances the best or the worst and yet he dreaded to know for he could live for a little in a paradise by imagining that he would get completely well instead of in a shattered ruin which the knowledge of the worst would strew round him but this morning the energy of life which for those two weeks had lain dormant in him began to stir again he wanted it seemed to him but a few moments since his nurse left him that dr cardew came in he saw the flushed face and brightened eyes of his patient and after an enquiry or two took out the thermometer which he had not used for days and tested hugh's temperature he put it back again in its nickel case with a smile well it's not any return of fever anyhow he said do you feel different in any way this morning yes i want to get well highly commendable said dr cardew hugh fingered the bed clothes in sudden agitation i want to know if i shall get well he said i don't mean half well in a bath chair but quite well and i want to know what my injuries were dr cardew looked at him a moment without speaking but it was perfectly clear that this fresh color and eagerness in hugh's face was but the lamp of life burning brighter there was no reason that he should not know what he asked now that he cared to know you broke your hip bone he said you also had very severe concussion of the brain there were a quantity of little injuries oh tell me the best and the worst of it quickly said hugh with impatience i can tell you nothing for certain for a few days yet about the fracture there is no reason why it should not mend perfectly and to day for the first time i am not anxious about the other quite suddenly hugh put his hands before his face and broke into a passion of weeping chapter xiii a week later dodo was interviewing dr cardew in her sitting room at meering he had just spoken at some little length to her and she had time to notice that he looked like a third rate actor and recorded the fact also that edith seemed to have gone back to scales and the double bass this impression was conveyed from next door he spoke like an actor too and said things several times over as if it was a play he talked about fractures and conjunctions and x ray photographs and satisfaction and the recuperative powers of youth and satisfaction and x rays eventually dodo could stand this harangue no longer it is all too wonderful she said and i quite see that if science hadn't made so many discoveries we couldn't tell if hughie would have a bath chair till doomsday or not but now dr cardew he is longing to hear and dreading to hear poor lamb and won't you let me be the butcher or i suppose i should say 'mary' you've been such a clever butcher if you understand and i do want to be mary who had a little lamb she added in desperation lest he should never understand her allusive conversation of course he's not my little lamb but my daughter's and he wants to know so frightfully yes i understand about his intellect too it seems to me as bright as it ever was and i notice no change whatever he always spoke as if he was excited may i go dodo intended to go whether she might or not but just at the door she seemed to herself to have treated this distinguished physician with some abruptness she unwillingly paused do stop to lunch she said it will be lunch in ten minutes and you will find me not so completely distracted i shall be quite sensible and would you ring the bell and tell them you are stopping don't mind the scales and the double bass dear dr cardew it is only mrs arbuthnot of whom you have heard she will not play at lunch i know you think you have come to a mad house but we are all quite sane and i may go and tell hughie what you have told me if you hear loud screams of joy it will only be me and you needn't take any notice dodo slid along the passage upset a chair in nurse bryerley's room and knelt down on the floor by hugh's bed she clawed at something with her eager hands and it was chiefly bed clothes oh praise god hughie she said amen there now you know and there won't be any crutches my dear or the shadow of a bath chair whatever that is like you won't have chicken broth and a foolish nurse not you dear nurse bryerley i didn't mean you and you will walk again and run again and play the fool just like me for a hundred years more i told dr cardew you weren't ever very calm or unexcited and your poor broken hip has mended itself and your kidneys aren't mixed up with your liver and lights and you've you've got your strong young body back again and your silly young brain oh hughie dodo leaned forward and clutched a more satisfactory handful of hugh's shoulders i couldn't let anybody but myself tell you she said i had to tell you but nobody else knows you can tell anybody else you want to tell hugh was paying but the very slightest attention to dodo telegraph form he said rather rudely to nurse bryerley dodo loved this inattention to herself there was nothing banal about it he had no more thought of her than he would have had for a newspaper that contained ecstatic tidings he did not stroke or kiss or shake hands with a mere newspaper that told him such great things it's so funny not to have telegraph forms handy he said i know dear they ought always to be in every room but servants are so forgetful talk to me until nurse bryerley gets one hugh looked at her with shining eyes how can i talk he said there's nothing to say i want that telegraph form dodo human and practical and explosive yearned for the statement of what she knew whom are you going to telegraph to she asked hugh had time for one contemptuous glance at her oh aunt dodo you ass he said oh by jove how awfully rude of me and i haven't thanked you for coming to tell me thanks so much i am so grateful to you for all your goodness to me ah he took a telegraph form and scribbled a few words may it go now he said dodo was almost embarrassingly communicative at lunch at which meal edith did not appear and the continued booming of the double bass indicated that art was being particularly long that morning consequently dodo found herself alone with an astonished physician if only a man could be a clergyman and a doctor she said you could tell him everything because clergy know all about the soul and doctors all about the body and when you completely understand anything you can't be shocked at it i think i should have poisoned you dr cardew if you had said that hughie would never be the same man again anyhow i shouldn't have asked you to lunch ah in that case i couldn't have poisoned you how difficult it must be to plan a crime really satisfactorily i always have had a great deal of sympathy with criminals because my great grandfather was hanged for smuggling do have some more mutton which calls itself lamb i certainly shall i'm going to have a baby you know or perhaps you didn't isn't it ridiculous at my age and he's going to be called david in case began dr cardew no in any case said dodo i mean it certainly is going to be a boy you shall see what a day for january is it not the year has turned though i hope that doesn't mean it will go bad i wish you had seen hughie's face when i told him he wasn't going to have a bath chair he looked like one of sir joshua reynolds' angels with a three weeks' beard which i shouldn't wonder if he was shaving now since as i said there aren't going to be any bath chairs i don't quite follow said dr cardew politely but desperately i'm sure i don't wonder said dodo cordially although it's so clear to me but you see he's going to propose to my daughter now that it's certain he will be the same man again and not a different one and no eligible young man ever has a beard what a good title for a sordid and tragic romance 'beards and bath chairs' would be of course hughie instantly called for a telegraph form and when i asked him who he was telegraphing to he called me an ass in so many words or rather so few after all i had done for him too oh here's edith dr cardew and i have not been listening to your playing but we're sure it has been lovely do you know dr cardew and it's mrs arbuthnot or ought i to say 'she's mrs arbuthnot' edith if you don't mind our smoking dr cardew and i will wait and talk to you for a little but if you do we won't edith shook hands so warmly with the doctor that he felt he must have been an old friend of hers and that the fact had eluded his memory but it was only the general zeal which a long musical morning gave her i'm sure you came to see our poor hugh she said do tell me is there the slightest chance of his ever walking again not the smallest said dodo i've just been to break the news to him and he has telegraphed to nadine to come at once i can't keep it up edith he is going to be perfectly well again and he has telegraphed to nadine just the same edith looked a little disappointed then i suppose we must resign ourselves to a perfectly conventional and philistine ending she said there was all the makings of a twentieth century tragedy about the situation and now i am afraid it is going to tail off and be domestic and happy and utterly inartistic i had better hopes for nadine she always looked as if there might be some wild destiny in store for her and when she engaged herself to seymour without caring two straws for him i thought i heard a great fate knocking at the door this was too gross an inconsistency for even dodo to pass over and you said at the time you thought the engagement was horrible and unnatural and me a wicked mother for permitting it she cried very possibly no doubt then i was being a woman now i am talking as an artist you always confuse the two dodo for all your general acumen when i have been playing all morning scales said dodo a great deal of the finest music in the world is based on scale passages and the second movement of my symphony is based on them too when i have been playing all morning i see things as an artist i know dr cardew will agree with me sometimes he sees things as a surgeon sometimes as a man as a surgeon if a hazardous operation is in front of him he says to himself 'this is a wonderful and dangerous thing and it thrills me' as a man he says 'poor devil i am afraid he may die under the knife' as for you dodo artistically speaking you spoiled a situation as lurid as a play by webster 'princess waldenech' might have been as classical in real life as the 'duchess of malfi' artistically an atmosphere as stormy as the first act of the valkyries surrounded you and now instead of the 'goetterdaemmerung' you are going to give us 'haensel und gretel' with flights of angels dodo exploded with laughter and while i was still giving you 'princess waldenech' she said you cut me for a year as a woman cried edith as an artist i adored you you were as ominous as faust's black poodle of course your first marriage to a man who adored you for whom you did not care one bar of the 'hallelujah chorus' was a thing that might have happened to anybody but when as soon as he was mercifully delivered you got engaged to jack and at the last moment jilted him for that melodramatic drunkard i thought great things were going to happen then you divorced him and i waited with a beating heart and now would you believe it dr cardew cried edith pointing a carving fork with a slice of ham on the end of it at him she has married lord chesterford as you know and is going to have a baby and all that wealth of potential tragedy is going to end in a silver christening mug the silly suffragette with her hammer and a plate glass window has more sense of drama than you dodo and now nadine is going to take after you and marry the man she loves hugh is just as bad instead of dying for the sake of that blear eyed child who comes up to enquire after him every day he is going to live for the sake of nadine drama is dead of course it has long been dead in literature but i hoped it survived in life dodo turned anxiously to dr cardew she isn't mad she said reassuringly you needn't be the least frightened she will play golf immediately after lunch edith had been brought her large german pewter beer mug and for the moment she had put her face into it like old fashioned gentlemen praying into their hats on sunday morning before service there was a little froth on the end of her rather long nose when she took it out why not she said all artistic activity is a sort of celestial disease and its antidote is bodily activity which is a material disease a perfectly healthy body like mine does not need exercise except in order to bring down the temperature of the celestial fever when i am playing golf my artistic soul goes to sleep and rests and when i am composing i should not know a golf ball from an egg that is me you might think i am being egoistic but i only take myself as an instance of a type i speak for the whole corporate body of artists militant here on earth remarked dodo militant of course all artists are militant and they fight against blind eyes and deaf ears they scream and lighten and hope to shake this dull world into perception but it is fighting against prodigious odds the drama that seems to interest the world now is a presentation of the hopeless lives of suburban people any note of romance or distinction is sufficient to secure a failure it's the same in music debussy when he tells us of rain in the garden makes the rain fall into a small backyard with sooty blighted plants growing in it out of a foggy sky when he gives us 'reflets dans l'eau' the water is a little cement basin in the same backyard with anemic goldfish swimming about in it as for strauss he began and finished with that terrible 'domestic symphony' it went from the kitchen into the scullery and back again fiction is the same any book that deals with entirely dull people provided that they none of them ever show a spark of real fire or are touched by romance or joy or beauty makes success they must have the smell of oilcloth and irish stew around them and then the world says 'this is art' or 'this is reality' there's the mistake art is never real it is fantasy a fairy story a soap bubble sailing into the sunset it is art because it takes you out of reality of course artists are militant they fight against dullness and they will fight forever and they will never win as for their being militant here on earth you must be militant somewhere i shall be militant in heaven by and by i wonder if you understand as i said i was disappointed in nadine artistically but i am enraptured with her humanly on that same plane i am enraptured with you dodo humanly speaking i have watched you with sobs in my throat battling perilously on the great seas and now you are like a battered ship having weathered all storms and putting into port with all the piers and quays shouting congratulation artistically speaking you are a derelict and i should like to have you blown up hullo what has happened to dr cardew dodo looked quickly round the thought just crossed her mind that he might be asleep or having a fit but there was no dr cardew there nor anywhere about to be seen he has gone away while we weren't attending just as a conjurer changes a rabbit to an omelette while you aren't attending she said and i'm sure i don't wonder oh edith at last the 'hunting of the snark' has come true i see now that we are boojums people softly and silently vanish away when you and i are talking poor dears they can't stand it and i've noticed it before dear old chesterford used to vanish sometimes like that and i never knew until i saw he wasn't there i'm sure bertie vanishes too sometimes i suppose we ought to vanish also as the table must be laid again for dinner to night edith finished her beer i had breakfast lunch and dinner on the same cloth once she said i was composing all day and at intervals things were stuck in front of me while i ate or drank i didn't move from nine in the morning till half past eight in the evening and i wrote forty pages of full score and the inspiration never flagged for a moment i wonder why artists are so fond of writing what they call 'my memories' they ought to be content as i am to stand or fall by what they have done thank god i have never had any doubts about my standing oh i see a telegraph boy coming up the drive it is sure to be for me i am expecting a quantity this particular one happened to be for dodo edith was disposed to take it as a personal insult nadine during the days she had spent at winston had not done much looking after papa jack which had been the face reason of her going there and it is doubtful whether the real reason had found itself fulfilled since there was substituted for the strain of seeing hugh daily the strain of wanting to see him dodo with her own swift recuperative powers and the genius she had for being absorbed in her immediate surroundings had not reckoned with nadine's inferior facility in this respect nor had she realized how completely the love which had at last touched nadine drained and dominated her whole nature all her zest for living all her sensitiveness and intelligence seemed to have been as by some alchemical touch transformed into the gold which all her life had been missing from her she explained this to esther who with an open mindedness that might have appeared rather unsisterly ranged her sympathies in opposition to seymour how long i shall be able to stop here she said i don't know i promised mama i would go away for at least a week unless hughie wanted me but after that i think i shall go back whether he wants me or not i can't attend to anything else and last night when i was playing billiards i carefully put the chalk into my coffee which is not at all the sort of thing i usually do it is very odd all my life i have been quite unaware of this one thing now i am not really aware of anything else you are rather dream like yourself to me i am not quite sure if you have really happened or are part of a general background i am not part of any background said esther firmly no so you say but perhaps it is only the background that tells me so and i suppose i ought to think a great deal about seymour i try to do that but when i've thought about him for about a minute and a quarter i find my thoughts wander and i wonder if hughie has had his beef tea or not i do hope that he is not unhappy but having hoped it i have finished with that and remember that just at this moment hughie is being made comfortable for the night but do pin me down to seymour did you see him in town and does he mean to tell me what he thinks yes i saw him he was exceedingly cross but i don't think his crossness came from temper it came from his mind's hurting him he told me he had meant to come down here and have it out with you but presently he said you weren't worth it so i took your side that was darling of you said nadine but i am not sure that seymour is not right how can he be right you haven't changed towards him oh doesn't jilting him make a change asked nadine hopefully no that is an accident as i told him you didn't do it on purpose you might as well say that to be knocked down by a motor car is done on purpose you get knocked down by hughie you hadn't ever loved seymour at all and really you said you would marry him largely because you wanted hughie to stop thinking about you it was chiefly for hughie's sake you said you would marry seymour and it was so wonderful of you then came another accident and seymour fell in love with you i warned him when we were on the family improvement tour in the summer that he was doing rather a risky thing nadine got up risky she said oh how risky it is it is that which makes it so splendid you risk everything you go for it blind do you think seymour went for it blind i don't believe he did i think he had one eye open all the time he couldn't be quite blind i think his intelligence would prevent it and i don't think he would be cross now if he had been quite blind so i am not properly sorry for him i went to lunch with him said esther he ate an enormous lunch which i suppose is a consoling sign but then seymour would eat an enormous breakfast on the morning he was going to be hung he would feel that he would never have any more breakfasts so he would eat one that would last forever i think we have given enough time to seymour it is much more important that you shouldn't think of me as a background nadine apparently thought differently but i want to be nice to seymour she said and i don't see how to begin and and he's part of the background too he doesn't seem really to matter but if he was really fond of me like that it's hateful of me not to care but how can i care i've tried to care every day and often twice a day but oh a huge 'but' the two were talking in dodo's sitting room which nadine had very wisely appropriated at this moment the door opened and seymour stood there i made up my mind not to come and see you he said to nadine and then i changed it esther sprang up oh seymour how mean of you she said not to ask nadine if you might come not at all she was bound to see me but i didn't come to see you you had better go away if nadine wishes she began it does not matter what nadine wishes nadine please tell her to go seymour spoke quite quietly and having spoken he turned aside and lit a cigarette he held in his hand by the time he had finished doing that the door had closed behind esther he looked round what a charming room he said but if you are going to sit in a room like this you ought to dress for it nadine felt that all the sorrow she had been conscious of for him was being squeezed out of her he tiptoed about now looking at a picture and now fingering an embroidery he stopped for a moment opposite a louis seize tapestry chair and gently flicked off it the cigarette ash that he had let drop there he looked at the faded crimson of the spanish silk on the walls and examined with extreme care a dutch picture of a frozen canal with peasants skating that hung above the mantelpiece there was an aubonne carpet on the floor and after one glance at it he went softly off it and stood on the hearth rug i should put three quarters of this room into a museum he said and the rest into a dust bin you are going to ask me what i should put into the dust bin i should put that sham watteau picture there and that bureau that thinks it is jacobean and me asked nadine i am not sure no i am sure i don't put you anywhere i want to know where you put yourself perhaps you think you don't owe me an explanation but i disagree with you i think you owe it me of course i know you haven't got an explanation but i should like to hear your idea of one standing on the hearth rug he pointed his toe as he spoke looking at the well polished shoe that shod it nadine was just on the point of telling him that he was thinking not about her but about his shoe but he was too quick for her of course i'm thinking about my shoe he said i was wondering how it is that antoinette polishes shoes better than any one in the world is that what you have come to talk about asked nadine that is a very foolish question nadine you have quibbled and chattered so incessantly that sometimes i think you can do nothing else you might retort with a tu quoque but it would not be true i was capable anyhow of falling in love with you i regret to say seymour paused a moment and then raised his eyes which had been steadily regarding the masterpieces of antoinette to nadine i am wrong i don't regret it he said suddenly his sincerity and his reality reached and touched nadine he stepped out of the background so to speak and stood firmly and authentically beside her i regret it very much she said and i am as powerless to help you as i am to help myself you seem to have been helping yourself pretty freely said he in a sudden exasperation but she usually so quick to flare into flame felt no particle of resentment there is no good in saying that she said i did not mean there to be good i did not come down here to do you good why did you come just to reproach me partly again seymour paused i came chiefly in order to look at you he said at length you are quite as beautiful as ever you may like to know it was as if a further light had been turned on him making him clearer and more real she had confessed to esther her inability to be properly sorry for him but now found herself not so incapable i can't help either you or myself she said again we have both been taken in control by something outside ourselves which never happened to either of us before you feel that i have behaved atrociously to you and any one you ask would agree with you but the atrocity was necessary i couldn't help it only you must not think that i am not sorry for the effect that such necessity has had on you i regret it very much but if you ask me whether i am ashamed of myself i answer that i am not she went on with growing rapidity and animation if you have been in love with me seymour she said you will understand that for you will know that compulsion has been put upon me how was it any longer possible for me to marry you when i fell in love with hughie i jilted you it is a word quite hideous like flirt but just as never in my life did i flirt so i have not jilted you in the hideous sense it was not because i was tired of you or had a fancy for some one else there was no getting away from what happened hughie enveloped me my walls fell down and went to jericho it wasn't my fault the trumpets blew just that and in walked hugh said seymour i am not sure about that said nadine i think he was there all the time walled up seymour was silent a moment how is he he asked he is going on well they do not know more than that yet he is getting over the concussion but they cannot tell yet whether he will be able to walk again and are you going to marry him in any case if he is a cripple i mean he asked if hughie will have me i daresay i shall propose to him and be refused just as used to happen the other way round in the old days oh i know what his soul is like so well he will say that he will not let me spend all my life looking after a cripple but i shall have my way in the end i am much stronger than he seymour saw and understood the change in her face when she spoke of hugh admirable as her beauty always was he had not dreamed that such tender transformation could come to it or that it was capable of assuming so inward burning and devoted a quality and yet shining with its habitual brilliance uneclipsed the love which he had dreamed would some day awake there for him he saw now in the first splendor of its dawning and from it he could guess what would be the glory of its full noonday and with how celestial a ray she would shine on her lover for the moment it seemed to him not to matter that it was another not he on whom that dawn should break for whom it should grow to noonday and sink at last in the golden west of a life truly and lovingly lived without fear of the lengthening shadows and the night that must inevitably close as it had preceded it for by the power of his own love he could detach himself from himself and though only momently reach that summit of devotion far below which remote and insignificant lies the mere husk and shell of the world that spins through the illimitable azure so dante saw the face of beatrice when he passed into the sweetness of the earthly paradise and there came to him she whom the chariot with its harnessed griffins drew and not otherwise in his degree and hers seymour looked now at nadine's face glorified and made tender by her love and in the perception that his own love gave him he hailed and adored it i came to scold and reproach he said but i also came just to see you to look at you there is no harm in that and if there is i can't help it nadine i used to wonder what you would look like when you loved you have shown me that i i didn't guess there's a poem by browning which ends 'those who win heaven blest are they' the man who speaks was just in my case but he managed to say that i say it too very quickly because i know this unnatural magnanimity won't last i agree with all you have said it wasn't your fault i hope you won't be tied to a cripple all your life or if he has to be a cripple i hope you will be tied to him there i've said it and it is true but it rather reminds me of holding my breath give me a kiss please and then i'll climb swiftly down out of this rarefied atmosphere he kissed her on the mouth as his right had been and for a moment held her to him in an embrace more intimate than he had ever yet claimed from her edith it may be remembered had once seen him kiss her and had pronounced it an anemic salutation but it was not anemic now his blood was alert and virile its quality was not inferior to that which one day in the summer made hugh seize her wrists demanding the annulment of the profanation of her marriage with seymour in both too was the same fierceness of farewell for a few seconds seymour held her close to him and felt her neither shrink from him nor respond her willing surrender to his right was the utmost she could give and he knew there was nothing else for him and then he proceeded to descend from what he had called the rarefied atmosphere with the speed of a yet unopened parachute damn hugh he said yes damn him for god's sake don't tell him i asked after him or hoped he was getting better i don't want him to die since i don't suppose that would do me any good nor do i want him to be crippled for life since that also would be quite useless after what you have told me but if you said to him that i had asked after him i should sink into the earth for shame he would think it noble and nice of me and i'm not noble or nice i should hate to be thought either his good opinion of me would make me choke and retch i should not be able to sleep if i thought hugh was thinking well of me so hold your tongue nadine had never been able quite to keep pace with seymour she always lagged a little behind just as hugh lagged so much more behind her she was still gasping from the violence of his seizure of her when he had descended so to speak a thousand feet or so tenderness still clung about her like soaked raiment oh seymour she said i didn't realize you felt like that i didn't really what are you going to do his clever handsome face wore an uncompromising look but there was humor in his eyes i may take to drink he said like your angelic father very likely i shan't because i notice that it spoils your breakfast if you are intoxicated the evening before i shall certainly try to get some more jade and i shan't marry antoinette because she is buxom if i marry i shall marry some girl who reminds me of asparagus like you not the stout french asparagus of course but the lean english variety i should not wonder if i came to your wedding and wrote an account of it to a ladies' newspaper i shall say you were looking hideous i haven't got any other plans except to go away from this place you are a sort of chucker out nadine at winston you chucked out hugh in the summer and now in the winter you chuck me out you are a vampire i think you suck people dry and then you throw them away like orange skins don't argue with me if you argued i should become rude i was rude to aunt dodo the other day when she showed me you sleeping on the floor by hugh's bed it was a sickening spectacle i told her so at the time and i tell you so now poor complicated nadine her complications had been canceled like vulgar fractions and she was left in a state of the most deplorable simplicity there was a numerator and that was hugh there was a nought below and that was she the simplest arithmetician could see that the nought went into the numerator an infinite number of times the result was that there was hugh and nothing else at all her surrendered reply indicated this it indicated also her knowledge of it but it was hughie there she said and then suddenly seymour's unexpanded parachute opened and he floated in liquid air with the azure encompassing him your hughie he said mine said nadine there came an interruption a footman entered with a telegram which he gave to nadine and once again the ineffable light came into her face coming from below transfiguring it that's from the cripple said seymour unerringly she passed him the words hugh had written that morning they could not have been simpler nor could he by any expenditure of separate half pennies have said more come back he had written important good news seymour got up so you are going he said nadine did not seem to hear this she addressed the footman tell them to send round the napier car at once she said yes miss but his lordship ordered the napier to meet the shooters has it gone no miss it was to pick up lady esther then i want it at once instead i am going to start instantly tell them to send the car round at once and tell my maid to pack a bag for me and follow with the rest of my luggage yes miss where to shall i say meering of course she will go by train she turned her unclouded radiance to seymour again and held out both her hands oh seymour she said i feel such a brute such a brute but it's my nature to clearly go and put on your hat will you let me hear of you sometimes she asked i don't see why i should write to you if you mean that he said nor do i now i come to think of it i made a conventional observation will you let them know if you want lunch or want to be taken to the station yes thanks good by and good luck she lingered one moment more thank you she said and don't think of me without remembering i am sorry it was still an hour short of sunset when the car emerged from the mountainous inland on to the coast the plain and the line of sand dunes that bordered the sea slept under a haze of golden winter sun a few wisps of light cloud hung round the slopes of snowdon but otherwise the sky was of pale unflecked blue from rim to rim and the sea was as untroubled as the turquoise vault which it reflected though january had still a half dozen of days to run a hint and promise of spring was in the air and nadine sat in the open car unchilled by its headlong passage they had taken but five hours to come from the midlands and they seemed to have passed for her in one throb of eager consciousness so that she looked bewildered to find that the familiar landmarks of home were close about her and that they were already close to their journey's end soon they began to climb out of the plain again up the outlying flank of hill that formed the south end of the bay and culminated in the steep bluff of rock at the top of which she and hugh had sat and quarreled and been reconciled on the morning of the gale to day no tumult of maddened water beat at the base of it nor did thunder of surges break into spray and flying foam and the line of reef that ran out from it lay with its huge scattered rocks as quiet as a herd of sea beasts grazing as they got higher she could see over the sand dunes the beach itself no ramparts and towers of surf or ruins of shattered billows fringed it now a child could have played on that zone of shattering and resistless forces of its dangers and menaces nothing was left the great gift that it had brought to nadine's heart alone remained and flowered there like the rose pink almond blossom in spring nature had healed where she had hurt and what had seemed but a blind and wanton stroke had proved to be the smiting of the rock so that the spring burst forth and rivers ran in the dry places the house gray and welcoming stood dozing in the afternoon sun and nadine suddenly conscious that they had arrived without a halt said a contrite word to the chauffeur on the subject of lunch she recollected also that she had sent no reply to hugh's telegram and that her arrival would be unexpected unexpected it certainly was and dodo who had just seen edith off to play golf better than anybody else had ever done jumped up with a scream as she entered but my darling is it you she cried we have been expecting to hear from you but seeing is better than hearing oh nadine such news of course you guess it so i shall not tell you as it is unnecessary and besides hughie must do that he has been shaved and looks quite clean and young again will you go up to see him at once perhaps it is equally unnecessary to ask that shall i come up with you my darling there's a third unnecessary question of course i shall do nothing of the kind ask the great grenadier if you may go in to him without his being told you are coming it might be rather a shock but personally i believe shocks of joy are always good for one at least they have never hurt me go upstairs dear and after an unreasonable time you might ring for me the nurse's room was a dressing room attached to the bedroom where hugh lay nadine went in through this and the door into the room beyond being open she saw that nurse bryerley was in there at this moment she looked up and saw nadine she turned towards hugh's bed here's a visitor for you she said and beckoned to nadine to enter she heard hugh ask who in a voice that sounded somehow expectant and she went in in the doorway she passed nurse bryerley coming out and the door closed behind her hugh had raised himself on his elbow in bed and the light in his eyes showed that though he had asked who his visitor was his heart knew he neither spoke nor moved while nadine came across the room to his bedside then in a whisper it is nadine he said she knelt down by the bed yes hughie you wanted me she said i always want you he answered for a moment nadine hid her face in her hands without replying then she raised it again to him hughie you have always got me she said she drew that beloved head down to hers and the news she said presently oh that said hugh it's only that i am going to get quite well and strong again that's all chapter xiv dodo was sitting in her room in jack's house in eaton square one morning towards the end of may being moderately busy she was trying to engage in a very intimate conversation with her husband and simultaneously to conduct communication through the telephone to smoke a cigarette and to write letters considering the complicated nature of the proceeding viewed as a whole she was getting on fairly well but occasionally became a little mixed up in her mind and spoke of intimate things to jack in the determined telephone voice habitually used or puffed cigarette smoke violently into the receiver she had just done this and apologized to the central exchange i never knew you could send smoke down a telephone remarked jack double one two four gerrard said dodo in these days of modern science you can't tell what is going to happen and it's well to anticipate anything no you fool i mean miss i said double one two four eleven hundred and twenty four if that makes it simpler as i was saying jack i don't see why i shouldn't stop in town and have my baby here you can put lots of straw down like margery daw and that always looks so interesting i should like to have straw down permanently why don't we darling how are you and as jack's going out to lunch and i shall be quite alone do come round dodo's face suddenly became seraphically blank oh are you she said then will you tell mrs arbuthnot that i hope she will come round to lunch with lady chesterford jack i said all that to edith's footman who always smiles at me i wonder if he will come to lunch instead and say i asked him which after all is quite true but edith talks so much like a man that of course i thought it was she whereas it was he yes i don't see why i should go down to winston for it babies born in london are just as healthy as babies born in staffordshire and people will drop in more easily afterwards besides i must go to nadine's wedding if i possibly can it would be like reading a story that you know quite well is going to end happily and finding that the last chapter of all which you have been saving up for so to speak is torn out i shall have the most enormous lump in my throat when i see her and hughie go up to the altar rails together and i love lumps in the throat don't you i don't mean quinzy i'll tell you all about the last chapter said jack that would be very dear of you but it wouldn't be the same thing at all i want to see it to see hugh walking as if he had never been smashed into ten thousand smithereens and nadine as if she had never thought about anybody else since her cradle oh by the way they have settled at last that they would like to go on the yacht for their honeymoon they are both bad sailors but i suppose there are lots of harbors or breakwaters about and they think it is the only plan by which they can be certain of being undisturbed if it is rough they will find a sort of pleasure in being sick into one basin i really think they will they are in that sort of foolishness that whatever they do together will be in the garden of eden and they are just forty five years old between them which is exactly what i am all by myself it seems quite a coincidence though i have no idea what it coincides with so let them have the yacht jack as you suggested and the moon will be lovely honey and they will be exceedingly unwell dodo finished her letter and having telephoned enough for the present came and sat in a chair by her husband in order to continue the intimate conversation jack dear she said i never do behave quite like anybody else as you have known poor wretch for i don't know how many years so you must be prepared for surprises when i give you that darling david something ridiculous will happen there'll be two or three of them and the papers will say i have had a litter or i shall die or david will arrive quite unexpectedly like a flash of lightning and i shall say 'good heavens david is it you' i should be exceedingly annoyed if i died so should i said jack i really believe you would but it would be more annoying for me because however nice the next world is going to be i haven't had enough of this i want years and years more because eternity is there just the same and if i live to be a hundred there won't be anything the less of that eternity is safe so to speak it is invested in the bank but time is just pocket money of which you always say i want such a lot eternity will always be on tap or else it wouldn't be eternal but this particular brew will come to an end and i shall be so sorry when the last gurgle sounds and one knows there is no more it couldn't come more nicely if when it sounded i had given you a son i can't imagine any nicer way to die on the other hand there's no reason anywhere near as nice for living jack put a great hand on her arm dodo if you talk about dying i shall be shall be as sick as hughie and nadine together he said oh don't but you see since we are us is that right there is nothing i can't say to you because i am only talking to myself i wonder if i had better write a quantity of letters to my son as some woman i believe a spinster did david shall read them when he has learned how to read oh i could tell him so well how to make love i know exactly what women like a man to be luckily so few men really know it otherwise the world would go round much quicker and we should all be blown off it oh jack fancy a woman who had never known what child bearing meant attempting to describe it you might as well sit down at your bureau and write letters to david i could write jolly good ones said jack serenely i am sure they would be excellent but they would be nonsense from the other's point of view it is so holy so holy once it wasn't holy to me it was merely a bore then when nadine was born it was not holy but very exciting and hugely delightful but now it is holy dodo put up her foot and kicked jack's knee it's yours as well as mine she said poor dear holy jack but i love you that makes such a difference jack caught dodo's foot in his hand oh jack let go she said it's bad for me instantly his fingers relaxed and a look of agonized apology came over his face dodo laughed oh jack you silly old woman she said it is so easy to take you in but her laughter quickly ceased and she became quite grave again i don't want you to be as sick as nadine and hughie combined she cried but i should like to make a few cheerful remarks about dying we've all got to do it and it doesn't make it any closer to talk about it it's a pity we can't practise it so as to be able to do it nicely but it's one performance only without rehearsals unless you die daily like st paul i don't think i shall do it at all solemnly or tragically jack for it would not be the least in keeping with my life to have one tragic scene at the end nor would it suit the rest of my life to be frightened at it you see if we all held hands and stood in a row and said 'one two three now we'll die' it wouldn't be at all alarming and then you see from a religious point of view god has been such a brick is that profane i don't think it is such a brick to me all my life that it seems most unlikely that he won't see me through jack dear you look depressed i won't talk about it any more i shall very likely out live you and i shall be such a comfort to you when you are dying i shall be exceedingly annoyed just as you said you would be if i did it but oh my dear i shall say au revoir to you with such a stout heart and when i pass through the valley of the shadow myself how i shall look for your dear gray eyes to welcome me it will be interesting and now as they say at the end of sermons i must get ready to go out with nadine i promised to go out with her for an hour before lunch pull me up and give me a chaste salute on my marble brow what a good invention you are it would be worse than going back to the days of hansoms and four wheelers to be without you without undue flattery it would dodo's slight attack of seriousness evaporated completely and having tried the effect of her hat which comprised so she said the entire flora and fauna of brazil on jack's head put it on her own and sent a message to nadine that she had been waiting an hour and a half but hughie shall not come out with us she said since he and nadine don't pay the smallest attention to me when they are together and i feel alone in london besides nadine has to buy things that young gentlemen don't know anything about and here you are at last my darling nadine but i'm not going to take your darling with us any more than he takes you to his haberdasher or whoever it is sells that sort of thing don't look cross hughie because jack's going to let you have the yacht and you and nadine can be unwell to your heart's content go and sulk at your club dear for an hour and then you come back to lunch and stop for tea and dinner if you like but the obduracy of your esteemed mother in law elect on the subject of the drive is quite invincible dear me what beautiful language nadine and her mother did their errands and as only edith was going to lunch with them who was almost invariably half an hour late but who if she arrived in time would be quite certain to begin lunch without them they prolonged their outing by a turn in the park the morning was of that exquisite tempered heat that lies midway between the uncertain warmth of spring and the fierceness of true midsummer weather and following as it did on a week of rainy days had brought out both crowds and flowers the little green seats and shady alleys were full of kaleidoscopic color from hats and parasols and summer dresses and more stable than these but hardly less brilliant were the clumps of full flowered rhododendrons and beds of blossomings the dust had been laid on the roads and washed from the angled planes and summer sat in the lap of spring summer and spring too as it were sat side by side in dodo's motor and who could say which was the more glorious the mother in the splendor of her full blown life or nadine that exquisite opening bud still dewy in the morning of her days no wild flower but more like an orchid fragrant and subtle and complex all that still remained to her she would never be wild rose or honeysuckle in spite of the big simple human love which had come to her and daily sprang higher flame like to day neither paid much attention to the crowd that contained so many friends occasionally dodo blew a sudden gale of kissed finger tips at some especially beloved face but the smile that never left her face though it did duty for general salutation was really inspired from within her daughter's awakening was a deep joy to dodo you and hughie and jack and i ought to be stuffed and put in the south kensington museum darling she said as curious survivals of absolutely happy people who are getting exceedingly rare i should utter a few words of passionate protest when the executioner and the taxidermist arrived but i think i should consent for the good of the nation in general nadine disagreed altogether we are much more useful alive she said because we're infectious or would our broad fatuous grins be infectious when we were stuffed oh there's seymour mama do kiss your hand violently because it wouldn't be suitable for me to i can only smile regretfully but you don't regret said dodo after giving him a perfect volley of kissed finger tips no but only because i can't my will regrets he has sent me a lovely necklace of jade with a little label 'jade for the jade' on it so i think he must feel better as it's a sort of joke i wrote him quite a nice little note and said how dear it would be of him to come to my wedding if he felt up to it dodo giggled my dear that is exactly what i should have done at your age she said but i think i should have kissed my hand to him just now and people would certainly have thought you heartless if you had just because they have got great wooden hearts themselves accurately regulated that pump exactly sixty times in a minute neither more nor less you do feel kindly and warmly to poor seymour and you trust he is getting over it about stuffing us now i'm not quite sure i should stuff papa jack he's anxious about me poor old darling as if at my age i didn't know how to have a baby properly i talked about dying a little which upset him i'm afraid though it wasn't in the least meant to my dear to think that in ten days from now you'll be married nadine i do look forward to being a grandmama i want to be lots of grandmamas if you see what i mean then there'll be papa hughie and papa jack and look there's papa waldenech i never knew he was in town we must stop a moment i have not seen him since he came uninvited to my ball in the autumn a little bit on ah what a fool i am he meant me not to tell you so bear in mind that i haven't waldenech my dear what a surprise they drew up at the curb and he came to the carriage door hat in hand courteous distinguished and evil i have just come from paris he said it is charming of you to welcome me nadine too nadine is your father to be allowed to come to your wedding may i dodo had half risen to greet him and he saw the lines of her figure he broke off short you are going to be a mother again he said yes my dear but you needn't tell the albert memorial about it said she and of course you may come to nadine's wedding i had no notion you would be in england he appeared to pay not the slightest attention to this but looked at her eagerly hungrily at those wonderful brown eyes at the still youthful oval of her face at the mouth he had so often kissed my god you are a beautiful woman he said and you used to be mine then he turned abruptly and walked straight away from them without another glance dodo looked after him in silence a moment frowning and smiling together poor old chap it was a shock to him somehow she said but he'll go back to the ritz and steady himself how old he has got to look nadine but nadine had the frown without the smile i didn't like the way he went off she said he didn't give another thought to my wedding mama after he saw he looked hungry for you and he looked horrible he admired you so enormously he was thinking of what he had lost and what papa jack had gained and i felt frightened of him just as i felt frightened one night when i was very little and he came stumbling into the nursery and wanted to say good night to me i remember my nurse tried to turn him out and he looked as if he would have murdered her poor daddy isn't a nice man you know but nadine looked more puzzled than vexed dodo's frown had quite cleared away she was far too essentially happy to mind little surface disturbances poor old daddy she said he was startled darling and when people are startled they look like themselves that is all and daddy isn't quite nice any more than the rest of us are but it was rather sweet of him to want to go to your wedding i hope he will be sober he will probably want to kiss us all in the vestry all of us except jack i shall certainly kiss him if he shows the slightest wish that i should do so but he might be nasty to jack perhaps we had better not tell jack he is here it might make him anxious again like when i talked about death this morning oh nadine look at those delicious horses cantering along and praising god because they feel so strong and young what a rotten seat that man has oh of course he has because he's berts how he fidgets his horse berts dear and dodo blew a shower of kisses on the end of her fingers nadine's enjoyment in this liquid air had been suddenly extinguished she herself hardly knew why but her lowered pleasure she felt to be connected with her father she tried very sensibly to get rid of it by speech for the unreal thing when spoken became so fantastically absurd was daddy ever very jealous about you she asked dodo recalled her mind from the tragedy of berts riding so badly but violently pea green with it she said so that sometimes i didn't know if i could say good morning to the butler in safety that was in the early days and i am bound to confess that he got over it after that came my turn to be jealous but i never took my turn for between the particular old brandy and mademoiselle chose if you understand poor daddy became entirely impossible but for auld lang syne i shall certainly kiss him in the vestry after your wedding and he shall sign his name if he feels up to it dodo's face recovered all its radiance and he was the father who begot you she said how can i ever forget that you joy of mine i should be a beast if i wanted to but he did look rather wicked just now i think we had better turn or edith will have finished lunch and gone away waldenech's appearance did not belie him he both looked and felt very wicked indeed the sight of dodo so soon to become the mother of another man's child had caused to break out into hideous activity a volcano that had long smoldered under the slag and ashes of his drunken and debauched days and he flamed with a jealousy the more passionate because it had so long slumbered he felt confused and bewildered by the violence of this unexpected passion and as dodo had said he felt he must steady himself he wanted to think clearly and constructively to determine exactly what he must do and how he must do it at present he knew only of one necessity that even as he had taken dodo away from jack years ago so now he must take jack away from dodo the particular old brandy taken in sufficient quantities would clear his head and enable him to think out ways and means he shut himself into his sitting room at the ritz and by degrees the monstrous nightmare like lucidity that alcohol brings to heavy drinkers brightened in his brain and he sat there emancipated from all moral laws and thought clearly and connectedly seeing himself and his desires as the legitimate center of all existence nothing else and nobody else could be reckoned with his jealousy that had shot flaming up no longer flared and flickered it shone with a steady and tremendous light a beacon to guide him and show him the way he must follow what should happen to himself he did not care nor did it enter into his calculations most likely it would be better when he had accounted for jack to account for himself also that would arrange itself he would see when the time came how he felt about it and the time had better be soon for there was no reason for delay but he pushed away from him a glass which he had just refilled he had drunk himself steady and knew that if he went on he would drink himself maudlin and confused again it would have been strange if by this time he did not know the stages even as a man knows the stairs in his own house he sat still a moment longer rehearsing in his mind what he had taken so long to construct he would go to the house in eaton square so that dodo would be there and he would see her look on what he had done to make the picture complete that touch was necessary though he did not want to hurt her then he would have finished with them and would finish with himself instead of waiting for the farce of a trial and the ignominy of what must follow the afternoon had already waned and looking at his watch he saw that it was after seven that was a suitable hour to go on his errand for it was probable that jack would be at home now soon to dress for dinner as he got up to get from his despatch box the revolver that he knew was there he saw the glass of brandy which a little while ago he had pushed away from him still standing there and from habit merely he drank it off then he put the weapon completely loaded into his pocket and took one more look round before leaving the room somehow deep down in him and smothered and shadowed was some vague repugnance towards what he was going to do and once more forgetful of his resolution not to trespass on the steadiness of nerves the spirit brought him he refilled and emptied his glass that he felt sure would soon stifle any conflicting voices within him his plan was actively seated in his brain inertia almost would achieve it he had been indoors all the afternoon and an instinct for fresh air and the evening breeze caused him to go on foot across the green park the air was fresh but coldish and it or the extra brandy he had just taken seemed quickly to harmonize and quiet that vague jangle of repugnance that twanged discordantly in his mind and he became reconciled to himself again but the wish not to hurt dodo became rather more pronounced in his poor fuddled brain he had to kill jack but he hoped she would not mind very much he could make her understand surely that he was obliged to do it he had always been devoted to her even when he most outraged the merest decencies of their married life and this morning the sight of her glorious beauty had wakened not jealousy only she was superb in her wonderful womanhood she was more beautiful now than she had ever been and nadine was not fit to sit beside her it was with surprise that he saw he had come to the house a motor was at the door which stood open on the pavement there was a footman bearing a coat and hat holding a rug in his hand another bareheaded stood by the door waldenech told himself that he had come very opportunely for it was clear that they would soon come out he hesitated a moment swaying a little where he stood not certain whether he should just wait for them or go into the house soon he decided to take this latter course for it was possible that dodo or nadine might be going without jack and seeing him standing there would ask him what he wanted that risked his whole plan they might suspect something and with one hand in his coat pocket where his fingers grasped the thing he had brought with him he went up the three steps that led to the front door is lord chesterford in he asked yes sir but his lordship is just going out said the man please tell him that prince waldenech would like to speak to him i shall not detain his lordship more than a moment dodo and her husband had dined early for they were going to the opera which began at eight and at this moment the dining room door which opened on to the back of the hall opposite the staircase was thrown open and waldenech heard dodo's voice come on jack she said or we shall miss the overture which is the best part and you will say it is my fault she came quickly round the corner resplendent and jeweled and saw his figure with its back to the light that came in through the open door so that for half a second she did not recognize him simultaneously jack came out of the dining room just behind her as he came out he turned up the electric light in the hall which had not been lit and she saw waldenech's face and at the moment he took out of his pocket what his right hand was fingering stand aside dodo he said rather thickly it is not for you not more than half a dozen paces separated them and for answer dodo walked straight up to him with arms outstretched so that he could not pass her screening jack she was menacing as a greek fury beautiful as the dawn dominant as the sun you coward and murderer she said give me that for one half second he stood nerveless and irresolute his poor sodden wits startled into sobriety by the power and glory of her and without a moment's hesitation she seized the revolver that was pointed straight at her and tore it from his hand by a miracle of good luck it did not go off out of the house she cried for i swear to you that in another second i will shoot you like a dog did you think you would frighten me frighten me you drunken brute she stood there like some splendid wild animal at bay absolutely fearless and irresistible without a single word he turned and shuffled out into the street again shut the door said dodo to the footman then suddenly and unmistakably she felt the life within her stir and a start of blinding pain shot through her so short had been the whole scene that jack hurrying after her had only just reached her side when she dropped the revolver and laid her arms on his shoulders leaning on him with all her weight jack my time has come she said oh glory to god my dear just as dawn began to brighten in the sky dodo's baby was born and soon made a lusty announcement that he lived presently jack was admitted for a moment just to see his son and then went out again to wait it was but a couple of hours afterwards that he was again sent for by a well pleased nurse i never saw such vitality said this excellent woman it's like what they tell about the gipsies dodo was lying propped up in bed and her baby was at her breast she gave jack a brilliant smile of welcome oh jack you and david and i she said was there ever such a family i may talk to you for five minutes and then david and i are going to sleep but about last night i don't know how much the servants saw or what they know but waldenech came here to shoot you he was drunk poor wretch he couldn't face me for a moment it was such a deplorable failure that i feel sure he won't try it again but i should be happier if he left england see your solicitor about it have him threatened if he doesn't go do that this morning dear and when i wake be able to tell me he has gone and now oh you and david and i i told you i should behave in some unusual manner but i didn't think waldenech would be concerned in it jack kiss the top of david's adorable head but don't disturb him and then my dearest kiss me and i shall instantly go to sleep and neither waldenech nor i will be able to go to nadine's wedding but my reason for not going is much the nicest isn't it oh my david about ten o'clock jack went out to do as dodo had bidden him and preferring to walk crossed the green park and went through the arcade fronting the ritz hotel he had forgotten to ask dodo where waldenech was staying but fancied that when he was in england last winter he had stopped here so he went through the revolving door and into the bureau is prince waldenech stopping here he asked the clerk looked down to consult the register of guests before he answered his serene highness left for paris this morning the end
