prologue chapter i the call from without colonel fanshawe was riding slowly back to his bungalow about an hour before the sunset of a hot and brilliant day in the middle of march he had spent a long day in the saddle for the commanderinchief of the indian forces was at peshawar on a visit of inspection and he had reviewed and inspected and inspected and reviewed and given medals and colours and compliments and criticism till the whole garrison who had been under arms on the parade ground since an early hour that morning was ready to drop with a wellearned fatigue that evening there was to be a great dinnerparty followed by a dance at the house of the resident tomorrow the commanderinchief was to go up the khyber pass returning just in time to catch the night train to lahore arriving there at daybreak and prepared to spend another day similar to this and yet so reflected colonel fanshawe he was made to all appearance of flesh and blood exactly like anybody else indeed he was endowed with flesh to a somewhat phenomenal extent for though not of unusual height he swung a full eighteen stone into his saddle ate and drank in perfectly amazing quantities and without doubt would tonight prance genially and colossally from beginning to end of every dance with a succession of the prettiest girls in peshawar it was equally certain that at the conclusion he would go in person to the bandmaster and beg as a personal favour for an extra or two and colonel fanshawe lean and slight and in excellent condition felt himself a pigmy and an invalid in contrast with this indefatigable elephant who all day had seemed only to wax in energy and boisterousness and monumental briskness it was as if some huge government building had burst into active life john bull himself as in the pages of some patriotic print had become incarnate commanding and guffawing and perspiring but the day though fatiguing to everybody else except the commanderinchief had been highly satisfactory twice had he complimented colonel fanshawe on the smartness of his pathan regiment and since the regiment was one of the two institutions for which the colonel lived and loved it followed that in retrospect his habitual content which at all times was of a very sterling quality had been lifted to the levels of the sublime and anticipation was up to the level of retrospect for the second of these institutions which engaged all his energies and affection was the home towards which he was now ambling along the dusty roads in the imperturbable fashion of a man who was not gifted with much imagination he enjoyed what he had to the almost complete exclusion of desiring that which he had not and though if a genuine wishingcap had been put ready to his hand he would certainly have had a request or two to make he never in the absence of that apocryphal piece of headgear let his mind dwell on what it might have brought him his wife the second of that name and elizabeth the daughter of the first almost completely exiled from his mind all desires connected with his home and were sufficient to satisfy the emotional needs of a love which was not the less luminous because it lacked the iridescence of romance it burned with a steady and unwinking flame without rockets and multicoloured stars and was eminently suited to light a mans way so that he should go without stumbling through the dusk of a hazardous world for the sake of his wife or of elizabeth he would have given his life unquestioningly and with cheerfulness regretting the necessity should such arise but he would have done so without any of the ecstasy of selfsacrifice that inspired the hymns and the beatitudes on the lips of martyrs in this sunny afternoon of middle age which had come to him there were none of the surprising flames that glorify the hour of dawn the road from the parade ground through cantonments lay level and dusty carobtrees dense and varnished of foliage with the long scimitarshaped seedpods of last year still clinging to them met and mingled their branches together overhead giving a vault of shadow from a midday sun but now as the day drew near to its close the level rays poured dazzling between the treetrunks turning the dustridden air into a mist of dusky gold in front seen through the arching trees the huddled native town rose dim and amorphous through the haze and the acres of flowering fruittrees were a flush of pink and white petals southwards level and infinite as the sea the indian plain stretched to the farthest horizons to the north rose the hills shoulder over shoulder till they culminated in fleecy clouds among which scarcely distinguishable there glistened the immemorial whiteness of the eternal snows here down in the plain the very existence of those frozen cliffs seemed incredible for though there were still a dozen days of march to run it seemed as if the powers of the air in whose control is the great oven of india had drawn the damper so to speak out of that cosmetic furnace during the last week to see if the heating apparatus was all in order for the approaching hot season and colonel fanshawes decision against which there had been the growlings of domestic mutiny that elizabeth should start for england the next week crystallized itself into the inexorable he had gone so far in the freshness of the morning hours today as to promise her to reconsider his decision but he determined now to telegraph for her passage as soon as he got home he quickened his pace a little as he approached his gate at the lure of the refreshing hours that he had promised himself in his garden before it was necessary to dress for the dinner and the ball the hot weather had already scorched to a cinder the herbs and grasses of unwatered places but no such tragedy had yet overtaken this acre of green coolness with its ditches and channels of unlimited irrigation where the unusual heat had but caused the expansion in a burst of premature luxuriance of all the flowers that should have decorated april so brilliant was this galaxy that colonel fanshawe could hardly regret it though it meant that even now the days of the garden were numbered and that through april it would sleep unblossoming till the rains of may stirred it into that brief and delirious frenzy of flowering again that lasts but for a day or two in some sultry intermission of the streaming skies that so soon open their floodgates again and cover the steaming earth with disjected petals but at present though april would pay the price in barrenness and withered leaf summer and spring were in flower together and tulips and petunias marigolds and flameflower morningglory and bougainvillaea made a jubilance of manycoloured carpet while more precious than all to the colonels soul his rose hedges of crimson ramblers gloire de dijon and the briars of peshawar flared with innumerable fragrance a few days before reluctantly and with some inkling of the sentiments of a murderer who plans a crime he had abandoned marooned so to speak his tenniscourt to die of drought but the motive of his deed really gave a verdict of nothing more bloodthirsty than justifiable grassicide for the well had given unmistakable signs that it was not capable of keeping the whole garden alive besidesand here for a moment his content was clouded againelizabeth was starting for england next week and the tenniscourt became an investment that paid no dividends in pleasure his wife never played she would as soon have thought of coming downstairs to breakfast and certainly she never did that she preferred dancing all night he gave his horse into the charge of his orderly at the gate and a little stiff and bowlegged from so many hours in the saddle walked up the short drive that lay between the abandoned tenniscourt and the rosegarden which was in full effervescence of flower and fragrance between him and his garden there was a relation as intimate almost and as comprehending as that between two personalities and had some one with the gift of vivid yet easily intelligible eloquence presented his feeling towards it as towards some beautiful dumb creature with a living identity of its own the colonel though it had never struck him in that light before would have acknowledged the truth of the imagery just now this silent sweetsmelling creature had begun to make a stir again after the hot windlessness of the day for the breeze of sunset invigorating as wine had just sprung up and wafted the evidence of its fragrant life in sheets and webs of perfume through the sibilant air while as evidence of elizabeth there came through the open windows of the drawingroom as complicated a melee of sound from the grand piano devoted and affectionate as father and daughter were to each other colonel fanshawe felt slightly shy of elizabeth when she was at the piano for elizabeth playing was elizabeth transformed a sort of fury of passion and intentness possessed her she evoked from the strings a personality as real to herself as was his garden to the colonel and all this intensity as her bewildered father occasionally said to himself was born from the compositions of some german johnny in that rapt adoration of melody elizabeths mother lived again just as she seemed to glow again from within elizabeths flushed face and sparkling eyes as she played so refraining from interrupting his daughter in her ecstatic communings with the particular german johnny who engaged her attention at the moment the colonel stepped softly round the corner and ordered himself a cup of tea in his bedroom with which he refreshed himself as he adopted a gardengarb for his hot and closefitting uniform his wife as he well knew would be resting in her sittingroom in anticipation of the fatigue of the dinner and dance which were to close the day had there been no dance or dinner in prospect she would be doing the same thing in repair of previous fatigue she was one of those women who are capable of exertion as long as that over which they exert themselves furnishes them with amusement an hours uncongenial occupation tired her completely out but she was able to do anything she wanted to and such a performance under such circumstances seemed but to invigorate her her husband rejoiced in her strength and sympathized with her weakness with equal sincerity he was no lilyhanded gardener no fingertip lover who with an ivoryhandled secateur snips off minute dead twigs and selects a rosebud for his buttonhole but went about his business with the tender ruthlessness that true gardening demands up one of the pillars of the veranda there climbed together a great ramping mass of blue convolvulus and an ards pillar and the constricting plant was quietly intent on strangling the rose now the convolvulus was an interloping adventuress invading territories that were not her own and regretfully but inexorably colonel fanshawe committed murder snipping off the sappy stem at its root and gently disentangling its voluted tendrils as he stripped it down the new bullpup came with sentimental sighs out of the house and then becoming aware no doubt by some subtle brainwave that the murdered morningglory was an enemy flung himself on the bestrewn tendrils and got tightly involved therein and rolled away in a state of wildeyed and bewildered entanglement barking hoarsely upon which an observant pigeon on the roof remarked quite clearly look at the fool look at the fool simultaneously with a loud false chord the wild torrents of notes within ceased there came a sound quite exactly as if somebody had banged down the lid of a piano and elizabeth came out on to the veranda she was very tall as tall almost as her father and the long lines of her figure showed slim and boylike through the thin blouse and blue linen skirt against which the evening breeze pressed moulding them to the limbs within her hair lay thick and low above her small face and her mouth in spite of the heightened colour of her cheeks and the vividness of her eyes drooped a little as if fatigued she had clasped her longfingered hands behind her head and she stood there a moment without seeing her father with amusement gathering in her eyes as she observed the comedy of the constricted puppy then turning her head she saw him oh daddy she cried are you back and if so why didnt you tell me the fact is that you love your garden better than your only daughter colonel fanshawe had two nails and a piece of bass string in his mouth destined for the support of the disentangled rose and could give no assurance beyond an incoherent mumbling it is true said elizabeth and what makes me feel it more keenly is that i havent had any tea daddy do leave your silly plants and talk to me i havent spoken to a soul all day mamma had lunch in her room she is saving up for this evening and i havent seen anybody in fact it has all been rather dismal ive been playing the piano and i have come to the conclusion that i shall never be able to play at all so i banged down the lid and i shall never open it again do get down from that silly ladder and talk to me colonel fanshawe was methodical he put the two nails in a box and looped up the spray of the rose in a manner which though temporary would last till he could get to work again that sounds rather a dismal little chronicle lizzy he said so if you feel that we cant talk while i go on gardening it has nothing to do with my feelings remarked elizabeth it is a mere question of external impossibilities have you had tea yes then come and see me have mine i shall eat quantities and quantities of tea and not have any dinner i think one cant dine alone and you and mamma are dining out at the residency and going to the dance daddy i do think mamma might have let me go to the ball im eighteen and if one isnt old enough to go to a dance at eighteen i dont know when one is elizabeth paused a moment and put her nose in the air i dont believe mamma will want me to come out till it is time for me to go in again she remarked colonel fanshawe had an admirable gift of silence when he concluded that there was no advantage to be gained by speech he could refrain from it instead of like the most part of mankind making a series of injudicious observations at the bottom of elizabeths remark as he well knew there lay stewing a herb of rather bitter infusion which he had no desire to stir up but elizabeth so it seemed felt disposed to do the stirring herself mamma will have the next eight months all to herself she said and she can dance all the time i wish to state quite explicitly that i think she might have let me go to this dance i have told her so and so for fear she should tell you i do it myself elizabeths eye wandered on to the path and she broke off suddenly oh my beloved shah jehan she said you will certainly strangle yourself this appeared highly probable for shah jehan the young and imperial bullpup had managed to entangle himself so strictly in the yards of strong convolvulus which the colonel had cut down that his eyes were starting out of his head and only the most remote sort of growl could escape from his enveloped throat with the cakeknife which she snatched up from the teatable elizabeth ran to his rescue its such a blessing daddy she said as she returned to him that you and i are so very much one person because we can say anything we like to each other and it is certain that the other onehow tiresome language isthe one i mean who listens only really listens to his own thoughts ah my dear elizabeth said he suddenly laying his hand on her arm if elizabeths mother lived again when elizabeth played masked behind her daughters face she appeared with no guard of flesh in between when elizabeth said that she drew his hand through her arm and strolled with him up the path it is so daddy she repeated and when i grumble to you it is only as if i grumbled to myself mamma might have let me go to this one dance and she doesnt because she wants all the dancing she can get herself and naturally doesnt want to sit in a row instead but shell have to let me come out next autumn oh by the way i had forgotten the most important thing of all have you settled when i am to go to england yes dear next week i have telegraphed for your passage what a loathsome and disgusting daddy remarked elizabeth possibly but the loathsome daddy isnt going to have a tired and whitefaced daughter if he can avoid it i shall miss you more than you can possibly guess lizzie elizabeth gave a great sigh im so glad she said i hope you will be thoroughly unhappy i shant like it either but mamma wont mind thats a comfort elizabeth i wish yes i know dear so do i you neednt explain i wish to begin to eat my enormous tea also so let us sit down i dont want to go to england and besides staying with aunt julia is exactly like lying on a featherbed with all the luxuries of the season on a table close to you and the windows tightly shut and edith is like the clean laceborder to the pillow i shall be so comfortable well thats something lizzie it isnt its nothing and worse than nothing i dont want to be comfortable nothing that is really alive is ever comfortable aunt julia and edith and all heathmoor generally are dead and buried i am not sure they do not stink my dear as it says in the bible said elizabeth nobody there is ever hungry or thirsty nobody is unhappy or happy nobody wants they are all like fishes in an aquarium you cant get at them because there is a sheet of strong glass in between and there arent any tigers or burning ghats or cobras or cholera i shouldnt be particularly sorry if there were fewer of those blessings here remarked her father perhaps but they help to make things real it is so easy to lose all sense of being alive if you are too comfortable elizabeth pointed to the molten west there she said thats a sunset but in england for the most part they wrap it up in nice soft thick clouds so that it isnt a real sunset and dear aunt julia wraps up her own life and the life of every one about her in the same way she mops up every ones vitality as with a sponge by thinking exclusively about not getting wet or tired oh how i love this naked tired wicked mysterious land with all its deadliness and its dust and its sunsets and its secrets which i shall never fathom any more than i can fathom schumann im a savage you know i love wild unhappy things elizabeth broke off suddenly i dont believe even you understand what i mean daddy she said yes my dear i do said he i could tell you exactly what you mean but have your say first you have not nearly done yet i will tell you what you mean when you have finished elizabeth laughed that will be a good thing she said because though i know that i mean something i often have not the least idea what it is daddy i wish i was a boy so terribly sometimes and i know you do too if i was a boy i would get up now and kiss you and walk straight off into the direction of where the moon is just going to rise i would have adventuresoh such adventures my dear you would get malaria and come home next morning with a violent headache and ask me for some quinine she shook her head you are wrong she said i wouldnt come back even to you for years not until i had learned what it all means i would be afraid of nothing i would shrink from nothing perhaps i should see malaria herself in the jungle down there by the indusa tall whitefaced woman with golden irises to her eyes and i would talk to her and learn about her i would go into the temple of the brahmins at benares and listen to them preaching sedition i would sit by the corpse as it burned by the river bank watching it oh so quietly and loving it i would go into the opium dens and learn how to dream learn how to dream i wonder if that is what i want to do i think it must be that sometimes when i am playing i begin to dream and just as i am getting deep i strike a false chord and wake myself up or mamma comes in and says it is time for me to go driving with her elizabeth had forgotten about the enormous tea she had intended to eat and still sat upright on the edge of her chair looking out over the gathering night already in the swiftly darkening dusk the colours were withdrawn from the flowerbeds and only the heavy odours gave token of their blossoming a streak of dwindling orange lingered in the west above in the fathomless blue stars that five minutes before had been but minute pinpricks of luminance were grown to yellow lamps and globes of light somewhere in the lines a bugle suddenly blared out its message to the stillness and was silent again a little farther off a tomtom beat with endless iteration then she spoke again more rapidly it is only by dreaming that you can get close to the world she said and hope to get at its meaning people who are completely awake spend all their time in doing things that dont matter you for instance daddyyou and your inspections and reviews what does it all come to would this world be one whit the worse if you didnt do any of it yet perhaps i am wronging you for anyhow you can go mooning about your garden for hours together let me seewhere had i got to colonel fanshawe was watching elizabeth a little uneasily this strange mood of hers was not new to him half a dozen times before he had known her go off into these dim rhapsodies and they somewhat disconcerted him he made an effort to bring her back into realms less shadowy where had you got to he asked upon my word my dear i dont think you had got anywhere particular wouldnt it be well to begin that enormous tea of which you spoke but the girl was fathoms deep in this queer reverie of speculation she shook her head at him no you dont understand yet she said one has to dream first before one can do any good while one is awake unless you call baking bread and milking cows doing good you have to penetrate penetrate it is a kingdom with high walls round it and i expect there are many gates perhaps we all have our own gates perhaps mine is a gate made of music and yours is a gardengate dont misunderstand me daddy or think i am talking nonsense or think again that what i mean is religion though i dare say there is a religiongate as well all i know is that you have to pass dreaming through one of the gates in order to get inside the kingdom and when you do get inside you find that it isnt so much that you have got inside the kingdom as that the kingdom has got inside you i know it must be so each of us i expect has to find himself and when he has found himself oh god knows she broke off and instantly poured herself out a cup of tea i am so hungry she said and i had quite forgotten while i eat and drink daddy you shall keep your promise and tell me what i mean you said you knew or have i been talking the most dreadful rubbish but if so i am rubbish myself for what i have said is me colonel fanshawe lit a cigarette no my dear you havent been talking rubbish he said but if i had said exactly the same it would have been rubbish he meditated a moment or two for though he felt what he wanted to say it was rather difficult for him to find the words for it at the same time also there was that in what elizabeth had said which strangely moved him it recalled to him in this sunny afternoon of life something of what he had felt when he brought home worshipping and loving elizabeths mother you have talked admirable sense dear he said for the very simple reason that you are eighteen but it would be rubbish in my mouth at fortyeight you feel that you are surrounded by delicious mysteries into the heart of which you mean to penetrate you can do it too and i so earnestly hope you will while you are yet young you can fall in love elizabeth looked at him in disappointed amazement is that all she asked i assure you it is enough you will not believe it now but fall in love said the girl again with a man just with a common man yes just with a common man said he at least it is quite certain that the immense majority of mankind will call him a common man you will find that he makes everything beautiful but i know how beautiful it all is already said she yes and it all puzzles you you dont know what it means well it means what i have told youlove oh daddy is that all said the girl again in a way it is i mean that you cant go beyond that but again he paused feeling a sudden shyness even with his own daughter in speaking of anything that concerned him so intimately but though you cant go beyond love he said you can go into itpenetrate penetrate as you said just now yourself and the more you penetrate into it the more you will see that there is no end to it and no beginning either and then you will call it by another name he paused for a moment and got up as he heard himself somewhat shrilly summoned from within the house it seems to you all rather dull i am afraid my dear he said but it isnt elizabeth rose also but why would it be nonsense for you to speak of it as i did she asked and why is it excellent sense for me to do so because when you are fortyeight my dear you will have had to learn a certain sort of patience and indulgence which is quite out of place when you are eighteen you will have seen that the people who bake bread and milk cows and review troops as i do may conceivably be doingwell doing quite nicely but you are quite right to think them useless old fogies at present elizabeth gave him a quick little kiss you are a darling she said and now i am going to vanish swiftly round the corner of the veranda mamma has called you three times and you havent answered you will get into trouble and so i desert you elizabeths amiable scheme was executed a little too late she had barely got halfway down the veranda when her stepmother rustled out of the drawingroom already dressed for her party her light slight figure was still like a girlslike a girls too was her evening dress with its simple straight cut nor did her facesmooth delicate and softbelie the impression but her forehead and the outer corners of her eyes were a little lined as if a sleepless night had momentarily devitalized her youth and her voice when she spoke was oldold and querulous bob i have been calling and calling you she said and are you not dressed yet what have you been doing elizabeth why did you not send your father to dress we shall be late as usual and if husband and wife are late every one always thinks it is the wifes fault do go and dress my dear and elizabeth my darling will you come and talk to me while i wait for him i am so dreadfully tired i am sure i do not know how i shall get through the evening what a pity you are not a year older and then you could go instead of me and let me pass a quiet evening at home or why are not you and i going to have a dear little evening alone together elizabeth retraced her steps i am quite willing to go instead of you mamma she said dearest i know how unselfish you are but you must keep your sweet girlish freshness another year and not tire yourself with sitting up and dancing all night i know you think i ought to have let you go tonight but you must allow me to judge of that indeed my dear i feel sure you do this little speech was admirably characteristic of mrs fanshawe at one moment she would be finding fault with everybody at the next she would shower tenderness on them it mattered nothing to her that only a few hours ago she and elizabeth had exchanged peculiarly clearcut and opposed views on the subject of this dance she was quite capable a few hours later of assuming that they were quite in accord about it she never had the smallest qualms on the subject of her own sincerity as is the habit of thoroughly insincere people she was merely quite determined to get her own way over any point in which she had a preference and having got it always proceeded to make herself charming in a rather helpless and clinging kind of manner whether her husband had ever gone so far as to admit even to himself the fact of her insincerity is doubtful where his affection was engaged he lost all power of criticism where he loved he swallowed whole mrs fanshawe gave a delicate little sigha very perfect and appealing little sigh it might have been supposed so finished was it so perfectly phrased that she had practised it for years in private such was not the case it was quite natural to her artificial self and came to her lips as spontaneously as song to a thrush we must see a great deal of each other these next days elizabeth she said before you go off to all the gaiety and delights of england how i long to come with you for i am sure the hot weather will utterly knock me up but of course my duty is with your father i should not dream of leaving him while i went home to enjoy myself but you will go up to the hills next month mamma will you not said the girl and stop there till the autumn and you will like that wont you mrs fanshawe gave the famous little sigh again like it my dear it is the emptiest emptiest life she said nothing but gossip and parties all day and dancing in the evening i would far sooner stop down here with your father and only go away with him when he can get off but of course he would not hear of that for he knows very well that to spend the summer here would kill me i should not dream of distressing him by suggesting it occasionally elizabeths patience gave way before the accumulation of such insincerities in general she put up with them unrebelliously adapting herself to the experience of daily life but now and then she rose in flagrant and unsuspected mutiny she did so on this occasion as her father appeared again dressed for this evenings functions daddy she said mamma has been telling me how much she would like to stop here with you instead of going up to the hills wouldnt that be nice for you it sounds a charming plan mamma mrs fanshawe did not suffer a moments discomposure she took elizabeths chin daintily in her fingers and gave her a little butterfly kiss which could not disarrange anybodys complexion darling what an idea she said what can i have been saying to make you think i meant that goodnight my little sweet one go to bed early and i shall come to my room like a mouse so as not to disturb you and in turn dear would you mind not beginning to practise till shall we say eleven tomorrow morning begin then and wake me up with some delicious thing like what you were playing so very early this morning goodnight sweet cinderella elizabeths rebellion vanished in a sense of amusement she knew that she might as well expect to cause a blush of embarrassment on the face of the serene moon by repeating to a mere mortal some unconsidered remark of hers as to cause her stepmother a moments loss of selfcomposure and she smiled at the butterfly lips even when mrs fanshawe caused her the greatest irritation she could not banish altogether the instinct of protection and tenderness towards that remarkably wellequipped little lady she was really about as capable of taking care of herself as an ironclad battleship anchored in a calm sea with guns agape and torpedonets spread but she conveyed so subtle an impression of dependence and timidity that even the victims of her most trying insincerities relented towards her as towards a pretty child eager for enjoyment it was so easy to strike the smile off her face goodnight little mamma said elizabeth have a nice time and dance every dance and i shant disturb you tomorrow by my practising as i am going with daddy up the khyber my darling wont that be rather a long day for you i hoped perhaps we should spend tomorrow quietly together you and i oh no not a bit long said elizabeth again with a little spark of irritation i shant have spent all night dancing like you goodnight dear daddy i shall be ready to start at eight elizabeth made a renewed but absentminded attack on her tea when the others had gone countermanded dinner and in spite of her lately registered vow never to touch a piano again went back into the drawingroom and opened it a modern musician a modern and ordinary concertfrequenter indeed would have pitied the rusticity of her oldfashioned taste for not only were the works but even the names of later authors unknown to her and at the present moment she was finding schumanns noveletten a source of rapture and mystery to her but however oldfashioned in taste she had the root of the matter in her profound love of melody and her secret unswerving sense that in music was contained the riddle and the answer of the world she even as all others who have felt the incommunicable spell that lies in beauty of sound knew that to put her feeling into words or even into the cramping outlines of definite thought was to distort and parody it for the essence of the whole matter was that its spell was wordless images of course thronged in spate through her mind as she played or listened to music sometimes it was a figure with veiled face that sang sometimes it was a band of militant spirits who marched sometimes through manycoloured mists that grew thinner and more opalescent as a climax approached there shone an ineffable light but whatever image there came to her she felt its inadequacy it was at the most what a photograph is compared to the landscape which it records music was music to those who understood that would be a more satisfactory statement than any array of images which it suggested tonight as she played she found running like a strong undertow beneath sunlit and placid surfaces certain words of her father was it indeed love that inspired this beauty if so how was it that she who so ceaselessly worshipped its manifestation had never a glimpse of the spirit that inspired it he had said more than that he had saidhere the ripple of the triplets enthralled and enchained her for a momenthe had said that for her the love of a common man would interpret things for her elizabeth was playing with divided mind her fingers that is to say already schooled to the notes rendered bar after bar to her inner her contemplative self while her thoughts that swarm of active honeybees that bring the crude treasure to the hive were busy on their quests love he had said would teach her had love taught schumann this moonmelody this starsown heaven of song had the thought of madame schumann made vocal to him the magic spell this was a thing to smile at daddy did not understand of course what music was he did not know how far it transcended in reality all else that can be felt or thought but to do him justice that was not the sum the conclusion of his words the love of a man he had said would teach her love and the dwelling in that would teach her that love had neither end nor beginning and she would call it by another name instantly and ludicrously an image presented itself the image of the regimental church with its pitchpine pews its crude windows its encaustic tiles its braying harmonium yet all these unlovely objects somehow symbolized to her father all and more than all that music symbolized to her and he was not imaginative he was not poetical he was not artistic but to him here was the one eternally satisfying answer to all questions that could ever be asked elizabeths fingers had come to the end of the first novelette but her unconscious mind even as her thinking mind heeded them no longer the whole of her mind conscious and unconscious alike peered eagerly into this asking itself what it saw there and it saw nothing except the coloured glass and the pitchpine heard nothing but the wheeze of the harmonium and the somewhat bucolic merriment of a chant in c major she rose from the piano and strolled out into the yellow honeycoloured moonlighta moonlight not pale and cold but partaking of the ardour and the weariness of the indian day she recalled all that religion direct religious worship that is to say and adoration of a personal and inner principle had meant to her life and fully honest with herself she saw how intensely little how infinitesimally small that had been there were her childish prayers first of all sentences which she could never remember having learned for they came out of her earliest mists of childhood and she could no more recollect being taught either them or their meaning than she could recollect being taught to wash her face they were both on exactly the same plane they belonged to the ritual of getting up and going to bed there was washing to be done there were buttons to be negotiated there were prayers to be said she had taken it on trust that these performances had to be gone through the reason for them had never interested her then a further piece of observance had been introduced into the routine of life and with her best frock and hat she had stood and sat and knelt sometimes with tedium sometimes in absorbed attention to interesting members of the congregation while words were recited and hymns sung it was rather pleasant to recognize among the formulas of public worship her own bedside ejaculations just as it is pleasant to recognize familiar faces in a crowd it was pleasant also to be encouraged to join her small voice in the more cheerful intervals of singing church in fact was a not unattractive way of spending an hour on sunday morning and was part of sunday in precisely the same degree and with exactly the same meaninglessness as her prayers were part of the ritual of dressing and undressing much of what was recited there was connected with the jews who had astounding adventures in egypt and in the wilderness she had heard she had listened she had been taught prepared for confirmation and taken to communion she supposed that she believed that she was a christian but she believed for that matter in australia and for that matter she knew she was english but neither her belief in australia nor in the truth of christianity was coloured with emotion or directed her actions she would not as far as she was aware behave any differently if australia was suddenly swallowed up in the ocean or if the historical facts on which christianity was based were proved to be fallacious in no way did either fact enter into her life she was not for instance kind and honest and truthful because she was a christian but she knew that in beauty she sought a meaning that she had never yet found that at times she agonized to discover and catch hold of something on which to rest from which to derive she had wandered down the length of the dusky garden alleys between the roses and yellow mimosas until she had come to the low stone wall at the bottom of her fathers garden here the cantonments ended and half a mile of dry dusty land lay between her and the native city which rose a black blot against the blue of the night sky a few low huts of cattletenders were scattered about and the featherlike plumes of tamarisk and clearcut aloes broke the level monotony one such aloe close at hand flowered a few days before and now the great stalk fifteen feet high with its cluster of blossoms at the end of the horizontal twigs stood like a telegraph pole across the face of the moon and elizabeth wondered at this prodigious force that from the empty air and barren soil raised in so few days this triumphant engine and distributor of life for years this plant had silently and slowly grown a barren growth in a barren land then suddenly it had been caught in the whirlpool of production of fruition and with a stupendous output which should cause its own exhausted death had erected that beacon flame with that torch of transmitted life had it felt a deathbed revelation as it were was it satisfied to bear witness to life and to die what did it mean what did it all mean a small trodden track lay just below the threefoot wall on which she leaned and at the moment she heard something stir there close to her looking over she saw that an old man was squatting there he had a long white beard that fell nearly to his waist he was naked but for the loincloth about his middle and by his side lay a tall crutch and an empty beggingbowl of wood but round his shoulders which glistened in the moonlight she saw that there was bound the threefold cord that marks a brahmin apparently he heard her movement as she leaned over and turned his head towards her deadly weakness and exhaustion were printed there but more clearly than that there shone from it a quiet indwelling joy an expression of rapture of ecstasy elizabeth spoke to him in the vernacular you want food she said i want nothing lady said he elizabeth suddenly felt that there was something here for her that this aged quiet face so full of joy so shadowed by weakness had a message the feeling was instinctive and unaccountable i will get you food in a moment she said i do not want food said he elizabeth put her hand on the top of the low wall and easily vaulted over but you are tired and hungry she said and you must have travelled far from your native place to come up here where are you from from benares i have searched all my life but today my search is over a sudden wave of uncontrollable emotion seized the girl oh tell me what you have searched for she said what is it it is the life itself he said and i have found he fell back and lay quite still with open eyes and smiling mouth even as he said he had found chapter ii the riddle grows in these days of the diffusion of the products of trade and the benefits doubtful and otherwise of civilization when the amir of afghanistan has a piano and the grand llama of thibet a bicycle it must not shock the reader to know that elizabeth travelled up the khyber pass in the company of her father and the commanderinchief in a motorcar that military hero who had danced threequarters of the night with the young ladies of peshawar not singling out any one for his favours but cutting up his heart into a large number of small pieces and giving one to each was delighted to find there was yet another charming maiden whom he had not yet seen and rolling his jolly sides with laughter supposed that there had been a conspiracy among the beauties of peshawar to keep the fairest of them all out of the ballroom gallantry and excessive animal spirits are apt to be rather disgusting in elderly and obese persons but the vitality of this amiable old warrior was so genuine in its boyishness that the primmest of the sex that he so indiscriminately adored were disarmed by his monstrous flatteries but when our party had passed the fort of jamrud that guards the indian end of the historic road and entered on the defile which from immemorial days has been the coveted key that has locked and unlocked the treasure of india each yard of which has been bought and paid for in blood sir henrys gallant loquacity was abated and the magic of the most historic highway in the world cast its spell on him elizabeth had hardly slept last night but that which had kept her still and wakeful during the dark hours had been so strong a stimulus to her mind that morning saw no haggard cheeks and drooping eyelids but an alert and freshcoloured face that strange sudden death of the whitehaired traveller had not in the least shocked or terrified her for her whole soul was full of the discovery of how wonderful and beautiful a thing is death to one who has lived and who like this aged brahmin had looked upon it not as a cold hand that locks the gates of the sepulchre but as a friend who opens a door into a fuller life an ampler perception hitherto she had never looked on death and in so far as she thought of it at all viewed it as a remote and cruel contingency horrible to contemplate and best forgotten she had no idea that it could be like that that calm moment of healing that had not distorted the peace and the joy on the old mans face but had merely wiped off as if it had been some travelstain some superficial blur the weariness and the age that had a moment before overlaid it she found too that she had no horror at the touch of the lifeless shell and had helped the servants to move the body but before she had called for assistance she had sat a minute or two alone with the body the face of which was calmer and more serene than the flooding moonlight that illuminated it and had kissed in a sort of inexplicable reverence and tenderness the lined forehead and all night long that face had remained with her if she shut her eyes it hovered before her in the darkness of her closed lids answering the question she did not know how to frame triumph conviction certainty attainment was the response she could not doubt that this death by the wayside of but one of the teeming millions and that one so aged so stricken was a royal entry from an antechamber into a throneroom she had seen a soul attain the dead smiling face no less than the last words which the triumphant lips had spoken assured her of it all his life he had sought knowing what he sought as yet she but felt the conviction that there was something to seek for a while however all this sank out of sight in her mind as if she had dropped treasure into a well it was there safe and when she dredged for it she would find it again but for the present as they wound upwards on the narrow road the magic of the way enchained her barer and more precipitous rose the barren hillsides of neutral native territory between which wound the narrow riband of the english road all the way along it within communicable distance from each other the sentries of the khyber rifles guarded the pass to give safe conduct to the caravan that came with carpets and dried fruits and incense from the unknown country beyond and to that which with the products of civilization oil and sheet iron and calico passed from the plain into the mountains of afghanistan they overtook and passed the caravan that had rested last night at the entrance to the pass going westwards six hundred camels bearded and with soft padding steps carried the amorphous mass of merchandise some were gentle beasts mildeyed and depressed others were muzzled with rope and foamed at the mouth myriad were the types of those who drove them there were palefaced boys with flaxen hair there were hawknosed eager pathans of the type so familiar to elizabeth in the parades of her fathers regiment snubnosed mongolians thibetans with their high cheekbones and widelipped mouths and of them all there was not one in whose face this morning elizabeth did not see signs of some secret quest some unconjecturable search one perhaps desired money one an end to this mounting road one was hungry another thirsty but behind all these superficial needs she read into each face a desire a quest often as if in answer to her eager glance she received a questioning stare as if the gazer sought from her some signal that he was waiting for all nature that morning had a question on its lips for elizabeth and an answer if she could but interpret it the grey climbing hillsides already aquiver in the hot sun seemed ready to tell her why they stood there broadflanked and menacing the brook that came cool and bubbling from below a rock by the wayside fringing its course with cresses and feathery grass had learned in the darkness of the earth in the subterrestrial caves from which it sprang the reason of its going scattered by the roadside here and there were afghan villages and at the mouths of excavated dwellings in the hillside stood the wildeyed native folk who were born and lived and loved and fought and murdered maybe all in obedience to some law of being that caused the aloe to shoot up in erect strong stem and blossom and that lit the fires of victory in the eyes of the dying brahmin all seemed ready to tell her the answer could she but frame her question like an obsession this sense of revelation ready to show itself to her could she but put herself on the plane of thought where it lay besieged her all day and as they returned to the caravanserai at the foot of the pass as the sun declining behind the western hills turned them for a moment into glowing amber it seemed to elude her but by a hairsbreadth there all was ready for the reception of the caravan that had marched through the pass into india that day the sellers of bread were pulling out of their circular ovens excavated in the ground the flat cakes of unleavened bread the brass samovars hissed at the booths of the teasellers and cauldrons of hot soup boiled and bubbled already the van of the wayfarers was entering the guarded gates that were pierced in the mud walls and the camels weary with the long stage bent their unwieldy joints and lay down for their drivers to strip off their load some were too tired to eat and resting their queer prehistoric heads on their bended forelegs closed their longlashed eyes and slept others hungry and restless foamed and lathered and snapped greedily at the mounds of dried fodder that their drivers placed before them tired men got their bowls of soup or tea from the stalls and leaning against the sides of their beasts ate their supper and wrapping their heads in their dusty gaycoloured shawls slept by their sleeping animals others inclined for a chat collected round the shops of the provisionsellers against the wall of the serai and smoked and talked when their supper was done others three or four clubbing together lit fires of the brushwood they had gathered during the day and cooked their own food at cheaper rate than obtained in the stores ponies nickered and twitched at their heelropes the sharp pungent smell of the wood fires and the wreaths of aromatic smoke drifted slowly along the sluggish currents of the almost windless air and gradually the empty space of the serai became a mosaic of sleeping men and beasts the hills that the sunset had turned into molten tawny gold grew dark again with the gathering night and in the depth of the velvet vault above the wheeling stars grew large and behind all the various forms of life behind the molten hills behind the sky behind the limbs of the bearded camels behind the chatter and smoke of the provision booths there lurked so it seemed to elizabeth one impulse one energy common to all in her head lay some remembered melody of schumann that seemed to beat to the same indwelling rhythms to which the stars pulsated her father was standing alone beside her a little way off the genial commanderinchief was tasting the soup that bubbled in the tinplated cauldrons pronouncing it excellent and bidding his aidedecamp a slim young weary englishman translate his verdict of it to the gratified boothkeeper some word of the identity of this great boisterous hedonist had been passed about the serai but the tired drovers of the caravan paid little heed and yet here incarnate was the figurehead of the english power that guaranteed their safe journey through the turbulent lands of the frontier and that would avenge with wicked little spitting guns and a troop of khakiclad soldiers any raid that the ungoverned tribe might make but sir henry in spite of this roused but little attention the tired drovers slept those who were more alert were but employed with jokes and snatches of song round the samovars and soupcauldrons the hills and the stars attended as little everything and everybody was intent on his own inward calls just as last night the brahmin who lay by the wayside had no need of food and but thought of the finding of that for which all his years had searched and then elizabeths questing soul suddenly gave up the pursuit of a hidden cause and felt content with the obvious explanation she took her fathers arm oh daddy ive had such a lovely day she said what heaps of different things there are in the world and what heaps of different businesses and it all makes such a jumbled incoherent whole in half an hour we shall be back home again and it will be time to dress and mamma will tell us all she has done today after dinner i will play the piano to you till you snore and as soon as you snore i shall wake you up again and make you write to aunt julia to say when i shall arrive at heathmoor he pressed her hand as it lay in the crook of his arm it is a less tragic view than that of last night he said i know at this moment i dont mind the least about going to england imim going to take things as they come elizabeth paused a moment as with the vividness of ocular hallucination the brahmins face once more swam before her eyes but that doesnt mean i am not going to be serious she said i want richly to enjoy doesnt that come in the bible somewhere i expect there are many routes that arrive at the same place to anybody unacquainted with the sum of elizabeths musings that day this was necessarily a cryptic speech it grew more cryptic yet perhaps drink leads the drunkard there she said and music the musician doesnt one develop daddy through ones passions and not through ones renunciations i cant see how starving your desires can possibly help one my dear there are desires and desires he said and where do they all come from surely from the search he was silent a moment and at that moment anything short of enthusiastic acceptance of her illumination was a coldness a hand of ice to elizabeth daddy you dont understand she said as long as we want it doesnt much matter what we want isnt it half the battle to be eager he shook his head again i should talk nonsense if i agreed with you he said eagerness is a sword my dear but it is not armour i dont want armour she said quickly i am not afraid of being hurt ah dont get hurt my darling he said not i and if i do get hurt daddy i shall come crying to you and you will have to comfort me oh ohlook at all those tired men with no beds to lie on and no pillows and no tooth powder or sponges dont you envy them they will wake up in the morning and find themselves there and after all nothing else can matter i dont want to be bothered with possessions i want to be elizabeth suddenly broke off interrupting her speech and thought alike daddy that darling sir henry has had soup and now he is eating unleavened cakes and a peculiarly murderouslooking pathan is tempting him with a pomegranate do stop him he is dining with us in an hours time and mamma will be so vexed if he doesnt eat the most enormous dinner colonel fanshawe with elizabeth still on his arm stepped over a couple of sleeping prostrate forms yes we will go to him he said and you shall tell me more about the simple life afterwards it is getting late sir henry had just cracked a pomegranate in his enormous beefy hands god bless me he was saying i never saw anything look so good fanshawe be kind enough to tell this man in your best pushtoo that theres a fortune in pomegranates why its quite delicious never tasted such a fine fruit colonel fanshawe made some amiable equivalent of all this in pushtoo and spoke to sir henry again he says that his trees will bear in greater abundance than ever now sir but it is rather late i think we ought to be getting home you wont have more than time to eat your dinner in comfort before the train sir henry rejected a mass of seeds yes yes well go he said why heres my miss elizabeth come to insist i always obey the ladies colonel you obey the ladies always and youll have a confoundedly pleasant time now miss elizabeth quick march is it a sleepless day following on a dancing night had produced in mrs fanshawe that uncertainty of temper which when it exhibits itself in children is called fractiousness the commanderinchief who dined with them en famille had been obliged to leave in order to catch his train before dinner was over and in consequence the very expensive strawberries which she had designed to form an exceptional dessert were eaten by herself and elizabeth while the colonel went to the station to speed his parting chief the chief also during dinner had paid according to her estimate of what was proper insufficient attention to his hostess and more than sufficient to elizabeth on whom he rained showers of robust gallantries in addition some vague story of a dead man found in the garden had agitated her while not a single soul from the rest of the station had called to tell her how complete was the eclipse that all other women suffered at the ball last night in consequence of her effulgence this was enough to start a promising crop of grievances and gloomy forebodings in mrs fanshawes mind which she served up so to speak young succulent and tender like mustard and cress the crop was of extremely varied growtha perfect macedoine of mixed and bitter vegetables among which her habitual helplessness and childlike manner had been completely volatilized i think it is no wonder she said that the military future of india gives politicians grave anxiety at home when there is such a doddering old goose at the head of affairs oh mamma its rather a telling sort of doddering said elizabeth they gave him a tremendous reception at jamrud and laughed at him behind his back i know said mrs fanshawe with decision and his conduct at dinner too with his absurd jokes i had hoped elizabeth that your good sense would have enabled you to see through them and for my part the most charitable explanation i can think of is that he had had too much wine which i am sure i hope he will sleep off before he makes another laughingstock of himself at lahore stuffing himself with soup and pomegranates too like a schoolboy at a confectioners elizabeth forebore to suggest that a school confectioner who sold soup and pomegranates would be a unique species of tradesman and proceeded to eat strawberries one by one from the dish her stepmother did not often spout with vinegar when she did the wisest thing was not to attempt to staunch the flow but merely wait till it ran dry but it appeared that her silence acted as spur sufficient and as you have nothing to tell me about the pleasures of your expedition observed mrs fanshawe i must be content with picturing it to myself as indeed i have been doing all day thinking that now you had got to landi kotal and now to the other place the name of which i forget we started at eight began elizabeth i am quite aware of that dear said mrs fanshawe i had lain awake till then after the ball and was just beginning to think i should get to sleep when i heard you laughing and calling so merrily i only thought now my dear ones are starting on their expedition nothing more at all except to look out of my window though the light hurt my eyes to see if you were likely to have a fine day but since you have nothing to tell me indeed mamma we all talked about our day at dinner said elizabeth i should have thought you had heard enough of it mrs fanshawe closed her eyes until elizabeth ceased speaking and then went on exactly where she had left off what you have been doing she said i must try to entertain you with what happened last night the room was very hot and full and indeed with sir henry bouncing about there was little space for anybody else to dance at all such an elephant i have never yet seen outside a menagerie or at the durbar and i should not wonder if when he retired next year as i am told he does barnum offered something handsome for him but it would be a risky purchase he might burst any day and cover the place with pomegranate seeds elizabeth gave a little inward gurgle of laughter at this picturesque phrasing a peculiarity of mrs fanshawe and one which she shared with many of the human race was that when vexed her sense of humour entirely deserted her though her humour itself indulged in admirable touches there was for instance humour in her swift thumbnail sketch of an exploding warrior in a menagerie but her perception of her own felicity failed to recognize it under these circumstances it was not diplomatic for others to greet it their amusement was not wanted mrs fanshawe proceeded in her inimitable way in a rather faint voice tuesday wednesday thursday she said i hope elizabeth you will be able to let me see a little of you before you bury yourself in your trunks i hope too you will keep a hand on your natural exuberance during your voyage you must not be carried away by such foolish sallies and witticisms as seemed to amuse you during dinner and make undesirable acquaintances there is sure to be a number of skylarking young men on board going home who will want to romp with any girl handy and be careful to dress very plainly and quietly you will earn in respect what you will lose in being stared at of course you will chiefly sit in the ladies saloon especially after dark and not play any of those foolish games with buckets and bits of rope which occasion so much silly shouting and giggling unless there are one or two elderly women playing she observed with a shaded glance that elizabeth had finished the strawberries perhaps you would pass me the strawberries dear she said they are quite excellent oh im so sorry began elizabeth ah you have eaten them all have you it is not of the slightest consequence i only wanted one or two and no doubt i am quite as well without them indeed i am only glad that you have enjoyed them so much and wish for your sake there were more ah here is your father back from seeing poor sir henry off take the dish off the table darling so that he shall not see we have had strawberries for they are his favourite fruit the goaded elizabeth turned daddy she said i have eaten all the strawberries so that there are none for you and mamma mrs fanshawe gave her a reproachful glance really elizabeth she said so you are back bob did you see the poor old man into his train i was saying to elizabeth that i hoped it was only wine but i am afraid his brain must be going i should not wonder if he became quite childish colonel fanshawe lifted his eyebrows in mild surprise sir henry he said i hope neither conjecture is true my dear by the way he sent his warmest thanks to you and hoped so much that when you went up to simla you would stay with him a week or two he will be there all next month but of course if you are afraid of his being sent for to go to the asylum mrs fanshawe did not waste time over her transitions she did not modulate from key to key but without sequence of transitional chords put her finger firmly down on the notes she intended to play my darling how literally you take my little joke she said dear sir henry he is like a great boy is he not with his jokes and high spirits i declare he made me feel a hundred years old i must say that it is very civil of him and of course i shall go i regard the invitations of the commanderinchief as a royal command when one is in india an unusual impulse of candour took possession of her besides she said it will be much more amusing and comfortable than at the hotel elizabeth as had now been settled was to start for england the next week and since after the visit of the commanderinchief a quiet reaction settled down on peshawar mrs fanshawe was at liberty to work herself to the bone as she herself phrased it to make preparations for her departure as a matter of strict fact her labours in this regard were to order her ayah to wash out a thermos flask of hers the possession of which she declared would make all the difference to elizabeths comfort on her journey down to bombay and to determine to finish a woollen crochet scarf for her which would make all the difference when she was on the boat the necessity of finishing thisfor her determination was invincible on the pointcaused her to insist on a good deal of reading aloud in the evening which she always enjoyed while the breaking of the thermos flaskquite irreplaceable in peshawarby her ayah gave her an excuse which she had long been wanting for dismissing her since it was quite impossible to trust a woman who could be careless over such a treasure and to keep a servant whom she could not trust was to violate one of her most sound household laws under the stress of these duties it was only prudent to rest for rather longer hours than usual after lunch with the crochet scarf put on a table by her sofa in case her afternoon insomnia was persistent and except for lunch she was practically invisible until evening under these circumstances though she continued to plan long quiet days for herself and elizabeth before the wrench of parting came the girl saw more than usual of her father for to speak frankly it was impossible to have the sense of seeing anybody else when mrs fanshawe was present she was obtrusive in the faint but shrill trumpeting manner of a mosquito to elizabeth therefore and though loyalty prevented his ever forming such a thought to himself perhaps to her father too these days had a recaptured charm it was now a couple of years since her stepmother had made the thirdnot shadowyin her home before that for her mother had died in her infancy she and her father had been inseparable companions and in these two years elizabeth had grown up from the high romantic mists of childhood she had stepped down into the level plains and saw womanhood stretching out in front of her as was natural that expanse had come slowly and gradually into sight and it was not till these few days of companionship with her father brought back the habit of earlier years that she began to realize how far she had travelled she found too that the adequacy of the prattling companionship of childhood no longer satisfied her her heart needed a more mature diet her brain was awake and tingling with a hundred questions and surmises such as a few days before had inspired her wondering conjectures when she found him at work in his garden then for the first time quite consciously she had asked herself that momentous question as to the meaning the principle that lay behind all the phenomena which she had taken for granted then too she had realized that to her father the explanation lay in or at any rate was bound up with something inherent in the prayers and hymns at church there to him was the finality which she had been consciously seeking about which for the first time she felt any real curiosity but she was as diffident about putting any question to him about it as he all these years had been of initiating any speech on the subject a mans religious convictions necessarily take the colour and texture so to speak of his mind and this quiet unassertive man was no more in the habit of speaking about them than about his loyalty to the king or his habits of personal cleanliness such subjects as these rightly or wrongly are the last to find vocal expression he would have found it as difficult and as unnatural to speak to elizabeth on religious topics as to discourse on the meaning of the national anthem or ask her at breakfast if she had performed her ablutions with thoroughness in his own case his conduct his work and his immaculate appearance bore witness to the reality of his convictions on these three respects and though he shared with no mother the responsibility of parentage he assumed her welfare in these regards it was not because the reality of them was faint to him that he was reticent it was because the reality was a matter of instinct deeply felt and inwardly imperative throughout the reigns of various governesses he had from time to time reminded those ladies of his wish that a bible lesson should inaugurate the labours of the day and having thus provided for the material of religious instruction he believed that the childs nature would out of that pabulum secrete in the manner of wellnourished bodily glands the secret essences that sustained and built but there had resulted from this method of reticence a symptom which should have troubled him if he wanted confirmation of its success for elizabeth so open so garrulous with him on all other subjects had never spoken to him on this one this he set down to the same instinct that made himself shy of speech on such subjects namely the inherent conviction that does not care to discuss matters like loyalty and cleanliness it had never occurred to him that her silence was due to indifference to incuriousness and that religious instruction was to her no more than a part of the curriculum of the weekday church an hours slightly distasteful feature of sunday morning but now elizabeths curiosity was aroused the scheme of things entire had begun to make audible to her its first faint flutelike call a call that before there has fallen on the spirit any experience of agony of darkness of loneliness is as fascinating as the music of pan or the voice of sirens and she longed to know how it sounded in the ears of others for herself she was confused bewildered by the remote uncapturable melody that at present only gave hints in broken phrases to her untrained ear the two were riding back one day from a horseback saunter along the lanes among the fruit orchards the blossom was beginning to fall and when a puff of wind disturbed its uncertain clinging the ground below would be showered with snowy pearblossom or pink with the flower of the peach elizabeth in tune with the spring was inclined to lament this i would almost go without peaches she said if that would save the blossom from falling he laughed yet it would be a hard choice he said to determine whether one would look at a tree covered with blossom instead of having dessert i think i should let nature take its course lizzie after all is it meant that the blossom has to fall before the fruit comes she asked well yes to want it otherwise would be parallel to wanting girls and boys not to grow up and you do naturally though it is at the expense of their rosy petals this seemed to give elizabeth sufficient material for a pondering silence which lasted a couple of minutes i want to grow up she observed and keep all my youth as well he smiled at her hard but worth attempting he said oh do you mean it is possible daddy certainly you can keep all of youth that is really worth having but as i said hard for instance you can continue to have all the glow of enthusiasm of youth till it is time to think aboutabout turning in dying i dont want ever to think about it i think it is a perfectly disgusting prospect dont you hate the idea of it daddy he let his eyes dwell on her a moment i cant say that i do lizzie he said dont misunderstand me i enjoy life tremendously im not in the least tired of it but as for hating the idea of death why no you see you see its only another stage in growing up which is a process with which as i said i am in sympathy they were passing through a lane deeply sunk between its adjacent fields a cool draught flowed down it and elizabeth shivered oh daddy to be put in the cold earth she said that anyhow is a quite certain accompaniment of death there is no doubt about that and about the rest who knows my dear you dont doubt do you he asked i dont know that i do one is taught i was taught i suppose i believe in the arithmetic i learned and in the geography i learned she broke off suddenly as a little wind as it were blew across the placid sunlit sea of her consciousness shattering the brightnesses but because i have learned a thing it does not become part of me as people tell me she said you have to leaven a thing with love in order to assimilate it ive always known that those things are bone of your bone to you part of you vital part of you part that could not be amputated even the fact that you have never talked to me about them has shown that you dont tell me that you love me simply because it is part of you to do so nor do i remind you that i have ten fingers and ten toes she checked her horse as they emerged from the lane into the stream of the traffic that was passing into the native city thats why we have never talked about it daddy she said in sudden enlightenment it was too real to you and it didnt touch me she had never seen him so troubled didnt touch you he asked you dont believe elizabeth laid her hand on his knee daddy dear i believe in all things living and beautiful and true dont take it to heartpray dont doesdoes the blossom know what fruit is coming but surely the fruit comes swiftly suddenly at this supreme instant of sunset all the world was changed it was as if it passed into the heart of an opal the dust of the main road into which the two had just turned was transfigured into mist of gold and rose the wayfarers who passed along plodding home with camels and mildeyed buffaloes were changed into citizens of some rainbowkingdom more brilliant grew the excellent opalescence and then all the tints of it were sucked up into one soft crimson that flooded earth and sky then as the darkness began to overlay it it grew dusky and yet duskier till the incarnadined air was robbed of its glories but high above them northwards and eastwards flamed the rosecoloured snows book one chapter iii comfortable mrs hancock it is almost doubtful whether it is right to call heathmoor a village since there is something plebeian about the word implying labourers cottages and publichouses and an admixture of corduroy in the trousers of the male inhabitants with strings tied for reasons eternally inexplicable below their knees even less is heathmoor a town if by a town we denote an assemblage of houses cheek to jowl streets with tramways or omnibuses and a scarcity of trees and gardens indeed no known word implying the collected domicile of human beingswhich heathmoor certainly iswill describe it and the indication of it necessitates a more verbose method it lies at so convenient a distance from the metropolis and is served by so swift and proper a succession of trains at those hours when heathmoor travels that it combines as its inhabitants unanimously declare all the advantages of town with the pleasures and fine air of the country twenty minutes in a wellpadded railwaycarriage with bevelled mirrors and attractive photographs of beaches and abbeys and nice clear rivers lands the business men to whom heathmoor almost entirely belongs in one of the main and central arteries of the london streets and twentythree minutes suffices to take them and their wives and daughters home again after they have dined in town and been to the play the question of those extra minutes is a staple of conversation in heathmoor and there is a great deal of high feeling about it for nobody can see especially after hours of conversation on the subject why the railway company should not quicken up the return trains in the evening another peculiarity of those otherwise admirable trains is that the firstclass carriages are invariably full and the rest of the vehicles comparatively empty tickets moreoverthose mean little oblongs of cardboardare seldom seen and ticket collectors never make their demands if some energetic young man newly promoted ventures to open a firstclass carriagedoor between heathmoor and london by the train that leaves heathmoor at am for instance or the later one at am its occupants look at him in disgusted astonishment one perhaps sufficiently unbends to murmur season but probably no notice is taken of him till the guard hurrying up gives him a couple of hot words and apologizes to the gentlemen on the whole they are not made uncomfortable by such intrusions interruption in fact rarely occurring somewhat emphasizes the privileged aloofness of these heathmoor magnates just as an occasional trespasser in wellordered domains makes to glow the more brightly the sense of proprietorship the impertinence receives but a shrug and a settlement behind the page of the financial times follows the second of these trains namely the am from heathmoor performs a more sociable journey for there is less of the financial times in it and more of the ladies of heathmoor who with business to transact in the shops go up to town in the morning with amazing frequency returning for the most part by an equally swift transit which lands them back at home again at twenty minutes past one all the morning in consequence between those hours the roads at heathmoor which are level and well drained owing to its famous gravelly soil which renders it so salubrious a settlement are comparatively empty for those who do not go to london find in their houses and gardens sufficient occupation to detain them there till lunchtime once again between five and six the male population swarms homewards and a row of cabs uniformly patronized awaits the arrival of the midnight train from town which enables its travellers to have stayed to the very end of most theatrical performances a small mercantile quarter clusters round the station but the local shops are neither numerous nor as mrs hancock colonel fanshawes widowed sister sometimes laments choice butcher baker and greengrocer supply the less choice comforts of life but if you want a sweetbread in a hurry or a bundle of early asparagus it is idle to expect anything of the sort a court milliner who lately set up there behind a plateglass window and some elegant forms has a great deal of time on her hands and a tailor who professes to have the newest suitings and to be unrivalled in the matter of liveries does little more than put an occasional patch in the garments of the male inhabitants for heathmoor in general gets its apparel from metropolitan markets and prefers to be waited on by large and noiseless parlourmaids in fact the mercantile quarter forms but an insignificant fraction of heathmoor residences the bulk of which consists of admirably comfortable and commodious villas each standing segregate in its acre or halfacre of garden all along the wellkept roadsthe roads at heathmoor seem to be washed and dusted like china every morningare situated these residences so aptly described as desirable each with its gate its laurel hedge and small plot of grass in front each with its tenniscourt or croquetlawn at back its tiled roofs its tradesmens entrance and its crimson rambler aspiring above the diningroom bowwindow the larger housesthose in fact which stand on acre plotshave a stable or garage attached to them though all are in telephonic communication with the livery stables that are situated on the far side of the railwaybridge and all are built in accordance with a certain english norm or rule designed to ensure solid comfort and an absence of draughts there is none that lacks the electric light none in which rivers of hot and cold water are not laid on upstairs and downstairs none that lacks a lavatory situated close to the front door in which is hung up a convincing and lucid diagram of the system of drainage but there is no monotony or uniformity in the appearance of these houses some are of brick some of roughcast and all have a certain mediocre individuality of their ownlike the faces of a flock of sheepwhich renders them to the observer as various as the highsounding names that are so clearly printed on their front gates most of these exceedingly comfortable houses designed for the complete convenience of couples with or without small families are as has been said built on halfacre or acre plots they are all of modern construction with a view to the saving of domestic labour for heathmoor as a place of residence for welltodo city men is but of late discovery but here and there a more spacious specimen can be encountered and mrs hancock who found nothing choice in the heathmoor shops had some ten years ago on the death of her husband bought two of these acre plots and had built thereon a house of larger rooms a boudoir and a stable with coachmans quarters since then she had devoted nearly all her income to rendering herself completely and absolutely comfortable an excellent cook salaried at sixty pounds a year a sum which according to the regular heathmoor standard would be considered to be sufficient to pay the wages of a parlourmaid also largely contributed to her wellbeing and a maid a serious butler with the deportment of a dean a chauffeur two housemaids a kitchenmaid a gardener and a daughter were all devoted to the same mission the daughter occupies the ultimate place in this list not because edith was not loving and loved but because on the whole her contribution to her mothers comfort was materially less than that of any of the others though perhaps physically more indeed she shared in rather than subscribed to it drove with her in her motor ate of the delicious food while in the evenings she laid out her own game of patience without being called upon to advise or condole or congratulate in respect of mrs hancocks it is true that the window on ediths side of the car was put down if her mother required a little more air without being too close to its ingress and put up if mrs hancock in her seat wished to avoid a draught but she was by no means enserfed to the ruling spirit that directed and controlled the movements of the other dependents naturally she drove and dined with her mother read her into a comfortable doze after tea and did all the duties of a daughter but she had even when with mrs hancock an existence and a volition of her own which the others had not indeed there was at this present time an event maturing that promised to provide edith with a completer independence yet for mrs hancock had for months been encouraging an attachment that was wholly sensible and like most sensible things could not possibly be called romantic edward holroyd the young man in question was very well off being partner in a firm of sound steadygoing brokers in the city was regularity itself in the persistence with which he caught the am train to town every morning and as far as could be ascertained had never in spite of his twentyseven years given any serious attention to a girl until mrs hancock firmly turned his wellfeatured head in ediths direction he lived furthermore in a halfacre residence of his own next door to mrs hancock and this she reckoned as a solid item among his eligibilities for edith would be able to give a great deal of companionship to her mother during the hours when her husband was in the city mrs hancock did not forget to addto her own credit side so to speakthat since edith would thus generally lunch with her and drive with her afterwards this would save her daughter something substantial in housebooks and give her the motordrive she was accustomed to it is true that her prospective husband had a motor of his own in which it might be supposed that edith could take the air if so inclined consequently mrs hancock added another item to her own credit when she reflected that if edith drove with her there would be effected a saving in edwards tyre and petrol bills this was entirely congenial to her mind for she delighted to make economies for other people as well as herself if the perfection of her own comfort was not affected thereby on this genial morning of early may ventilated by a breath of southwest wind and warmed by a summer sun the diningroom windows of arundelthe agreeable name of mrs hancocks housewere both open and she was sitting at a writingtable just within fixing her plans for the day she always sat here after breakfast until she had seen her cook sent orders to her chauffeur and read the smaller paragraphs in the morning post usually the plans for the day the marching orders as she habitually called them depended completely on the weather if it was fine she drove in her car from twelve to a quarterpast one and again after a salutary digestive pause after lunch when she engaged with the more solid paragraphs in the morning post from three till a quarter to five this it must be understood was the curriculum for the summer in the winter radical changes might occur and sometimes if the morning was fine but promised rain later she would start as early as eleven and went outif the weather still held upfor quite a short time in the afternoon but she always went out twice even if occasionally her inclination would have been to stop at home for denton the steady chauffeur and lind the serious butler would have thought it odd if she did not take two airings did she then go out when she had a bad cold no but then she never had a bad cold today however being ascension day the marching orders became exceedingly complicated and when lind came in to say that denton was waiting for her commands he received the same instructions that had been given him last ascension day but never since these were not the same as on sundays and christmas days because on ascension day mrs hancock drove in the afternoon tell denton i shall want the car at ten minutes to eleven she said no you had better say a quarter toto take me to church he must be back there at a quarterpast twelve or say ten minutes past i shall drive this afternoon at three or mrs hancock pondered a moment exactly as she had done on last ascension day edith dear she said to her daughter who was winding the clock i think we had better lunch today at one instead of at halfpast there will not be time to settle down to anything after church and in that case we had better go out this afternoon at halfpast two and lunch will be at one lind i will see mrs williams now she paused again this was not a usual ascension day pause though connected with it i see there is a holiday on the stock exchange edith she said so perhaps mr holroyd will lunch with us wait a moment lind she did not scribble a note and never had done so but wrote it very neatly begging pardon for so short a notice and hoping that ifa verbal answer was all that was required i will see mrs williams as soon as i get the answer lind she said and i will tell you then whether we shall be two at lunch or three it was not worth while to settle to anything when an interruption would come so soon and mrs hancock looked quietly and contentedly out over the garden where ellis was mowing the tenniscourt the flowerbeds below the window dazzled with the excellence of their crimson tulips and swooned with the sunny fragrance of their wallflowers and the hedge of espaliered apples that separated the lawn from the kitchengarden was pink with blooms of promise the rosetrees were all cut back in storage for their summer flowering no spike of weed was insolent on the wellkept paths or gardenbeds and no tending that the most exacting gardeners companion could suggest as suitable to the season had been left undone the same flawless neatness distinguished the diningroom from which mrs hancock looked out landseer prints hung quite straight on the paper of damask red such chairs as were not in use stood squareshouldered to the walls the writingtable where she sat was dustlessly furnished with pens penwipers pencils sealingwax and all stationery appertaining the maroon curtains were looped back at exactly the same angle and six inches of green blind showed at the top of each window room and garden were as soignes as mrs hancocks own abundant hair mrs hancocks passbook had been returned to her from her bankers that morning and she found it quite pleasant reading pleasant enough indeed to open and read again as she waited for the arrival of the verbal message from next door next to devising and procuring all that could be secured of material comforts the occupation that perhaps chiefly administered to her content was that of saving money this seemed to her an extremely altruistic pleasure since if you took a large enough view of it she was saving for edith thus she would always purchase anything she wanted at the place where it could most cheaply be obtained provided its quality was in no way inferior and she never omitted to lay in a replete cellar of coal during the summer months anything like waste was abhorrent to her and though her ordinary living expenses were excessively high she could not secure absolute comfort and the flawless appointment of her house at a smaller outlay she paid high wages to her servants and gladly defrayed their doctors and dentists bills since she wished to make it impossible for them to think of leaving her when once she was satisfied with them for a change of servants was uncomfortable and produced days of uneasy suspense before it became certain that the new one would suit her all such expenses were incurred to procure comfort and so were necessary but beyond them she was extremely economical and dearly liked the secure and continued feeling of a big balance at the bank when that balance grew very large she made a prudent investment often through edward holroyd and told herself that she was doing it for the sake of edith before long came a warm acceptance of her hospitality from next door and having sent for mrs williams she added mutton cutlets to the menu and withdrew the asparagus as her cook was certain there was not enough for three then she got up from her writingtable since the marching orders were now completed her plump and pleasant face was singularly unwrinkled considering the fifty years that had passed over it yet it would perhaps have been even more singular if the years had written on it any record of their passage it is true that she had married had borne a child and had lost a husband but none of these events had marred the placidity of her nature at the most they had been but pebbles tossed into and swallowed up below that unruffled surface breaking it but for a moment with inconsiderable ripples she had married because she had easily seen the wisdom of becoming the wife of a welltodo and wholly amiable man instead of continuing to remain the once handsome miss julia fanshawe wisdom still continued to be justified of her child for she enjoyed the whole of her late husbands income and since her clear four thousand pounds a year was derived from debenture stock and first mortgage bonds it was not likely that these fruits of prudence would wither or decay on this side of the grave but she did not ever distress or harass herself with the thought of anything so comfortless as sepulchres but devoted her time and money to the preservation of her health and the avoidance of all such worries and anxieties as could possibly disturb the poise and equilibrium of her nervous system she was slightly inclined to stoutness and occasionally had rheumatic twinges in the less important joints but a month spent annually at bath sufficed to keep these little ailments in check while the complete immunity she enjoyed there from all household anxieties since she lived in a very comfortable hotel was restorative to a nervous system that already hovered on perfection and enabled her to take up her home duties againwhich as has been said consisted in providing comfort for herselfwith renewed vigour this visit to bath was to take place next week and for the last ten days she had thought of little else than the question as to whether she would take denton and her motorcar with her last night only she had come to the determination to do so and consequently there was a great deal to be thought about today as to cushions luggage and where to lunch for she was herself going to travel in it edith had finished winding the clock when her mother got up there is still half an hour before we need think of getting ready for church dear she said and we might go on planning our arrangements for next week the maps are in the drawingroom for denton brought them in last night but the print is so small that i should be glad if you would get my number two spectacles which i left in my bedroom they are either on my dressingtable or on the small table by my bed filson will find them if you cannot put your hand on them oh look there are two starlings pecking at the gardenbeds how bold they are with the mowingmachine so close i hope ellis will scare them away from the asparagus edith managed to find the number two spectacles without troubling filson and devoted her whole mind which was as tranquil and lucid as her mothers to the great question of the journey to bath though the distance was something over a hundred miles it was clearly better to risk being a little overtired and compass the whole in one day rather than spend the nightperhaps not very comfortablyat some halfway country inn where it was impossible to be certain about the sheets after all if the fatigue was severe a days rest on arrival at bath postponing the treatment till the day after would set things right but in that case lunch must either be obtained at reading or better still they could take it with them in a luncheonbasket and eat it en route denton could take his too and they would stop for half an hour to eat after reading thus dividing the journey into two halves so far so good the question of filsons journey was more difficult if the day was fine she could of course travel outside with denton but if it was wet she would have to come insidea less ideal arrangement with regard to knees in that case also lind would have to go up to town with the heavy luggage and see it firmly bestowed in the bath express at paddington at this point edith triumphantly vindicated the superiority of two heads over one and suggested that filson should go up to town with the heavy luggage and catch the express was it not at paddington thus arriving at bath before them indeed she would have time almost to unpack before they came the train was verified and thereafter all was clear lind would escort filson and the heavy luggage to the station and since mrs williams would be putting up lunches anyhow filson could take hers as well but it was time to get ready for church and the question of cushions and cloaks for so long a drive which might be partly cold and partly warm must wait but certainly denton would have to come in either after church or in the evening for the route which appeared to lie straight down the bath road had not been tackled at all yet mrs hancocks religious convictions and practices which edith entirely shared with her were as comfortable as her domestic arrangements but simpler and they did not occupy her mind for so many hours daily it must be supposed that she recognized the christian virtue of charity for otherwise she would not in the course of the year have knitted so large a quantity of thick scarves made from a cheap but reliable wool or have sent them to the wife of her parish clergyman for distribution among the needy she worked steadily at them after the short doze which followed tea while edith read aloud to her but apart from this and the halfcrowns which she so regularly put into the offertoryplate the consideration of the poor and needy did not practically concern her though she much disliked seeing tramps and beggars on the road for the rest a quiet thankfulness except when she had rheumatism glowed mildly in her soul for all the blessings of this life which she so abundantly enjoyed and even when she had rheumatism she was never vehement against providence she was quite certain indeed that providence took the greatest care of her and she followed that example by taking the greatest care of herself feeling it a duty to do so for these attentions she returned thanks every morning and evening in her bedroom and in church on sunday morning and also frequently in the evening if fine when rheumatism troubled her she added a petition on the subject and went to bath never since her earliest days had she felt the slightest doubts with regard to the religion that was hers and dogma she swallowed whole like a pill her father had been a canon of salisbury and in the fourth and leastused sittingroom in the house where smoking was permitted if gentlemen were staying with her was a glassfronted bookcase in which were four volumes of his somewhat controversial sermons these she sometimes read to herself on wet sunday evenings if edith chanced to have a sore throat her evening doze usually succeeded this study but to say that the principles of a christian life were alien to her would be libellous since though neither devout nor ascetic she was kind especially when it involved no selfsacrifice she was truthful she was a complete stranger to envy slander or malice and was quite unvexed by any doubts concerning the wisdom and benevolence of the providence in which she trusted as firmly as she trusted in aspirin and bath for her rheumatism at the church in which she was so regular an attendant she found both doctrine and ritual completely to her mind even as it was to the mind of the comfortable and prosperous inhabitants of heathmoor generally no litany ever lifted up its lamentable petitions there the hymns were always of a bright and jovial order unless as in lent brightness was liturgically impossible and the vicar even then made a habit of preaching delightfully short and encouraging sermons about the christian duty of appreciating all that was agreeable in life and told his congregation that it was far more important to face the future with a cheerful heart than to turn a regretful eye towards the sins and omissions of the past to this advice mrs hancock found it both her pleasure and her duty to conform and indeed with her excellent health her four thousand pounds a year and her household of admirable servants it was not difficult to face the future with smiling equanimity and though again it would have been libellous to call her pharisaical for she was not the least complacent in her estimate of herself she would have experienced considerable difficulty in making any sort of catalogue of her misdoings besides as mr martin distinctly told them it was mere morbidity to dwell among the broken promises of the past far better dear friends to be up and doing in the glorious sunlight of a new day sufficient may we not truly say to the day is the good thereof let that be our motto for the week and now and the refreshed and convinced congregation poured thankful halfcrowns into the velvet collecting pouches and themselves into the glorious sunlight edward holroyd from the bowwindow of his diningroom next doorlike most of the inhabitants of heathmoor he habitually sat in his diningroom after breakfast when not leaving for the city by the am trainsaw the hancocks car glide churchwards at ten minutes to eleven and then proceeded to his drawingroom to practise on his piano with slightly agitated hands the agitation was partly due to the extraordinary number of accidentals which chopin chose to put into the eleventh etude partly to a more intimate cause connected with the invitation he had just accepted for some months nowin fact ever since his twentyseventh birthdayhe had made up his mind that it was time to get married and had held himself in a position of almost pathetic eagernesslike a man crouching for the sprint waiting the signal of the pistolto fall in love but either the preordained maiden or some psychical defect in himself had been lacking and he had long been wondering if there was to be any pistol at all if not it was idle to maintain himself in the tense crouching strain but he had no doubts whatever that he wished to be married and that mrs hancockwhen he allowed himself for a moment to face a slightly embarrassing questionwished him to be married too she constantly turned his head in one particular direction and that direction showed him in houseagents phrase a very pleasing prospect which without complacency he believed smiled on him with an open and even affectionate regard but he wondered at himself for not being of a livelier eagerness in emotional matters for he brought to the vocations and avocations of his busy and cheerful life a fund of enthusiasm which was of more than normal intensity like the majority of the males of heathmoor he rounded off days of strenuous work in the city with strenuous amusements and with croquet in summer and bridge and pianoplaying in the winter filled up to the brim the hours between the arrival of the evening train and bedtime but the failure of the inevitable and unique she to put in an appearance and bewitch the eyes and the heart which were so eager to be spellbound was disconcerting for years he had looked for her for years he had missed her and since his twentyseventh birthday he had begun to determine to do without her he accepted the limitations namely his own inability to fall in love for which he could not devise a cure and was prepared to close gratefully with so pleasant and attractive an arrangement as he believed to be open to him he liked and admired edith her firm and comely face her serene content her quiet capable ways she was as fond of croquet and bridge as himself andthis was a larger testimonial than he knewreally enjoyed his pianoplaying and if the lightnings and thunders of romance roused no reverberating glories in his heart it must be remembered that romance is a shy rare bird coming not to nest under every eave and that there would be a very sensible diminution in marriage fees if every man delayed matrimony until the blinding ecstatic light fell upon his enraptured eyes it is clear what was the matter in medical phrase with this handsome and lively young man at heart he was an idealist but one ready to capitulate to surrender to beleaguering common sense he was ready to sacrifice his dreams a somewhat serious offence in a world where true dreamers are so rare by nature he was a true dreamer but accumulating wealth and the dense comfort of life at heathmoor had done much to rouse him though in music he still saw the fiery fabric unsubstantial and receding in performance he was quite execrable in imagination of the highest calibre through all his patient and heavy strumming he heard the singing of the immortal bird and even his reputation as a pianoplayer in the drawingrooms of heathmoor had not made him lose his profound appreciation of his own incompetence but in music alone was he worthy any more of the title of a dreamer today he stood pen in hand ready to sign the greatest capitulation to common sense that a man is ever called upon to make for he was ready to give up the image of the invisible conjectured she that stood faintly glimmering in the inmost chamber of his heart and throw it open for a charming enemy to enter it was not long before he gave up his attempts on the piano for this invitation to lunch next door had caused him to take a definite resolution which upset all steadiness and concentration and lighting a pipe he strolled out into his garden he had not room there for a fullsized croquet lawn and had contented himself with three or four hoops of ultrachampionship narrowness through which with the fervour of the true artist he was accustomed to practise various awkward hazards but here again as by the piano desire failed and with an extinguished pipe he sat down on a gardenseat and experienced a sharp attack of spurious middleage such as is incidental to youth regretting as youth does the advent of the middleage which in reality is yet far distant he had completely made up his mind to propose to edith that day believing without coxcombry that he would be accepted believing also that the future thus held for him many years of health and happiness with the addition no slight one of a charming and inalienable companion whom he liked and admired yet something the potentiality of the fire which had never yet been lit in him caused him an infinite and secret regret for the step which was now as good as taken he longed for something he had never experienced for something of which he had no real conception but of which he felt himself capable for as the flint owns fire in its heart but must wait to be struck he felt that his true destiny was not to be but a stone to mend a road or at the best to be mortared into a housewall with all his fiery seed slumbering within him yet what if there was no fire there at all he had long held himself ready aching you might say for the blow that should evoke it and none had struck him into blaze it was not surprising that the approaching motordrive to bath loomed conversationally large at lunch and edward proved weighty in debate he had a sharp decisive habit in social affairs his small change of talk was bright and fresh from the mint and seemed a faithful index to his keen face and wiry assertive hair quite right not to break the journey mrs hancock he said most country hotels consist of featherbeds fish with brown sauce and windows over a stableyard but if you do it in one journey get most of it over before lunch i should start by ten at the latest mrs hancock consulted a railway timetable then filson will have to be finished with her packing at halfpast nine she said the heavy luggage must go to the station in the car before we start have it sent in a cab afterwards suggested holroyd mrs hancock pondered over this i dont think i should like that should i edith she said i should prefer to see it actually leave the house or can i trust lind and filson edith dear remember to remind me to take the patience cards in my small bag there is room to lay out a patience on the foldingtable in the car and it will help to pass the time and have you got footstools asked edward over mrs hancocks face there spread a smile like the coming of dawn here was a comfort that had never occurred to her what a good idea she said i have often felt a little strained and uncomfortable in the knees when motoring for more than an hour or two very likely it was just the want of a footstool remind me to take out my bedroom footstool in the car this afternoon edith to see if it is the right height you are helpful mr holroyd i never thought of a footstool his next halfdozen suggestions however showed that mrs hancock had thought of a good deal already including a thermos flask of coffee a contour map of the country and a stylograph pen in case she found that she had left anything behind and wanted to write a postcard en route postcards she always carried in a green morocco writingcase filson must take a postcard too she said ready directed to lind in case anything goes wrong with the luggage that is a good idea she will be very comfortable do you not think mr holroyd in a nice thirdclass compartment for ladies only i am often tempted to go thirdclass myself when i see how cheap and comfortable it is edward felt quite certain that this was a temptation to which mrs hancock had never yielded and lunch proceeded in silence for a few moments then since nobody was able to make any further suggestion whatever which could lead to additional comfort or security on this momentous journey mrs hancock allowed herself to be drawn into other topics still not unconnected with bath such as the efficacy of the waters and the steepness of the hills which surrounded it which however with dentons careful driving and the new brakes she had had fitted to her car presented no unmanning terrors i shall be there she said exactly four weeks so as to get back early in june bath is very hot in the summer but i do not mind that and the hotel rates are more reasonable then after that we shall be occupied for my niece elizabeth fanshawe will arrive almost as soon as i return she will be with me till she goes back to india to her father in october out of the depths of halfforgotten memories an image quite vague and insignificant broke the surface of holroyds mind was she not with you two years ago he asked a tall dark girl with black hair fancy your remembering her i so envy a good memory edith dear remind me to get the piano tuned i will write from bath elizabeth is for ever at the piano now so my brother tells me she will enjoy hearing you play mr holroyd well if everybody has finished i am sure you will like to have a cigarette in the garden edith will take you out and show you the tulips it must not be supposed that this arrangement was to be dignified into the name of manoeuvre on mrs hancocks part except in so far that after lunch she liked to skim the larger paragraphs of the morning post comfortably reclining on the sofa in her private sittingroom she was not a person of subtle perceptions and it had certainly never occurred to her that holroyd had come to lunch that day with his purpose formed she only wanted to read the morning post and as usual to throw him and edith together as for edith she had been quite prepared a dozen times during this last month to listen with satisfaction to his declaration and to give him an amiable affirmative on the earliest possible occasion each time that her mother arranged some similar little teteatete for them she felt a slight but pleasurable tremor of excitement but was never in the least cast down when it proved that her anticipations were premature she was perfectly aware of her mothers approval and it only remained to give voice to her own she had long ago made up her mind that she would sooner marry than remain single and she had never dreamed or desired that it should be any other man than this who should conduct her to the goal of her wishes that she was in any degree in love with himif the phrase connotes anything luminous or tumultuousit would be idle to assert but equally idle would it be to deny that according to the manner of her aspirations he seemed to her an ideal husband for ten adolescent yearsfor she was now twentyfourshe had lived in the stifling and soulquelling comfort of her mothers house and it would have been strange if the dead calm and propriety of her surroundings had not bred in her a corresponding immobility of the emotions for there is something chameleonlike in the spirit of every girl not powerfully vitalized it assimilates itself to its surroundings and custom and usage limn the hues which at first are superficial and evanescent into stains of permanent colour passion and deep feeling so far from entering into edith herself had never even exhibited themselves in the confines of her horizons she had neither experienced them nor seen others in their grip but she thoughtindeed she was certainthat she would like to be mistress in the house where edward holroyd was master she felt sure she could make herself and him very comfortable she went out hatless like him into the warm bath of sun and southwest wind and they passed side by side up the weedless gardenpath all nature bees and brighteyed birds and budding flowers was busy with the great festival of spring and matingtime nothing was barren but the salted weedless path so carefully defertilized the tulips were a brave show and in their deep bed below the paling a border of wallflowers spun a web of warm ineffable fragrance ellis returned from his midday hour was still engaged with the clicking mowing machine on the velvetnapped lawn and they went on farther till the gravel of the paths of the flowergarden was exchanged for the cinders of the kitchen patch and the hedge of espaliers hid them from the house then he stopped and a moment afterwards she also smoothing into place a braid of her bright brown hair and without agitation came the question without agitation the reply indeed there was nothing for two sensible young people to be agitated about each was fond of the other neither had seen any one else more desirable and over the hearts of each lay thick the cobwebs of comfort and motorcars and prosperous affairs and unimpassioned content only as he spoke he felt some vague souleclipse some dispersal of a dream then he drew her towards him and kissed her and for one moment below the cobwebs in her heart something stirred ever so faintly ever so remotely connected with the slight roughness of his closeshaven face with the faint scent of soap of cigarette but it did not embarrass her they stood there for a moment looking into each others faces as if expecting something new something revealed shall we tell your mother now he asked still she looked at him he was not quite the same as he had been before oh in a minute or two she said suddenly he felt that he had to stir himself somehow into greater tenderness greaterbut he felt disappointed it had all been exactly as he had imagined i am very happy he said i have thought about this moment so much edith it was the first time he had used her name edward she said looking straight at him edward no i dont think i shall call you edward i must have a name of my own for you at the moment the sound of a gong from within the house droned along the garden the motor is round she said this time it was he who delayed though without passion your mother will not mind waiting a minute he said no what else have you to say to me everything nothing she laughed there is not time for the one she said and no time is required for the other besides all the time that there is is ours now in all her life she had never phrased a sentence so neat so nearly epigrammatic its briskness was the fruit of the stimulus that had come to her they delayed no further but went back to the house where mrs hancock was already waiting she did not attempt to appear surprised at their news but placidly delighted at it kissed them both and took it for granted that edward would come in to dine with them that evening then since there was no use in vain repetitions she reverted to the topic which had to be considered at once let me see she said i think the motor is round and filson has brought down the footstool from my bedroom to see if it is the right height a quarter to eight then dear edward tonight we shall be quite alone and if you will come in half an hour sooner i have no doubt that you will find my darling dressed and waiting to talk to you fancy what a lot you will have to say to each other now and then after dinner as you are drinking your glass of port i shall claim you for a little conversation while we send edith to wait in the drawingroom oh i see you have brought the footstool from the spare room as well filson that was well thought of as they are of different heights and one might suit if the other did not let me get in and see which suits me best now try them one on top of the other filson well really i think that is the most comfortable of all edith dear are you ready and i have brought down my patience cards and if i put them into the pocket under the window at once i can dismiss them from my mind there a quarterpast seven then dear edward for a chat before dinner yes leave the footstools in the car filson and we will measure the height when i come back denton was standing with the door knob in his hand waiting for orders you might take us first to slough denton she said so that we shall see what the road is like before we join the bath road next week and then we can go through the beeches we are ten minutes late in starting but if we are a little late for tea it wont matter for once in a way tell mrs williams lind that we may be ten minutes late for tea mrs hancock habitually wore a perfectly natural and amiable smile on her pleasant face except when her rheumatism gave her an exceptional twinge or more exceptionally yet mrs williams was not quite up to the mark today the discovery of the footstools and ediths engagement seemed to her to be touching examples of the care of providence and she was beamingly conscious of the variety of pleasant objects and topics in the world she laid her hand in ediths as the car started and now i want to hear allall about it darling she said oh look there are two magpies is not that lucky and will you let your window quite down dear it is so warm and pleasant this afternoon i will have mine just halfway up there that is nice and now i want to hear all about it edith returned the affectionate pressure of her mothers hand it was all so sudden mother she said and yet i was not at all startled heedward stopped when we reached the kitchengarden and so i stopped too and without any speeches he just asked me and i said yes at once as i had always meant to and then he said he was very happy and kissed me mrs hancock thought that denton was driving a little too fast as if he meant to make up the lost ten minutes but she checked herself from calling down the tube to him my dearest she said you will never forget the first kiss given you by the man who loves you oh what a jolt the jolt decided her and she called to denton not to go quite so fast then she pressed ediths hand again tell me more dear she said had you expected it at all edith looked at her with complete candour oh yes she said and that is why it seemed so natural when it came the faintest flush glowed on her face but i never liked him so much before as when he kissed me she said it did not make me feel at all awkward i used to think that if such a thing ever happened to me i should not know which way to look but it all seemed quite natural our tastes agree in so many things toomusic and croquet and so on that is a good thing is it not mrs hancock beamed again my dear of course she said community of taste is half thebattle she was going to sayhalf the strength and joy of marriage oh here we are in slough already turn to the right denton and go through burnham beeches yes what games of croquet you will have and what music i will get a gate made in the paling between his garden and ours so that there will be no need to go round by the front door and ring the bell i dare say ellis could do it or even if i had to get a carpenter it would be but a trifle anyhow and i certainly shall not permit edward to pay half of it however much he may insist bless you my darling i feel so happy and contented about it look there is a great western express what a pace they go edith usually gave excellent attention to the various bright objects which continually caught and pleased her mothers eye but today she wandered or rather did not wander it was wonderful she said i hadnt guessed but her mother had other things as well to think about edward was quite right she said a footstool or rather one on top of another makes all the difference i shall order a very thick one from the stores sending the height i require and i think i must give a little dinnerparty before i go to bath dear just to tell a few friends our news i wish the asparagus was a little more forward how lovely the beeches are and look at those sweet little birds are they thrushes i wonder or what and what do you guess they are saying to each other i will ask mr beaumont i think and the martins and mr and mrs dobbs it will not do to have it on wednesday if we start early on thursday as we shall find plenty of little jobs on the last evening and it will be wise to get to bed early if we are to motor all next day it must be tuesday perhaps the asparagus will have come popping up if the hot weather holds darling i cannot tell you how pleased i am and what an excitement for your cousin elizabeth fancy if she was a bridesmaid before she went back to india what a lot she would have to tell to uncle robert we shall soon have to begin to think when it is to be mrs hancock said no more on this subject for the fact was that she had not made up her mind when she wished the marriage to take place she had vaguely contemplated going to egypt with her daughter next winter and she could not offhand balance the disadvantages of going alone in case she settled that edith should be married first with the advantage of saving the expenses of taking her then a brilliant possibility struck her edward might be induced to come too in which case the marriage must certainly take place first since then he would of course pay for edith but all this required consideration indeed there were many things which would need a great deal of careful thought chief among them already blotting out the beauty of the beeches was the whole question of settlements edith would naturally inherit the whole of her mothers money at her death an event to be contemplated with only the most distant recognition and mrs hancock had no intention of making serious inroads into her income which handsome as it was did not more than provide her with everything she wanted and enable her to put by a nice round sum of money every year this she was so much accustomed to do that it was unreasonable to expect her at her age to break so prudent and longestablished a habit but all this must depend to some extent on edwards attitude and expectations she had no doubt that for his part he would do all that was generous which would obviate the necessity of being very openhanded herself living next door edith would be able to come in to lunch every day when he was in the city and enjoy her motordrive as usual without any expense the croquetlawn too would be quite at edwards disposal practically she was presenting the young couple with a motorcar a lunch daily and a croquetlawn kept in excellent order by ellis straight away then there were wedding presents to be thought of which would be a great expense and elizabeth was going to spend four months at least with heran additional drain mrs hancock began to feel quite worried and pressed for money as she was accustomed to do when having made some considerable investment she found she had not more than two or three hundred pounds lying at her bank edward arrived as had been already agreed half an hour before dinner and found edith already dressed waiting for a lovers talk in the drawingroom lind had seen that the housemaids had completed the evening toilet of the room and strict injunctions had been issued that the two were not to be disturbed edward kissed her again as soon as they were left alone but after that no interruption however sudden would have surprised a fiery scene both were placid content happy undisturbed by strong emotion and unembarrassed by its absence but though as yet no surface signs gave indication the evenly hung balance had begun to quiver once more his kiss woke in her a tremor of dim agitation while inwardly he wondered though as yet unembarrassed at his own want of emotion not for a moment did he regret what he had done he was happy in the event of the day but only a little surprised a little scornful of himself for finding that he felt so precisely as he had anticipated that he would feel he had not expected to be inflamed with sudden rapture and was not dimly he saw that the adventure to which they were committed promised more to her than it did to him and he was ashamed of that yet to him it had its definite promise this charming girl whom he liked whom he admired with whom he was in sympathy had consented to share his life with him to no one would he have so willingly offered himself as to her who had so willingly accepted him his horizon such as it was was filled with her only he wondered and that but vaguely what lay over that horizons rim but he found no difficulty in framing his lips to the sense and nonsense of lovers talk i have been too happy all the afternoon to do anything he said i have just sat and strolled and thought and waited he possessed himself of her hand and told himself how capable it was yet how soft how pretty hitherto he had not given many thoughts to hands now he realized that this particular one concerned him he admired it it was strong and fine ah i am having a bad influence upon you already said she if i make you idle suddenly it appeared to him a wonderful and beautiful thing that he and a charming girl should be saying these intimate things and his response was almost eager i was only idle from happiness he said isnt it all wonderful would you have had me go to tea with some foolish people whom i did not want to see i make you misanthropic as well but im not ashamed if i make you happy something stirred within her some new beating pulse she came a little closer to him you looked so nice edward she said this afternoon when you stopped and spoke but i couldnt bear your tie i shall knit you one the same shade of brown as your eyes i will do it at bath it is a great nuisance your going to bath he said must you really go i want you here but the tie will be lovely oh conceit she said after i have told you it is to be the colour of your eyes i forgot that arent you being rather malicious he looked up from her hand to her face never before had he noticed how bright and abundant was her hair how delicate the line of black eyebrow he corrected himself malicious did i say he asked i meanti meant delicious and talking of eyes i must give you a turquoise engagement ring for the day and a sapphire one for the evening what has that to do with eyes she asked everything yours are light blue in the sunlight and dark blue at night i feel as if i ought to apologize but i dont think i shall it wasnt my fault i dont insist said he but i insist on knowing one thing when when what do you mean she asked look me in the face and say you dont know edith laugheda happy little quiver of a laugh that she had never heard yet i could if i liked she said but i dont choose to if you mean that is exactly what i mean how can you know before i have said it she asked i can do say what i mean again she laughed when shall we be married was what you meant she looked extremely pretty and rather shy he had never noticed before how fine was her mouth how fine and fair the curve of her upper lip yes sapphire and turquoise he said his lips said it his brain said it the sonorous tones of the chinese gong manipulated with so cunning a crescendo and diminuendo by lind boomed through the house immediately afterwards mrs hancocks tread noticeably heavy was heard on the stairs she hummed some little nameless ditty in warning edith got up dinner already she said edward perhaps was not quite so much surprised at the swiftness of the passage of this halfhour before you have answered my question he said as the door opened chapter iv comfortable plans had the day of judgment or any other devastating crisis been fixed for the morrow that would not have delayed mrs hancocks retirement to her bedroom not later than eleven the night before sometimes and not rarely she went upstairs at halfpast ten in order to get a good night before the fatigues of the next day whatever they might happen to be but in no case unless by chance she went to the theatre in town was she later than eleven she did not always go to bed immediately on arrival in her room frequently after she had played her invariable game of patience while filson brushed her hair she read a book since as she so often lamented she had so little time for reading during the day sometimes she sat in front of her fire making further plans for her comfort tonight plans occupied her for a considerable time and though they directly concerned edith they might still be correctly classified as bearing on her own comfort she had literally enjoyed half an hours conversation with edward after dinner this had been of a highly satisfactory character for she had ascertained that he was making a really substantial income and that he had investments all of a sound character which already amounted to over thirty thousand pounds this in the event of his deathto which apparently he did not mind alluding at allhe was prepared to settle on his wife the house next door was freehold property of his and though he had contemplated selling that and purchasing one that was more of the size to which edith was accustomed he seemed perfectly ready to fall in with mrs hancocks clearly expressed wish that he should remain where he was for the wrench of parting with edith at all was only tolerable to her if the parting was not to be more than a few yards in breadth the question of the gardengate in the paling did not however fill him with any intense enthusiasm and she after making it quite clear that he was not expected to pay for it let the subject drop but she intended to give ellis the necessary instructions all the same for she was quite sure he would like it when it was done furthermore he had not expressed the least curiosity as regards what allowance or dowry she was intending to give edith which showed a very proper confidence he could not in fact have behaved with greater delicacy and yet that delicacy had put mrs hancock so to speak rather in a hole she had to determine by the light of her own generosity alone what she was prepared to do it was this point that now occupied her after she had written a note to the stores ordering a footstool nine inches high covered in a dark red shade of russia leather so that was off her mind edward had given quite a warm welcome to the scheme of the egyptian expedition and had expressed his readiness to take no holiday this summer but have his vacation then in this case marriage in november a months honeymoon with his bride and a reunion with mrs hancock at cairo was an ideal arrangement all this kindled mrs hancocks sense of generosity for it would relieve her of the expense of edith on the egyptian tour and in the first glow of her gratification she proposed to herself to settle on edith a sum that should produce four hundred pounds a year she was almost surprised at herself for this unhesitating openhandedness and sat down to consider just what it meant four hundred a year represented a capital of over ten thousand pounds that seemed a great deal of money to put without restriction into the hands of a girl who hitherto had been accustomed to control only an allowance for dress and pocketmoney paid quarterly it would be much more prudent and indeed kinder to give her at first anyhow till by experience in household management she became accustomed to deal with larger sums a quarterly allowance as before four hundred a year was more than double what she had been accustomed to and no doubt edward who was clearly the soul of generosity would give her no less edith would then be mistress for her own private expenses alone of no less than eight hundred a year this was colossal affluence enough carefully used for the upbringing and support of an entire family she could never spend eight hundred a year and there was no need for her to save since she was the wife of a welltodo husband and heiress to a considerable fortune so much money would but be a burden to her if her mother allowed her two hundred a year that added to what edward would no doubt insist on giving hermrs hancock had settled that he would certainly give as much as she had originally thought of givingwould make her a more than ample allowance her thoughts went back for a moment to the note to the stores which lay on the table certainly a footstool made a motordrive much more comfortable and since edith was going to accompany her to bath her mother could not bear the thought that she should lack the comforts she gave herself she would order two footstools without a moments hesitation she opened the letter and made the necessary alteration there that was done how pleased edith would be she returned to the question of the allowance viewing it as it were from a rather greater distance she hoped she prayed that edith would have children who must certainly adore their granny their granny would certainly adore them and it would be nothing less than a joy to her to give each of them say a hundred pounds every birthday to be prudently invested for them so that when they came of age they would have tidy little fortunes of their own she glowed with pleasure when she thought of that childrens education was a great expense and it would be so nice for edward to know that as each child of his came of age he would have waiting for him quite a little income of his own or capitalized such a sum would start the boys in life and provide quite a dowry for the daughters at compound interest money doubled itself in no time they would all be young men and women of independent means perhaps edith would have five or six children and though mrs hancocks munificence would then be costing her six hundred a yearor interest on fifteen thousand poundsshe felt that it would be the greatest delight to pinch herself to make ends meet for the sake of being such a fairygranny but if she was paying edith two hundred a year all the time the very queen of the fairygrannies would scarcely be able to afford all this and she felt quite sure that edith would choose to have her children provided for rather than herself for she had the most unselfish of natures hitherto edith had received a hundred and fifty a year for dress and travelling expenses when she went alone she had done very well on that and was always neat and tidy now without doubt her husband would pay all her travelling expenses since they would always travel together even if she continued to give edith a hundred and fifty pounds a year that with her travelling expenses paid by her husband and an allowanceas beforeof four hundred a year from him would be far more than she could possibly require besides her mother had already settled to provide lunch for her every day while edward was in town and a motordrive afterwards while to keep the croquetlawn at such a pitch of perfection as so fine a player as edward would expectand she was determined he should findwould mean very likely another gardener or at any rate a man to come in once or twice a week to help ellis then there was the trousseau to be thought of which mrs hancock was invincibly determined to provide herself and that would cost more than the whole of ediths allowance for the year certainly with this necessary visit to bath and the winter in egypt which she had promised edward she would manage and with the expense of having elizabeth in the house all the summer she herself would be very poor indeed for the next year it seemed really unreasonable that for these twelve months she would give edith any allowance at all and by that time please god there might be a little grandchild to begin providing for evidently she would have to be very careful and saving but the thought of those for whom she would be stinting herself made such sacrifice a work of joy and pleasure but for a moment she looked at the note to the stores again wondering whether it would not be possible to put one footstool between them to be shared by both that red leather was very expensive then there were wedding presents to be thought of and though she was determined to give edith her whole trousseau she meant to behave lavishly in this respect and glowing with the prospective delight of giving she opened the bramahlocked jewel safe which was let into her bedroom wall she quite longed to clasp round ediths neck the four fine rows of pearls which had come to her from her late husband but this was impossible since she was convinced they were heirlooms and must remain in her possession till her death there was a diamond tiara which it was true was her own property but this was far too matronly an ornament for a young bride diamond tiaras also were out of place in heathmoor and she had not once worn it herself in the ten years that she had lived there it was no use giving dear edith jewels that she would but lock up in her safe then there was an emerald necklace of admirable stones but it was oldfashioned and green never suited edith she disliked green she would not wear it but pink was her favourite colour and here was the very thing a dogcollar of beautiful coral with a pearl clasp how often had edith admired it how often had her mother thought of giving it her there was a charming moonstone brooch too set in dear little turquoises the blue and the pink would go deliciously together as a matter of fact the turquoises were rather green too but it was late time had flown over those liberal schemes she locked up the coral necklace and the moonstone brooch in a drawer by themselvesediths drawer she instantly christened itsaid her prayers with an overflowing heart and went to bed just before she fell asleep she made up her mind to order new morocco boxes lined with darkblue velvet with ediths new initials in gilt upon them to hold these weddinggifts then there was edward she must give him something he would use and take pleasure in there was no sense in giving presents which were not useful suddenly an excellent idea struck her how pleased he would be at her remembering the want he had expressed the other daya want that was only one item out of the gift she contemplated she would give him a whole set and he might keep them in her gardenhouse since he would use them here it would be necessary to write another letter to the stores what a lot of things there were to think about and provide when young people were going to be married the little party which mrs hancock invited to receive officially the news of ediths engagement were all delighted to be able to accept even though the notice was so short dinnergiving at heathmoor though during the summer croquet and lawntennis parties with iced coffee and caviare sandwiches were of almost daily occurrenceindeed sometimes they clashedwas chiefly confined to saturday evening when no sense of early trains on the morrow made writing on the wall to check conviviality mrs hancock knew that quite well though in her notes to her guests she had said if by any chance you happen to be disengaged on tuesday and would have been much surprised if any previous engagement had forced any one to be obliged to decline personally she would have liked to get together a somewhat larger gathering for ellis said there was no doubt about a sufficiency of asparagus but lind invariably set his hatchetlike face against a party of more than eight which he considered a sufficiently festive number in the earlier years of linds iron rule mrs hancock had sometimes invited a larger party but on these occasions the service had been so slow the wine so sparingly administered and linds demeanour if she remonstrated next morning so frozen and fatalistic so full of scarcely veiled threats about his not giving satisfaction that by degrees he had schooled her into submission and she was beginning to consider that eight was the pleasantest number of guests and a quarterto the most suitable hour which also was linds choice so on this occasion there were the engaged couple and herself the clergyman mr martin and his wife an eminent and solid solicitor mr dobbs with mrs dobbs and mr beaumont one of the few men in heathmoor who was not actively engaged all day in making money partly accounted for by the fact that he had a great deal already partly that he would have certainly lost it instead idle however he was not for he was an entomologist of fanatical activity he spent most summer evenings in spreading intoxicating mixtures of beer and sugar on treetrunks to stupefy unwary lepidoptera most of the night in visiting these banquets with a lantern and taking into custody his inebriated guests and the entire day in beating copses for caterpillars in running over noonday heaths with a green butterfly net and in killing and setting the trophies of his chase for a year or two mrs hancock had spread vague snares about him for ediths sake feigning an unfounded interest in the crawlings of caterpillars and the dormancy of chrysalides but her hunting had been firmly and successfully thwarted by his gaunt sister who devoted her untiring energy to the destruction of winged insects and the preservation of her brothers celibacy she never went out into heathmoor society though she occasionally played hostess at singularly uncomfortable dinners at home these entertainments were not very popular since escaped caterpillars sometimes came to the party a smell of camphor and insects pervaded the house and miss beaumont began yawning punctually at ten oclock until the last guest had departed then she killed some more moths but her brother was the nucleus of heathmoor dinners and hostesses starting with him built up agreeable gatherings round him for though heathmoor was not one atom more snobbish than other settlements of the kind it was idle to pretend that the nephew of an earl brother of a viscountess and member of the royal entomological society was not a good basis on which to build a social evening he had a charming tenor voice which he had not the slightest notion how to use and heathmoor considered that had he chosen to go on the operatic stage there would not have been so much talk about caruso while the interest with which he listened to long accounts of household difficulties with fiends in the shape of housemaids was certainly beyond all praise at home he managed the whole affairs of the menage from seeing the cook in the morning to giving his dog his supper in the evening since his sister when not occupied with his moths was absorbed in roman history mr martin and his wife were the first to arrive and as usual the vicar took up his place on the hearthrug with the air of temporary host this indeed was his position at mrs hancocks for it was he whom she always left in charge of the men in the diningroom when the ladies left them to their wine with instructions as to where the cigarettes were and not to stop too long it was his business also at which he was adept to be trumpeter in general of the honour and glory of his hostess and refer to any late acquisition of hers in the way of motorcars palings or rambler roses in this position of host he naturally took precedence of everybody else and his mot round collars are more than coronets when conducting the leading lady to the diningroom in the teeth you may say of a baronet dazzled heathmoor for weeks whenever they thought of it his wife a plump little dresden shepherdess made much use of the ejaculation only fancy and at her husbands naughtier sallies exclaimed alfred alfred while she attempted to cover her face with a very small hand to hide her laughter soon they were joined by mr and mrs dobbs and shortly after by mr beaumont who looked as was indeed the case as if he had been running mrs hancocks dinners were always admirable and since mrs williams kept a book of all her menus there was no risk of guests being regaled with dishes they had lately partaken of at the house the conversation if anything was slightly less varied since apart from contemporaneous happenings that required comment the main topics of interest were rather of the nature of hardy perennials mr beaumonts sister was always inquired after and usually the opinion of his uncle with regard to the latest iniquity of the radical government weather gardens croquet were questions that starred the conversational heavens with planetlike regularity moving in their appointed orbits and mr dobbs filled such intervals as he could spare from the mastication of his dinner with its praise delicious glass of sherry mrs hancock he said very early in the proceedings you cant buy sherry like that now mr martins evening clothes were not cut so as to suggest his profession he based his influence not on his clothes but on his human sympathy with the joys and sorrows of his friends there is a time to mourn to weep to repent he said once in a sermon but undoubtedly there is a time to be as jolly as a sandboy he did not approve of teetotalism any one could be a teetotaller you are more of an example by partaking of the good things of this world in due moderation he drank half his glass of sherry i always tell mrs hancock that her wine would cause a rechabite to recant he observed gaily mrs martin covered her face with her hand and gave a little spurt of laughter this was an old joke but social gaiety would speedily become a thing of the past if we never appeared to be amused at familiar witticisms alfred alfred she said how can you is not alfred wicked conversation became general and have you begun croquet yet this year mr holroyd asked mrs dobbs i suppose you will carry off all the prizes again as you always do i wish you would make mr dobbs take to it instead of spending all his time catching slugs in the garden so much better for him do not listen to mrs dobbs holroyd cried the vicar i use my authority to forbid your listening to mrs dobbs the slugs spoil the flowers and like a greedy fellow i want every flower in heathmoor for trinity sunday alfred alfred said his wife yes my dear and you will never guess what mrs hancock has just promised me while she is at bath i may order ellis to send a basket of her best flowers up to the church every sunday no limitation over the basket mind you it shall be a clothesbasket and as for best flowerswell all i can say is that any one who hasnt seen mrs hancocks tulips this year doesnt know what tulips can be mr dobbs who ate with his head perpendicularly above his plate looked up at his wife i told you salmon could be got my dear he said you shall have it she said but dont blame me for the fishmongers book mr martin laughed joyfully my wife tells me i mustnt play golf so much he said because it gives me such an appetite that i eat her out of hearth and home but i tell her it is one of my parochial duties how can i get to know the young fellows of the place unless i join in their amusements they will never tell me their difficulties and temptations unless they have found me in sympathy with their joys and if when i am playing with them there is trouble in the long grass and occasionally a little word a wee naughty little word slips outalfred alfredyou may be sure that i never seem to hear it well i do call that tact said mrs hancock genially but you must take a little cucumber with your salmon mr martin this is the first cucumber ellis has sent me in a gourda positive gourd said mr martin taking a slice of this remarkable vegetable jonah and his whale could have sat under it is not alfred wicked said his wife and you are really off to bath the day after tomorrow asked he and are going to drive all the way in your car though of course with a car like yours it is no distance at all sometimes i see your car on one horizon and then whizz you are out of sight again over the other but no noise no dust no smell but the speed limit mrs hancock i am tempted to say no speed limit either he refrained from this audacious suggestion and continued such an excellent steady fellow too you have in denton i always see my friend denton coming in during the psalms after he has taken your car home and if he has to leave again in the middle of the sermon im sure he only does at the call of duty what half the congregation would do for pleasure if they had the courage they have my sympathy how bored i should get if i had to listen to a longwinded parson every sunday mrs hancock cast an anxious eye on the asparagus but there was a perfect haystack of it how much i enjoyed your sermon last sunday said she about the duty of being cheerful and happy and doing all we can to make ourselves happy for the sake of others oh you must take more asparagus ellis would be miserable if it was not all eaten it is only the second time we have had it this year for the moment she thought of telling mr martin to supply himself with asparagus while she was at bath but the duty of making herself happy prevailed and she refrained for it occurred to her that ellis might dispatch daily bundles early in the morning in cardboard boxes so that they would reach bath in time to be cooked for dinner the hotel commissariat would certainly not rise to asparagus so early in the season mrs martin in the meantime with one sycophantic ear open to catch her husbands jokes was full of fancy ejaculations to mr beaumont who was describing to her the romantic history of the female oakegger which exercised so extraordinary a fascination on all young males for miles around here mr dobbs was lacking in felicity for he remarked that a great many unmarried young ladies would be glad to know how the female oakegger did it but mr beaumont made it unnecessary for mrs dobbs even to frown at him so rapidly did he wonder whether it was called an oakegger because it laid upwards of a million eggs then mrs hancock called the attention of the table generally to the fact that the gooseberry tartlets were the produce of the gardenthe first of the yearand mr martin alluded to the feast of the blessed innocents saying that even massacre had a silver lining though not for the massacred a savoury of which mr dobbs was easily induced to take a second helping brought dinner to what musicians call a full close then came the moment of the evening port was ruthlessly supplied by lind to all the guests whether they wanted it or not and mrs hancock rose with her kind brown eyes moist with emotion ladies and gentlemen she said i have a toast to propose i ask you to drink the health of my dear daughter and of edward holroyd my future soninlaw your health my dear dear children mr beaumont instantly led off the musical honours on so high a note that those of the party who could sing followed with faint gasps and screams and under cover of the hubbub of comment and congratulation that followed shyly and eagerly ediths eye sought her future husband and when his eye met hers she felt her heart rap out a tumultuous dozen of unbidden beats fast and sweetly suffocating then she blushed furiously at a sudden selfaccusation of indelicacy of unmaidenness but her heart acquitted her of the indictment was it not right to give that tattoo of welcome the start for bath was made in strict accordance with the scheduled plan filson with the heavy luggage on the top of the motor accompanied by lind her lunch and a freshly cut bundle of asparagus destined for mrs hancocks dinner in the evening left the house in such good time that she had to wait twentyfive minutes at the station which it took exactly three to reach the motor returned in time for lind to serve mrs hancocks breakfast with all the finish and decorum to which she was accustomed then the new nineinch footstoolmrs hancock had decided against the extravagance of twothe map of the route the large luncheonbasket the adjustable cardtable the writingcase a couple of new volumes from mudies cloaks of varying thickness and the great green russia leather travelling sack were conveniently bestowed and full five minutes before the appointed time the car slid silently away from the door with all possible provision made for a comfortable journey the first five minutes were spent in verifying the presence of all these conveniences and mrs hancock sank back on her carefully adjusted cushions there she said we are in for it now dear and if all goes as well as it has begun we shall be at bath by five how much nicer than all the fuss of crossing london and the risk of having somebody put into our carriage fancy our never having thought of motoring to bath before oh look there is mr martin going to play golf how early we all are this morning and perhaps we shall see mr beaumont with his butterfly net then as soon as we get into the main road i shall have a look at the morning paper there has not been a minute to glance at it yet or perhaps you would look at it for me dear edith and tell me what there is the motion always makes the print dance a little before my eyes i expect the time will slip by so that we shall be astonished when we find we are at bath and very likely not be at all tired and you must be on the lookout for anything interesting and write to edward about it in case when he comes down for a sunday he comes by motor then he will be on the lookout and see it too why we are at slough already there is the great western line filsons train will go along there if she had started three or four hours earlier her train might have gone by as we passed and she could have looked out of the window and seen us that would have been a coincidence the car ran so smoothly on the excellent surface of the bath road that mrs hancock found that the print of her morning post had not the smallest tendency to dance and reserving as usual the leaders and longer paragraphs for the digestive period after lunch she soaked herself gently as in a warm bath in the announcements of the arrival in london of people she had never seen and the appearance at the opera of those she had never heard of what taste exactly was gratified by these titbits of information it would be hard to say possibly the sense that so many people were moving backwards and forwards enhanced the enjoyment of her own leisure she mentally contrasted the bustle that was incident to journeys from paris with her own smooth unhurrying progress to bath edith meantime following her mothers suggestion that she should look out of the window in order to be able to communicate to edward objects of interest to be seen by the road soon passed from external observation to introspection these last four or five days since she had so unemotionally accepted his offer of himself to her had about them something of the unconjectured surprises of dawn when after a night of travel the darkness begins to lift off from the face of a new and unfamiliar country it was he in this image who took the place of the light and the country which its gradual illumination revealed as it soaked through and dissolved the webs of darkness was herself for it is an undeniable truth that love that absorption of self in another self cannot take place till the giver has some notion of the nature of the gift that he brings and edith up till the present time was as ignorant of herself as are all girls whose emotions and womanhood have never been really roused she had accepted her lover without knowing what devotion meant or who it was who accepted him except in so far that her name was edith hancock her years twentyfour and her complexion fair for the arrows of love are at the least feathered with egotism they will not fly unless a conscious personality enables them to steer straight but flutter and dip and reach no mark at first frankly she was appalled by the barrenness which the light of her lover showed it appeared to be level land without streams or inspiring hilltops a country uncovetable a featureless a mountainous acreage but it was not stonily barren even her eyes unaccustomed to the light and that which it revealed saw that it was barren but from emptiness and empty perhaps only as the winter fields are bare it was not an unkindly an inhospitable land the very soil of it cried out and told her that all day the image of her empty country but not unkindly hung in her mind even as an unborn melody hovers a little above the brain of the musician until condensing like dew it melts into it and all day but very gradually for these dawns of love come seldom in a blinding flash of a sun upleaping over the horizon but rather in a slow crescendo of illumination as of a waxing flame that shall mount to who knows what transmitted fire the first wonderful twilight of the day grew rosy and in that morningrose which showed her herself she saw also him whom it welcomed eagerly and with strong sense of possession she claimed him it was to her that he belonged he was hers to be loved and adored but also to be owned outwardly she was the edith whom her mother knew though in her spirit were beginning those changes which must soon make her old self a thing unrecognizable to her clearer vision but it was scarcely strange that mrs hancock saw no hint of change for as may have been perceived she had the gift or limitation of being completely taken up with the surface of things indeed to her mind any inquiry into the mechanism of the spirit and its pulses was of the same indelicacy as discussion of the functions and operations of the human body if your body was ill you went quickly to the doctor and did not call your friends attention to your infirmity if your soul was illbut mrs hancocks soul was never ill they had the satisfaction of seeing a great many more great western trains at reading and passed out into the delectable country beyond then totally unexpected difficulties began to occur with regard to the spot where they should stop and take their lunch just outside reading indeed there was seen an entirely suitable place secluded shady out of the wind and strongly recommended by denton but unfortunately it was then only a quarterpast one and mrs hancock had not intended to lunch till halfpast therefore they pushed on going rather slow so as not to miss any really proper encamping ground ten minutes later they were again favoured by an oaktree and a sheltering hedge but here unfortunately a tramp was asleep by the wayside at any moment he might wake and prove to be intoxicated and mrs hancock was quite sure she could not enjoy her lunch in his vicinity further on again there was a wayside cottage too near a proposed haltingplace for children might come out of it and stare and the cottage was succeeded by a smell of brick fields before long tilehurst began to show up roofs and it was necessary to get clear of tilehurst on the far side before any sort of serenity could be hoped for then for nearly a mile they had to follow an impenetrable flock of sheep and it was imperative to get well ahead of them pangbourne appeared and it was already after two oclock it will hardly be credited that they had scarcely got free of this contaminating village when a tyre punctured a halt was inevitable while it was being repaired but then denton could not eat while he was mending it and since they would have to stop again for denton to have his lunch since he could not drive during that process it was better to make a halt for general refreshments when the tyre trouble was overpast mrs hancock looked despairingly round it is most annoying she said i do not know that we should not have done better to have had lunch at an inn at reading or to have stopped at that first place remember to tell edward dear to look out for that first place if he drives down there is positively nowhere after that where he can find a quiet spot i wonder if we had better eat a couple of biscuits now in case we cant find a suitable place soon dear me here come those sheep again they ought not to be allowed to drive sheep along a road that is meant for carriages put the window up dear against the dust suddenly illumination like a cloudpiercing ray shone on edith it struck her that all her life had been spent in looking for a place to have lunch in so to speak in putting up windows for fear of the dust in avoiding the proximity of tramps infinitesimal as was the occasion it seemed to throw an amazing light on to her life up till the present it was hardly an exaggeration to say that anything more important anything more directly concerned with existence had never happened to her was it this comfortable ordered life in which an infinite agglomeration of utterly trivial things made up the sum total that caused her lately discovered country to appear so barren she looked at her mothers face it was flushed with childish annoyance just as it had been about three years ago when a perfectly satisfactory housemaid gave notice because she was going to be married since then she could remember nothing that had so disconcerted her mother except when once denton shut the corner of the new fur carriagerug into the hinge of the motordoor on both these previous occasions she had been impressed with the magnitude of the moment now she felt slightly inclined to laugh even if the unthinkable the supreme disaster happened and they did not lunch at all would the world come completely to an end but a second glance at her mothers face checked her tendency to laugh and encouraged a feeling that was quite as novel to her she felt suddenly and overwhelmingly sorry that this drive this lunch which her mother had planned with such care and with such pleased anticipation of comfort should have disappointed her it was like a childs disappointment over the breakage of a toy or the nonfulfilment of some engaging expedition there was laughter in her heart no longer only a tenderness a commiseration that sympathized in womanly fashion with a childish trouble it is darkest before dawn and this cimmerian gloom composed of puncture and the absence of a possible luncheon place began to lift denton was handy with his tools the sheep were herded through a gate into a field by the roadside so that when they went on again there was no further passage through the flock to be negotiated goring streamed swiftly by them and hardly were they quit of its outlying houses when a soft stretch of grass by the roadside uncontaminated by tramp and untenanted by child spread itself before their eyes and mrs hancock as she finished the last jam puff was more beaming than the sun of this lovely may afternoon im not sure that it was not worth while going through all these annoyances and delays she said to have found such a lovely place and to have enjoyed our lunch so much i was afraid the jam might have run out of the puffs but it was as safe as if they had just come up from the kitchen i wish edward was here to have enjoyed it with us you must tell him what a good lunch we had and edith found her mothers enjoyment as tenderly pathetic as her disappointment had been chapter v comfortable settlements edward holroyd had arranged to go down to bath for a certain saturday till monday some fortnight after the safe arrival there on the stroke of five of mrs hancocks motor he had spent a couple of rather lonely weeks at heathmoor since the departure of his neighbours and he was pleased to find how much he missed edith his failure to achieve poignant emotion over his engagement had troubled him he was distressed about the indolence of his temperament he had never yet seen a girl whom he so much admired and liked but the very fact that he was able to contemplate her image and tell himself how charming she was seemed to him part of that failure she affected him with the same degree of emotion that a spring morning or a melodious song stirred in him he could while basking in her charm tell himself that he basked he was not by the exquisitiveness of the conditions rendered in the least oblivious of himself his sensations had not any overpowering mastery over him duly he sat and thought about her when he got home in the evening from his day in the city duly and honestly he told himself how delightful her perpetual presence would be to him but he did not dream and doat he never lost himself in haze of rapture he was not blinded by any intolerable brightness but he wanted immensely to see her again he missed her as much as he was capable of missing anything but his industry at his office and his appetite at his dinner were wholly unaffected though they would quite certainly have been impaired if for any reason his engagement had been broken off she was the nicest girl he had ever seen and in the autumn she was going to marry him tonight on the eve of his departure to bath he reminded himself many times of his great good fortune he had known friends who had suffered the torments of the lost over the obduracy or the indifference of girls whom they wanted to marry and his sympathy with such men was tinged with jealousy that they felt so keenly she had been neither indifferent nor obdurate she had at once granted him his hearts desire and then he faced the question that arose out of his fortunate situation would he have suffered unutterable torments if she had refused him he knew he would not the night was warm a full moon rode high in an unclouded heaven and he let himself out of the french windows of his drawingroom into the small lawn behind the house a windless calm reigned and the shadow of the trees that bounded his lawn fell in sharp unwavering outline on the dewy grass next door the black mass of mrs hancocks house unpierced by any lights except the small illuminated square from servants rooms in the top story stood with blinds drawn down over the windows solid concrete comfortable a brick and mortar rendering of the ordered life that was lived there no roofs he felt sure leaked no windows stuck no door squealed on its hinges and its inhabitants whom he knew so well to whom he was so sincerely attached were equally strangers to squealing and leaking soul and body they were watertight undesirable emotions no more percolated into their souls than did rainwater into their roofs they stood with their wellbuilt walls cool in summer and warm in winter their windows never rattled when gales bugled outside and he himself he knew also was in the same excellent state of repair it was a characteristic of heathmoor to be in an excellent state of repair they all stood like that side by side in detached residences with small though charming gardens behind for the moment he was in revolt against this deadly respectability then with a comical despair he knew that he was not even in revolt he could not do more than imagine being in revolt rightly or wrongly he connected all this wellordered comfort those eggs and bacon for breakfast and buttered toast for tea with his inability to feel keenly life had never stung or prodded him any more than it appeared to have stung or prodded mrs hancock and that she could be stung or prodded by anything was beyond the bounds of the most fantastic imagination there were no wasps nests in all heathmoor the gardens were too well looked after and there were no psychical wasps or gadflies either the gospel of mr martin preached so regularly and convincingly every sunday made it a sin to be otherwise than cheerful and contented and wellfed no disturbing influence ever came down in those firstclass carriages not even mrs grundy ever paid them a visit she left her own dear children to look after themselves with a complete and untroubled confidence in their good behaviour as for edward his conduct had from boyhood upwards been such as to justify that ladys absence in life he was a natural grundyite indisposed to the venial if unjustifiable violences of youth not so much from a lack of vitality or on the other hand from high principle but from a sheer innate respectability which beat in his blood he had been one of those boys who never have given their parents a moments anxiety not from any stern sense of right behaviour but because he was that exceedingly rare product in a world that is almost entirely composed of exceptionsa perfectly normal young man one that is who lies just about upon the mean which is fixed resultantly by contending forces he was that lusus naturae an average young man a sport an exception a rare variety to be collected by the mr beaumont of human moths an instance in himself of the average which in the sum is made up of qualities of specimens none of which is average he was in life and conduct what the average young man is supposed to be and in the mass not individually is he was neither milksop nor adventurer neither celibate by nature nor debauchee he was not miserly with money or spendthrift neither devout nor irreligious in two points only did he depart from the perfect specimen of the average he was exceedingly goodlooking and he had been a dreamer though his dream blossoms as yet had borne no fruit indeed as has been already stated he had largely acquiesced in their barrenness and in the matter of the ideal she had shaken himself awake round one subject only did they linger that was music in regard to which so far as he performed at all he was so atrocious a practitioner it was long past midnight as he stood there in his garden and surveyed the solidity of the house next door and the novelty to him of his reflections about it had been perhaps induced by his listening that night to that out of which his dreams were made for he had just come backmotoring down in great comfortfrom a performance at the opera of the gotterdaemmerung all evening he had been wrapped and absorbed in the immense tragedy of its portentous people and just now they and their woes and their loves seemed to him more real more essentially existent than all the actual and tangible things with which he was surrounded they were the substance of which this moonlight this square house next door the remembrance of edith even were but the shadows of the spaces they moved among even as the shadows on the grass were but an accident of light occurring to the trees that cast them on such a night after the uproar of cosmic cataclysm the moon shone on the waters of the rhine with their restored treasure through a hundred and a thousand such nights brunnhilde slept below her breastplate on the mountaintop maiden but goddess no more till to siegfrieds soul she resumed a nobler divinity and that divine duet with its webs of melody passing through and through it like a shuttle of pure light was but the expression of love such love as it had been given to man to feel since a man wrote and recorded it it was such music now that his soul should be making when he thought of edith but he knew that no such frenzy of fire inspired him if his soul sang it was but a cheerful little tune admirably adapted to the domestic hearth and that was the best music he could make anyhow it had no wrong notes in it it had no wild cadences or broken and sobbing rhythms it was just a cheerful little tune such as they sang in church about morning gilding the skies you only had to substitute moon for morning and you were as jolly and comfortable as possible edward began to be aware that his brain was dictating thoughts which his conscious mind did not endorse they resembled the tissue of confused images which lie on the borderland which intervenes between the sheer incoherence of sleeping dreams and the drowsiness which precedes it but there was an uneasy though only momentary wonder in his mind whether these disordered images sprang not from the poppy soil of sleep but from a gradually awakening brain whether they were not the light at the end of a tunnel rather than the dimness of its entrance the cool cells of thought had grown feverish with the excitement of the drama he had just seen or had they begun to stir to their own proper activity which was real in fact the white cool flame of the moonlight as it shone on still trees and dewy grass or the song of siegfried which burned the sunset air and blinded with rapture the eyes of brunnhilde when she woke goddess no more and by that the more divine heathmoor the essential spirit of heathmoor in the incarnation of the striking of the clock at the livery stables came to his rescue for it unmistakably reminded him that the hour was two in the morninga time which probably occurred every night but a time of which the evidence was a matter of inference rather than experience he hailed it as a navigator driving before the wind in rocksown and dangerous waters might hail a harbour light that betokened an inlet in a wavebeaten and inexorable cliff he could put in and escape from these threats of wavecrest and storm it was long past the proper time to go to bed or in heathmoor phrase he would never get up in the morning but that waiting in the still moonlight shadowed by the unwavering trees had been a moment of revelation a little light coming from the realms of music where alone his imagination worked had been blinked into the windows of the dark and tidy room where otherwise he lived it was like a distant lightning flash coming at night to a room where in a cool clean bed a man lay drowsy but awake he wondered whether the storm would move nearer and before he slept he wondered whether edith would understand she knew he was fond of music would she understand that fond of music was a mere phrase of nonsense if meant to convey what it held for him he fell into a slightly priggish sleep he arrived at the admirable star hotel at bath next afternoon and found a room had been engaged for him by mrs hancock who with edith welcomed him at the station he had been uncertain whether he was her guest or not but she at once put and end to all doubt on this point by telling him that she had bargained with the manager on his behalf and that he had granted him the reduced terms on which she making a long stay was entertained which saved him halfacrown a day and included the unlimited use of the bathroom of course he would use their sittingroom quite freely just as if it was his own and i cant tell you how pleased i am to see you dear edward she said laying a cordial hand on his knee we will have tea at once as my bath is at halfpast five and i like to reach the establishment a full ten minutes before the hour and so after tea you and edith will be left to your own devices what a lot you will have to tell each other for its a fortnight and three days since we left home though im sure it doesnt seem more than a week ellis sends us a bundle of asparagus every morning and says it will last another ten days at least they are most civil about having it cooked and dont charge a penny for it or for giving melted butter with it i quite expected they would charge for the melted butter this seemed to be the sum of mrs hancocks news and shortly after tea she had brought her own tea with her which perhaps served to counterbalance the munificence of the management as regards the melted butter she went off to her bath leaving the two together edward had occupied a chair while edith sat on the sofa now he came beside her well he said capturing her hand edith looked at him as she had never looked before her eyes sought and held and embraced him tell me all you have been doing she said especially the little things i think the little things matter most they are more intimate but i want your news said he she flushed a little i have wanted you she said simply what a little thing not till then did he understand the change that had come over her in this last fortnightthe change that concerned him alone it was clear that the music which her soul made was no cheerful little chant inarticulate it sang and soared a little of that fire leaped across to him kindling him that was sweet of you he said but it makes me feel rather nervous what if you are disappointed she came a little closer to him ive got an awful confession to make she said whenwhen you asked me first i was so pleased and glad but i didnt care not care but since then she looked up at him i care so much she said and i want to be worthy you have such fine thoughts edward thoughts so much above me ive always known that but now that i care for you i realize it when you play for instance you are hearing things i am deaf to seeing visions perhaps that i am blind to but i do want to learn will you teach me nobody but you can teach me her confession ennobled her he saw a glimpse of her far above him all the years that he had known her he had thought that there was nothing up high like that but it had always been there it wanted but the sun and wind of love to part the cloud and show the shining peaks human peaks divine peaks the highlands of dawning love she was beginning to realize for herself quite easily quite without effort all that he lacked all that in the vague dream of his youth he believed to lie outside of him already she was there her foot on the eternal snows bathed in the eternal sunshine the commonest and greatest miracle of all was in process within the waterpots were already reddening with the true grape i never guessed she said and oh edward if only caring made me less stupid but be patient with me and wait for me to learn i shall be able to learn if you will teach me there is a whole great world round me full of splendour and beauty which somehow doesnt come in ones way at heathmoor i thinkand she laughedi think the asparagus so to speak shuts it out but it is there its everywhere you took me right up to it and even then i didnt recognize it at once now i am beginning to recognize it i get glimpses of it anyhow this was near enough to the dreamthoughts that had come to him last night as he looked at the square house next door to enable him to join her but she who besought him to teach her spoke authentically of what she had seen he the teacher but babbled and halted over things imagined and not realized ah that is so much what i felt last night he said i went to the gotterdaemmerung in town and when i came back i stood in the garden and all that you say was in my mind there is a splendid world round us and too much asparagus i dont mean she guessed just what he stopped himself from saying but mother is such a dear she said i love her comfortable little plans they are as touching as a childs i wouldnt spoil her pleasure for anything tell me about the gotterdaemmerung it is all that which i want to learn theres love in it and tragedy all big music says what you feel isnt that it i can see it does to you when you play and what music says to you you the fact of you say to me yet he felt this was exactly the same girl whom he had long known comfortable pleasant pretty the change was but the change that happens to a plant when the spike of blossoms shoots upwards from its heart and was not so much change as growth she had shot up far away ahead of him with her budding stem and all the time she thought she was reaching up to him and he gratified and a little embarrassed thought so too you mustnt say such things to me he said it makes me feel as ifas if you had put me on a pedestal somehow but it is true that music says to me things which turn into ideas longings aspirations but so far from me teaching you what it means it is you who have got to teach me it is you who are the explanation of it all dont you see he stopped a moment trying himself to grasp the thought which eluded him so at least he imagined to himself in reality he sought the fire that should kindle him and fire of a sort was not hard to find for they sat alone together and she whom he liked and admired clung to him he kissed her and found himself nearer to passion than he had ever been yet it must have been you that i was looking for he said again in her the tremulous flame of a girls first love shot up fed with the new fuel then by a sudden impulse she got up and stood a little away from him passing her hand over her eyes i feel as if it cant be she said and yet when you say it is i cant disbelieve you but are you sure he got up also i tell you the truth when i say that i never cared like this before he said all that i know of love is yours you lit it she looked at him mutely inquiring scrutinizing something within her wanted more wanted a conviction that she had not yet got it was as if there was still some closed chamber in her heart that was not yet flooded the tide did not flow freely throughout her and for that moments space she wondered if he too was in the same incomplete stress of emotion if the entire abandonment which she knew she lacked held off from him for a moment only the doubt lasted the next it was enough for her that so much was hers already the unfolding of love was at work on the petals of her girlhood and she did not even desire to hurry the hour of fullblowing that for the present was the apex of the mounting flame in her which made the air round it quiver and glow so that its heat and radiance were beginning to touch with lambency all the common things of every day around her transforming them as by the light of an indian sunset into opalescent brightnesses already to her the sun was of a wider light the wind of may more caressing the fields greener the faces she passed in the street lit with a happiness and a humanity she had never noticed before she saw and heard and apprehended all that touched her senses with a greater vividness the paper she read from to mrs hancock when she rested after her bath had a new significance and as she conned aloud the list of surnames of those who had been born married and diedwhich was the opening chapter of the daily lecture in case her mother knew any of themshe found herself wondering about the history of their loves the most commonplace events filled her with reflections which though delightfully commonplace themselves were utterly new to her as material for thought if the prime minister went to balmoralthe kind of news that was particularly gratifying to mrs hancockedith now was interested in it not from wonderlike her motheras to what they would say to each other but because before the prime minister was a baby in his cradle a man and a woman had looked with eyes of dawning love on each other the whole world was vivified a keener pleasure infused the common actions of life she ate and drank with a new savour she went to sleep with a more luxurious sense of that drowsy gulf and above all she awoke with welcome for the day she joined every morning the ranks of those living and sentient things to whom the knowledge of love had come she was struggling yet the struggle was effortless as if a new force invading her soul did the battle for heron to the level of real existence leaving the desert for fertile lands she read the secret in the eyes and mouths of those she met in the street for they knew it even as did the wind and the sun and the stars that wheeled sometimes she spoke of this new thing to her mother who must be among the initiated and then the wing of comedy shed a feather as it passed mrs hancocks reminiscences of her beautiful days were of the nature of pressed flowers it seemed that their fragrance had departed though they retained their outward form your father was a very handsome young man dear she would sayvery handsome indeed with a rather bluish chin for at that time he had no beard i dont think there can ever have been a more poetical lover and scarcely a day passed when he did not bring me some volume of tennysons early poems or mr brownings edith if you would put the window just an inch more up we can talk thank you dear he could understand all mr browning wrote about different ways of love and explained it most beautifully there was one way of love and another way of love and one of them happened about the middle of june i learned that one by heart in order to please him he used to say the most wonderful of all was by the fireside which was in november but that was after they married oh look dear what a tiresome dog some day it will be run over and it wont be dentons fault your father was very jealous and though i hope you will never give edward any cause for that any more i am sure than i did men are like that sometimes and they dont seem to be able to help it he was quite devoted to me so it sprang from a good cause yes he used to read mr brownings poems though he was very fond of mrs brownings too mr and mrs browning what a lot of poetry they must have read to each otherall made up by themselves i wonder if she understood it as well as your father he never found any difficulty about carrying on the sense between the lines which i think is the hardest part and to think that now you are going through the same happy time darling look it is halfpast three and we must turn at once else we shall never get home in time for tea will you tell denton down the tube to turn as soon as he possibly can when we get home i will let you read the copies of mr brownings poems which your father gave me have you heard from edward this morning when he comes i shall have to talk to him about business this business talk which so far as mrs hancock was concerned followed on the lines which she had laid down for herself in the matter of allowance for edith took place next morning he had suggested the more usual course that their respective solicitors should represent their clients views to each other but mrs hancock preferred a personal and direct interview she felt that edward who was so generous would understand the somewhat peculiar position that she fully intended to take up whereas the more practical and less sympathetic mind of a solicitor might not see things in so romantic a light so edith was informed when it was twenty minutes to eleven and time that she should put her hat on while edward was told that it was quite excusable that he should not want to go to church after sitting in an airless office all the week but it was a little chilly and she asked him to shut completely the window of the sittingroom and now dear edward she said we must have a little business talk which i am sure will soon be done since i am as certain to approve of your plans about edith as you are to approve of mine and then when we have talked it over we can instruct our solicitors and they will draw up the settlement please smoke a cigarette you will be more comfortable so there we are mrs hancock indeed felt perfectly comfortable she had pictured her plans in such delicious grandmotherly colours to herself that they could not fail to touch edwards heart and she proceeded to lay them before him i am what they call fairly off my dear she said and indeed i put by a little every year though as you know to do that i live extremely simply just with the ordinary little comforts of life to which i have been accustomed now at my death every penny of my fortune will go to edith with the exception of two or three little bequests to servants at present it is something over a hundred thousand pounds you and edith will enjoy that for many many years after i am gone mrs hancock felt as if she was making some deed of tremendous generosity the sense of that and the allusion to her own death caused her eyes to stand in moisture which she wiped away with one of her new handkerchiefs which were so expensive but i am beginning at the end she said and we must come back to the present i mean dear edward to give edith the whole of her trousseau i shall be very much vexed with you if you want not to let me have my way about that everything she can want and indeed much more than i ever had in the way of frocks and linen shall be hers and shall be paid for by me put your cigarette in your mouth and dont think of interrupting me she beamed delightedly at him sure that had she not positively forbidden it he would have protested against her munificence munificence too she really thought it when she considered how much lace but that is not my great plan she said i know so well without your telling me that you will shower on edith more than a girl accustomed to the simplicity of life she has hitherto led can possibly dream of spending and so i have thought of a great expense which please god will certainly come upon you and her which you have not i expect taken into consideration children my dear edward i want it to be my pleasure and privilege to provide for them and with careful management i shall be able to give each of your children as they are born the sum of a hundred pounds and on every one of all their birthdays if they live to be a hundred fifty pounds more to mrs hancocks cars this sounded immense it is true that her original plan had been to make the yearly birthday gift a hundred pounds to each of them but in the interval between forming that idea and today she had seen that such a scheme would amount to a lavishness that was positively unreasonable if not actually wrong it is true that it was not exactly likely that she would continue to be in a position to shower this largess on children that were yet unborn for a hundred years after their birth unless she was to outrival the decades of old parr but the sentence sounded well and expressed though hyperbolically the sumptuous extent of her intentions but she had to climb down from those great heights and proceeded to small details take another cigarette edward she said or otherwise you will be arguing with me and as i have quite made up my mind there would be no use in that my dear i am a very determined person when once my mind is made up and i shant listen to your remonstrances so you neednt trouble to make them there i can afford to do this and since i can i am determined to now as regards smaller matters i know you are very well off but i want to spare you any extra expenses that i possibly can and a hundred little schemes occur to me i send myself to sleep at night with thinking what i can take on my shoulders for i assure you it is the little drains on ones purse that make the big hole in it so in the first place let me tell you that your motor bills for tyres and petrol neednt be a penny more after your marriage than they are today i intend that edithand i shall tell her soshall consider my car as hers in exactly the same manner as she has always considered it ours shall we say morning and afternoon whenever she feels inclined she can have her drive with me on my tyres and on my petrol you will be sure when you are away in the city that your car wont be scouring all over the country eating up every penny you make there is a psychical phenomenon known as suggestion whereby the operator produces a hypnotic effect on his subject causing his mind to receive and adopt the desired attitude for the moment at any rate mrs hancock was producing this effect on edward her own sublime conviction that she was making the most generous provision infected him as she reeled off this string of benefits but there are subtle conditions under which suggestion acts which perhaps she did not appreciate for at this point the effect began to wear off probably she should have stopped there unfortunately she continued it may be that she began to see through herself and thus enabled her subject to see through her household books too she said you have no conception nor has edithfor it takes years of careful housekeeping to understand all about ityou have no conception what economies can be made in them nor if you do not practise them what a tremendous drain they are let us say that edith is alone for lunch while you are in the city and she orders a fillet of sole and a cutlet with some french beans and a little cherry tart and perhaps a peach to finish up with for dear edith has such an excellent appetite i am glad to say and is not like so many women who when they are alone have a sandwich on a tray or a piece of cake and find themselves getting anaemic and run down in consequence edith as i was saying orders a decent little lunch like what she is accustomed to every day like that when she is alone and at the end of the week i shouldnt wonder if her lunches had cost her twentyfive or thirty shillings well i want to spare you all that expense there will be lunch for edith every day at my house so that all the household books for your purse will be a couple of poached eggs in the morning and a plain little dinner in the evening if you want to be alone with her otherwise you can both find your dinner and such a warm welcome my dear as often as you like where she had her lunch and even if it costs me another gardener i am determined to have my croquetlawn as good as a croquetlawn can be and you can come across and play on it and have your cup of tea or your whisky and soda with me any day you like i mean to turn my house into a hotel for you and my darling where you will ask for whatever you like motors and what not and never have a bill sent in to you everything provided edward all the year round and the warmest welcome from the old proprietress there i dont think i can say more than that and i certainly dont mean less about wedding presents i shall say nothing because i mean them to be a surprise but the suggestive glamour had faded and edward found himself adding up in a clearsighted and businesslike manner what this all amounted to immediately the result seemed to be that mrs hancock would have ediths companionship at lunch and in her drives and that he could play croquet next door edith the day before had alluded to her mothers childlike pleasure in her plans but it seemed to him that a certain power of parsimonious calculation presided over their childlikeness and it was not without a sense of surprise and almost of incredulity that he made the inference that mrs hancock had no intention of giving her daughter any allowance or of settling anything on her for himself he could not by any stretch of malignant criticism be called niggardly or closehanded and he felt justified in making quite sure of the unlookedfor situation then you do not propose to settle anything on edith he said or make her any allowance he knew that this was a perfectly proper suggestion to make that the absence of any provision for edith was ludicrous yet the moment he had made the suggestion he was sorry he understood also what edith had meant by childlikeness for mrs hancocks face changed suddenly from its beaming and delighted aspect and looked pathetic hurt misunderstood it was clear that she had taken the sincerest pleasure in devising all these dazzling plans which at present anyhow cost her nothing and in avoiding any direct expenditure she had quite certainly convinced herself of her own generosity and of the unselfish thought and ingenuitywhich caused her to lie awake at nightthat had devised those schemes but this miserliness the ingenuity of which was so perfectly transparent to anybody else was not he felt convinced transparent to her hurriedly he corrected himself it was as if he had unthinkingly taken a toy away from a child now he made the utmost haste to restore it to anticipate the howl in preparation for which it had opened its mouth how stupid of me he said i had quite forgotten in the multitude of your gifts that you were providing with such generosity for our children of course you do that instead of giving money to edith i think that is a delightful plan why they will all be heirs and heiresses by the time they grow up and the lunches and drives for edith too she will never be lonely while i am away in town and the croquet and everything i never heard so many nice plans he knew he was being weak was yielding on points on which he really had no business to yield in order to avoid a scene it was quite ridiculousand he was aware of that factto treat this middleaged and wideawake woman as if she was a child to give her anything to prevent her howling but the morality of the matter did not trouble him at all she was like a child he saw the resemblance but no less striking was the resemblance to a selfish child or to a very miserly grownup person he did not really doubt that some part of her brain carefully walled up and sequestered knew that she was acting in a thoroughly miserly manner but she entirely refused to attend to that treating it as we treat some involuntary suggestion of a disobedient mind putting it from her even as she put away secular reflections when in church and indulging instead and painting in tender but vivid colours the image of the beloved old grannynot so old eitherincessantly signing the most sumptuous cheques for the benefit of her beloved chicks or looking from the drawingroom window on to the velvetnapped croquetlawn where edward stood with brimming whisky and soda while edith a child tugging at her skirts went through hoop after hoop she loved to see everybody happy round her all enjoying the fruits of her bounty and if incidentally she herself gained a companion in her daily drives at any rate edith would not sit solitary over her expensive lunch while edward was in town and if in reality she was a somewhat selfish person and one somewhat insincere how much more comfortable that she should think that she was brimming with kind plans for other people when as a matter of fact she was only making the most pleasing schemes for herself it was not possible entirely to agree with her in her estimate of herself but there was certainly no use in distressing her by letting her know that he saw through her she had hypnotized herselfby excessive gazinginto her creed about herself and any dissension from it was only likely to make her think that the dissentient was unkind not shake her belief in her own tender benevolence she started from that even as euclid starts his amazing propositions from certain postulates if you did not accept the postulates you could not proceed any further in her company normal human vanity renders complete selfknowledge impossible but complete selfblindness is almost equally uncommon and at the very back of her mind mrs hancock knew very well that she was acting in a manner which if occurring in anybody else she would have unhesitatingly labelled mean but she never indulged in such thoughts about herself she turned a deliberate back upon them for they were rankly inconsistent with the spirit of cheerful selfishness which was the key to her character she shut the door on them as she shut it on tales of misery and crime ignoring and if necessary denying their existence and if it was easy to spoil her childlike pleasures it was easy also to restore them in all their integrity and edwards assurance that he had never heard so many nice plans was amply sufficient for her again her wellfavoured face beamed with delighted smiles i thought you would like them she said shutting the door not only on her knowledge of her meanness but on his also and you have no idea what a pleasure it was to me to make them so since you approve we will regard my share of the arrangements as settled and now for your part i am certain i shall be as satisfied with what you intend to do as you are with my intentions but before we go on you must tell me what i have to do must i have a deed drawn up is it a deed they call it he was careful not to spoil pleasure this time i think that is scarcely necessary he said you see you areare making no settlements on edith you have promised to do certain things for our children but for the present anyhow she interrupted i see she said but you must be certain to tell me whenever it is necessary for me to have a deed drawn up i shall be always ready to do it and to thank you for reminding me well then she settled herself in her chair with an air of pleased expectation and it must be confessed a secret gratification that she had not got to put her name to anything at all i shall draw up a will he said settling the whole of my property on edith in trust for her children if she has any and if not for her use during her lifetime in other words she will enjoy the interest on my money though the property itself will be in the hands of trustees it amounts at present to about thirty thousand pounds edward paused for it was clear that mrs hancock was pondering some point let me thoroughly understand she said in case of your death edward without children though it really is quite horrid to think about such a thing if she wanted to build herself a little house shall we say would she not be able to put her hand on three or four thousand pounds no she would have the income from my money for life mrs hancock was almost as eager to secure financial advantages for edith as she was to retain her own herselfalmost not quite but she would find it difficult to live in a suitable house the sort of house to which she has been accustomed on the interest of thirty thousand pounds said she do you think so it means about fifteen hundred a year yes i know my dear a very nice pleasant little income but you must think what she has been accustomed to for i must say that though as you know i live very simply yet i have never grudged edith anything think if she was ill a long illness is so terribly expensive would it not be better to insure your life and settle that on her so that she could have a little fund for a rainy day i know my husband insured his life long before he married me edward stiffened a little i think then she might look to you for assistance he said ah how pleased i should be to make any economies for her sake she said with feeling but what if i am no longer here to help her in that case she will have all your money in her complete command he remarked this was undoubtedly the case and it was not possible to pursue that particular line of grabbing any further she smiled at him not quite so tenderly my dear how sharp the city makes you business men she observed heathmoor seemed to have done pretty well in that line for her but he did not draw attention to that i dont think i feel inclined to make any further provision over that he said edith is coming to me i must remind you quite portionless a sudden resentment at her attitude seized him or how would it be if you and i both insured our lives for let us say ten thousand pounds he suggested and settled it on her mrs hancock became dignified at my death she said she already comes into a considerable fortune very well i quite agree with you that no further provision is necessary mrs hancock had not much liked the reminder that edith came portionless to him and did not want that section of the argumentfor it really was becoming an argumentpursued further she retreated into her stronghold of satisfaction again and now about the allowance you will make her she asked genially i was proposing to give her two hundred and fifty a year for her private and personal expenses he said mrs hancocks smile completely faded yes she said yes i gather from your tone that you are not satisfied said he there was a short rather unpleasant pause then she assumed an air of confiding candour i did expect dear edward she said that you would make a rather larger allowance than that for her it is no use my denying it and would you mind not smoking another cigarette just yet the air is getting quite thick now just as you have told me quite frankly what you think of my provision for edith so i will tell you there is nothing like a perfectly frank talk for getting over difficulties all her life dear edith has had a very handsome allowance from me with really nothing to spend it on except a dress or a pair of boots i dont deny that i have often stinted myself so as not to stint her but what her mother has done that i think her husband should do i dont think you consider how many more calls a married woman has on her purse than a girl living at homeall the running up to london to get household necessities for you all the greater expenditure on dress that a married woman must make beyond what a girl requires indeed i dont see how edith can manage it on the sum you mention edwards sympathy with mrs hancocks childlike pleasure evaporated he did not believe for a moment that the very handsome allowance given her by her mother amounted to anything like the sum he proposed he knew also that the sum he proposed was a very reasonable one if you would tell me how much she has hitherto spent he said i should have some guide this mrs hancock did not in the least wish to do i do not mean to say that dear edith is extravagant said she but there is a great deal of difference between extravagance and counting every penny there has been no need for her to do that she is not accustomed to it it was impossible for him to ask her point blank what ediths allowance had been it was impossible also to ask the girl herself he could not do such things they were contrary to his average politeness of behaviour it is true that when i settled to give edith this allowance he said i supposed that you would also give her something i did not know what your intentions might be mrs hancock brightened but you do now dear edward she said and you said you quite appreciate them dear me what was the expression you used which warmed my heart so oh yes you had never heard so many nice plans i am going to provideand i assure you the more it costs me the better shall i be pleasedfor your children when i give edith oh so gaily into your care that shall be my part you were pleased with that i dare say it had never occurred to you and you thought it very likely that i should give edith a hundred or a hundred and fifty a year so that she would have three hundred and fifty or four hundred pounds of her own a year then indeed she would be well off she would be as comfortable as she had ever been suddenly the intolerable sordidness of the discussion struck him justly he told himself that it was none of his making but he could at any rate decline to let it continue he did not hug himself over his generosity for he knew that in his comfortable circumstances it made no real difference whether he gave edith four hundred a year or not merely he could not possibly go on bargaining and disputing he got up she shall have four hundred a year he said mrs hancock gave a little cry of delight exactly what i thought that your generosity would insist on giving her she said it is nice to find how well we agree i was sure we should and what a delicious sunny morning book two chapter vi elizabeth enters elizabeth was sitting with her cousin in the gardenhouse at the end of the croquetlawn waiting for the sound of the gong which should announce to her that the motor was round to take her for a drive with aunt julia she had arrived the evening before after spending a week at paris with some relations of her mother and had at mrs hancocks special desire breakfasted in her room that morning this being the correct aftercure for any journey that implied a night in the train or a crossing of the channel for had mrs hancock started at midday from calais and come to her journeys end at dover she would certainly have had breakfast in her room next day elizabeth as a matter of fact feeling extremely vigorous when she woke this morning at six had let herself discreetly out of the house and much enjoyed a two hours ramble returning in time to steal back unobserved to her room where she ate her breakfast with remarkable heartiness at nine soon after she had come out with edith while her aunt read small paragraphs in the paper and saw the cook the usual schedule for the day had been altered so that elizabeth might have a good long drive that morning and the motor had been ordered for halfpast eleven instead of twelve she could then get a good long rest in the afternoon which should complete the journeycure inaugurated by breakfasting in bed but this dislocation of hours had proved too serious to face and lind had come out half an hour ago to say that if it suited miss elizabeth equally well the car would come round at twelveor a few minutes beforeas usual elizabeth as has previously been mentioned had not looked forward to this summer in england with her aunt nor had she considered that the wellremembered comfort of the house was an advantage but on this glittering summer morning after the dust of trains and the roar of towns she found herself in a singularly contented amused and eager frame of mind there was for the present a charm for her in the warm airy house the exquisitely kept garden the cheerful serenity of her aunt as is the way of youth she delighted in new impressions and she found that in her two years absence from england for she had spent the last summer in the hills she had forgotten the aroma of home life she was recording those new impressions to edith with remarkable volubility but the most beautiful bath she said all white tiles and roses at the window and silver handles for everything you should see our indian bathroom edith there is a horrible little brown shed opening from your bedroom and a large tin pan in a corner and if you are lucky a tap for the water usually you are unlucky and there are only tin jugs of water in the hot weather the first thing you have to do is to look carefully about to see that a cobra hasnt come to share it with you then there are no bells nobody knows why but there arent and if you want your ayah you shout if she doesnt want to come she doesnt appear for a quarter of an hour or so and explains that she didnt hear you shout then how did she know you shouted said edith brightly that is what you ask her and she explains at such length that you wish you were dead oh look at the grassreal grass and theres still dew on it in the shadow i long to take off my shoes and stockings and walk about on it may i oh elizabeth i think not said edith slightly alarmed ellis would think it so odd ellis oh the gardener he looks like a clergyman with his sidewhiskers but does it matter much what he thinks servants must think such a lot of awful things about us however i dont mind i wanted my bath tremendously this morning if youll promise not to tell because it wasnt exactly what aunt julia meant you see she thought i was tired and really i wasnt so i got up at six and had a delicious ramble i went on to a quiet common covered with heath and there was nobody there but a sort of lunatic with a butterfly net running madly about he caught his foot in a root of heather and fell flat down at my feet of course i howled with laughter mr beaumont remarked edith in a tone of inspiration so he told me because we sat and talked after that i rather liked him and he gave me a cigarette a cigarette asked edith you dont mean elizabeth laughed oh dear have i done anything improper she asked but anyhow ellis wasnt there he is rather mad i suppose isnt hemr beaumont i mean then while we were sitting there an awful woman came along the path like a witch in spectacles and the most enormous boots i ever saw yes said edith rather apprehensively you would never guess it was his sister after i had said she was like a witch then she became like a policeman and took him in charge and i was left smoking my cigarette all alone the heather smelt so good better than the cigarette but everything smells good in england and reminds you of being clean and happy and cool but oh edith the indian smell the old tired wicked smell theres always a little bit of it smouldering in my heart like a jossstick its made of incense and hot sand and brown naked people and the filth of the streets and the watercart its savage and eternal and it reeks ofit doesnt matter oh look ellis is brushing the grasss hair docs he comb it as well edith had but little chance of saying anything at all while these remarkable statements were being poured out by her cousin but as a matter of fact she was well content to listen two years ago when she had seen elizabeth last the latter was a tall thin sallow girl with bursts of high spirits and long intervals of languid silences and now with the strength of two years added and the flow of her adolescent womanhood tingling in her veins she was a very different creature her sallow face was tinged with warm blood giving her the warm brown complexion that goes with black hair and soft dark eyes it was as impossible not to feel the kindly effect of her superb vitality as to be insensible to the glow of a frostyburning fire she was taut and poised and full of vigour as a curled spring of steel or the strained wings of a hovering hawk with the immobile balance that implies so intense an energy edith with a rather unaccustomed flight of imagination compared herself to a sparrow hopping cheerfully about a lawn with a nest in the ivy and an appetite for breadcrumbs but apparently the sparrow had to chirrup and now i want to hear all sorts of things edith she said tell me about mr beaumont and the witch and who lives next door on that side and on that on that sideand she pointed with her long brown handi saw a roundabout little woman like a cook sitting on a bench and reading the paper was it the cook was she looking in the advertisements for another place i wondered no mrs dobbs said edith shes a friend of mothers and mine tell me about her what does she think about it had never occurred to edith to conjecture what mrs dobbs thought about you did not connect mrs dobbs with the idea of thought she is very fond of dogs said edith i saw them too curled and brushed i expect she blacks the ends of their noses like horses hoofs i dont call them dogs but what does she think about if she lies awake at night what you think about lying awake is what you really think about perhaps she doesnt lie awake well leave her i dont seem to be interested in her who lives there mr holroyd whom aunt julia said was coming to dinner tonight she called him edwarddear edward i thinkand i am sure she was going to tell me something about him when the old manlind isnt itcame in to say mrs williams was waiting so i came out here tell me about edward is he a relation shall i call him edward elizabeth gave one glance at ediths face stopped suddenly and clapped her hands i guess i guess she said he isnt a relation but he is going to be edith my dear how exciting i want to hear all about him instantly she stopped again i think he must have come out of his front gate in rather a hurry at nine oclock she said is he rather tall and cleanshaven with the look that some people have as if he had washed twice at least that morning also he was whistling schumanns first novelette very loud and quite out of tune i thought that was rather nice of him and i whistled too out of my bedroom window i had to i couldnt help it of course i didnt let him see me and he stopped and looked up at the sky to see where it came from my dear tell me all about edward instantly edith gasped in the grip of this genial whirlwind of a girl you are quite right elizabeth she said andand theres nobody like him i should have come up to talk to you last night but mother said you would be tired how did you guess it was quick of you elizabeth laughed not very dear she said you looked as ifas if you were in church and as you werent it was obvious you were in love mr holroydyou said it like that like an amen my dear what fun but i do hope hes good enough for you and attractive enough a man has to be so tremendously attractive to make up for being a man at all with their tufts of hair all over their faces of course i shall never marry at all i shalloh dear ive begun to talk about myself and really im not the least interested in myself tell me straight off all about cousin edward this was a task of which edith was hopelessly incapable she could no more talk about him than she could talk about religion reticent at all times on this subject her inability to speak amounted almost to dumbness her thoughts unable not to hover round him were equally unable to alight to be put into words the very thought of speaking of him embarrassed her quick said elizabeth putting her arm round her i cant i cant say anything about him except that he is he you must see for yourself but oh elizabeth fancy his wanting me and fancy that when he asked me first i didnt really care but very soon i began to care and now i care for him more than anything if i go on like this i shall begin not to care about anybody else oh there is the gong that is for the motor you must go but in the interval i think you are a dear i care for you edith got up hearing the sonorous chinese music but elizabeth pulled her back to her seat again surely the motor can wait five minutes she said we are beginning to know each other but mother doesnt like waiting said edith nor does daddy but he very often has got to what do you and cousin edward talk about i shall call him cousin edward at once i think to show him that i know or is that forward and tropical of me lind approached swiftly across the grass mrs hancock is waiting miss he said to elizabeth she thinks you cant have heard the gong out here elizabeth gave him a ravishing smile oh i heard it beautifully she said say im coming i think mrs hancock expects you at once miss said lind quite unsoftened and continuing to stand firmly there until elizabeth should move under these circumstances it was impossible to continue anything resembling an intimate conversation and elizabeth rose just as mrs hancock herself came out on to the gravel walk below the drawingroom window she had been waiting at least three minutesa thing to which she was wholly unaccustomed except when going by train then for the sake of the corner seat facing the engine she cheerfully waited twenty elizabeth was quite unconscious of any severity of scrutiny on the part of her aunt as she ran across the lawn and jumped over a flowerbed nor did she detect the slightest intention of sarcasm in mrs hancocks greeting arc you nearly ready elizabeth she asked if so the car has been waiting some time im quite ready aunt julia she said and i am so looking forward to my drive the usual detailed discussion was gone through with denton as to their exact route and mrs hancock put her feet up on the footstool that had been bought for the journey to bath now were off she said and if you would put down your window two more holes dear or perhaps three we shall be quite comfortable you look quite rested thats what comes of stopping in your room for breakfast and if you get a good long rest again this afternoon while edith and i are out ive no doubt youll be quite brisk this evening mr holroyd is coming to dinner and youll hear him play that will be quite a treat for you as you are so fond of music and now i want to tell you elizabeth interrupted her aunt to this also she was unaccustomed i think i know she said do you mean about mr holroyd edith told me but she didnt seem able to describe him at all do tell me about him is he good enough for her i think shes a dear edward is a young man in a thousand began mrs hancock yes but is he the right young man in a thousand i hope hes rich too though of course that doesnt matter so much for edith aunt julia what a lovely car may i drive it some day would your chauffeur lend me his cap and coat i used often to drive daddy till one day when i went into a ditch it was so funny one door was jammed of course against the side of the ditch and we couldnt open the other mamma was inside we thought we should have to feed her through the window but daddy said afterwards that it wasnt entirely my fault may i drive now or perhaps i had better learn about the car first and now about cousin edward mrs hancock had received several shocks during this hurricane speech and she had to collect herself a little before she could reply but before she could reply elizabeth was away again oh here we are on that nice heath she said it did smell so good oh aunt julia i think i had better confess i couldnt stop in bed this morning though it was nice of you to want me to get rested and i went for a walk about six my dear all alone some of the time i met a man whom i thought was a lunatic with a butterfly net but edith says it was mr beaumont he fell down so we talked and his sister came out of a wood oh i believe that is he again coming along the road towards us now but my dear what odd conduct on your part was it it seemed the only thing to do had i better bow to him aunt julia mrs hancock felt slightly bewildered by so puzzling a question of etiquette as that involved by a girl conversing with a total strangerparticularly when that stranger turned out to be mr beaumontat six oclock in the morning prudence prevailed we will both look at the view out of the sidewindow she said and mr beaumont encountered a pair of profiles but mr beaumont and his butterfly net being left behind mrs hancock thought well to take advantage of the opportunity for a few general remarks already she had been kept waiting been interrupted and been faced with this problem arising from quite unheardof conduct on elizabeths part and as a gentian thrusts blossoms through the snow so at the base of her cordiality of tone lay a frozen rigidity as her custom was when she wanted to say something of the correcting and improving nature she laid her hand softlythen squeezedon elizabeths this was symbolical of the affectionate nature of her intention i cant tell you dear elizabeth she said how i have been looking forward to your coming here and i am quite certain we shall have the happiest summer together and i hope you wont find the manners and customs expected of a young lady in england very strange though i know they are so different to what is quite right and proper in india with all its deserts and black people most interesting it all must be and i am greatly looking forward to hearing about it all and im sure when you tell me i shall want to go to india myself but here for instance dear edith would never dream of taking a walk at six oclock in the morning all alone when there might be all kinds of people about or talking to strangers or thinking even of driving a motorcar my dear if you would reach down that tube and blow through it and then say to the right please denton he will take us a very pleasant round and we shall get back ten minutes before lunch and have time to rest and cool had we started a few minutes sooner when the car came round we should have had time to go a long round past a very pretty mill which i wanted to show you as it is we will take a shorter round there was all mrs hancocks quiet masterfulness in these agreeable remarks all the leaden imperturbability which formed so large a factor in the phenomenon of her getting her own way in her own manner and of everybody else doing in the long run what she wished until they were reduced to the state of abject vassalage in which her immediate circle found themselves the effect it produced on elizabeth though not complete was material im afraid that it was my fault we didnt start punctually aunt julia she said but couldnt we go round by the mill all the same and be a little late for lunch mrs hancock laughed and make other people unpunctual as well she said no my dear when anybody has been unpunctuali am never unpunctual myselfmy rule is to get back to punctuality as soon as possible and start fair again we will go to the mill another day for i hope we shall have plenty of drives together about mr beaumont i hardly know what to do if only you naughty girl you had not got up but stayed quietly in bed as i meant you to do it would never have happened i think the best plan will be for me to ask him to lunch with us and then introduce you quite fresh so that he will see that we all mean to forget about your meeting on the heath look here are the golf links very likely we shall see mr martin playing he is our clergyman and we are most lucky to have him yes upon my word there he is now he sees my car and is waving his cap well that was a coincidence meeting him for now you will recognize him again when you see him in his surplice and hood in church tomorrow morning dear me it is the first sunday in the month and there will be the communion after morning service mr martin never calls it matins he says that is a roman catholic name how quickly the sundays come round elizabeth looked out of the window at the celebrated mr martin and saw that here was an opportunity for saying what she felt she must say to her aunt before sunday morning the talk she had had with her father on the reality of religious beliefs to her had been renewed before she left india and with his consent she had made up her mind not to go to church while the reason for so doing remained inconclusive to her to attend public worship seemed to her a symbolical act an outward sign of something that in truth was nonexistent it was like a red socialist joining in the national anthem but she had promised himand indeed the promise was one with the desire of her heartto pray not to let neglect cement her want of conviction aunt julia she said i want to tell you something it is that i dont want to go to church itit doesnt mean anything to me oh im afraid you are shocked it seemed a justifiable apprehension elizabeth said mrs hancock how can you say such wicked things this roused the girl they are not wicked she said hotly it is very cruel of you to say so i had a long talk two talks with daddy about it he agrees with me he was very sorry but he agrees it is hard to convey exactly the impression made on mrs hancocks mind if elizabeth had confessed to a systematic course of burglary or murder she would not have been more shocked nor would she have been more shocked if her niece had announced her intention of appearing at dinner without shoes and stockings the conventional outrage in fact was about as distressing to her as the moral one she knew of course perfectly well that even in wellregulated heathmoor certain most respectable inhabitants who often sat at her table were accustomed to spend sunday morning on the golflinks instead of at public worship but she never for a moment thought of classing them with elizabeth she could not have explained that it was merely matter of common knowledge that grownup men did not seem to need to go to church so much similarly it was right for them to smoke strong cigars after dinner whereas the fact that elizabeth had consumed one of mr beaumonts cigarettes had she been cognizant of that appalling occurrence would have seemed to her an almost inconceivable breach of decency girls went to church and did not smoke here was the statement of two very simple fundamental things i hardly know what to say to you she said talking to mr beaumont is nothing to this i must ask you to be silent for a little while elizabeth while i collect my thoughts and on our first drive too which i hoped we should enjoy so much although your being late made it impossible for us to go round by the mill as i had planned the poor ladys pleasure was quite spoiled and not being accustomed to arrange her thoughts in any order except when she was forming careful plans for her own comfort she found the collection of them which she desired difficult of attainment but very quickly she began to see that her own comfort was seriously involved and that gave her a startingpoint it would be known by now throughout heathmoor that her niece from india had come to stay with her for the summer and it would be seen that no niece sat with her in the pew just below the pulpit almost all the seats in the church faced eastwards this with one or two others ran at right angles to them and was thus in full view of the congregation it followed that unless she explained elizabeths absence sunday by sunday when there was always a general chatexcept on the first sunday of the monthat the gate into the churchyard by a cold or some other nonexistent complaint and this was really not to be thought of her circle of friends would necessarily come to the most shocking conclusion as to elizabeths nonappearance certainly mr martin would notice it and it would be his duty to inquire into it that would be most uncomfortable and if inquiries were made of her she could not imagine herself giving either the real reason or a false one no doubt if mr martin talked to elizabeth he could soon awake in her that sense of religious security of soothed confident trusta trust as complete as that with which any sane person awaited the rising of the sun in the morning which to mrs hancock connoted christianity but that he should talk to her implied that he must know what ailed her and in any case the rest of heathmoor would notice elizabeths absence from church it was all very dreadful and puzzling and was no doubt the result of a prolonged sojourn in india where heathens in spite of all those missions to which she did not subscribe were still in such numerical preponderance but the cause of elizabeths proposed absence did not in reality so greatly trouble her what spoiled her pleasure in any case was the uncomfortableness of the situation if elizabeth was seen to be consistently absent from the eleven oclock service then the light began to break and conventional arguments flocked to the assistance of her beleaguered conventionality i am so shocked and distressed dear she said though you will tell me i dare say that there is little good in that and on this lovely morning too but of the reason for your not going to church i will not speak now i am thinking of the effect every one knows that you are here with me and unless i am to say you are unwell every sunday morning what am i to say and indeed i could not bring myself to say you are unwell and keep on repeating it of course we all say not at home when it is not convenient to receive callers but on a subject like this it would be out of the question there is mr beaumont again we seem always to be meeting him and the servants too lind and denton and filson will all certainly know you dont go to church and mrs williams who cant go though i am sure she would if her duties allowed her to will be certain to hear you moving about from the kitchen they will talk among themselves and say how odd it is it will offend them dear and you know what is said about giving offence i am sure you did not think of thatmrs hancock had only just thought of itor consider what effect your absence would have i assure you that often and often i have felt inclined not to go on sunday morning and should much prefer when it is wet to read the psalms and lessons at home even then lind and filson and the others would know that it was only the weather that prevented me and they would see the prayerbooks and bibles lying about elizabeth again interrupted you neednt say any more aunt julia she said certainly i will go to church on sunday it seems to me that it would be an offence against your hospitality for me to refuse it is part of the routine is it not a rule of the house on those grounds i will go will that satisfy you mrs hancock found that all that had shocked and distressed her was sensibly ameliorated the feelings of lind and filson would be spared and the chat at the churchyard gate would be as cheerful as usual she beamed on her niece i knew you would see it in the right light if it was put to you she said and with regard to your reasons for not wanting to go would you like to talk to mr martin about it he is so wise anyhow you will hear him preach and i cannot imagine any one hearing mr martin preach without feeling the absolute truth of what he says but that we will talk of another time dear me we are back at the golf links again we have made a loop you see and if that isnt mr martin going into the clubhouse fancy seeing him twice in a morning well we have had a nice drive after all and when we get in you must remind me to give you a volume of sermons by your grandfather in which he tells about his own doubts when he was a young man and how he fought and overcame them it is all so beautifully put and after that he never had any more doubts at all and we shall get back ten minutes before luncheontime which is just what i like to do edward was the only guest that evening and during dinner elizabeth found herself observing him somewhat closely and coming to no conclusions whatever about him certainly he was goodlooking he was wellbred and quiet of voice but she found nothing in him to distinguish him from the host nothing that to her could account for the lighting up of ediths face when she looked at him he had a couple of stock exchange jokes to repeat one of which made mrs hancock call him naughty and the subjects of perennial interest such as the weather and the trainserviceit appeared that the directors were going to cut off the vexing three minutes in the evening train from towntook their turns with the hardy annuals such as the forthcoming croquet tournament and the ripening strawberry crop new plays going on in town the criticisms of which mrs hancock had read in the morning post followed and the muchdebated action of the censor in refusing to license the biblical drama called david infused a tinge of extra vividness in discussion and mrs hancock exhibited considerable ingenuity in avoiding the word bathsheba mr beaumont was talking to me about it the other day she said and he said his cousin who is in the lord chamberlains office told him that there was no question about its having the licence refused there were episodes quite unfit for the stage everybody looked regretfully at the dessert i am very glad it was stopped continued mrs hancock i feel so uncomfortable at the theatre if i think there is something coming which isnt quite but we have it all read in the lessons in church dont we aunt julia asked elizabeth yes my dear but what is suitable to read is often not suitable for the stage for my part even if they do give parsifal in town i shall not think of going to it but that is not quite parallel to david and bathsheba said elizabeth straight out lind was at her elbow too with the savoury and do come in tomorrow afternoon edward said mrs hancock with extraordinary presence of mind and play these two young ladies at croquet smoking of course was not allowed in mrs hancocks drawingroom and edward was firmly shut into the diningroom with the injunction not to stop there long no word was said regarding elizabeths awful lapse nor did any silence reproach her the one swift change of subject at the moment of the crisis had called sufficient attention to it the table with patience cards was set ready and mrs hancock over her coffee got instantly occupied and superficially absorbed in her game before long edward as commanded reunited himself and now give us our usual treat dear edward said mrs hancock building busily from the king downwards in alternate colours and play us something that beautiful piece by schumann now where it keeps coming in again from this indication edward was quick enough to conjecture the first of the noveletten and opened the steinway grand covered with a piece of italian embroidery on which stood a lamp two vases of flowers and four photograph frames edith moved round to the other side of the cardtable where she could see the player elizabeth with a flash of delighted anticipation shifted round in her chair and put down the evening paper she adored the piece which kept coming in again and knowing it well herself felt the musicians intense pleasure at the idea of hearing what somebody else thought about it somewhat to her surprise edward put the music in front of him more to her surprise he did not show the slightest intention of moving the lamp the vase of flowers or the photograph frames then he began with the loud pedal down as the composer ordered and elizabeth listened amazed to an awful a conscientious a correct performance never were there so many right notes played with so graceless a result no one could have imagined there was so much wood in the whole human system as edward contrived to concentrate into his ten fingers those fingers which elizabeth noticed looked so slender and athletic and for all purposes of striking notes properly were as efficient as a row of wooden pegs he made the piano bellow he made it shriek he made it rattle and when he played with less force he made it emit squeaks and little hollow gasps as for phrasing there was of course none at all each chord was played as written each sequence that made up the phrase played with laborious and precise punctuality to any one of musical mind the result was of the most excruciating nature or would have been had not the entire performance been so extremely funny as a parody of how some quite accomplished but unsympathetic pianist performed the novelette it was beyond all praise elizabeth rocked with noiseless laughter so much for the sound and then elizabeth looking at his face in the twilight of the shaded lamp saw that in it was all that his hands lacked the features that at dinner when she somewhat studied him had appeared so meaninglessly goodlooking were irradiated transfigured he heard all that his fingers could not make others hear his eyes saw and danced with seeing all the abounding grace and colour that lay in the melodies his hands were incapable of rendering then in three inflexible leaps as if a wooden marionette jumping down from platform to platform of rock the piece came to an end edith gave a great sigh oh its splendid she said mrs hancock triumphantly put the knave of hearts on to the queen of clubs thank you edward she said i like it where it comes in again there i believe its going to come out he faced round on his musicstool to receive their compliments his eyes still glowing and met elizabeths look perception flashed between the two wordless and infallible he knew for certain that she knew knew all the exultant music meant to him knew all the entire incompetence of his rendering he got up and went to her you play dont you he said speaking rather low cant you take the taste of that out of our mouths elizabeth almost laughed for pleasure at the complete understanding so instantaneously established between them yes what shall i play she asked if only you happened to know that first novelette he said she raised her eyebrows shall i really she said i think i know it and wont you give us that other delicious one said mrs hancock plastering the cards down the one i like next best which is sad in the middle elizabeth did not answer but went straight over to the piano he had shut the book from which he played and she did not open it for though she suspected she might not be noteperfect she intended to play not to practise mrs hancock absorbed in the patience that really was coming out did not notice that she had no reply to her question and the click of her triumphant sequence of cards continued edith who had not heard what had passed between the two remembered that elizabeth was fond of music but felt surprised and slightly nervous at the thought that she should think of playing when the echoes of that reverberating performance still lingered in the air but neither elizabeth nor edward seemed to heed her elizabeth sat down then halfrose again and gave a twirl to the musicstool then she paused for a moment with her hands before her face and without any preliminary excursions plunged straight into the first novelette again and all that had been in edwards brain all that could not communicate itself to his hands streamed from her firm soft fingertips the images imprisoned in his brain broke out and peopled the room with colour and with fire banners waved and a throng of laughing youths passed jeweldecked in wonderful processions down a street of noble palaces at every corner fresh members joined them for on this joyful morning the whole world of those spiritpresences kept festival and whether they sang or not or whether the marching melody was but the sound of joy he knew not innumerable as the laughter of the sea they glittered along until by some wonderful transformation they were the waves on a spring morning and over them a song floated or were they a field of daffodils and over them the scent of their blossoming hovered from the sunlight they passed into a clear blue shadow and out of it as out of waters came the strain from shadow into sunlight again they passed and from sunlight into waves with singing seabirds flashing whitewinged over them once more sun and banners and in the sunlight a fountain of water aspired where under his hands the wooden doll had tumbled from rock to rock bouquets of rainbowed water fell from basin to basin of crystal and that was the first novelette mrs hancock had noticed the change of performer though not at first for it only occurred to her that edward was playing the same piece over again but it struck her very soon that he was not keeping the time with such precision as usual and the moment afterwards that this was altogether different from the tune that kept coming in again as rendered before then looking up she saw it was elizabeth at the piano and there followed a couple of obviously wrong notes how foolish and forward of this girl to play after edward to play his piece too and make mistakes in it and when the tune came in again she didnt put half the force into it that edward did certainly she had not edwards touch nor his masculine power that stamped out the time with such vigour her natural geniality prevented her saying or even hinting at any of these things and she was extremely encouraging thank you elizabeth she said what a coincidence that you should be learning one of edwards tunes now you have heard it played havent you i am sure you will get it right in time you must play it to edward again next week when you have practised and he will see how you have got on ah do play it again to me next week said he or before next week and now edward said mrs hancock do let us have the tune that gets sad in the middle he turned to her with face that music still vivified after that all my tunes would be sad he saidbeginning middle and end but wont miss fanshawe play again mrs hancock thought that charming of him it was so tactful to make elizabeth think she had played well poor elizabeth with her wrong notes that any one with an ear could detect as a matter of fact she did not care one particle who played or if anybody played so long as her patience came out she perceived nothing of the situation guessed nothing about the fire from the girls fingers which tingled in his brain but edith saw more she saw at any rate that something in elizabeths playing had enormously pleased and excited her lover and he had said that it was surely she herself who lay behind melody she whom he sought she went to elizabeth and gently pushed her back on to the musicstool do play again dear she said it gives us such pleasure elizabeth as her father knew was conscious of little else than her german johnnies when there was singing in her brain and she sat down at once do you know this she said quite short she touched the keys once and then again as if to test the lightness of her fingers and then broke into the twelfth etude of chopin letting the piano whispera privilege so seldom accorded to that belaboured instrument even mrs hancock responded to it and laid down her cards and spoke what a delicious tune my dear she said tumtiti tumtiti the tune was still hovering and poised elizabeth put her hands firmly down on a suspension and stopped but what an abrupt end said mrs hancock yes said elizabeth turning round on the stool when mrs hancock had had enough patience and conversation she secretly rang an electric bell which was fixed to the underside of her cardtable upon which lind brought in a tray of glasses and sodawater which was rightly regarded by her guests as a stirrupcup this signal occurred rather earlier than usual tonight for it was likely that the two lovers would wish to say a few words to each other in the library before parting this was made completely easy for them by mrs hancocks suggestion that edith would find edwards hat and coat for him as lind no doubt had gone to bedhe had left the sodawater tray about three minutes beforeand the two went out together the words of parting were short and edward still tingling with music still inflamed by that lambent fire went back to his house in musical matters despite his own incompetence in matter of performance he had an excellent judgment and he knew that he had been listening that night to the real thing there was no question as to the quality of elizabeths playing she had authority without which the most agile execution is no more than a mere facility of finger acquirable like the nimble manoeuvres of a conjurer and in itself as devoid of artistic merit that magic like his is a matter of mere manipulation and no more constitutes a pianist than does the power of pronouncing words without stammer or stumbling constitute an actor but behind elizabeths playing sat the master who understood by virtue of perception the meaning of music and by virtue of hands coordinated with that burning perception could interpret and above all he felt that in music she spoke his language uttered the idioms he understood but could not give voice to her soul and his were natives of the same melodious country not foreigners to each other he told himself and honestly believed it that there was no more than thisas if this was not enoughin the hour he had spent in mrs hancocks drawingroom he was not even sure whether he liked elizabeth or not certainly she was as different as might well be from the type of marriageable maidenhood which had so greatly and so sanely attracted him that he rejoiced to know that his future life would be intimately and entirely bound up in hers all through dinner elizabeth had meant nothing at all to him and he had noted rather than admired her vitality for certainly she was like a light brought into a dusky room dispersing the shadows that completely and somnolently brooded in the corners and restoring colour to mere grey outlines but he was not very sure that he desired or appreciated this unusual illumination they had all of them got on very nicely in the dark where if you dozed a little there was not much probability of being detected and of late he had sat with chair close to ediths so to speak and listened with tenderness to mrs hancock talking on in her sleep into this had elizabeth come with her vivid bullseye lantern which got in ones eyes a little and was slightly disconcerting so had it been until she played and at that moment and in that regard he found her simply and utterly adorable and he poured out his homage for her as he would have done for some splendid brunnhilde awaking and hailing the sun and he knew the nature of the homage he brought so he as yet confidently told himself a homage as sexless and impersonal as that which prompts the presentation of wreaths to elderly and perspiring conductors at the close of an act it needed not a brunnhilde to evoke that for it was merely the tribute to artistic interpretation manifested by man or woman and responded to by those who could appreciate mrs hancocks deplorable ejaculation of tumtiti tumtiti was of the same nature it was not a tribute to elizabeth nor was his abandonment of himself to her spell or at the most it was a tribute to her fingers for the music that flowed from them but how he would have worshipped that gift in another if only it had been edith who played he had sat himself down in the broad windowseat of his drawingroom which looked out into the garden and trees that a fortnight before had stood made of ebony and ivory in the blaze of the may moonlight on the night when the house next door had been empty tonight it was tenanted tenanted by the girl who within a few months would come across so short a space of lawn and make her home with him tenanted also by the dark vivid presence of her who had made music to them in his drawingroom where he sat empty and blazing with electric light for some unaccounted impulse had made him turn on all the switches stood his big black piano with inviolate top standing open how would elizabeth awake the soul in it even as siegfried had by his kiss awakened brunnhilde by the magic of her comprehending fingers almost he could see her there with her profile a little defiant a little mutinous cut cameowise against the dark grey of his walls with her eye kindling as she listened to the music in her brain which flowed like some virile tumultuous heartbeat out of her fingers how well she understood the tramp and colour of that noveletteyet he knew he understood it quite as well himselfhow unerringly her fingers marshalled and painted it in her was the secret the initiation andoh how much it meantin her also was the mysterious power of communication she was not one of those incomplete souls who are born dumb as so many were she could speak others were born empty and so their power of speech was but a bottle of senseless sounds of flat wooden phrases and then with a shock of surprise to himself he became aware that he was thinking no longer about the music which elizabeth made but elizabeth who made it chapter vii the intermezzo business on the stock exchange had been as was not uncommon somewhat slack during this month of june and edward found it easy to get down to heathmoor by the train that arrived soon after five instead of that which started an hour later it was natural for him after getting rid of the habiliments of town to come round next door where he would find mrs hancock and edith ready to give him a slightly belated cup of tea in the gardenhouse that adjoined the croquetlawn as a rule elizabeth was not there but her whereabouts was indicated by the sound of the piano for she was practising with the energy of the enthusiast and found this hour when the house was empty and she could escape from the sense of disturbing or being disturbed the most congenial time in which to make as much noise as she chose or to practise a particular bar in endless repetition mrs hancock continued to believeand to reiteratethat edward was the maestro and that elizabeth followed faint but pursuing in the wake of his victorious fingers and she often asked him how he thought she was getting on he frequently dined there and with the regularity that characterized her she insisted on his playing one or more of his pieces when he had smoked the cigarette that detained him in the diningroom and on these occasions his eye was wont to seek elizabeths in tacit apology and though no word had passed between them on the subject the situation was quite clear to them both more than once he had attempted to convince mrs hancock that while he could only strum abominably her niece played and she perfectly incredulous thought it was nice of him to be so modest himself and to encourage elizabeth so protest being utterly useless he played with elizabeth in his confidence but the sense of this secret between themfor edith shared her mothers belief in the maestrogave him a peculiar and so he still told himself an inexplicable satisfaction with that knowledge he enjoyed rather than otherwise his own longdrawn murders of the classical authors and he completely understood the dimpling smile that fluttered lightwinged over elizabeths face as he performed his ruthless deeds during this last fortnight life at arundel had pursued to all outward appearance the regulated and emotionless course that characterized existence at heathmoor the time of strawberries had come and therefore also the time of garden parties and a quarter of an hour after the arrival of the evening train from town the welllaid roads were thick with hurrying flannelled figures carrying lawntennis racquets or croquet mallets for this latter game was taken with extreme seriousness and nobody among the regular players would have dreamed of trusting to a mallet of the house elizabeth naturally had her share in these invitations and it was a source of neverending surprise to see young and athletically limbed men of the same species apparently as those who in india spent their leisure in polo and pigsticking pursuing their laborious way through hoop after hoop and talking about the game afterwards with greater gusto and minuteness than if they had been tigershooting chief amongst those heroes of the lawn was edward but he as she did him the justice to observe preserved the reticence of the accustomed conqueror and sat silent when the vicar and mr dale lived their triumphs oer again elizabeth felt that to be like him but she made the admission grudgingly the fact that she grudged him such credit was symptomatic of her feelings towards him and in especial of those feelings which she did not admit though she would honestly have denied it she was fighting him again and again not knowing why she assured herself that he was a very ordinary young man that edith must be blind so to speak to see anything in him except in one point she told herself that there was nothing there that a lanky frameit was beyond her power to deny his inchescrowned by a vacant face was the harbourage of an insignificant soul he spent his day among the moneybags his evening on the croquetlawn and found that sufficient for him he was not nearly worthy of edith or of ediths inexplicable adoration he was not even so he appeared to elizabeths eye in love with her which would have been a foundation for worthiness he seemed indulgent of her kind to her sometimes a little impatient of her there elizabeth did not wholly acquit her cousin of blame she set him willynilly on a pedestal and those on pedestals for he did not deprecate the plinth are bound to stoop but he should have stepped down from the pedestal he should not have consented to be edified into the statuesque here was the ground of elizabeths censure of him in fine she reminded herself twenty times a day of some reason for belittling to her own mind her cousins betrothed and concealed from herself that she belittled him that was an affair of her instinct and instinctively she knew though she whispered it not to herself why she did it for she feared to give rein to her liking for him one exception she made in this policy of selfdefence in one thing she gave him his due for she never attempted to deny or belittle the validity of his musical passion it was a fingerless passion so to speak between his brain and his hands there seemed to be a total want of coordination he was paralytic but she could not doubt the intensity of his perception he was but an alphabetbabbler when he tried to communicate but when she played to him she knew by a glance at his face whether she did ill or well thus ironically mrs hancocks judgment of him as maestro and elizabeth as pupil was strangely correct and the girl did not attempt to conceal from herself that it was of him and his opinion that she thought when she practised with a greater diligence and fire than had ever been hers before the music which he understood and loved so discerningly day by day she slaved exultingly at the piano and the thought that he would appreciate her progress became an inspiration to her but at present this reverence for his gift was like an insoluble lump in the cup of her cold indifference towards him it neither sweetened nor embittered the beverage but certainly through him she was beginning to get closer every day to the ineffable spring and spirit from which that bewildering beauty of sound is poured forth that dweller in the innermost one glance from whom sends the beholder mad with melody on one afternoon at the end of the month graciously exempt from gardenparties elizabeth was alone in the house for the hour after lunch had been too hot for mrs hancocks drive and the whole curriculum of the day had been upset tea having taken place at the very unusual hour of halfpast four so that she might enjoy a cooler progress between that time and dinnera dislocation of affairs that had not occurred since the year before last but the heat was so intense that she really hardly cared at all whether denton and lind thought it odd or not and punctually at five she had set out with edith leaving a message with lind that if mr holroyd came round he was to be told that they were out but would be back by halfpast six thushere denton became concernedthey would have time to go round by the mill proceeding very slowly where the road had been newly mended and so forth but ifhere lind was attentive againmr holroyd came by the six oclock train he might be offered a whisky and soda and asked to wait but if by the five oclock train the original message should be delivered then filson brought out a light dustcloak and the heavier blue one was taken out then it was put back again in case the evening got chilly they passed over the bridge by the station the moment after the five oclock train got in and edith thought she saw edward stepping out of it but she was not sure but edward saw the motor and its passengers without any doubt whatever he went straight to his house and out into the garden there from the open french windows of the house next door the piano was plainly audible elizabeth was playing the first of the brahms intermezzi and the air sang like a bed of breezestirred flowers in less than a minute he had rung the bell and in answer to linds message had said he would come in and wait in spite of the fact that the offer of whisky and soda applied only to the six oclock train lind suggested it but edward said he wanted nothing and turning the handle of the drawingroom door very softly he entered elizabeth utterly intent on her music heard nothing of his coming and he sat down in a chair close to the door knowing that he was doing a rude and an illbred thing knowing too in his heart that he was doing worse than that for he was definitely indulging infidelity even though the infidelity was in fact no more than listening to the girls playing but he knew quite well why he listened and it was not for the sake of the music alone it was to allow himself unseen and unsuspectedfor there was in this questionable conduct something of the selfeffacing quality of loveto see incarnated the dreams from which he had roused himself when a month ago he engaged himself to edith for years of his youth he had cherished this unrealized vision fondling it in his dreams now when too early he had told himself that the time for dreaming was done and he must awake to the average humdrum satisfaction of domesticity with a delightful partner the dream incarnate had walked into his waking hours the sound of what she played had been the magnet which drew him here but now that he had come he was scarcely conscious of her music which throughout this month had been that which attracted him to her now it was as if that had done its work for it had brought his heart to her and nature or the law of attraction threw it aside like a discarded instrument and for the first moments that he sat here he scarcely heard the sweetness of the melody then it seemed to him that the strong and tender tune was elizabeths soul made audible she played thinking she was alone as she had never played before she seemed to reveal herself and then it struck him that he had done and was doing what was equivalent to looking through a keyhole at somebody who thought she was alone shame awoke in him for that but shame passed and was swallowed up in his intense consciousness of her of elizabeth and the tune that was elizabeth herself she finished and sat still for a moment with her fingers still resting on the last chord then she gave a long sigh and turning round saw him cousin edward she said almost incredulously feeling exactly what just now he had felt namely that he had been looking through a keyhole at her he got up only dimly conscious of the rebuke in her voice i came in after you had begun that intermezzo he said and i didnt want to disturb you i know how you hate an interruption i he paused a moment dead to all else except the fact of her i never heard you play like that before he said it was you she still looked troubled i dont think you should have done that she said didnt lind tell you that aunt julia and edith were out yes if you think i oughtnt to have come in i am sorry but i cant help rejoicing that i have heard you play like that suddenly it seemed to elizabeth that it was ridiculous of her to object to what he had done she had often played to him alone before and what difference did it make if on this occasion she did not know of his presence but her reason was at variance with her instinct she smiled at him it is nothing she said i was absurd to mind i am glad you thought i played it well have you had tea shall we go into the garden he saw his danger slipping away from him he had but to make a commonplace reply and it would be past but he saw his dream that had become incarnate slipping away from him also and at the moment that meant everything in the world to him he was reckless on fire and came close to her and stammered a little when he spoke for the last fortnight he said i have thought of nothing else but you loyalty and cowardice mixed caused him to stop he saw amazement and utter surprise flood elizabeths face he saw also faint as the reflection of faraway lightning something that responded to him something that leaped towards him instead of recoiling from him but all the rest of her was lost in pure bewilderment which only wanted to get rid of him she did not even answer him but with finger and following eye pointed to the door i beg your pardon he said quickly please go said the girl she sat down on the musicstool which she had so lately left and while waiting for her brain to work again struck a random note or two as far as she felt anything she felt surprise then in a flash came indignation that while he was but a month old in his engagement to edith he should speak thus to her and following instantly on that like some burglar violently breaking into her mind came the unbidden thought he cares for me she tried to eject it she called for help so to speak but the burglar contemplated her quite calmly as if he had a right to be there he seemed to speak to her to say you will have to get used to me in turn she looked at him and ceased calling for help something inside herthat without doubt which edward had seen faintly behind her first amazement and surpriseseemed to recognize to smile at him and elizabeth ceased from being surprised at edward and became surprised at herself but what was to be done beyond all doubt the answer was clear there was nothing to be done at all at any rate there was nothing for her to do it was ludicrous to contemplate telling aunt julia it would not have been more ludicrous to tell edith nobody must know nobody must ever so faintly conjecture what had happened edward was going to marry edith on the eighth of october and there were to be six bridesmaids of whom she herself was to be one elizabeths surprise at herself waxed and grew and her surprise was due to the fact that she was not in the least shocked she made one unsuccessful attempt to tell herself that edward had not meant what he said but she swiftly gave that up being quite aware that he meant much more than he had said his trembling voice his fingers that plaited themselves together told her that he was quite in earnest then as suddenly as if she had been shaken out of some deep sleep she obtained complete control and consciousness of herself she was not shocked because she welcomed what he had said because she responded to it shame and a secret rapture overwhelmed her and the burglar went neck and crop out of the wideflung window of her mind it was not till she had turned him out that any struggle in her own mind began she knew now why she had made a habit of belittling and criticizing him to herself she had been defending herself against him now she had to defend herself against herself as well she had to inquire into the fidelity of her own garrison and she knew that there were traitors among them but still she was not the least shocked certainly they must be turned out or executed or drawn and quartered but their crime against herself did not anger her against them the practical aspect of the situation engaged her again and she saw now that there was just one thing to be done namely to obliterate altogether what had happenednot to think of it any more at all no doubt it was very bad that ediths affianced lover should have said what he had said should have meant so much more than he said and that she should not have been horrified at him but only surprised and when her surprise was passed that she should have found that there was response to him in her soul but all this must be expunged and if she could not forget it she must remember it only as some queer distorted dream that in reality is nonsense though while the dreamer still slept it seemed so intensely real she felt she could answer for herself in this matter that she was quite competent to seal the affair up in her mind as bees seal up in wax some intruder to their hive edward must also see that to her the whole episode was no longer existent since nonexistence was undoubtedly the best fate for it and thus her manner to him must be exactly what it had been before he had made his unfortunate intrusion hardly less important was it that edith and her aunt should remain unaware that anything had occurred between edward and herself this gave a reason the more for her treating him quite normally only how did she treat him before how did she look at him did she usually smile when she spoke to him she felt that to meet him again now without consciousness of what had just happened would be like meeting a perfect stranger but it had got to be done to admit in her bearing to him that any recollection of the scene still had a place in her mind to indicate even by coldness of manner and an aloof demeanour that he must keep his distance was impossible for edith would be sure to notice it and above everything almost it was essential that edith should be utterly unaware of anyshe hardly knew what to call itany understanding or misunderstanding between them over those three minutes there must be pasted a sheet of white paper it seemed to her well within her power to do that and she must continue to make her mind fight and belittle and criticize him that ought to be easy now that he had done what she knew to be a despicable thing unfortunately she did not despise him for being despicable or at the most her reason did but not her instinct she heard the sound of the motorwheels crunching the gravel and felt perfectly prepared to resume not only her natural manner but her normal consciousness she swung round on her musicstool and began the intermezzo again getting up as her aunt entered with edith well and i hope youve had a good practice dear said mrs hancock very cordially and weve had a pleasant drive and not so dusty as i expected it would be but we hurried back sooner than i intended originally because there was a huge black cloud coming up and denton said he wouldnt be surprised if it came on to rain very suddenly so i think i shall sit out in the garden to get a little more air and you and edith might have a game of croquet i expect edward will come in when the six oclock train arrives dear me it is after six perhaps he has been edith and went back lind will know then you can all three play croquet if you touch the bell dear elizabeth found the natural manner perfectly easy he came in she said and went back to his house again i think i was practising suddenly she found herself wondering whether her manner was quite natural and she glanced at edith who was touching the bell no doubt he did not want to disturb your practice said mrs hancock who always liked to remind herself of the comforts she showered on other people for i have given strict orders dear that you are not to be disturbed when you are practising perhaps he is in the garden we will call to him over the wall i want him to come in to dine and you shall both play to us afterwards i wonder if we could not get some nice duets with an easy part for you dear which you could play together look it has begun to rain already denton was quite right i am glad he advised us to turn though it was edith who saw the big black cloud first there is an end to our going into the garden and to your croquet i am afraid but i will send a note round to edward i think that was a flash of lightning perhaps you would write the note for me edith and give it to lind oh yes lind there will be a note yes there is the thunder quite a loud clap what a blessing we turned linds wooden face looked inquiringly round when he was told that there was a note for edward to be taken round as if he expected to find him concealed under the piano i thought mr edward was here maam he said perhaps he is in the garden he said he would wait elizabeth gathering her music together made a sudden awkward movement and spilled it no he went back home aunt julia she said he came in when i was practising as i told you i told him you were out maam repeated lind and he said he would wait elizabeth felt a wild exasperation there was nothing to explain and yet she had to go on explaining but he went away again she repeated yes dear i quite understand said mrs hancock he saw you were practising did he say he would come back if so i need not send this note it all seemed like a plot of the inquisition no he said nothing remarked elizabeth rather shortly feeling that this perfectly straightforward visit was somehow becoming suspicious did he stop long asked edith quite casually no five minutesten perhaps said elizabeth i really did not time him mrs hancock always kept a feather in a small vase of water on her writingtable with this she smeared the gum on the flap of envelopes in preference to the more ordinary use of the tongue on such occasions it seemed to her slightly indelicate to put out her tongueeven the tip of itin public and besides who knew what the gum was made of or who had been touching it this genteel observance singularly annoyed elizabeth and it was her privilege to snatch away envelopes from her aunt and lick them herself with so to speak yards of tongue protruding rather than allow the use of the horrible feather here she saw her opportunity and with a complete resumption of her natural manner which up to that moment had not been a complete success upset the feathers water and brought an end to the senseless catechism lind was obliging enough to take the note himself and prepared for this expedition of about forty yards by putting on a cap a mackintosh and goloshes and providing himself with an umbrella there was need only for a verbal answer but he waited some five minutes before an acceptance came by this time the rain had completely ceased but edward from his window saw him put up his umbrella againno doubt to guard against drippings from the trees he observed this with a very minute detached feeling of interest then he sprang up to call to lind and substitute regrets for his delight then that impulse died also and he sat down to think over what had happened he did not fall into the mistake of considering it a little thing though the incident in itself was nothing it was at the least a feather of carded cloud high up in the heavens that told though so insignificant and remote a thing of the great wind that blew there he had not spoken idly rather he scarcely knew that he had spoken at all until his own words sounded in his ears he had not addressed pretty words to a pretty girl it seemed to him that they had been squeezed as it were by some force infinitely superior to his power of will out of his resisting mouth his whole conduct from the chance hearing of the brahms intermezzo in his garden leading on to his illbred and silent intrusion into the room where elizabeth played and his words all seemed to have been dictated by an irresistible power that arose out of the sense of his incarnate dream it had been perfectly true that for the last fortnight he had thought of nothing else but her that the affairs of every day had for him moved like shadows across that solid background in the meantime he had promised his substance and his life to one of the shadows and as far as he knew or guessed he was nothing more than a shadow rather a distasteful one to the girl who for him was the only reality then the practical side of the situation the what next which always hastens to stir the boiling pottage of our emotions with its bony fingers held his attention even as it had held elizabeths he came to the same conclusions but with an important reservation she had consigned the whole affair to complete oblivion whether or no the consignment lay in her power he was as glad as she to consign it also until and unless in legal phrase something modified the existing conditions he knew very well what he connoted by that modification it meant some sign some signal from elizabeth that should confirm the secret welcome that her amazement had so instantly smothered just now he had told himself that he was but a distasteful shadow to her now again the remembrance of her souls leap towards him told that he was not that yet he had had no right to see that smothered welcome any more than he had a right to intrude himself privately into her presence but in his heart of hearts he was ashamed of neither feat only his surface his sense of breeding his respect for things like conduct and convention rebuked him he himself the seer of dreams cared not at all rather he hugged himself on it he had drifted away from practical considerations and wrenched himself back to them on the eighth of october next as matters stood he was to be married to edith and his conductagain with that reservationmust be framed on the lines demanded by that condition he felt no doubt whatever that elizabeth would breathe no word of what had passed to her aunt or edith for if she did so it would imply wanton mischief on her part of which he knew her to be incapable or the determination to stop his marriage forfor other reasons she would only speak if she intended to spoil or to stop she might it was very likely that she would interpose between herself and him that screen of manner invisible as a sheet of glass which yet cuts off all rays of heat from a fire while it suffers to pass through it the sparkle of its brightness she would probably appear to others to shine on him as before but he poor shivering wretch would know that all warmth had been cut off from him for a moment his passion blazed up within him and he felt himself barbarian and primitive man without code of morals without regard for honour and environment he who spent his innocuous days in an office making money wearing a black coat living the dull respectable stereotyped life who spent his leisure in reading papers about affairs that he cared not one drop of hearts blood about in tapping foolish croquet balls through iron hoops in playing the piano at heathmoor dinnerparties in enveloping himself and his soul in the muffled cottonwool of comfort and material ease knew that within this swathed cocoon of himself that lay in a decorous row of hundreds of other similar cocoons there lurked in spite of all contrary appearance an individual life he found himself capable of love and utterly indifferent to honour or obligations regarding them only as arbitrary rules laid down for the pursuance of the foolish game of civilized existence in essentials he believed himself without morals without religion without any of the bonds that have built up corporate man and differentiate life from dreams and this flashed discovery did not disconcert him he felt as if he had found a jewel in the muddy flats of existence then in another flash he was back in his cocoon again prisoner in this decorous roomful of things which he did not want there was a silver cigarettebox on a polished table there was an ivory paperknife stuck into the leaves of a book he was reading a parquetted floor spread with persian rugs and all these things were symbols of slavery chains that bound him or at the best bright objects by which a baby is diverted from its crying for the moon and the clock chiming its halfhour after seven told him he must conform to the prison rules and go to dress for dinner at mrs hancocks he took out of his coatpocket an envelope about which up to this moment he had completely forgotten it contained the ticket for a box at the opera which he had bought that day for a performance of siegfried in a weeks time he hoped to persuade the ladies next door to be his guests and since the pursuance of this formed part of the resumption of ordinary normal life he meant to propose his plans to them but both when he bought the ticket and now he saw that it might bear on the life that lay within the cocoon more than all the material diversion or business of the world he wanted to go with elizabeth to siegfried and with his hat when he started to dinner he took the book of the music with him he was a little late as judged by the iron punctuality of arundel and he found the ladies assembled he had one moment of intense nervousness as he entered but it was succeeded by an eagerness not less intense when he saw elizabeths cordial and welcoming smile that set the note for him he had already determined on the same key and he knew himself in tune with it as he shook hands with the girl he laughed and turned to mrs hancock involuntarily detaining elizabeths hand one second not more than was quite usual i was rather nervous he said i intruded on elizabeths practice this afternoon perhaps she has told you in fact i meant to stay to wait for your return and ediths but i found it quite impossible dear said mrs hancock yes lind has told us dinner is ready did elizabeth scold you elizabeth equally relieved laughed you behaved very rudely edward she said and as a matter of fact i didnt tell them i wanted to screen you but as you dont seem in the least ashamed of yourself i shall give you up what revelations we are going to have said mrs hancock yes your favourite soup edward mrs williams thought of it when she heard you were coming she sent out for the cream now let us hear all about it i thought there was some mystery this was not quite true mrs hancock had not thought anything whatever about it but this phrase of purely dinner conversation disconcerted elizabeth for a moment edith suddenly looking up perceived this obscure embarrassment no aunt julia there was no mystery said elizabeth there was merely my mistaken kindness in sparing edward now i shall sacrifice and expose him he came in when i was practising quietly so that i didnt hear him and sat down to listen and when i had finished my piece i turned round and saw him and of course i was startled and annoyed wasnt it caddish of him do say it was caddish that should have been sufficiently robust to have carried off and finished with the subject but it so happened that mrs hancock went on my dear what words to use she said edith will be up in arms look there is another flash of lightning we shall have a regular storm i am afraid and what did you say to him she told me to go away said edward which i did and i asked her to forgive me i dont know if shes done that yet the desire for secret communication with her prompted and impelled him i shall ask her later if she has he said raising his eyes to her face her screening me was a sign of her softening but her giving you away now shows signs of hardening again said edith perhaps she doesnt know her own mind said edward still looking at her and knowing but not caring that he had no business to force replies on her so long as he could talk with a meaning that was clear to her alone this time the secret look that leaped out to him below her amazement showed again through the trouble and brightness of her face i know my mind perfectly she said i will forgive you if you are sorry i am but i liked hearing you play when you didnt know any one was there mrs hancock looked vaguely and beamingly round but i always thought that people played best when there was an audience to listen to them she said there was an audience remarked edward mrs hancock saw the fallacy without a moments hesitation and enlarged on it till it became more clear than the sun at noonday but she didnt know there was she said lucidly and so it would count as if there wasnt listen there is the rain beginning again like that beautiful piece of edwards which always makes me feel sad he shall play it to us after dinner was it one of your pieces that elizabeth was playing before edward mrs hancock always spoke of immortal works by classical masters as if edwards atrocious renderings of them gave him the entire right and possession of them no said he it was her own i shall always think of it as the elizabintermezzo mrs hancock turned an attentive eye on the asparagus dish finish it edward she said it is the last you will get from my garden this year and what an amusing conversation we are having about elizabeth and you elizabintermezzothe intermezzo which elizabeth plays what a good word quite a portmanteau all this private signalling of edward to her all his doubleedged questions as to whether she had forgiven him seemed to elizabeth in the worst possible taste she had just now announced so frankly that she could not be imagined to be serious that he had behaved caddishly that afternoon and his behaviour now seemed to endorse her judgment and yet she by her outspokenness perhaps had set the fashion of doubleedged speech it was justifiable in him to think that she meant to allude to what neither of them openly alluded to but he was caddish she felt irritated and disgusted with him she looked at him with eyebrows that first frowned and then were raised in expostulation havent we all had enough of my practice this afternoon she said as she looked at him she noticed what she had noticed a hundred times before how his hair above his forehead grew straight and then fell over in a plume and while her mind was ruffled with his behaviour she suddenly liked that enormously she wondered if it was elastic that thickness of erect hair like a springmattress she wanted to put her hand on it and that radical and superficial emotion called physical attraction had begunsuperficial because it concerns merely the outward form and colour of face and limbs radical because all the sexlove in the world springs from its root which is buried in the beating heart of humanity afterwards no doubt those roots may dissolve and become part of the lifeblood red corpuscles of love but without them there has never yet opened the glorious scarlet of the flowers of passion nor the shining foliage that keeps the world green thus at the very moment when he was indifferent to her except that she was a little nauseated by his behaviour he began to become different to all others and very faintly but authentically it was whispered to her that he and she belonged that they fitted entwined and interlacing into this great chinese puzzle of a world instantly she shut her ears to the whisper but she had heard it he had the decency she allowed to change the subject no encore for the intermezzo he said but siegfried is being given this day week and i have got a box for it i want you all to come well that would be a treat said mrs hancock these are the first whiteheart cherries weve had from the garden edward you must take some siegfried that is by wagner elizabeth banished from her mind caddishness and springy hair alike oh aunt julia she exclaimed that is capital then said edward knowing the value of an atmosphere of certainty we had better all sleep in town so that we can stop to the end without any sense of being hurried which would spoil it all ill see to all that and of course its my treat mrs hancocks face changed but brightened again as she caught the full flavour of the first whiteheart sleep in town she said i neverarent the cherries good i shall tell ellis he was quite right when he wanted extra manure delicious but sleep in town edward is that necessary cant we come away before the end for i quite agree with you that it is no use stopping in your seat grasping a fan in one hand and your dress in the other waiting for the curtain to go down and even then they all come on and bow wouldnt it be better if we all slipped out in plenty of time to catch the theatretrain as we always do elizabeth sighed aunt julia i would sooner not go at all than come away before the end she said its the love duet you know and oh ive never seen it aunt julia looked mild reproof my dear we mustnt be in a hurry we must think it over and see how we can contrive we can contrive by stopping in town said elizabeth or couldnt you drive down in your car afterwards but my dear it might be a wet night and if we drove back it would only be reasonable to drive up shall we have coffee in here now for an exception and then we need not interrupt ourselves yes lind coffee in here not in the drawingroom but here it would only be reasonable as i said to drive up for it would be no use going by train while denton took up the car empty and if it was a wet night i should not like him hanging about all afternoon and evening for his wife expects a baby this was aside to edward though since edith was soon to be married she did not so much mind her hearing but his wife isnt going to hang about all afternoon and evening said elizabeth swiftly my dear let me talk it over with edward and denton would not know how to meet us at the operawe might miss him and then what would happen edward laughed then mrs hancock you would have to sleep in town uncomfortably without night things instead of sleeping comfortably according to my plans but i should have to take filson said mrs hancock rather unwisely since if you mean not to do a thingand she had not the smallest wish to see siegfriedit weakens the position to argue however sensibly about it of course you would take filson said edward take lind as well if you like i will arrange it all well it would be an event wouldnt it to see the opera and sleep up in town said mrs hancock who though she did not mean to go a little hankered after anything of this sort if it was to be had without any expense but there would be a great deal to think of and to plan i always forget if you take cream edward yes a great deal to plan for if one is to go one must look tidy and have a few jewels she formed a rapid mental picture of herself in the front of a box with the pearls and perhaps the tiara it rather attracted her but she felt that if she stayed in a hotel she would not get a wink of sleep all night with thinking of those treasures she rejected the picture but simultaneously a bright idea struck her wednesday next did you say she asked guilefully no thursday mrs hancock made a gesture of impatience well if that isnt annoying she said when we were arranging it so nicely and getting over every difficulty because thursday is mrs martins gardenparty which i havent missed in all the years i have been at heathmoor and i mustnt miss it she would think it so unkind for she always says she depends on me i wonder if she could possibly change her day listen to the rain i hope you have brought your mackintosh edward no im afraid its too late to ask her for the invitations are already sent out well that does knock our delightful plan on the head how battered the garden will be though we want rain and siegfried too of all operas that is the one i should so like to see again but i have an idea yes pray light your cigarette edward what if you took these two girls up to see it couldnt they be supposed to chaperone each other and edith so nearly married too i dont know what people would think though mrs hancock was the soul of good nature and having so adroitly shown the impossibility of herself partaking in this plan thought nothing of the disagreeableness of spending an evening alone but couldnt you come after the gardenparty mother asked edith my dear i should be a rag mrs martin says that she feels no responsibility if i am there at her party but i assure you i do i have always said it is no use trying to listen to music unless you are fresh it is an insult to the music but i wonder if it is very wrong of me to suggest such a thing edith darling the candleshade well done you have saved it but if you girls go up together and join edward in town i dont see who will know well that will be a secret for us all to keep shall we all go into the drawingroom hark how the rain is falling we must have some music then thats settled asked edward if these young ladies approve but what a lot we have to arrangewhere you are to go and where they are to meet you and the train they are to come back by in the morning she paused a moment as she took up her patience pack and filson shall go up with them she proclaimed it will make me feel more comfortable if i know filson is there what a talk we have had i declare it is halfpast nine already do let us have some music edith dear i think you might open the window into the garden a little bit if any of us feel it damp we can close it again look there are two aces out already what a good beginning edward turned to elizabeth and you like the siegfried plan he asked but its too nice of you i she stopped do go on he said speaking low suddenly elizabeth saw that edith was observing them i suppose i shall have to forgive you she said in a voice clearly audible now that you are taking me to siegfried and the very fact that she spoke aloud so that edith could hear falsified so she felt the truth of her light speech she knew he would not take it quite lightly and she allowed him to put one construction on it so that edith might put another his eye quickened with the secret message he sent to her and she did not refuse it but it wasnt a bribe said he with his lips i made the plan before i sinned so play your intermezzo a week afterwards elizabeth was walking up and down the long gardenpath while the morning was yet dewy she had awoke early on this day that she and edith were going up to town to see the opera woke with a sense of ecstatic joy in life of intense and rapturous happiness for the last week she had been living in a storm of emotion that seemed not to come from within her but from without beating and buffeting her but giving her from time to time serene and wonderful hours she had wrestled with and worked over the transcript of siegfried until she had made the music her own and she seemed to have come into a heritage that was waiting ready for her to claim it the passionate excitement of the true musician with all its flow of flooding revelations its stream of infinite rewards was hers she had entered that kingdom which to all except those few who can say we musicians know is but a beautiful cloudland and a place of bewildering mists but now for her it had cleared she had come into her own and saw steadfastly what she had before but guessed at of what she had heard but hints and seen images till now with all her love of music she had been but a speller of the mere words that made its language knowing the words to be beautiful and feeling their nameless charm but now it was as if the printed page of their poetry was open to her there was meaning as well as beauty coherence and romance in the sounds which had hitherto but suggested images to her the revelation had not come singly the golden gates had not swung open of their own accord well she knew the hand which for her had thrown them open the wind that had dispersed the mists she was in love in love as she had once said indifferently and disappointedly with a common man beyond any shadow of doubt it was that which had opened out the kingdom of music for her thus quickened her receptive nature had been enabled to receive hitherto she had been like a deaf man vivid in imagination to whom the magic of sound had been described her perceptions had been dormant she had but felt the light as the bud of a folded flower may be imagined to feel it now she received it on expanded petals about that love itself she had at present no qualms she admitted no recognition of its hopelessness she had no perception of its dangers she was too full of the first wonder of its dawning to guess or to care what the risen day might bring forth the fact that edward was engaged to be married to her cousin was a complete safeguard against dangers which she barely conjectured and the very thought of hope or hopelessness made no imprint on her mind for in the presence of the thing herself she could not bring herself to consider the possible issues of it it exalted and possessed her the fact that she loved filled her entire being which already brimmed with her new perceptions of music each heightened the other each was infinite possessing the whole of her she had no thought for the morrow or for the day or for herself the whole of the eagerness of her youth was enslaved in a perfect freedom she was blind and ecstatic and in truth was running heedlessly sightlessly between quicksands and deep seas and precipices unconscious of them all and above all unconscious of herself absorbed by love and melody even as the dew on the lawn was being absorbed by the sun above the sky was unflecked by cloud and as yet of pale and liquid blue the warm air had still a touch of nights coolness in it and the young day seemed like a rosy child awakening from sleep at the end of the garden the tall elms stood motionless towers of midsummer leaf and the smell of the evaporating dew that had lain all night in the bosom of red roses and among the thickblade grass of the lawn told her where it had slept it hung thick on the threads of the netted fruittrees and glimmered on the redbrick wall that ran alongside the shining gravel walk already the bees had begun their garnerings the birds were achuckle in the bushes and suddenly the whole pervading sweetness and song of the morning smote on elizabeths heart already full to overflowing and demanded the expression of her gratitude she was compelled to thank somebody for itnot ellis not aunt julia not edward even somebody anyhow she said aloud chapter viii the mountaintop edward from long living at heathmoor had little to learn about comfort and the arrangements he had made for the two girls were of a completeness that mrs hancock could hardly have rivalled even if she had been concerned with plans for herself he had gone up to town by the am that morning and had shown himself but briefly at his office devoting the rest of his time to orders and inspection he had been to see the rooms prepared for their reception at the savoy bedrooms for the two girls with a sittingroom between had shown in a practical way that he recollected elizabeths ardour for sweet peas and ediths respect for roses had ordered tea to be ready for their arrival a table to be reserved in the restaurant for their dinner between the acts and an entrancing little supper to be served in the sittingroom when the opera was over finally he was waiting at the station with his motor for their arrival it was not only the desire for their comfort that prompted this meticulous supervision for the evening in prospect was symbolical to him of a parting a farewell and with the spirit in which all farewells should be said he wished to join hands with elizabeth once more festally and superbly not with lingering glances and secret signs but to the sound of music and to the sight of a glorious drama he had spent this last week among waves and billows of emotions and though his ship had not foundered his lack of experience as a sailor in such seas had completely upset him in every other sense but tonight he had told himself he would reach port already he had rounded the pierhead and within a few hours now he would put elizabeth ashore the pier was decorated for her reception flags waved and bands played he would part with her splendidly and go back to his boat where edith would await him for their lifelong cruise in calm and pleasant waters he had made so he honestly believed the honest decision and though honesty is a virtue which is so much taken for granted that it is ranked rather among the postulates of life than among its acquirements honest decisions are not always made without struggle and difficulty he felt for elizabeth the actual flesh and blood and spirit of her what he had only hitherto imagined in the dreams which a few months before he had settled to have done with bitterly and with more poignancy of feeling than he had thought himself capable of he regretted his precipitancy in their abandonment in a few months more he would have seen them realized he would have had his human chance of an attractive boy with a girl to have made them true but he had not waited he had shaken himself awake and with full sense of what he was doing had made love to and been accepted by the girl he knew and liked and admired today he acknowledged his responsibility and had no intention of shirking it a week of what was not less than spiritual anguish had resulted in this decision in one direction he was pulled by honour in the other by love he had a previous engagement which he had settled took rank before anything else whatever he believed without the smallest touch of complacency that edith loved him but he believed also and again not a grain of that odious emotion entered into his belief that had he been free elizabeth would have accepted him since his deplorable lapse a week ago she had treated him with a friendlier intimacy than ever this for they had had no further word on the subject he interpreted to mean that out of the generosity of her nature she had completely forgiven him and obliterated the occurrence and that her friendliness was meant to show how entirely she trusted him for the future in this he was absolutely right he was right also in the corollary he instinctively added that she would not have adopted this attitude unless she was fond of him she could quite correctly have kept him at arms length she could have continued to manifest that slight hostility to him which had previously characterized her behaviour but she had not she had given him a greater warmth and friendliness than ever before so far he could let his thoughts bear him without shame or secrecy but there went on beneath them a tow an undercurrent which though he suppressed and refused to regard it was what had caused in the main the soulstorm in which he had been buffeted all this week he believed there was more than friendliness in her regard for him and with the terrible sharpsightedness of blind love as if one of his eyes saw nothing while the other was gifted with portentous vision he had not missed the signs little signs a look a word a movement which are the feelers of love waving tentacles of infinite sensitiveness that threadlike and invisible to the ordinary beholder shrivel and spring and touch instinctively without volition on their owners part no one fairly and impartially judging could say that elizabeth had behaved to him except with friendly unreserve but to him she seemed to reserve much to reserve all in spite of all this edward as he waited on the platform for the arrival of their train had no doubt that he was doing right in following the demands of honour he had killed his dreams so to speak when he engaged himself to edith tonight to the sound of flutes and violins he was going to conduct their funeral and did not see that in reality he was intending to bury them alive and that dreams are not smothered by burial rather like the roots of plants they grow and flourish beneath the earth sending up the sap that feeds their blossoms he did not contemplate the future with dismay he believed that both he and edith would have a very pleasant comfortable life together according to the heathmoor pattern and with a touch of cynicism which was unusual with him he added as the train steamed in that this was more than could be said for many marriages then before the train stopped he saw elizabeth get out and look round for him with shining excited eyes and his heart beat quick at her recognition of him the three met with jubilance and drove straight to the savoy for there was not more than time to have tea and dress the day like the last dozen of its predecessors had been dry and dusty and the roadway in front of the hotel had been liberally watered stepping out of the motor edith slipped and fell heavily her foot doubled under her bravely she tried to smile bravely also she tried to get up but the smile faded in the agony of her twisted ankle and she was helped into the hotel it seemed at first that it might be a wrench of little consequence the pain of which would be assuaged by ten minutes rest but all that ten minutes did for her was to give her a badly swollen ankle and show the utter impossibility of her setting foot to the ground then swathed in wet bandages and lying on the sofa in the sittingroom she took a peremptory line with the others you two must go she said and if you wait here any longer you will be late if you arent both of you ready to start in a quarter of an hour i shall go myself bandage and all if i have to hop there but you cant spend the evening alone said elizabeth and we i shant spend the evening alone because we shall all have supper together dinner too if you will be awfully kind edward and have it up here with me instead of in the restaurant edward had already yielded in his heartyielded with a secret exulting rapture the fates though at ediths expense were giving him a splendid farewell to elizabeth they would be alone together for it he did not let his thoughts progress further than that if you insist he began am i not insisting my dear it is a dreadful bore but we must make the best of it be kind and order dinner here instead and go to dress elizabeth was left alone with her cousin but aunt julia she said what will she say i have thought of that mother mustnt know you must coach me up when you come back andand i shall have sprained my ankle when we came back to the hotel at the end dont forget oh do go and get ready elizabeth its all settled i cant bear that edward should be disappointed in not seeing siegfried nor indeed that you should it would be perfectly senseless that you should stop at home because i cant go it cost elizabeth something to argue against this she wanted passionately to see the opera and if a dreamwish a fairywish for a thing that was impossible could have been presented to her that morning she would have chosen to see the awakening of brunnhilde alone with edward his wildblurted speech when he intruded upon her practising a week ago she had buried so complete since then had been his discretion and if she thought of it at all she thought of it only as a momentary lapse an unguarded exaggeration since then she had not defended herself against him by any coldness of manner any unspoken belittlement of him and they had arrived at a franker and more affectionate intimacy than ever before she did not inquire or conjecture what his secret emotional history was she was safeguarded enough from him by his engagement to edith while from herself her own integrity of purpose seemed a sufficient shield yet she argued against ediths insistence on the fulfilment of the fairywish but aunt julia wouldnt like it she said i cant help that said edith i want it so much that i dont care what mother would think besides she wont think anything she will never know edith paused a moment and flushed besides dear she said if i asked you and edward or even wanted you not to go what reason could there be for it it would appear soso odiousas ifi cant say it oh go and dress the unspoken word was clear enough and it contained all that elizabeth was conscious of it would have been odious that either of them should harbour the thought that edith could not put into words it was sufficient the two came back to dine at the end of the first act full to the brim of music intoxicated with the beady ferment of sound and drama and both a little beside themselves with excitement at present the music and that alone held them in the flame of their common passion each as yet paid little heed to the other except as a sharer in it elizabeth hardly touched any food she was silent and brighteyed exploring her new kingdom but with edward the return to the hotel to the common needs of food and drink above all to edith took him poignantly back into the actual world again once again more vividly than ever before his choice which he told himself was already decided was set before him as he sat with elizabeth silent and strungup on the one side with edith intelligently questioning him with a view to subsequent catechism of herself on the other her questions seemed idiotic interruptions he could barely make courteous narrativeand then mime told him about his youth and then he began to forge the sword yes it was palstecher who played siegfriedhe was in excellent voice he did not revoke his choice but he ceased to think of it he wanted only for the present to hasten the tardy progress of the hands of the clock to the moment when it would be time for him to go away again alone with elizabeth but the aspect of this evening as his farewell to her was ousted in his mind by the prospect of the next hour or two he thought less of what it symbolized more and growingly more of what it was but even as no thunderstorm bursts without the menace of gathering clouds so the thickening intensity of his emotions warned him with utterly disregarded caution that forces of savage import were collecting had a friend laid the facts the possibilities the danger before him and asked his opinion as to what a man should do under such circumstances unhesitatingly would he have advised without regard to any other issue that he should not go back alone with elizabeth let him take a waiter from the hotel a stranger out of the street rather than trust himself alone to keep a steady head and a firm foot in those precipiced and slippery places had he believed that elizabeth had no touch of more than pleasant friendly feelings towards him he might have been justified in believing in himself butand this was the very spring and foundation of his excitement his expectancyhe did not so believe he fancied rightly or wrongly that she had shown signs of a warmer regard for him than that but still as unconvincingly as a parrotcry he kept saying to himself edith trusts me and therefore i trust myself he did not even feel he was doing a dangerous thing he felt only that he had an irresistible need to be with elizabeth in the isolation of the darkened house when brunnhilde awoke the performance viewed artistically was magnificent from height to height mounted the second act till the sounds of the noonday the murmurs of the forest grew from the scarcely audible notes to the full triumphant symphony of sunlight and living things pervading allembracing bringing the voice of all nature to endorse heroic deeds and at the same time to bring to the hero the knowledge of his human needs to him even as to siegfried it woke in his heart the irresistible need of love of the ideal mate of the woman of his dreams who sat beside him once only as the clear call of the bird rang through the hushed house did elizabeth take her eyes off the stage and turned them dewy with tears and bright with wonder on him she said no word but unconsciously moved her chair a little nearer his and laid her ungloved hand on his knee he had one moments hesitationone moment in which it was in his power to check himself there was just one branch of a tree so to speak hanging above the rapids down which he was hurrying and it was just possible with an effort to grasp it he made no such effort deliberately if anything in this fervour of growing madness could be called deliberate he let that moment go by deliberately he rejected the image of edith awaiting their return and all aflame acquiesced with his will in anything that should happen deliberately he cast the reins on the backs of his flying steeds and not again did the sense that he had any choice in the matter come to him the last atom of his manliness was absorbed in his manhood elizabeths hand lay on his knee the fingers bending over it inwards gently he pressed them with his other knee and he felt her response she had but sought that touch to assure herself she was in tune with him one with him over this miracle that she was looking at but on the moment she felt there was more than that both in that pressure of her hand and her own response to it but she was too absorbed too rapt to care nothing mattered except siegfried and the fact that she and edward were together and beating with one heartsblood about it and presently afterwards brunnhilde lay beneath the pines in her shining armour and through the flames the vain obstacle that barred his approach to her came siegfried of no avail to her was the armour of her maidenhood for while she slept he loosened it and of no avail to stay his approach was the fierceness of the flames that girt her restingplace at his kissthe kiss that sealed her histhe strong throb of her blood beat again in her body the eyes that had so long been shut in her unmolested sleep were unclosed and she sat up and saluted the sun and she saluted the day and the earth and all the myriad sounds and sights and odours that told her she was born into life again siegfried had stood back in awe at the wonder and holiness of her awakening and she turned and saw him and once more elizabeth turned to edward and their eyes met in a long glance to each at that moment to her no less than to him it was the drama of their own souls that was unfolding in melody and lovesong before them she needed to look at him but for that one glance of recognition for there on the stage she learned as she saw the immortal lovers together the immortality of love the whole air rang with this supreme expression of it the violins and the flutes and that glorious voice of brunnhilde spoke for her and it was her companion here in the box with her who bore the rapture higher who completed it made it perfect indeed there was greeting in the farewell if he said vale to her he sang ave also but his vale was less now than a mutter below his breath she sat with her arms resting on the front of the box till the last triumphant notes rang out and through the applause that followed she still sat there unmoving there was no before or after for her then her consciousness moved upon a limitless an infinite plane he had left his place and when she turned he was standing close behind her again their eyes met in that long look and the question that was in his saw itself answered by the smile shy and solemn that shone in hers then still in silence they went out into the crowd that filled the passages the entrance porch was crowded with the efflux of the house waiting for their carriages to arrive and elizabeth saw the surging glittering scene with a strange hard distinctness but it all seemed remote from her as if it was enclosed in walls of crystal the crowd was no more to her than a beehive of busy moving little lives altogether sundered in intelligence and interests from herself and edward the whole world had receded on to the insectplane it crawled and skipped and jostled about her but he and she were infinitely removed from it and it aroused in her just the vague wonder of a man idly gazing at a disturbed anthill hardly wondering what all the bustle was about here and there stood members of this throng waiting quietly in corners taking no part in the movement and it just occurred to her that in a room in the savoy hotel there was another such member of this queer busy little race waiting their return but even the thought of edith barely found footing in her mind she was but another specimen under glass the night was quite fine and in a moment or two they had made their way out of the doors and were walking down the queue of carriages to find their motor he had suggested that she should wait while he hunted it and brought it up but she preferred to go out of this crowded insecthouse to look for it with him the street was full also of the vague throng that also seemed utterly unreal utterly without significance she would scarcely have been surprised if the lights and the people and the houses and the highswung moon had all collapsed and melted away leaving only a mountaintop girt with flames that rose and fell with gusts of sparkling melody she would not be alone there her whole self her completed self at least would be therethe self which she had seen so often had criticized and belittled which till this evening she had never known to be herself now she knew nothing else all the rest was a mimic world full of busy little insects the motor was soon found and she stepped in followed by edward she had heard him give some directions to the chauffeur about driving down to the embankment and going to that entrance of the hotel and they slid out of the queue and turned so intensely did she feel his presence that it seemed to bring him no nearer to her when he took her hand in his when she heard him whisper brunnhildeyou awoke yes siegfried she answered and his arms were round her and for one second she clung close to him as he kissed her then even while his fire burned close to her so that it mingled with her own blaze and while the ringing of the music that was mystically one with it drowned all other sound the real world the actual world which had quite vanished from her consciousness stood round her again menacing reminding appalling her real self her integrity her honour pointed at her in amazement in horror so that through their eyes and not through the eyes of her passion she saw herself and what she was doing and what she was permitting and what she was rapturously welcoming memory loyalty honesty cried aloud at her and though it seemed that she was tearing part of herself away she wrenched herself free oh what are we doing she cried we are both mad and youoh why did you let me why did you make it possible for me let me go edward he had seized her again i cant he said you are mine and you know it its you that i have dreamed of all my life we both dreamed and we have awoke tonight to find it is true again and this time easily she shook herself free of him for that in him which had struggled before which had planned this evening as a farewell to her came to her aid for the moment elizabeth far stronger than he in will was wholly against him and against him he had honourable traitors in his own house we dreamed tonight of impossible things she said and i have awoke again she began to tremble violently as the struggle to maintain that first flush of true vision seized her it had come to her with the flashing stroke of impulse nowand here was the difficultyshe had to keep hold of it edward you see it as i do really she said you know weve been mad mad ah thank god here we are the motor had stopped by the hotel door and already a porter was coming across the pavement to it no we cant leave it like this he said lets drive on for a little just for ten minutes elizabeth he was on the near side of the carriage and tried to prevent her getting up come to your senses she said but it is impossible to meet edith like this he said she will see he considered that for a moment what if she did see was not that exactly what he desired but elizabeth interrupted him she wont because she mustnt she said i can do my share you must do yours get out please next moment he followed her into the hotel at the door of the sittingroom she paused a moment feeling suddenly tired and incapable and she looked appealingly at him as he joined her edward do help me she said i rely on you the tremendous pressure at which she had been living all day helped elizabeth now for reaction had not come yet and whatever at that moment she had been set to do she would have done it with ten thousand horsepower she made a rush of it across the room to where edith lay dropping fan gloves handkerchief on her way and it seemed that edwards help would chiefly consist in listening oh my dear she cried weve gone quite mad both edward and i there is nothing in the world but brunnhilde and siegfried she kissed edith and went on breathlessly turning the deep tumult of her soul into the merest froth siegfried and brunnhilde brunnhilde and siegfried i felt i was brunnhilde darling and i was rather surprised that edward did not kiss me i will now if you like remarked edward taking his cue unerringly yes do youre such a dear for having taken me perhaps you had better not though its a little late you should have done it earlier and besides edith might not like it we must consider edith now after thinking about our own enjoyment all the evening how is the ankle i ask out of politeness dear i dont really care in the least how your ankle is i only care for siegfried oh do lets have supper at once i had no dinner to mention and i am brutally hungry that is the effect of emotion after daddy was charged out pigsticking and was nearly killed i ate the largest lunch i ever remember ah they are bringing it i shall never go on hungerstrike whatever happens to me siegfried that wasnt quite in tune oh edith now help me to pull her sofa up to the table edward then she neednt move at all and how is your ankle i do care really this remarkable series of statements and questions could hardly be called conversation but it served its purpose in starting social intercourse again edith turned to edward is she mad she asked and are you mad too yes he has got dumb madness said elizabeth he hasnt said a word all the evening occasional sighs oh i wish you had been there edith yes certainly soup for the third time i inquire about your ankle looking up she caught edwards eye for a moment he was eagerly gazing at her as siegfried gazed at brunnhildethat was in some opera she had once seen in remote ages ago in some dim land of dreams inand as she looked at him the stream of her babbling talk froze on her lips and her heart beat quick and she was back again in the darkness of the motor and she was saying to him yes siegfried without thought of anything but the present moment and of her love then with a sense of coming from some infinite distance she was back in this sittingroom again conscious that edith had said something and that she had not the remotest notion what it was but edward answered that is capital he said i am glad it is better of course you and elizabeth will drive down in the motor tomorrow morning so that you neednt walk at all when will you go i must tell joynes at what time he is to come round so he edward also belonged to his world not to the world of the mountaintop and the ring of flame of course he did he was going to marry edith on october th and it was not yet certain if she herself would be there or not she would be leaving about then for indiait depended on whether she could get a passage by the boat that left marseilles on the th she felt like a child saying over to itself some absurd nonsense rhyme july august september then octoberthirty days hath october it did not sound right quailyes why not quail so little while ago she lay on her mountaintop and siegfried loosed her armour and kissed her supper was over and edith was saying something to her about her looking very tired she was suggesting that she should go to bed for herself she was going to sit up a little longer and have a chat with edward for he had to coach her thoroughly in the opera since mrs hancock was never to knowat least not at presentthe true history of the evening elizabeth found herself laughing at that it seemed so unnecessary to say that mrs hancock must never know the true history of the evening nor must edith herself ever know the true history of the eveningnever never there was no question of not for the present about that but that mrs hancock should not know the mere fact that she and edward went to the opera alone seemed a ludicrous stratagem laughable what a tangled web we are going to weave all about nothing she said i warn you edith i shall be sure to forget and let it out oh mother would be horrified said edith you must take care elizabeth sat down and took one of edwards cigarettes somehow her revulsion of feeling against him had altogether vanished and her yearning for him was stealing back again like pain that has been temporarily numbed and begins to reassert itself the dream the impossibility was that on october th he was going to marry edith it was quite incredible a mere piece of nonsense that she had heard down at some dreamplace called heathmoor where everybody was fast asleep it was just part of the dreams of one of them of aunt julia perhaps who certainly had no pains or joys only comforts she herself had to humour the dreampeople saying things to those drowsy people of whom edith was one which really had a meaning but not for them but have we really done anything so awful she asked is it highly improper that edward and i should go to the opera together there were about two thousand people there to chaperone us and a lot of them were so respectablebald men and stringy women she laughed again did you see the one just behind us edward she said im sure you did she had been out and got caught in a sudden shower of diamonds she was peppered with them there were several on her forehead and i think one on her nose oh dear and why that asked edith because i feel quite mad and because i am afraid i shall recover i suppose i shall go to heathmoor again tomorrow there will be lind there and mr martin and andany other place would be as bad it isnt that heathmoor is more impossible than london or india or any other place would be yes ill remember that you sprained your ankle after the operaabout now in fact and then i helped you to bed and then i went to bed myself exactly as im going to do oh im so tired goodnight siegfried and brunnhilde edward you are a darling for taking me next minute she was alone in her bedroom and there shot through her like fire a pain agonizing and contemptible which she had never known before the intolerable torture of jealousy seized her and she writhed in its grip as clearly as if the scene was before her eyes she knew what was happening next door she could almost hear edith saying in that quiet sincere voice of hers now we shall have a little time alone edward i thought dear elizabeth was never going is she not queer and excited tonight and she would hold out her hand to him and he would sit on the edge of her sofa holding it in his and he would bend to kiss her not once not once only they would whisper together the words that were natural and proper between pledged lovers the words that but an hour ago he was burning to say to her now she made no doubt he was glib with them to edith and yet an hour ago she had wrenched herself away from his arm and his kiss with horror and upheaval of her nature of that horror there was nothing left now in the hour of the first onslaught of jealousy now it was inconceivable to her that when he had offered her what she longed for the thought of which given to another made her writhe with jealousy she could have rejected it she had repulsed him for wanting to give her what her whole heart cried out for and what was hers though he had already sworn it away to another he had not met her then he did not know that she was ordained for him even as he for her and now just because he had promised like a child not knowing what he promised he was giving all that by right was hers to a girl whom he did not love for a moment that thought namely that edith was nothing to him assuaged her she might as well be jealous of a dog that he caressed and mumbled nonsenselove to and her rage turned against herself for having been so insane as to give him scruples instead of welcome what if she went back now into the room she had so lately left and said to edith let him go you will have to let him go it is not you he cares for what if she challenged him to say which of them he chose she knew well what his answer would be inconceivable as was her folly in rejecting him equally inconceivable was her mood on that morningwas it only the morning of todaywhen she walked about the dewy garden in an ecstasy of happiness at the knowledge of her love she had thought it was sufficient to love it had made her happy to do that but she had understood nothing of its nature then it was only when she saw brunnhilde awake to siegfrieds kiss that she had begun to understand and the full understanding had come when edward clasped and kissed her and she for that moment had clung to him only to push him away to thrust from her just that which she wanted which her whole soul needed it was but a foolish fairytale she had told herself among the roses and sweet peasa tale of sexless bodiless love fit for a sunday school or a biblereadinga tale of white blossoms and white robesa thing for children and old maids the inquisition had another pair of pincers heating for her they were ready now and glowing what if his moments heat and flash of desire for her was but the fruit of excitement but the froth which the music had stirred up in him certainly it had been easy to quell it she had but to tell him to let go of her and he obeyed to get out of the motor and then he stood on the pavement she despised his weakness for surely a man who was in earnest who was stirred even as she was stirred not by some mere breeze of attraction or by the excitement of a stimulated scene but felt the hearts need would not have relinquished her as easily as that yet it looked to her in unreasoning agony that it was so for now he was with edith indulging in more madrigals no doubt yet when she thought as collectedly as might be for a second she had the cold water ready for those pincers she knew really that what she now called his weakness was in reality of the same stuff as her own strength that which made her strongthat grotesque angular old image called honourwas one with the reason of his yielding to her she was left alone with that now next door a precisely similar idol presided over the two whom she raged to think upon yet if he had not so easily succumbed to her strength or if to put it more truthfully if they had not both been held in by the force that restrained the hot impulse that governed that laid cool hands on the reins he had flung away would she so she asked herself now have continued to persist have ranged her will and purpose against his till there was no more courage left in her she did not know swift and decisive though the struggle had been it seemed to have taken all the force of which she was capable to make it at all for the moment there was remission for her at the hands of her jealousy and she walked across to the window and stood behind the curtain looking out on to the moonemblazoned river the floodtide was at its height and the reflection of the lights from the farther bank lay on the lakelike surface in unwavering lines stars and moon burning in the blaze of an everlasting day and something in the calm of the night in the eternal progress of those shining worlds gave her a momentary tranquillity so that she was able to ask herself this question on the answer to which all depended with a mind aloof from herself how long her will could have held out against her love she did not know but she knew she would not have chosen to yield and at that moment she had won had she but known it the first real battle of her life for that moment she stood with her banner waving round her the next she was back in the thick of the melee again without tactics without any sense of there being any one in command of the army she fought with or even of herself being but a unit in an immense warfare she felt utterly alone struggling yet hardly knowing why knowing only that the odds against her seemed desperate chapter ix edwards absence the injury to ediths ankle which according to the authorized version had happened on their return from the opera to the hotel gave more trouble than she had expected and ten days after its infliction she was still a limping pedestrian this morning she was whiling away the halfhour that would elapse before the motor took her out with her mother in a long chair in the strip of shade just outside the drawingroom window with an unread paper on her knees hearing rather than listening to elizabeths stormy performance on the piano the agitation that sounded there was not confined to those musical excursions for ever since that night at the opera there had been something about elizabeth that her cousin would have summed up in the word queer had not other circumstances and other people been queer too she would probably have been content to define without analysis as it was she had spent a good deal of time during this last week in attempting to penetrate this queerness of elizabeth and seeing if it fitted in with other oddities and she had come to the uncomfortable conclusion that they were not unconnected very small phenomenamore remembered now than noticed at the timehad announced like horns faintly blowing the train of circumstances that were growing peaked like a volcanocone and promised eruption such for instance had been her sense that something had happened on the afternoon when edward had interrupted elizabeths practising it was barely noticeable at the time but it tended to confirm her view of subsequent happenings which began to take shape and substance in her mind on the evening of the opera that night elizabeth had been rather oddly excited and though an excited elizabeth was a daily if not an hourly phenomenon her excitement then had been of peculiar texture though not given to similes it had represented itself quaintly enough to ediths mind under the image of elizabeth holding some young living thinga puppy or a kittendown in a bucket of water to drown it while to draw off attention from her employment she had been wildly and incoherently talkative at the time it had struck edith that her excitement was not merely a reaction from the climax of music and drama she was certainly attempting to drown something and while her tongue was voluble with vivid talk her fingers were holding something down shrinking but resolute this was not wholly an affair of memory and interpretation the impression had been conveyed to edith at the time and now taken in conjunction with other events and conclusions it assumed the importance of a cipher when a numeral is prefixed to it and the numeral without doubt was edward for on the night of the opera after elizabeth had gone to her bedroom edward had lingered for a talk and he had been as inanimate as elizabeth had been vivid as grey as she had been rainbowed he was absentminded preoccupied inaccessible he had nothing enthusiastic or enraptured to tell her about the opera which had so stirred his companion and yet when questioned he said that so far from being disappointed with it it had been magnificent to her comment that elizabeth had seemed to enjoy it he had for reply that he believed she did half a dozen times he had tried to rouse himself and for a few minutes had pulled himself up by muscular effort as it were to a normal level but as often as he thus exerted himself he fell back again below the surface below waves and waters and once more her own image of elizabeth trying to drown something occurred to her then again edward would ask after her injured ankle and not listening to her reply repeat his inquiries he suggested a train for their return next morning to heathmoor having himself arranged half an hour before they were to drive down in his car finally edith halfamused halfpiqued with him had told him that whether he knew it or not he was tired and had better follow elizabeths example and go to bed for a few minutes after that he had roused himself to the performance of the little loverlike speeches the touches and hints of their relationship it had never been the habit of either to be demonstrative but tonight these attentions seemed to her purely mechanical things wooden and creaking not the result of the fatigue with which she had saddled him since that night instead of seeing him as she was accustomed to do every evening on his return from town she had not once set eyes on him he had telephoned next day that stress of business kept him that night in london a thing that occasionally happened but the same stress of business it appeared had prevented his coming down to his house next door ever since a sunday had intervened and he had merely told her that he was engaged to pay a weekend visit and this morning a further note had come saying that a similar engagement prevented his coming down on the saturday that was at hand it was true that he had written to her with frequent regularity for every morning presented her with a note from him but those communications were of the most unsatisfactory description with perfunctory regrets for his continued absence and perfunctory assurances of the imperativeness of the employments which detained him once he had said that the hot weather had pulled him down from the usual serenity of his health and visited him with headaches but her inquiry and sympathy on this point had brought forth no further allusion to it he was still staying at the savoy hotel for while work was so heavy it was not worth while getting to heathmoor late in the evening only to leave by the early train in the morning this he said would only add further fatigue to a fatiguing day and he had clearly written in between lines i should not set eyes on you even how is your ankle these notes as has been mentioned arrived with regularity but they were not the only communications received at arundel from him twice to ediths knowledge elizabeth had heard from him and allowing herself now to suspect everything and everybody edith imagined that her cousin had heard oftener than that for the early post was delivered at the house an hour before breakfasttime and was sent up to the rooms of its various destinations but a week ago now edith by chance had come down before its arrival and when it came had sorted it out herself and seen the neat unmistakable handwriting and today in obedience to a definite jealousy and suspicion she had come down early again and again found that edward had written to her cousin this time hating herself for it yet unable to resist she had fingered the envelope and come to the conclusion that there were certainly two sheets in it to neither of these letters had elizabeth made the slightest allusion there remained to colour as it were all these various outlined features with a general wash the aspect of elizabeth the impression of her of edward she could only judge by the tenor of his notes and in them he revealed nothing except reticence but elizabeth was here her moods her appearance her voice all gave information about her and if edwards notes suggested reticence elizabeth suggested repression it required very little knowledge of human nature luckily for edith since her acquirements in that supreme branch of knowledge were of the most elementary description to see that her mind was beset by some monstrous incubus often she sat silent and absorbed and then with an effort would break into a torrent of brokenwinged high spirits and gaiety which presented the appearance of a fair forgery of her normal appreciative pleasure in life then with equal suddenness she would seem incapable of keeping up this spurious pageant and in the middle of some voluble extravagance she would sink back again into a nervous silence more than once this change had come on the ringing of the front door bell which sounding in the kitchen passage was clearly audible from the garden not once or twice only in this last week had edith seen her drop suddenly into a restless silence when this innocent harbinger was heard while with eager and shrinking anxiety she watched beneath dropped eyelids for the appearance of a visitor sometimes some such would appear and elizabeth would soon make an excuse for a visit to the house or a conjecture as to the arrival of the post now up till the moment of her falling in love with edward ediths potentialities for jealousy had remained practically dormant and sealed up in her nature the reason presumably being that she had not cared enough about anybody to be able to wake that greeneyed monster threequarters fiend and onequarter angel from its hibernation for though jealousy is a passion which at first sight seems wholly ugly and contemptible it must not be forgotten that its very existence postulates the preexistence among its ancestors of love love we may say represents one of its grandparents it is always of that noble descent or if it be argued that a passion so utterly mean is wholly lacking in the openhearted trust which so emphatically is in the essence of love it must at least be conceded that love is in the hand that turns the key or breaks the seal of the cell where jealousy lies confined then flings open the door to let the wild and secret prisoner escape and roam the love that is lofty that seeks not its own will no doubt wring its hands in despair to see what sort of intruder it has set loose will use its best efforts shocked at the appearance of this monster to confine it again but without love never has jealousy been allowed to get free to root about among the springing crops of the heart devouring trampling spoiling and in ediths case her love had from the first come mixed with the sense and pride of possession its first act while yet newborn was to set guards round its treasure sentinels to watch today they were wideeyed and alert from inside the drawingroom came the sound of the galloping squadrons of chord and scale and harmony brahms was working up to one of his great intellectual crises with an attack thought out brilliantly manoeuvred before delivering the irresistible assault then quite suddenly the music entirely ceased in the middle of a bar and there was dead silence for half a second edith conjectured the turning of a page but the half second grew and grew and it was clear that it was no such momentary halt as this that had been called simply elizabeth had finished had broken off in the middle an idea an explanation leaped into ediths mind suggested to her by one of her greeneyed sentinels and in her present mental condition sapped as it was by the secret indulgence of a weeks jealousy she was unable to resist testing the accuracy of her conjecture as she was to resist the demands of her lungs for air but in pursuance of her object she waited without moving until the pulse in her clenched hand had throbbed a hundred beats then very quietly she got out of her chair and went softly in through the open garden door into the drawingroom elizabeth was sitting with her back towards her at the writingtable that stood at the far end of the room as edith entered the swift passage of her pen ceased and she sat with her head resting on one hand thinking intently then taking it up again she began writing once more edith had seen enough for her present purpose and she took an audible step forward instantly elizabeth turned round and as she turned she shut the blottingbook on her unfinished letter oh how you startled me she said i thought somehow you had gone out driving with aunt julia edith sat down no the car has not come round yet she said it will be here in a minute we shall pass the postoffice i will post your letter for you elizabeth turned farther round in her chair but her hand still lay on the closed blottingbook oh i was only just beginning a scribble to father she said it will not be ready edith considered the days of the week but she felt that she knew it was not to her father that elizabeth was writing it will just catch the mail if i post it for you she said otherwise it will have to wait another week then it must wait another week said elizabeth jealous people never themselves feel the wantonness and cruelty of their unconfirmed suspicions they only know that these are not suspicions at all but certainties i noticed that you had a letter from edward again this morning she said elizabeth slightly shifted the blottingbook and edith registered the factfor so it seemed to herthat the letter was lying there again said elizabeth edith felt that she was not being wise but jealousy is of all passions the most pigheaded it only says i must know i must know yes you heard from him a week ago elizabeth who had been startled by her cousins entry was cool enough now she perfectly understood what prompted this catechism but little did edith know how gallant a battle was being fought on her behalf by the girl whom she now so utterly distrusted and suspected little also did she know that which elizabeth was using her whole strength to conceal elizabeth laughed she meant to laugh anyhow the effort might pass for a laugh yes i believe i did she said and as for that i rather fancy you have been hearing from him every day naturally did he say in his letter to you when he expected to come down here again he has not told me that no he did not mention it as far as i remember he appears to be very busy he appears to have time to write very long letters to you said edith hatred and resentment flashing out till that moment she had not known that she hated her cousin elizabeth opened her blottingbook took out of it her unfinished letter and from under it edwards she slipped them into a piece of music that lay there and holding it in her hand stood up and left the table what do you know about the length of his letter to me she asked edith saw her mistake the instinct that said i must know i must know had been wonderfully illinspired in its notions of how to find out i happened to take it up it was a thick letter she said hopelessly trying to efface her steps giving as reason an irrational excuse i dont know the thickness of edwards letter to you said elizabeth it is no concern of mine how many sheets he writes you she paused a moment you speak as if you resent edwards writing to me at all she added edith saw that she could get at nothing in this way swiftly and unexpectedly she shifted her attack answering elizabeths comment by another question why does he keep away from heathmoor she said elizabeth had not been expecting anything of this kind she winced as from a blow and had to wait a moment before she could trust her voice to be steady has he not told you she asked i thought it was work during the week and a couple of visits for the sundays that he is away two instincts were dominant in edithlove and jealousy inextricably intertwined disputing for mastership love and its yearning anxietya cord so to speak of which jealousy held the other end pulled her here but its so strange of him she said and his letters are strange i dont understand it at all cant you help me to understand elizabeth you are so much cleverer than i has it anything to do with music there was no mistaking the sudden and piteous sincerity of her tone half a minute ago she had been all anger all hate all suspicion now she appealed to her whom she had hated and suspected elizabeth felt her eyes grow suddenly dim if i were you i wouldnt worry edith she said i should be quiet not let my thoughts run away with me andand trust that everything is all right then there is something wrong asked edith i didnt say that i didnt mean to imply it take it that he is busy that he has visits he feels he must pay why should he conceal things from you why should you assume there is anything to conceal edith instinctively shrank from making the direct accusation which all this week her jealousy had been dinning in her ears so that her head rang with it elizabeth would simply deny it but it would put her on her guard here jealousy was busy to prompt and the chance of finding out more would be lost her emotion had narrowed and enfeebled the scope and power of thought she could make no plan i am very unhappy she said simply elizabeth took a step towards her i am sorry for that dear she said butbut dont make yourself unhappy dont contribute to it the expected summons came and even as the wheels of the motor crunched the gravel lind sounded the gong and mrs hancock entered the household books had proved at least a sovereign less than she had expected also the coral necklace with the pearl clasp had come back from the jewellers in its new case with ediths initials on it she felt that these two delightful phenomena were somehow dependent on each other the money she had spent on the new case seemed to be returned to her by the modesty of the household books dearest are you ready she asked edith let us start at once and we can go round by the old mill and what delicious tunes you have been playing elizabeth my dear edward will think you have got on when he hears you again why you hardly limp at all this morning edith i knew that the lotion i gave you last night would make you better mrs hancock settled herself among her cushions she had lately got a new one rather stiff and resisting which admirably supported the small of her back the footstool from the stores continued to give complete satisfaction and such a lovely day she said just not too hot oh what a jolt and yet i hardly felt it at all with my new cushion i see there has been a dreadful accident in a welsh colliery so sad for the poor widows and families what a lot of misery there is in the world but as mr martin says we should not dwell on it too much for fear of dimming our sense of thankfulness for all our blessings and edward have you heard from edward when is that naughty boy coming back you will have to scold him dear for neglecting you while he absorbs himself in making money there did you not hear the cuckoo just say cuckthere is a rhyme about it yes edward is really quite greedy stopping up in london like this to make money yet after all dear you must consider that he is working for you making himself rich for you edith turned round sharply so sharply in fact that her mother was startled for sudden movements were not characteristic of her do you really think that is all mother she said and if so how about the sundays he was not here last sunday and he is not coming down for next sunday but what do you mean edith asked mrs hancock you have not had a quarrel or anything what edith could not say to her cousin was possible now no we have not quarrelled she said but what if he doesnt even care to quarrel what if he has ceased to care at all orit came out with difficultyor if he cares for somebody else mrs hancock was sufficiently disturbed not to call attention to another cuckoo that in defiance of the rhyme was still gifted with complete speech but what a wild and dreadful idea she said have you any reason for supposing so so far could edith go but she could not tell her mother that she had definite suspicions that affinities attractions had begun to exert their force between her lover and elizabeth the chief feeling that kept her silent was pride the confession would be humiliating she would be acknowledging herself as having failed to feed the affection she had inspired her love for him genuine though it was and the best of which her nature was capable was not large enough to make her drown herself she still kept her own head above water not guessing that it is through the drowning the asphyxiation of self that the full life of love is born a second cause of reticence less dominant was her belief in edwards loyalty it was overlaid with suspicion which ivylike covered it and thrust pushing tendrils between the stones of its solidity but beneath all this rank growth it was still there she did not yet quite soberly believe all that she suspected she sat silent a moment to her mothers huge discomfort weighing her pride in the balance and confusing it with her loyalty if it were not for his absence i should not have any reason she said but i dont understand his absence the gospel according to mr martin was of the greatest assistance on this point then my dear dismiss it altogether said mrs hancock with relief why it was that very point that mr martin spoke of last sunday ah i remember you could not go to church because of your ankle but he told us that we ourselves were responsible for most of our own unhappiness and that if we only determined to feel cheerful and thankful we should find the causes of thankfulness being multiplied round us was it not a coincidence that he preached on that very subject one can hardly call it a coincidence indeed one feels sure there must have been some purpose behind it what lovely sunshine is it not and there is the old mill so picturesque tell denton to stop a moment and let us look at it a pause was made for the contemplation of this particular cause for thankfulness and mrs hancock put up her parasol to temper the other well that is nice she said shall we drive on i have never heard mr martin more convincing and eloquent and im sure he practises what he preaches for he has always got a smile and a pleasant word for everybody so dismiss it all from your mind dear and ill be bound you will find edward coming down here before many days are past just the same as ever showing how right mr martin is for your cheerfulness will be rewarded i see nothing odd in his having to stop up in town all the week and as for his going away for a couple of sundays to see his friends what could be more natural you would not wish him to be without friends i am sure or to shirk the claims of friendship and since you said that his absence was your only ground for your dreadfully foolish idea i think we may consider that weve disposed of that now let us look about us and enjoy ourselves oh theres a windmill how its sails are going round mrs hancock cast a slightly questioning glance at her daughter to see if mr martins wonderful prescription was acting at once like laughinggas and finding that edith still sat serious and silent proceeded to administer other fortifying medicines he has often told us to busy ourselves with plans and thoughts for others she said and there again how he practises what he preaches he has had the diningroom repapered since mrs martin thought it was a little gloomy and has given her the most beautiful new carpet for her sittingroom and im sure ive never been happier in my life than this summer with all your future dear to plan and scheme for and with elizabeth as well to think about i must say i havent had a moment to think about myself even if i had wanted to her kind face beamed with such smiles as mr martin considered to be symptomatic of the christian life ive got a plan about elizabeth she said though its a secret yet but i should like to tell you about it i am thinking of making a proposal to elizabeth and suggesting that she should not go back to india as early as october there is no great affection between her and her stepmother and i expect she often feels very lonely and unhappy there with no music and as far as i can judge only soldiers to talk to dear elizabeth i think she is enjoying our quiet life at heathmoor i dare say that after those dreadful wildernesses and jungles in india it seems to her one round of excitement and pleasure and parties and operas all given her free indeed i have a further plan still which will make her quite wild with pleasure i am sure i am thinking of asking her to come with me to egypt and i have written to ask uncle bob about it just to see if he will allow it before i say anything to her of course he would pay for her journeyand indeed it is all on the way to indiaand her hotel expenses but i should not dream of charging her for her share of our sittingroom if we have one i shall go shares with edward in that and i dare say the servants at the hotel would not expect her to tip them mrs hancocks plans for other people always necessitated a certain amount of interpretation it was important to look at them from her point of view here the interpretation was easy it had occurred to her that she would be rather lonely when edith and edward left after their marriage and that in egypt it would be pleasant to have somebody in constant attendance on her since the other two presumably would want to make all kinds of expeditions that she herself might not care to join in she liked elizabeths vitality and fervour finding it stimulating this point she touched on next i declare elizabeth is as good as a tonic she said with all her high spirits and gaiety though for the last ten days she has not been quite so lively i dare say it is the hot weather though to be sure she ought to be used to that here we are on the heath again we shall be at home in ten minutes how quickly we have come well my darling i do think i have managed to disperse your clouds for you this morning i dont think edwards absence will give you any more anxiety now that we have talked so fully about it there is nothing like talking a thing thoroughly over you will see that it will not be long before his stress of work is finished perhaps he is making quantities and quantities of money for i hear that sometimes on the stock exchange people make fortunes in quite a short time would not that be exciting mrs hancock as has been seen had a great belief in the imitative instinct which she interpreted by means of her own to her it meant that if she herself felt thoroughly content and happy it was certain that those round her would feel happy too for she diffused happiness in the same way if she felt very well she knew that she diffused a spirit of health it was a comfortable belief like all the clauses of her creed and she would have been quite incredulous if she had been told that all she had done was to accentuate ediths suspicions by her allusion to elizabeths diminished liveliness and to depress her thoroughly at the thought of elizabeth joining them on the egyptian tour and had edith known how elizabeth had been spending this last hour while her mother had been so rich in unconvincingness she would have known how solid her suspicions really were the girl had gone up to her bedroom after the motor had started in order to be secure against any further interruption and had again read through the letter she had received from edward that morning which as edith had ascertained contained two sheets she heard his voice in the pleading sentences it seemed to her as she read with eyes that ever and again were too dim to decipher the words that he was actually talking to her and she could not interrupt him argue with him as she would have done if he had been here she had to fight the cumulative effect of those closewritten lines he besought her to allow him to come down for it was at her instance that he stayed away and tell edith all he scouted as childish the idea that absence could make any difference that he could forget what she had called the excited madness of that evening above all again and yet again with a lovers clamorous iteration he begged her to see him elizabeth sat with this letter in front of her for a long time after she had finished reading and rereading it letting her tears have their way with her in strange guise had the soft god come to her girt about with bitterness and impossibilities she raged at herself for loving him she reviled this torturing demon that others found so sweet but how she longed for the changed transfigured aspect that he burned to show her once for mere relief of heart she filled a page with scrawled words of love only to tear it up again and once she filled another page with useless denials with cold assertions that edward was nothing to her that she was perfectly indifferent to him that too was fruitless he knew she loved him and even if she could have convinced him that it was not so she could not have brought herself so to convince him to deny the most sacred truth that she had ever known she could no more have done that than she could accept the love which brought misery on another and rose from the ashes of a broken promise if there was no binding force in loyalty all ties were dissolved after a while her sobs grew quieter and she tore up the letter she had begun to him when edith that morning had come in from the garden till then elizabeth had not known that her cousin suspected anything that she had begun to put the real construction on edwards absence now it was necessary to quiet those suspicions to let edward know also in a way she could not convey by letter that while edith claimed his promise that promise could not be broken for any reason whatever nothing in the world seemed so certain as this edith must voluntarily give him up before then she carefully erased that sentence that contingency was not to be thought of yet elizabeth felt utterly weary and confused and heartsick obstacles menacing and monstrous faced her in whichever direction she turned perhaps edwards presence would only confirm and strengthen ediths suspicions and lead her to the certainty which she suspected yet if edward continued to be absent that would lead to a break on his side at his initiative and it was that above all that must be avoided if he threw her over said he could not marry her the hosts of hell and heaven combined would not be able to bring elizabeth to him she could not take what by right was ediths against ediths will it was possible and more than possible that edith might see he did not love her and not release him only but bid him begone and yet edward had never loved her while she loving him in her own manner had been content with his liking and friendly intimacy when she knew that his heart had been awakened but not for her would she still desire that moonlight when his sun had risen on another land elizabeth as she finished her letter to edward felt that she had not the slightest idea the letter got written and no word of tenderness or love appeared in it it might have been penned by some fossil of a family friend and written in prehistoric ink for if she had not written like that there was but one other way in which she could write to him and she would have said i am coming to you the thinnest partition but a partition the most impenetrable insulated her from him on this point her will stood utterly firm in this short dry note she did not attempt to argue the question she merely told him that he must come down at once and put an end to ediths intolerable suspicions but for you to break your engagement to her will not bring me one step nearer you were the concluding words whether she was acting wisely or not whether there was not some step she could take later that would be cleverer more tactful she could not consider the situation was simple enough and they had to wait for edith to decide its solution the thing was done that cold hard little sentence that finished her letter was written all this last week of his absence she had wondered whether her will would stand firm enough to enable her to tell him that and to make no other answer to his pleading she knew that when he came down as he assuredly would on the next day she would be obliged to see him to let him in justice state the case for himself but she had now her own word to bind her she would be able by memory to recapture the spirit of the moment when she wrote it it was her definite decision and the knowledge of it would fortify her she would need it she felt when she was face to face with him and her overwhelming need of him a resolution taken and embedded in the mortar of fact always gives relief even if a deathsentence is involved in it the acute edge of suspense is removed and when elizabeth having posted her letter strolled out again into the garden she was conscious of a certain tranquillity to which for the last ten days she had been an utter stranger she did not suppose that there was anything more than a lull in the tempest she knew that it must again howl and buffet round her but even as on the night after the opera she had felt a momentary calm as she looked at the moonlit floodtide so now she was given another respite but now she felt securer she had gained a little ground she could look out over the contention and estimate the odds against her as less desperate it was just here she had walked on the dewy morning in ecstasy of unreflecting happiness when the instinct to give thanks to some one first came to her today she saw the triumphant riot of midsummer under a noonday sun and she no less than the garden was surrounded by the burden and heat the dew and freshness had faded from the cool petals and the heavy heads of the roses drooped on their stems but with brimming eyes and bitten lip she encouraged herself to exhibit a sturdier pluck than they she would not yield she would not hang her head she would whatever the issues might be be grateful to the power that had come into her soul the power to love ignorantly ten days ago she had thought that sufficient now with greater knowledge she wondered whether her ignorance had not told her right after all then it seemed to matter nothing so long as she loved now just for a little while she knew it mattered nothing she caught a glimpse as of snowpeaks behind stormclouds of a reality so lofty so serene that she almost distrusted her eyes suddenly her mind sped on its magic flight to the low white house at peshawar from which so often she had lifted her eyes up through the heathaze to the quivering lines of eternal snows to the steadfast peaks that rose above all dust and stormcloud and she smiled as she recognized by what association of ideas her mind had winged its way thither the gardens there would be withered in the heat but she yearned for the scene where life had been so unperplexed above all she yearned for her father who even now retained the simplicity of youth she yearned for his comradeship his wisdom his patience his sympathy she could have told him all the trouble so easily and confidently she could hear him say lizzie dear i am so sorry but of course you had to do just what you did she could have argued with him taking the side of her longing and love telling him that nothing could be counted or reckoned with against the fact that she and edward loved each other and again she could hear him say my dear i know you dont think that really and then she could have said no no i dont mean it and have sobbed her heart out against that rough homespun jacket which he wore in the garden the garden at the end was a low wall over which one night she had vaulted when just outside lay the dying brahmin to whom a beggars death by the wayside needy indigent was a triumph that transcended all telling was the finding of that which all his life he had sought his eyes already dim in death were open not upon death but life he had renounced all the fair things that the world offered to find something infinitely fairer round him tired hungry dying the banner of some stupendous triumph waved how had he reached that by seeking and how had he sought by renunciation and what had he found life the moment had worn the vividness and splendour of a dream and elizabeth was again conscious of the heavyheaded flowers and the noonday heat the wheels of the motor scraped on the gravel sweep at the other side of the house and in another minute she would be plunged back in the deeds and the needs of every day but she no longer felt so utterly alone and desolate far behind the storm she had seen the snows and for a moment the moonlight had shone on the face of the dying brahmin there was some tie between them all something that expressed itself in the peace of the great silence and in the vision of the dying eyes andwas she not right in hopingin the choice she had just made there was one thread running through them there was a factor common to them all and here was mrs hancock coming into the garden my dear is it wise to be out in this sun without a hat she asked you have had a nice quiet time for your practising havent you i was telling edith that i felt sure edward would think you had got on when he comes down here again chapter x edwards return elizabeths letter to edward had pressed upon him an immediate return to heathmoor at the cost of his weekend engagement if such existed to them both the desire of their hearts for each other had been revealed on that night of the opera as chaos suddenly made manifest by a flash of lightning and on all considerations it had been more decent and wise that he should absent himself but as elizabeth had foreseen this absence could not indefinitely continue since it implied absence from edith as well as herself and was but of the nature of a temporary measure to give breathingspace and time for reflection she had told him but not with confidence that absence would restore his legitimate allegiance poor girl she had but little trust herself in the mildness of that prescription which was so to speak but a dose where the knife was called for in any case ediths revealed suspicions had rendered his return necessary whatever the solution of that knot into which the heartstrings of three young folk were tangled it must be dealt with by his presence here for both girls the interval before he could answer whether his reply was an argued negative to elizabeth or an affirmative announcement to edith passed in acute discomfort that rose and fell like the ebb and flow of the physical pain of some deepseated mischief into crises of anguish and numb reactions there was not an employment there was scarcely a topic of conversation that did not conduct them sooner or later to an impassable road where was a red flag and a danger signal the hours passed in broken conversation and aching silences with edith sentinelled about by her fears and jealousies elizabeth torn with longings and hearing amid the troubled peace of her renunciation voices that accused her of bitter cruelty to herself and to him and poured scorn on the tragic folly of her refusal twenty times that day she felt she could barely resist the need of telegraphing to him cancelling her letter and acceding to his imperative desire of simply taking the next train up to town going to him and saying i have come but her will renounced him still and her will still dominated her deeds and all the time she knew that edith watched her with sidelong glances that were quickly removed when her own eyes met them sometimes it seemed that edith must speak so intense was the miserable strain but she always shied away at the last moment over those palpitating duellists who never quite came to blows presided mrs hancock unconscious and bland foolish and voluble she had experienced a moments discomfort this morning when edith spoke to her of edwards continued absence but as mr martin would have her do she dismissed it with complete success from her mind telling herself that she had quite cleared it all up and made edith comfortable again the obvious constraint that hung over the two girls she merely refused to admit into her mind it might batter and ring at the door and there was no need for her even to open that door a chink and assert that she was out she sat and knitted at her crossovers and in the evening played patience refusing to hear the signals of distress and trouble next day came a telegram from edward to edith announcing his arrival at halfpast seven that evening and asking or rather supposing that he might dine with them it was delivered at lunchtime and edith as she tore it open glanced at elizabeth opposite and saw the sudden whiteness of her face saw that she sat with her fork halfraised to her lips then put it back on her plate again that she waited with hand pressed to the table to control its trembling his message gave rise to debate for mrs hancock and edith were engaged to dine at the vicarage that night and a small solitary dinner had already three hours before been ordered for elizabeth there was to be a slip a lamb cutletquite enough and not too much of course it would be natural said mrs hancock to ask him to come and have a little dinner with you dear elizabeth and then you could amuse yourselves by playing to each other afterwards till edith and i returned and then edith and i could have made an excuse to get away perhaps at ten or even five minutes before but now your dinner is ordered it is very provoking and mrs williams edith interrupted watching elizabeth narrowly her jealousy seemed to have divided itself into two camps part and for the moment this was the stronger allied itself with this scheme if elizabeth and edward had an evening together things if there were things would declare themselves there would be an answer to that eternal question i want to know i want to know thats a delightful plan mother she said and surely mrs williams has got some cold beef edward says nobody can need more than plenty of cold beef for dinner he and elizabeth will enjoy an evening together they will talk over the opera and play and we shant be obliged to hurry back from the martins this rather diabolical speech hit its mark elizabeth blushed furiously as she heard the yapping bitterness in ediths voice and it was not only with the rush of the conscious blood that her face flared anger flamed at the innuendo the double meanings in fact i neednt reply to edwards telegram at all said edith and he will naturally come here for dinner elizabeth looked up at her cousin at the moment she completely and fervently hated her oh that wouldnt do edith she said edward would come over here all anxiety to see you and find only me he would be horribly disappointed and make himself very disagreeable i shouldnt wonder if he went straight back to london again that was the first pass of the naked swords between them yesterday they had not come to the touch of the steel and the first bout was distinctly in elizabeths favour elizabeth had not parried only she had attacked and yet it was only with foolish words that could not wound that she had thrust had edith only known her cousin was fighting for her with a loyalty that was as divine as it was human and calling on the loyalty of her lover to be up in arms but her assault with its sharp double meaning only gratified a moments laudable savagery and she instantly turned to her aunt oh aunt julia she said i should so like an evening alone do tell edward you are out he can be here all sunday i want to write to daddy and i want to practise not play but practise well it would put mrs williams out said mrs hancock to know that she had to provide dinner for edward as well for as for letting him eat nothing but cold beef i think she would sooner leave my service than do that edward is a great favourite with mrs williams indeed where she would get provisions i dont know for its early closing and even such shops as we have here are shut i think your plan is the best dear and your father wouldnt like not to hear from you and then theres your practice as well ill write a note to him has everybody finished and which of you would like to drive with me this afternoon elizabeth conscious of her own loyalty did not in the least mind having another thrust at her cousin edith had provoked her edith should take the consequencesthe superficial ones she turned to her it will be a good punishment for edward she said to find that you are out you will be paying him back in his own coin for keeping away so long perhaps he will come round after you get back if i were you i should say i was tired and would not see him edith looked at her with her real anxiety making anxious imploring signals elizabeth saw and disregarded them of course it would be the worst punishment of all for him she said if you let him come round expecting to find you and he found only me alone with my lambcutlet but you mustnt punish him as much as that edith it would be too cruel mrs hancock had passed out of the diningroom on the quest for the longer paragraphs in the morning post and for a moment the two girls faced each other elizabeth was still quivering with indignation at ediths first wanton attack the attack which sounded so friendly and pleasant a salutation and which both knew was so far otherwise and if edith only knew what wrestlings what blind strivings after light elizabeth had undergone for her dont scold him too much she said he is so nice i love edward shall i drive with aunt julia this afternoon or would you like to elizabeth ran upstairs to her room and locked herself in already she was sick at heart for her barren dexterity she had pricked edith with her point made her wince startled her into miserable silence and what was the good of it all it did not even for the moment allay the savage anguish of her own wound she threw herself on her bed and sobbed by soon after eight she had finished her dinner and was sitting in the drawingroom neither writing to her father nor practising for the last halfhour she had had one overpowering sensation in her mind which absorbed the active power of thought and spread itself like a dense enveloping mist obscuring all other perceptionsnamely the knowledge that in the house next door edward sat alone or perhaps walked in the garden longing to catch sight of her over the low brick wall she too would have spent this hour of darkening twilight outside but for fear of seeing him or more exactly but for the longing to see him which she must starve and deny no doubt she would have to see him have to listen to his pleading but it was part of her resolve that she would use all her will to hold herself apart but the thought of him possessed her and she could not concentrate her mind enough even to attempt to practise or to write her overdue letter it had taken all her nervous force to arrive where she was now like a bird after the flight of migration she had to rest to let the time go by without stirring up her activities for any activity she roused seemed to be directed from the cause of purpose that excited it and to be sucked into the millrace that but ran the swifter for an added volume of awakened perception soon mere inactivity became even more impossible than employment and she opened the piano the wonder of music which his love had so magically quickened in her perhaps would not desert her even now and she set herself to study the intellectual as well as the technical intricacies of brahms variations on the handel themes if she could give them any attention at all she felt she could give them her whole attention it was impossible merely to paddle kneedeep in that profound and marvellous sea you had either to swim or not enter it at all she bent her mind to her work as a man bends the resisting strength of a bow she would string it she willed that it should bend itself to its task how marvellous was this artistic vision to the composer the theme was like some sweet simple landscape a sketch of quiet country with a stream perhaps running through it then he set himself to see it in twenty different ways he saw it with gentle morning sunshine asleep over it he saw it congested with winter green with the young growth of spring triumphant in the blaze of summer and gorgeous with the flare of the dying year he saw it with rainclouds lowering on its hills and swelling its streams with gathered waters he saw it underneath the lash of rain and echoing to the drums of thunder he saw it beneath the moonlight and white with starshine on snow suddenly elizabeth held her hands suspended over the keys and in her throat a breath suspended through the maze of melody she had heard another sound faint and tingling that pierced through the noise of the vibrating strings a bell had rung hearing it she knew that unconsciously she had been listening for it with the yearning with which the eyes of the shipwrecked watch for a sail there were steps in the hall a few words of indistinguishable talk and she turned round on her musicstool and faced the door it opened whispering on the thick carpet and edward stood there in silence he held out both hands to her and she rose but she did not advance to him or he to her she felt her lip trembling as she spoke you should not have come she said you told me to come but not to me i told you to come to edith he sat down in a chair near her you have got to hear what i have to say he said you have not heard it yet yes you have written to me i have answered you i cant express myself in writing i can only write symbols of what i mean i understood your symbols very well i am sure you understood mine it seemed to her that the real struggle had only just begun even as he had said what he wrote had only been symbols compared to the awful reality of his presence the short sharp sentence that each had spoken rang with keen hostility in each love was up in arms battling as with an enemy for a victory that must be hard won you speak as if you hated me for coming he said if you do i cant help it she raised her eyes to him oh my dear dont make it harder for me she said its hard enough already i cant bear much more i am going to make it as hard for you as i possibly can said he i dont care what it costs you so long as i convince you you wont even convince me i shall try my best i believe your happiness as well as mine is at stake he paused a moment and his voice which had been low and quiet like hers suddenly raised itself i want you he cried oh can you know what it means to want like that i dont believe you can or you could not resist do you realize what has happened how by a miracle of godsent luck we two have found each other and you think that there can be an obstacle between us there cant be there is nothing in the world that is real enough to come between us you do love me i was wrong when i said i didnt believe you knew what it meant to want when for one moment you clung to me you knew you were real then you were yourself but since then you have held up a barrier between us i am here to tear it down you cant tear it down said elizabeth you shall tear it down yourself i didnt know what love meant when i got engaged to edith that was because i hadnt seen you oh i know two years ago i had set eyes on you but i hadnt seen you it was obvious that i couldnt love just because i hadnt seen you i couldnt unlock my heart without the key and you were the key elizabeth oh elizabeth i worship you oh my darling what is the use of torturing me as you have been doing during these awful days you wont go onyou wont he had left his chair and was kneeling before her with his hands clasped together on her lap as he had said his written words were but symbols compared to the reality they were but as pictures of flames compared to the burning of authentic fire as splashes of paint compared to actual sunshine she could not speak just yet only with the quivering semblance of a smile and eyes that were bright with tears could she answer him but she did not shrink from him nor move and she laid her hands on his edward she said at last and again edward against some inward weight of unacknowledged conviction he allowed himself to hope and bending he kissed the hands that lay on his not now even did she shrink for she could not it was as much as she could do not to respond and she could not respond you see then he whispered at last you see he looked up and faced the tender inexorable love in her eyes i see more clearly than ever she said please dear dont interrupt me not by word or by look even i cant marry you unlessunless edith voluntarily gives you up i cant i cant accept love that can be mine only through your disloyalty through your breaking a promise you have given and i cant let you take my love on those terms it would kill love it would kill the most sacred thing there is no loyalty is as sacred and you mustnt ask her to set you free love can only give only giveit cannot ask for itself he got up wild with impotent yearning inflamed to his inmost fibre but are you flesh and blood he cried or are you somesome unsubstantial phantom that does not feel she rose also with fire of loyalty to meet his fire of passion and flung out her words with a strength that more than matched his violence no i am flesh and blood she said and you know that i love you but love is holier to me than to you i cant love you differently we can never come together while a single thread of loyalty of common honour has to be snapped to let us he interrupted trust your heart my darling he said only trust that i do trust it and i trust yours you know you are battling with not me alone but yourself there is something within you that tells you i am right my cowardice nothing more my fear of unpleasant things for which my real self does not care two straws she shook her head at him then advanced and laid her long hands on his shoulders it is just your real self that does care she said oh my dear i do not mean it is your false self that loves me but it is your false self that has been urging me tonight edwardand again her lips so trembled that she could scarcely speakedward i dont want to spare you one moment of the wretchedness that has come upon us nor would i spare myself if we were not suffering so we should not love so all our suffering is part of our love i dont know why it has happened like this why god didnt allow us to meet sooner and that doesnt concern us it is so what does concern us is not to graft our love on to disloyalty and unfaithfulness it is in our power to do right i cant deliberately choose to find happiness for you or for me in a crime crime yes the worst sort of crime for it is one that is a crime that we should commit against each other i dont thinkand a shadow of a smile hung round elizabeths mouthi dont think i should feel so very bad if i murdered some one whom i hate but in this i should be murdering all that is best in the man i love you are talking wildly he said murder what nonsense i never spoke more deliberately said she again he was stung to a frenzy of impotence and you admit you love me he cried you admit it but of course dontdont be so silly but i cant do it i cant let you go he broke out again and would you have me marry edith you who talk about the sacredness of love elizabeth pushed him gently away from her i dont know i havent had room in me to think about that she said it has taken me wellall my time to think about us he was silent a moment do you think she will let me go when she knows he asked i think she does know at least i think she guesses well i cant tell but i think she loves you i am sure she loves you and it is hard to let go a person one loves its impossible he cried suddenly she may find it so i wasnt thinking of her said he he stretched out his arms wide and towards her elizabeth he cried she wavered where she stood never yet had the balance hung so evenly as when now he made his final appeal to her wordless except for her own name for into that his whole soul went she felt dragged to him by a force almost irresistible from him and her alike for the moment all the ties and considerations of loyalty and honour were loosed he knew only his overmastering need she the intensity of a womans longing to give herself had the choice been then for the first time to be made she would have flung herself to him but the force of the choice she had made before had already made itself firm within her no no no she said and the words were drops of blood then once more she had power to turn from him she went back to the piano to close it and mechanically shut up the music she had been playing from then though she had heard nothing she felt that some change had come into the room from the edge of the field of vision she saw that edward had turned towards the door and she looked the door was open and edith stood there elizabeth let the pianolid slip from her hands and it fell with a bang and jar of wires you are back early she said at least it is early is it not has aunt julia come back no i telephoned for the car and left almost immediately after dinner my ankle began to hurt again the reaction after her struggle had begun in elizabeth though it was for ediths advantage she had done battle it was not for ediths sake and the sight of her cousin suddenly filled her with bitter resentment she felt perfectly sure also that this reason for her return was wholly fictitious she had come back like this for an entirely different purpose elizabeth feigned an exaggerated sympathy oh i am so sorry she said and surely edith it is madness to stand like that i am sure you are in agonies of course you will go to bed at once shall not i ring for filson and then i will telephone and ask dr frank to come round immediately is it very bad poor dear but anyhow you have the pleasure of seeing edward you did not expect to find him here did you did you goaded and selfaccused of a foolish attempt at deceit edith turned to her yes i did she said i thought it extremely probable ah and can it have been for the sake of finding him here as much as for the sake of your ankle which i see you still continue to stand on that you came back edward do you hear edith expected to find you here so she is not disappointed and im sure her ankle feels much better it was scarcely possible to believe that this jeering scoffing girl was the same who five minutes before pleaded with her lover with such womanly strength such splendid selfrepression or that she could have thus battled for the rights of her whom she now so bitterly taunted and indeed the mere identity of edith was but a casual accident elizabeth had ranged herself on the side of a principle rather than the instance of it for the rest after the scene in which she had called upon every ounce of her moral force to aid her she had nervously entirely collapsed with a jar like that of the fallen pianolid then her collapse spread a little farther the angry fire that burned in her for this pitiful subterfuge went out and swaying as she stood she put her hands before her eyes im giddy she said im afraid im going to faint edward took a quick step towards her but she waved him aside and fell on to the sofa edith looked at her without moving you will be all right if you sit still a moment she said and then i think it is you who had better go to bed as edward is here i want to talk to him privately leave her alone edward she is better left alone he paid no attention to this and went to the sofa can i do anything for you he said cant i get you some water or some brandy elizabeth sat up i shall be all right she said i will just sit here a minute or two then i will go edith wants to talk to you sheshe has not seen you for so long slowly her vitality returned and with it for the second time that day the aching sense of the uselessness of her bitter ironical words to her cousin of the sheer stupidity of their wrangle if edith chose to tell a foolish tale about her ankle it concerned nobody but herself it did not matter for one thing only in the world mattered and with regard to that for the present she felt a total apathy she had done her part nobody not even herself could require anything more of her she felt hugely and overwhelmingly tired nothing more at all she got up i shall take your advice edith and go to bed she said if there is anything you want to tell me afterwards please come up to my room goodnight edward not till her steps had passed away up the stairs did either of the two others speak ediths face firm pretty plump showed not the slightest sign of emotion she stood in front of the empty fireplace waving her feather fan backwards and forwards opposite her knee looking at it i think you had better tell me what has happened she said or if you find a difficulty in doing that i will tell you you imagine that you have fallen in love with elizabeth an answer seemed superfluous after a little pause she apparently thought so too and went on still in the same quiet passionless tone i have often watched you and her she said she has used her music as an instrument to encourage you and draw you on that is not so said edward of course you are bound to defend her it is manly of you and what i should expect from you but that does not matter yes it does matter said he throughout the fault has been entirely mine you have got to believe that you do not understand her at all if you think otherwise i do not want to understand elizabeth her nature and mine are so far apart that i do not attempt to understand her what is perfectly clear to me is that she knew that you and i were engaged and she has tried to come between us so far i understand her and for me that is far enough edward looked at her half an hour ago he had wondered whether elizabeth was flesh and blood now he wondered if edith was you are absolutely mistaken about her he said it is she who has been unswervingly loyal to you the disloyalty has been entirely mine i know i cant make you believe it but it is so edith met his eye looking at her steadily without tremor yes you can make me believe it if you ask me to release you from your engagement to me she said do you do that the waving of her fan ceased as she waited for his answer she stood absolutely still a marvel of selfcontrol no i dont ask that he said all the same you must believe what i tell you about your cousin and if i cant i will force you to i will tell you what happened on the night of the opera i will tell you why i have kept away all these days i will even show you the letter from her that brought me back you will have to believe for the moment nothing seemed to matter to him except that edith should believe this and in the silence that followed he watched her face and marvelled at the change that came there it was as if it was possible to see the belief penetrating into her brain and transforming her features even as the thaws of the spring penetrate into the congealed ground softening its outlines and bedewing the spearheads of frozen grass with moisture that percolates and liquefies the icebound tussocks even so edith frozen with jealous hate for elizabeth melted at the words the truth of which it was impossible to doubt for the nature of the proofs he offered was the guarantee for them she had to believe and this unfreezing melted her the crust of her hardness was dissolved and pitiful imperative yearnings welled up from the very springs of her that pierced and flooded the ground that had been sealed to their outflow as far as her will went she banished her bitterness and blame of elizabeth she was herself alone with her lover and her love that was more adamantine than this mere frozen surface of hatred and jealousy had been till that crust was dissolved the inner springs could not flow now it was melted and they flooded her her fan dropped unregarded at her feet and she clasped her hands together i believe you she said it is you whowho are responsible but you dont ask me to release you that is well forfor i cant release you you can refuse to marry me i suppose a man can always do that if he has made a girl love him and has asked her to marry him he did not answer and she went on winding and unwinding her fingers you see i love you she said and i cant let you go and only a few weeks ago you liked me enough anyhow to want me to marry you you thought you would be very well content to live with me always i think that was about it and i felt much the same towards you then immediately when i found you wanted me i began to love you and i love you more and more before that nothing in the world had meant anything to me even if you asked me to let you go i could not still he said nothing and she came up close to him treading on her fan and breaking the ivory sticks of it it would be simply impossible for me she said do you think that by my own act i could give you up and let you marry elizabethas i suppose you would do she pointed through the open window at his house next door could i see you living there with her she asked hear the gate clang as you went in on your return in the evening see the lights lit in the house and quenched again at night and know you were there with her and that i had permitted it never never you can refuse to marry me if you will that is your affair but dont edward dont and her voice broke he felt utterly humiliated by her sudden entreaty it was pitiful it was intolerable that she whom he had sought lightheartedly with a view to comfort and quiet happiness and domestic peace should abase herself to him asking that he should not withdraw so paltry a gift he had known and liked and admired her for years and had offered her not knowing how cheap and shabby was his devotion what was wholly unworthy of her acceptance in return now she gave him unreservedly all she had all she was capable of only asking that his rubbish should not be taken from her and now as he sat there full of cold pity for her full of scorn for himself that he should give her pity and be unable to give her warmth she knelt to him clasping his knees and her beseeching so grovelling so abandoned seemed only to degrade him knowing now that he knew what love was how royal was the gift she brought him he saw himself bankrupt and abject receiving the supplications of some noble petitioner with streaming eyes and voice that choked she besought him just give me what you can my darling she said and oh how content i will be it is so short a time ago that you thought i could make you happy and i canbelieve me i can i was not worthy when you asked me first but i have learned so much since i began to love you and i am worthier now you have always liked me we have always been good friends and you will get over this sudden infatuation for elizabeth i will be so good about that i wont be jealous of her it wasnt your fault that you fell in love with her i will never reproach you for it we shall be so happy together very soon she will go back to india and you will forget i will do anything except give you up once or twice he had tried to interrupt her but she swept his words away in the torrent of her entreaties but here for a moment her voice utterly choked and he put his arm round her raising her dragging her from her knees weeping hysterically she clung to him burying her face on his shoulder and all the tenderness and kindliness in his nature came to him my dear dont talk like that he said soothing her and dont cry like that dry your eyes edith there is nothing to cry about tell me then she sobbed what are you going to do with me still with his arm about her he led her across the room to the sofa where half an hour ago elizabeth had fallen there was no possibility of choice left him and he saw that clearly enough he could not break a promise made to one who loved him the strength of whose love he had not even conjectured before undemonstrative and reticent by nature edith had never yet shown him her heart nor had he known how completely it was his there was no struggle any more there was left to him only the selfhumiliating task of comforting her god knows i will give you all i can he said i will do my best to make you happy but my dear dont humiliate me any more i know that you are giving me all a woman can give a man and it is sweet of you to forgive me i dont deserve to be forgiven there dry your eyes let me dry them for you never never i hope will you cry again because of me ediths sobbing had ceased and with a womans instinct she began to repair with deft fingers the little disorder of her dress oh i will love you so my darling she whispered we shall be happy i know we shall be happy and when i give you the best gift of all when i give you a child and another child yes yes i know he said and how their grannie will love them she shrank away from him a moment at this he had said anything that might comfort and quiet her which came to his tongue and how we shall love them he added quickly there you look more yourself still leaning on him as if loth to let him go she turned her tearstained face round to the mirror above the sofa ah but what a fright she said i shall just go and wash my face and then come back to you mother will be in any minute now and i shall look into elizabeths room shall i not sheshe said she wanted to know the sounds of the arrival of the motor hastened her departure upstairs and next moment mrs hancock came in well it is nice to see you my dear she said but i cant say its a surprise for i told edith i was sure you would look in but wheres edith and wheres elizabeth edward shook hands elizabeth went to bed half an hour ago he said she was not feeling very well edith has just gone upstairs she was going to look in and see how she was mrs hancock sat down to her patiencetable she always played patience when she had been to a party to calm herself after the excitement isnt that like my darling edith she said forgetting all about her ankle ill be bound and even about you though you mustnt scold her for it she will have told you that her ankle began to pain her fancy there is a second king already ring the bell dear edward i must have a little lemonade and no doubt you would like a whisky and soda another acehow provoking mrs hancock had a tremendous belief in her own perspicacity and looking at the young man came to the very distinct conclusion that something had happened his voice sounded rather odd too simultaneously she caught sight of the wreck of ediths fan on the floor her remarkable powers of imagination instantly enabled her to connect this deplorable accidentfor edith was usually so carefulwith whatever it was that had happened perhaps there had been a little tiff over edwards longcontinued absence she summoned up all her tact and all her optimism why if that isnt ediths fan she said she must have dropped it and stepped on it or it would be more like elizabeth to step on it and what a long time you have been away edith was almost disposed to blame you for that until she and i had a good talk together i told her it would never do for you to neglect either your business or your friends once mr hancock was away from me for a month when there was either a slump or a boom in the markets dear me how the old words come back to one though im sure i forget what they mean has it been a slump or a boom dear edward all this last fortnight oh everything has been pretty quiet said he absently he could barely focus his attention enough on what she was saying to understand her upstairs edith had gone in to see elizabethto tell her what had happened i see said mrs hancock with great cordiality and so you have had to watch things very carefully such a pleasant dinner at mr martins and a great deal of wise and witty talk and i have such a lovely plan for elizabeth which i shall tell her about tomorrow so theres no reason why i should not tell you now i mean to let her stay with me after you have taken my darling away all october and november and come with me to egypt so that we shall all meet again our happy little party i have just heard from her father who of course will pay for her travelling expenses and he is quite agreeable if elizabeth likes i quite look forward to telling her she will go mad with joy i think for imagine a girl seeing egypt at her age i am very fond of elizabeth she is lively and cheerful though i think she has felt the heat this last fortnight so affectionate is she not and im not sure she doesnt like her cousin edward best of all of us this amazing display of tactful conversation designed to take edwards mind off any little tiff that he might have had with edith demanded some kind of appreciation from him i should be delighted to know that elizabeth liked me he said you may be sure she does such a common interest you have too in music ah here is edith and my patience is coming out in spite of that horrid ace which blocked me so long we were talking about elizabeth dear and i was telling edward how fond she is of him the poor lady had touched the limit of his endurance i think i must be getting to bed he said not wait and chat while i have my lemonade well dear it is nice to see you again and i have no doubt that edith will see you out and lock the door after you so that i need not ring for lind again edith my darling your fan who could have stepped on it was it elizabeth and has your ankle ceased to pain you edward followed edith out into the hall there was no repressing his anxiety to know did you see her he asked yes oh edward i have been wronging elizabeth so and i am sorry she told me she didnt care for you not one scrap itit had never entered her head i asked her forgiveness for having had such dreadful thoughts about her i dont know how i thought so it has made me quite happy you see she never thought of you and she kissed me and forgave me she lifted her face to his she told me to tell you she said she edward kissed her quickly and stepped out into the black cloudshadowed night chapter xi the telegram mrs hancock was distinctly aware when three days afterwards she started in her motor for a drive with elizabeth that in order to live worthily up to mr martins pattern of the thankful cheerful christian life she had to keep a very firm hand on herself and nail her smile to her pleasant mouth indeed for these last few days she had to set before herself an ideal not of cheerful but of grinning christianity like a prudent manager however she had steadfastly saved up as an allconquering antidote to the depression and queerness which was so marked in elizabeth her joyful plan that should give the girl a month more of heathmoor and her own undivided society and a reunited tour in egypt afterwards at colonel fanshawes expense the prospect of that she felt sure could not possibly fail to restore to elizabeth her accustomed exhilaration and liveliness meantime mrs hancock had carefully forborne to ask either of the girls for edith also had exhibited symptoms of queerness what was ailing with the serenity of life it fitted in with the cheerful gospel to know as little as possible about worrying and annoying topics lest their infection should mar the soothing and uplifting influence over others of a mind wholly untroubled two inquiries only had she made and those were from edward which elicited the comfortable fact that the event of the th of october still remained firm and that he had not lost any money in the city after that she firmly shut her eyes to any possible cause of trouble and though one and that the correct one actually stood immediately in the foreground of her mental vision she by long practice in obedience to mr martins gospel had reached a pitch of absolute perfection in the feat of mental eyeclosing even as a child frightened by the dark can by an effort of will shut out terrifying possibilities by the corresponding physical feat or firmly bury its head under the bedclothes but her victory over these subtle influences of gloom and general oddity had not been gained without effort it had been distinctly hard to maintain an equable cheerfulness with elizabeth sometimes for a little the girl was quite herself with a shortlived flood of highspirited talk sometimes from her sittingroom mrs hancock would hear a flight of brilliant songbirds on the piano but then suddenly the flood would cease from pouring and the flight fail in midair once just after a silence had fallen on the ringing air she had come into the drawingroom to find elizabeth sitting with her hands still resting on the keys and her head bowed forward over them her assertion that she was not ill carried conviction her denial that anything was the matter was less easy of belief but she said it and since successful inquiry might lead to disturbing information mrs hancock fell back on the unimpeachable general duty of trusting everybody completely and in particular of believing what elizabeth said but it required an effort to remain perfectly comfortable for she was surrounded with people who did not appear to be so and edward so it seemed to her though he had lost no money and was going to marry edith on the th of october seemed to have been drawn into what she looked upon as a vicious circlevicious since it was wrong positively wrong not to be happy and comfortable she was not quick or discerning in the interpretation of symptoms nor indeed when she suspected that anything was amiss quick to see symptoms at all but through her closed eyelids so to speak there filtered the fact that elizabeth altogether avoided looking at edward but that he observed her with furtive eager glances that somehow seemed disappointed in what they sought also though elizabeth took spasmodic and violent spells at the piano she never played in the evening when edward was there but had evinced a sudden desire to learn the new patience which mrs hancock had found in a ladies paper mrs hancock did not so much wonder at that for this particular mode of killing time was undoubtedly of thrilling interest and she almost thought of buying elizabeth a little patiencetable for her birthday which occurred in october she intended in any case to look out the article in question in the catalogue from the stores and see how much it cost there would be no harm in that and if it cost more than she felt she could manage why there would be no necessity to say anything about it but then an admirable notion struck herher own table was getting a little rickety it shook when she put cards down on to it also it was rather small for the great fourpack king of mexico which she had fully determined to learn this autumn so elizabeth should have her old table and she would get a new one of size no bevelled edges and adjustable top that it was even more expensive did not trouble her and she impressively told herself that she would not have dreamed of buying it had it not been that she wanted to give dear elizabeth a present in fact though she bought it apparently for herself it was really elizabeth for whom this great expense was incurred and all these rich and refreshing rewardsnamely another month at heathmoor instead of the cobras and deserts of india a tour in egypt and the most expensive patiencetable at the storesshe would announce to her fortunate niece as they went round by the old mill how all the look of trouble and depression would fade from dear elizabeths face as she listened to the announcement of those delicious joys one after the other mrs hancock felt a sudden gush of thankfulness to the kind disposition of providence that had endowed her with the ample income which she was so eager to spend in securing the happiness of others and even while without selfconscious commonplace she felt herself blessed in such opportunities and the will to take advantage of them she could not help feeling how true it was that kindness and thought for others is so laden with gain for oneself for she herself would have a new patiencetable size no with bevelled edges a delightful companion throughout october after edith had left her while elizabeths father would pay her expenses in egypt she could not help feeling also how much more christian and how much more martinesque it was to stifle smother and destroy whatever might be the cause of elizabeths trouble by this perfect shower of causes for happiness rather than inquire into it and thus run the risk of being herself unsettled and made uneasy but it had certainly required an effort she had to put firmly out of her mind not only elizabeths possible worries but also the remembrance of the evening when she had come back from dinner with the martins and thought edwards voice had sounded odd and seen ediths fan lying broken on the floor that had never been explained edith had said subsequently that she supposed she must have stepped on it but it was very odd she should not have noticed it for the breaking of all those ivory sticks must have made quite a loud snap meantime the gong that heralded the arrival of the motor had sounded quite two minutes and elizabeth had not yet appeared mrs hancock thought she would just speak to her on the subject of punctuality and then wipe all impression of blame away by the recital of these prospective benefits elizabeth was not downstairs and it was just possible that she had not heard the gong lind was told to sound it again elizabeth heard it the second time that it boomed and rose from where she knelt by her bed by the side of which five minutes ago she had flung herself following so it seemed to her some blind instinctive impulse that morning there had broken over her a storm of rayless despair for a couple of days after her final rejection of edward when ediths absolute determination not to give him up voluntarily had been known to her the apathetic quiet of the step taken of deliberate renunciation had been hers but it had not been and the poor girl guessed it the peace that is always eventually not only the reward but the consequence of selfabnegation but only the exhaustion that follows a prolonged mental effort ediths choice apart from the tremendous significance it had for herself was incredible and monstrous to her nature she did not question the fact that edith loved edward but the notion of love not seeking the happiness of the beloved was to her inconceivable she could not understand it could not in consequence have the smallest sympathy with it but this she had to take and did take on trust and let depend on it her own unalterable decisionthat decision that as far as she could see took the sun bodily out of her own life from mere weariness she had found in the dull acquiescence in this an apathy that had for a couple of days anaesthetized her against this insensitiveness knowing that it was valueless she had made pitiful little struggles seeking now to establish some kind of sympathy and renewal of intimacy with her cousin now to rouse herself to feel in music the passion with which it had inspired her instead for the present she found she had a shrinking abhorrence of it its beauty had become remote and from its withdrawn eminence its unassailable snowpeaks it mocked her it did more than mock it reminded her of all it had done for her how through it she and edward had been brought together to stand now close to each other embracing overlapping yet with a thin unmeltable ice between them then in due course had come the recuperation of her vital forces and she had awoke this morning after long and dreamless sleep to find that the anaesthesia of her mind had passed off for a couple of minutes perhaps she had lain still in the delicious consciousness of restored vigour and of delight in the new freshness of the early day then as she became fully conscious of herself again she found that what had been recuperated in her was but her capacity for suffering and the blackness of a vivid despair bright black not dull black fell on her more black because she knew that it was a darkness of her own making a word from her to edward would scatter it and let loose the morning she had no doubt of that no doubt that he at her bidding would break the fetters of his promise that bound him as easily as if they had been but a wisp of unwoven straw she told herself and what was the more persuasive she could hear his voice telling her that she was committing a crime against love that she was refusing and bidding him profane the most sacred gift of all she told herself that she was a fool to listen to any voice but that which sounded so insistently but there was yet a voice still and small that was steadfast in its message to her it was not that she cared one jot for the ordinary external consequences of a disobedience to that she guessed that there would be a consensus of opinion in her favour if she disobeyed no doubt they would say it was a deplorable accident that she and edward had fallen in love with each other but once the accident had happened it was best to make the best of a regrettable situation the young man had never been in love with poor edith he had but fallen a lukewarm victim to the influence of propinquity and mrs hancock certainly it was very sad for miss hancock but she was young she would get over it and probably end by making quite a good marriage elizabeth cared little for either the approval or condemnation of the world in general the thought of it was remote and stifled and insignificant but it was edward who called to her called loud called closely and low and she must be deaf not to listen to him not hear him even at whatever cost she had to approve of herself black empty aching an intolerable loneliness she had but one desire apart from the desire of her heart and that was to escape from it all to go away as quickly as possible to be out of sight of what she might not contemplate far away across leagues of hot ocean and miles of plain baking from the summer solstice was her father no one else in the world did she want to see to no one elseif even to himcould she pour out her woe he would comprehend would approve she knew of all she had done not blaming her for letting love so completely envelop her not praising her rejection of it but simply seeing even as she had seen in loneliness and hearts anguish that there was no other course possible she knew that as thoroughly as if she had already opened her whole heart to him there was a letter already written which she had not yet posted now she opened it and added a postscript father dear she wrote i am awfullyawfully unhappy and cant write to you about it but when you get this please send me a telegram saying you want me home at once trust me that this is wiser dont delay dear daddy the pen dropped from her fingers after she had redirected her letter and she sat quite still looking blankly at it she had told edith she did not love edward that she had never thought of him like that if there could be degrees in this abject wretchedness hers was a depth unplumbable yet this colossal lie seemed to her necessary edith believing that her cousin loved edward yet refused to release him of her own will so she was to have him she must be given what was already hers handsomely largely it would be wicked even at the cost of this denial to give him her with a stab so to speak emptiness utter loneliness selfordained she must tell somebody about her misery she must pour out her unshared grief for the burden of it was intolerable with dry blind eyes with the groping instinct to seek just to seek she threw herself on her knees by her bed she knew not what or whom she sought there was just this blind unerring instinct in her soul the instinct of the homing pigeon mrs hancock put up her parasol when the three cushions were perfectly adjusted and the car slid slowly forward i think we shall have time to go round by the old mill she said though we are a little late in starting i wonder elizabeth if you could make an effort to be more punctual dear i dont think there is a person in the world who hates blaming people as much as i do so i dont want or mean to blame you i only ask you to make a little effort it is so easy to form a habit and while you are about it you might just as well form the habit of punctuality as of unpunctuality i am so sorry aunt julia said she ii wasnt thinking about the time no dear that is just it i want you to think about the time a little more there is just a little touch of selfishness and inconsiderateness in keeping other people waiting and selfishness is so horrible is it not edith is never unpunctual though all the time her ankle was bad she got downstairs very slowly but she allowed for that what was the engrossing employment today that kept you i was saying my prayers aunt julia at least i was trying to mrs hancock laid her hand on elizabeths my dear that is a very good reason she said though i am afraid it means that you forgot to say them when you got up its a very good plan elizabeth to say them the moment you get out of bed then they are off your mind oh what a beautiful fresh air there is this morning i think we might almost have my window half down and yours quite down your prayers yes and to think that when you came you didnt want to go to church at all but i felt sure that mr martinwhy there he is do you see in a red coat playing golf fancy what a coincidence he is dining with us tonight and i must be sure to tell him that we saw him just the very moment that i was speaking of him but the only way to get through the days work is to do everything punctually prayers and all then when bedtime comes you are ready for it with nothing left undone to keep you awake and now my dear i have a great deal to tell you and im sure i look forward to doing so it is almost as great a pleasure to me as it will be to you to hear about all the plans i have made for you mrs hancock had settled that her climax was to be egypt the patiencetable perhaps was the least sensational of the benefits and she was going to begin with that i have often noticed lately dear she said what an interest you take in my patience so much so indeed elizabeth that weve had not a note of music in the evening for a week past though ive thought sometimes that i have seen edward looking at the piano as if he would like to hear how you are getting on look there is the old mill will you tell denton to stop so that we can enjoy looking at it so i thought to myself the other night or perhaps a little bird whispered it to me that you would like to play patience too in the evening and so you shall dear you shall have my patiencetable all for your very own and i will get another one for myself mind elizabeth it is not lent you to use only as you use the other things in the house but it is quite yours the moment my other table comes from the stores you may take it back to india if you wish when you go when you go oh that is kind dear aunt julia said the girl but why should you give it me and go to the expense of a new one i enjoy seeing you play just as much as i should enjoy playing myself mrs hancock wondered if this was really true her generosity about taking the table to india which so neatly introduced the next topic had been an unpremeditated flash of course if elizabeth did not want to play patience there was no kind of reason for getting a new table but luckily at this moment she remembered king of mexico which employing four packs could not be properly laid out on the table she at present used my dear i am determined you shall have a table of your own she said to take to india with you if you wish and perhaps you noticed that i said when you go and repeated it that brings me on to my second plan i should enjoy dear i should really enjoy your stopping on here after edith and edward are married then you will no longer share the little treats like having a drive in my motor with edith but you can come out in it whenever i go twice a day if you like and if you like you shall have ediths room and i shall make mrs williams and lind and all of them quite understand that you are to take ediths place you shant be a visitor any more arundel shall be your english home oh aunt julia began elizabeth no wait a minute you shall have all my plans together here you will be all october with your own patiencetable and ediths room until i go to egypt in november and then and then my dear you shall come with me i have written to your father and we have quite arranged it you will be absolutely one of our party and when edith and edward join us as they will do at cairooh look at those starlings what a quantitywhen they join us at cairo we will all go up the nile together and see everything there is to be seen how busy we shall be you and i all october my dear reading all sorts of learned books i am sure you will read aloud very well with a little practice we shall be quite a pair of bluestockings when we meet edith and edward again and be able to tell them all sorts of interesting things about the greeks and ancient egyptians we will take your patiencetable with us for it shuts up more conveniently than any table i have ever seen and i dare say i shall often ask you for the loan of it if you will be so kind as to lend it me and then we shall all come down the nile together such a happy party and i know very well dear elizabeth that when we come to part and you go on to india from wherever it is that the boats call i for one shall miss you very much indeed mrs hancock had warmed herself up into the most pleasurable glow of generosity and felt that all these wonderful plans which as a matter of fact had been made solely with a view to her own comfort were entirely due to her altruistic desire for elizabeths delight her selfdeception was complete and triumphant she had for the time quite lost sight of the undoubted fact that she had thought of herself and herself only in the making of them she had secured an excuse for a new patiencetable a companion during what would have otherwise been a month of loneliness and at no expense to herself of somebody who would look after her in egypt and be devoted to her comfort she fully expected a burst of gratitude a rapturous and scarcely credulous assent from the girl elizabeth sat quite silent for a moment oh aunt julia it is sweet of you she said but i think it is all quite impossible i must go back to india i must get back to father aunt julia still glowed my dear your father has made up his mind to do without you and let you enjoy yourself she said i wrote to him about it oh weeks ago telling him not to allude to it at all to you but that i would tell you he will rejoice in your happiness as much as i elizabeth clasped her hands together on her knee oh i cant i cant she said but thank you ever so much aunt julia indeed i wrote to father only today saying that i wanted to come back to him quite soon sooner than i had planned i cant explain you have been so kind to me i know but i must go back to india as soon as possible simply that mrs hancock recognized the earnestness of the girls tone and all the pleasure and glow faded from her face really i think your words do require some explanation she said to think of me so busy planning and contriving for your pleasure and you saying that you dont want any of my plans yes denton drive on we have looked at the old mill long enough i think you ought to tell me what it all means elizabeth i cant tell you said she try to think it means nothing or that it means only just what i have said it does mean that i want to go back to india if it was possible i would go back today i want to see father i have been a long time away from him and though you andand edith and edward are so kind i miss him dreadfully i am homesick i want to get back mrs hancocks own beautiful architectural designs for elizabeths happiness tumbled in ruins and elizabeths notions of replacing them did not seem in the least satisfactory she who avowedly had planned and contrived for this end found herself accusing the girl of the most barefaced selfishness when she stated what she really wanted apparently she thought about nothing but herself well all i can say at present said mrs hancock is that i am dreadfully disappointed and grieved yes i am sorry put in elizabeth butbut it is quite impossible you mustnt think i am ungrateful aunt julia i do not think you can expect me to praise you for your gratitude said mrs hancock no i dont want praise i dont deserve it but i want to go back to father mrs hancocks sense of illusage of having her kindness met by black ingratitude rankled and grew this was worse much worse than the painful case of the housemaid who suited her so well going away from her service to be married indeed that misguided creaturethe marriage did not turn out very happily and mrs hancock was sure she didnt wonderthe cause of so many bitter memories appeared now as a perfect angel in comparison i must say that i cannot consider this a pretty return for all the indulgences i have showered on you she said i have treated you like my own daughter elizabeth with the piano always ready dusted for you and the most expensive motor always whirling you about the country wherever you like to go and the new table for your patience and never a thing asked of you in return till i suggest that you should keep me company during october and this you flatly refuse and what your father will say i dont know with all his kindness in paying for your tour in egypt when we settled between us to let you come with me all up the nile at a great deal of expense and now all you can say is that you dont want to go and cant explain why and here was i thinking of ordering books on egypt from the london library this very afternoon and even planning going up to london some day this week to make sure of getting places in the sleepingcar to marseilles and you cant explain elizabeth felt suddenly goaded to exasperation at this childs babble of books from the library and tickets for the sleepingcar it was round such things as these that her aunts emotions clung like swarming bees around their queen she felt a wild desire to supply aunt julia with something real to think about something that would really pierce through those coils of comfortpadding that wrapped her up as in eiderdown quilts at present all that ever reached her was a slight disarrangement a minute tweaking of one of her quilts or if by years of habit they were too firmly tucked round her it would be something to let her see that others were not so grossly wadded against the world against reality i will explain if you like she said quickly and almost smiled to see aunt julia huddling her quilts round her clutching them with eager fingers dreading lest they should be taken from her by cruel and inconsiderate hands my dear you havent given me your confidence voluntarily she said in a great hurry and i am the last person in the world to ask for confidence when it is not freely given dear edith has always told me everything but that is no reason why you should do you mean that edith has told you about this asked the girl about your inexplicable rejection of all my plans for you including the patiencetable no certainly not that i imagine concerns you my dear edith would be the last to betray what seems to be a secret elizabeth broke in again but i am offering not to make a secret of it from you she said mrs hancock turned an almost imploring face to her no elizabeth she said you have not come to me with it of your own accord and i was quite wrong to hint that you owed me an explanation if i have hinted so i withdraw it look there is mr beaumont with his butterflynet let us be silent for a little and collect ourselves again our talk was getting very wild and uncomfortable would you kindly put your window a shade more up mrs hancock regarded the view with a severe and compressed face into which there stole by degrees an expression of relief she felt that she had dealt with this threatening situation in an extremely tactful manner elizabeth had not chosen to confide in her and she had put so she told herself all all her natural curiosity aside and refused to hear the secret which had not voluntarily been made known to her that waiving of her personal feelings in the matter had as usual its immediate rewards for she had averted the risk of hearing something thoroughly uncomfortable she dismissed that consideration and in the silence for which she had asked devoted herself to the pained contemplation of elizabeths selfishness which had so much surprised and grieved her hitherto she had not thought elizabeth at all selfish except in the matter of unpunctuality and the discovery was a great blow to her she had quite made up her mind that the girl would jump at those delightful proposals which had been the fruit of so much thought about egypt she did not care so particularly but she felt terribly blank at the prospect of a lonely october with elizabeth taking a real solid interest in patience with the interval between tea and dinner filled in by readings about the ancient egyptians and with a companion for the two daily motor drives she had felt really quite resigned to losing edith since on their return from egypt she would be living again next door and of course would be only too delighted to enjoy her mothers companionship during edwards daily absence in the city and now there had come this earthquake upsetting everything there was a proverb that misfortunes never come singly and she felt an indefinable dread that filson would want to marry next or mrs williams threaten to leave her of course she could raise mrs williamss wages again to stem this tide of disaster but if filson wanted to marryno doubt she could try the effect of raising filsons wages and could point to the awful fate of the housemaid but even that might not prove sufficient if filson loved some hypothetical young man very much then she tried to cling to the gospel of mr martin and determined not to dwell on these unnerving possibilities meantime elizabeth sat silent as requested by her and the kindliness of mrs hancock which existed in large crude quantities and her affection for the girl which in its own way was perfectly genuine came to her aid however startling and deplorable elizabeths selfishness was she was sorry for whatever might be the trouble that lay at the root of it and provided only that trouble was not confided to her was willing and eager to do her best to alleviate it secretly she guessed that edward was concerned in it she guessed also that the girls affections were concerned in it she rejected without difficulty that elizabeth had conceived a hopeless passion for mr beaumont or an illicit one for mr martin and she inferred that elizabeths affections and edward were synonymous terms but that was only a guessshe hastened to assure herself of thatand might really be as insubstantial as she hoped was the shattering notion that filson was engaged in a love affair and she shut the door on it there was poor elizabeths trouble safely locked up and she wondered how she could help her she turned to the girl my dear i am sure you have some trouble she said and though i would be the last to ask you about it is there not anybody you could consult perhaps your wanting to go back to your father means that you think he could help you but is there no one here could you not tell edith if she does not know about it already or there is mr martin you would find him all kindness and wisdom i often think of him as my minddoctor to whom i would certainly go myself if i was worried oh thank you aunt julia said she but i dont think i will worry mr martin i should like to tell daddy about it and i shall but it would be no worry for mr martin said mrs hancock he is so used to hearing about other peoples troubles it is quite his profession he has often said to me that his wish is to bring joy to people and take away their wretchedness such a noble career i cant think why they dont make him a bishop elizabeth gave a little squeal of laughter as unexpected to herself as it was to her aunt i dont think i will really aunt julia she repeated this appeared to mrs hancock another bit of selfishness it seemed to her quite likely that mr martins really magical touch might easily remove elizabeths trouble in which case egypt and the patiencetable blossomed again instead of withering on their stalks but she determined not to give it all up quite yet and abandon elizabeth so it represented itself to her to the moral pit of her selfishness mr martin who dined with mrs hancock that evening and spoke of egypt as if it was a newly acquired possession of hers like her motor or the gate that had in spite of edwards lukewarmness on the subject been put into the wall that separated the two gardens trumpeted her praise in his usual manner we shall miss you terribly he said heathmoor will not be itself without you but still how right you are to go and see it all for yourself you take your car with you no then i shall be down on denton and expect him to stop for my sermon every sunday morning poor fellow instead of stealing out to bring your car back for you poor denton ha ha hell be glad ill warrant when you come back again and he can shirk the padres jaw as usual an excellent fellow denton upon my word i am sorry for him i shall skip a page or two every now and then if denton looks too reproachfully at me alfred alfred said his wife i shall nobbleisnt it nobble edwardi shall nobble denton to sing psalms in the choir said mr martin while mrs hancock is away he will have no car to take back after she has gone to church yes yes give denton a dose of david to begin with and alfred to finish up with mr martin looked furtively round to see if lind was amused and mrs martin put her hand to her face alfred alfred she said is not alfred naughty mrs hancock beamed delightedly this wild religious badinage always pleased her it seemed to make a human thing of religion to bring it into ordinary life i will leave denton in your hands she said with the utmost confidence so long as we dont make a clergyman of him before you come back suggested mr martin we wont do that there are many mansions and im sure that a good fellow in his garage occupies one of them we all have got our mansion have we not you miss elizabeth in your music edward here in the city though hes a lucky fellow to be sure for he has a musical mansion as well and we all meet we all meet this was a shade more solemn than mr martins usual dinnertable conversation and mrs hancock crumbling her bread with dropped eyes saw here a very good gambit to open with again in a little serious conversation she meant if possible to have with him afterwards then the appearance of a very particular salad roused her immediate attention this you must eat mr martin she said it is the new sort of lettuce which ellis insisted on my getting i am told that in egypt it is quite unsafe to eat salad or any raw vegetable for you cant tell who has been touching it or what sort of water it has been washed in its the same in india is it not elizabeth mr martin turned briskly to the girl and why dont you join your aunt in her tour to egypt he said its all on the way back to india is it not why not put africs sunny fountains in before indias coral strands dear me how wonderful bishop hebers grasp is this was indeed another coincidence that mr martin should suggest quite without consultation the very scheme that mrs hancock had planned and contrived that mr martin should think of it quite independently seemed to mrs hancock a tremendous almost a religious argument in its favour well that is odd now that you should have mentioned that she said for i was proposing to elizabeth only this morning that she should do that very thing and that mr martin should agree with me well edward looked up caught elizabeths eye ricocheted so to speak on to ediths and returned in time to catch the drift of mr martins further comment on bishop heber mrs hancock saw the sudden colour flame in elizabeths face saw the glance that played between her three young people and shut more firmly than ever the door into which she had thrust her conjecture on this subject she entirely refused to recognize the possible existence of anything so very uncomfortable mr martin observed that his wife had got well under way again with bishop heber and spoke confidently to his hostess ive got schemes in my head too about egypt he said though i dont know that they will come to anything i want to send my dear minnie to the south for a month or two of the winter you remember perhaps how unwell she was last winter and what wonderful jellies mrs williams sent her indeed if i think i can manage it i believe i shall really have the courage to suggest that she goes out about the same time as you so that she wont be quite alone in the land of bondage of course i dont for the moment hint at her actually joining your party but hush mrs hancock we are observed i have not said a word about it to her yet it was impossible that mrs hancock should not feel that providence had kindly turned his attention to her disappointment about elizabeth and the egyptian tour it was true that the even more harrowing subject of her lonely octoberin case elizabeth persisted in her selfishnesshad not at present attracted his notice but this suggestion of mr martins seemed to her to be a direct and divine contrivance for her comfort she had no wish to examine into the logic of her belief she did not dream of inquiring if she really thought that mrs martin had suffered from bronchitis last winter in order that her husband might think of sending her south now so that mrs hancock should have somebody to attend to her in egypt but she felt that elizabeth perhaps was not intended to go to egypt which being so providence having a special regard for her comfort had put forward this utterly unexpected idea to see if she liked it she did like it she also formed the conclusion that she on her side was meant not to urge elizabeth any more nor even to see if mr martin could not probe and heal her trouble it was evident that her entire arrangements were being seen after for her but she had to meet this halfway to acquiesce thankfully and help it on she turned beamingly to mr martin the very thing she said and as for dear mrs martin not being of our party how could you suggest such an idea some subject cognate to bishop heber was actively engaging mrs martin and mrs hancock could speak without fear of being overheard she shall share my sittingroom as my guest of course and everything she said and after dinner you and i must have a couple of words together if it is only the question of expense that troubles you if there is any difficulty there you must allow me to help and elizabeth says for the matter of that that the secondclass cabins on the liners to port said are every bit as good as the first this offer to help was not so precipitate as it sounded mrs hancock had seriously considered during the afternoon what the expense of a companion would be and had come to the conclusion that if elizabeth would not join her she would be able to afford it but this providential idea would save her the greater part of that expense for no doubt if she could persuade mr martin to let her pay since she would then be saved the full expenses of a companion some forty pounds or perhaps thirty towards mrs martins travelling his doubts on the subject of whether it could be afforded would be completely removed she would tell him that she looked on it as a form of charity which he must not be too proud to accept she was subscribing to mrs martins efficiency in parochial work which was a clear duty mrs martin must be induced to see it in the same light and she surely would when she saw that her husband and mrs hancock were so completely in accord on the subject and ifif behind that locked door in her mind there was shut up the true reason for elizabeths unwillingness to go to egypt how wonderfully it had been conveyed to her that she must not urge her any more that of course was the most important thing of all she must also cease from accusing elizabeth in her mind of any selfishness she must dismiss it all now not even wonder whether it was true or not providence had locked the door on it and indicated quite unmistakably that elizabeth was not to go to egypt providence too had caused her passbook to be returned to her disclosing a very sound position even forty pounds would not worry her at all but that was no reason why she should not see whether thirty would not put mr martins mind at ease on the question of expense she would certainly ask elizabeth to play to them after dinner and go out into the garden with mr martin to enjoy the music from there mr martin left alone with edward after dinner had another glass of port before he took his cigarette on general principles of bonhomie and partaking in the pleasure of other people and also on the particular principle that mrs hancocks port was a very charming beverage he continued also to trumpet her praises in a confidential manner the most generous woman i know he said you are indeed lucky to be allying yourself with her daughter an instance occurred at dinner i mentioned that i was thinking of sending my wife south for the winternot a word of this yet to anybody my dear fellowand she guessed that expense might be a serious consideration to me i had but ever so faintly alluded to it instantly she offered to help suggesting that my wife should be of her party you join them i think you and your bride at cairo do you not that is the idea a very good one and miss elizabeth is she going too it seemed to have occurred to her aunt edward got up i know she thought of it he said butbut i do not suppose elizabeth will go shall we join the others i get scolded if we stop in the diningroom too long certainly certainly if you will allow me one more whiff of this excellent cigarette mrs hancock always gives her guests of the very best and how much more my dear fellow has she given you her best of all edward did not reply to this but waited in silence while mr martin took his one whiff as they crossed the hall the frontdoor bell sounded and lind took in a telegram miss elizabeth sir he said to edward edward just glanced at it it was a foreign telegram ill take it in he said mrs hancock had stationed herself strategically near the window so that she could easily stroll out with mr martin there you are she said and youve both been good and not waited too long now let us have some music theres room for you here mr martin who will beginyou edward or elizabeth i meant to have got some duets for you and then you could have played together what is that edward a telegram for elizabeth he said open it then dear said mrs hancock to the girl well excuse you the little hush that so often attends the opening of a telegram fell on the room as elizabeth tore open the thin paper she looked at the message and standing quite still handed it to her aunt it was from her stepmother and told her that her father had died of cholera that morning book three chapter xii april evening elizabeth was sitting in the drawingroom window of the little house that her mother and she had taken in oakley street on a warm uncertain afternoon of april in the following year the window was wide open and the breeze that blew in from the southwest ruffled the leaves of the music that stood open on the piano it seemed to the girls indolent mood that there was quite a good chance of their not blowing on to the floor and since that was so she much preferred going to pick them up if this happened rather than disturb herself for fear of its happening outside there was a small brickwalled enclosure with strips of flowerbed bright nodding with daffodils and a figtree rather sooty in foliage and hopelessly incapable of bearing any fruit at all was thrusting out broad handlike leaves from its angled boughs this enclosure mrs fanshawe was accustomed to call that dreadful little backyard when she felt like that but in more cheerful moods alluded to it as that dear little garden for some days past it had been a dreadful little backyard colonel fanshawe had left his widow and daughter in circumstances that admitted of comfort and demanded care and mrs fanshawe sometimes complained of sometimes rather enjoyed the practice of economy elizabeth was rather afraid of those bouts of economical enjoyment for they meant that mrs fanshawe was apt to order more coal than the cellar would possibly hold as she got a cheaper quotation for large quantities or would take a taxicab to some fardistant shop in oxford street keep it waiting an hour and drive back in it bursting with innumerable packages she would then gleefully reckon up the saving she had effected by not buying the same goods at the shop just round the corner sometimes it amounted to as much as two shillings in which case she would give elizabeth quite a little homily on the virtue of thrift and the immense importance of looking after the pence the shillings apparently as represented by the taxi were capable of looking after themselves after this thrifty afternoon she would feel that a little treat was owing to them and she would take elizabeth to a concert at other times still enjoying it she would help in the housework and putting on a very pretty grey apron dust the china on the chimneypiece in the drawingroom or even clean the handle of the front door with some sample that had been sent her which was of unrivalled merit in polishing brasswork she still required a great deal of rest to recuperate her from labours past and fit her for those to come and always had breakfast in bed apart from this necessary repose and the fatigue engendered by the practice of economies her time for the last two months had been largely taken up in collecting materials for a short memoir of her late husband i feel that i who know him best she said to elizabeth owe it to his large circle of friends at home and abroad who loved him to tell them what i can about him it is my duty dear in addition to that his public service as a soldier was never properly appreciated by the war office and it is right that they should know what they have lost now that it is too late elizabeth felt as if a file had been drawn across her front teeth and her stepmother went on with a certain degree of complacency with a sense of importance and yet not without sincerity it is so beautiful that passage in in memoriam she said wiping her eyes where tennyson says that to write about mr hallam is a sad narcotic numbing pain i know he would have understood my feeling about it which is just that i shall of course state in the preface my reasons for writing the memoir and say that though it is like tearing open a wound that will never heal i owe it to my dear husbands memory she paused a moment it will be privately printed of course she said and i shall give it to all his friends i was thinking of having a purple cloth binding with gilt lettering wont it be very expensive mamma asked the girl i cannot bring myself to think about the expense you and i will have to be very economical i know but when a call of duty comes like this i feel that no other consideration can stand in my way if you think it quietly over elizabeth she said again crying a little i believe you will agree with me when you recollect all that your dear father was it will helpi hope it will helpyou to appreciate him too as well as the war office this awful little conversation which held for elizabeth a certain miserable wounding humour had taken place soon after mrs fanshawe had come back to england after her husbands death she had returned as soon as she had settled her affairs in india and had sold not unsuccessfully the bungalow and all it contained retaining only a few personal possessions of his and what belonged to elizabeth and herself this private property included many packets of his letters which she tied up in a black ribbon and bestowed in an immense tin dispatchbox with corrospondence the orthography of which was not worth correcting printed in white letters on it this indeed had suggested to her the idea of the short memoir and with it by the side of her chair or sofa she made masses of extracts with a view to arranging them afterwards in the chapters on his second marriage and his homelife the pieces which she selected for publication almost entirely consisted of affectionate words to herself and she mostly omitted messages he sent to elizabeth or indeed anything that did not directly refer to his affection for his wife mrs hancock had been put under contribution to supply details about his boyhood and early manhood which similarly consisted for the most part in stories to show how fond he was of her these for a month had poured in in immense quantities and before they came to an end mrs fanshawe had begun to find them exceedingly tedious dry details in the same way about his military service did not so much engage mrs fanshawes attention and it was elizabeths duty to get the facts about those from army lists while she during the long winter evenings searched through his letters for fresh instances of his devotion to her and wrote and had typewritten the preface which was on the lines already indicated the chapter on social life in india was already arranged also in a rambling sort of fashion and showed without the slightest doubt how popular mrs fanshawe was at dinnerparties and balls and how her husband with the wonderful confidence and trust he had in her was never the slightest bit jealous his first wife elizabeths mother was scarcely to be mentioned in the short memoir she might have been a weekend visitor who had not made much impression on him the wind which had been threatening so long to spill the music that stood open on the piano carried out its intention at last but still elizabeth did not stir something of the languor of spring had invaded her and meaning every moment to get up and go on with her practising which had been the excuse for her not going out with her mother on an expedition of economy to the army and navy stores she still lounged in the windowseat thinking over all that had passed since that evening when edward came into the drawingroom at arundel with the foreign telegram in his hand it had been a shock to her the violence of which she had not been conscious of at the time but which showed itself afterwards in the weeks of nerve fatigue that followed there had been taken away something in the very core and kernel of her life and for the time she had known less of grief than of an inexplicable lack as if on the physical plane a limb had been amputated and that she had just awoke from the operation and found herself with arm or leg no longer there indeed the feeling was not so much that he was dead as that a piece of herself was gone she sent out messages from her brain and they were not received anywhere nothing thrilled or moved in correspondence with them and then slowly and by degrees there began to wake in her that new sense that almost always wakens in those who have suffered some intimate bereavement her mind could not take in could not conceive when once faced with it the notion of annihilation of ceasing to be it revolted from it and though for a time her reason as she accounted her reason kept telling her that he was gone that the days of their love and confidence were over she found the conclusion growing incredible it began to dawn in her like the waking of a new intelligence that there was nothing of him gone except the sight of him and the possibility of his presence being apprehended any more by her physical senses she knew she would not again see or touch him as she had known him before or again hear his voice but she found herself daily realizing more and more distinctly by some perception as innate in her as growth the knowledge that he was not and could not have been taken away amputated destroyed all of him that she missed so dreadfully all that for which she stretched out empty arms in the dark was not her essential father but only the signs by which she knew him he became her companion again by no effort of the imagination but by the assertion of an instinct that could not be contradicted never in those communings with his quiet wisdom beneath the fading crimson of the indian sunsets had she felt more strongly than now the immortal kinship between them the reality of their spiritual alliance he had told her once in words that at the time seemed to her to have been spoken in an unknown tongue that it was impossible to go beyond love that you can only penetrate into it finding it without beginning and without end it was by his death that she had begun to understand that by the knowledge of the impotence of the supreme dividerthe supreme divider she echoed the meaningless words the words from which all meaning had departed death did not divide it was only meanness falseness impatience that could do so tragic a work she remembered with growing clearness as she lay in the window seat with the daffodils nodding outside and the music splayed on the floor their talk in the garden that evening it was as if it had been written in her mind with invisible ink which required some spiritual solution to be poured over it to bring out the words again she herself she remembered had been full of vague visions as to the possibilities and wonders of the world she had been full of the dreams that were coloured with the vivid unsubstantial hues that are painted by inexperience now behind them not removing them or painting over them there was stealing soaking into them the colours that at the time seemed to her to be somehow dull dingy stereotyped what he had said to her about love had seemed somehow commonplace and when an hour or two afterwards she had sat by the dying fakir at the bottom of the garden it was more the sensationalism the picturesqueness of that weary and happy passing that had affected her now she saw differentlyshe saw that precisely the same spirit precisely the same inborn knowledge had inspired both the same rich and unclouded vision was their daily outlook they had both staked their all on love then a few days afterwards elizabeth had ridden out with her father and he had spoken to her in the same quiet way about death he had said he enjoyed life tremendously but as for death it was to him but another stage in growing up elizabeth turned her face to the garden and the bright daffodils daddy daddy she said aloud she raised herself on her elbow with the indolence and languor of spring quite slipped off from her overwhelmingly conscious of her nearness to her father not to his memory but to him none knew none ever would know except herself and she but guessed at the huge significance of it just what his death had done for her with regard to her comprehension of life the news had come to her in days of despair when love itself seemed manifested to her only in the form of a desperate renunciation when she who loved and was loved in return was severed just by an untimely promise by a bond signed blindly even then she had known though only by the groping of instinct that to disown that or to allow it to be disowned was to poison the very fountain and wellspring of love edward she knew well with reason on his side had longed to marry her in despite of that believing that the eternal gushing of that spring would wash away from the mouth of it the taint that had been laid there but now she had begun to see how it was that her instinct had directed her for even then when her need was the sorest she had comprehended though without conscious knowledge of her comprehension that while loyalty was of the very essence of love passion was but a symptom of it that while love died at the breath of disloyalty it existed still deep and calm though the symptom the froth on the surface was blown off it by the austere wind of mere straightforward commonplace duty or was suffered to die down under the frozen dawn of renunciation how she had longed through those thirsty days to be able to go to her father and be comforted by his steadfast upholding of her choice a draught of cold sweet water in the sultriness of a barren land never so it had been ordained should she whisper to him the story of the summer nor cry her fill on his shoulder but his upholding and his comforting had been not one whit less vivid and present to her though far away the parching wind swept over the grave beneath the tamarisktrees in that remote cemetery but it was not often she thought either of the grave or of his death itself for those things seemed to her even as they had seemed to him but little incidents of the wayside not events of great moment in the onward march of his soul nor to be given a place beside what he had been and what he was to her he had died swiftly under the stroke of the sword of the pestilence died in a few hours from the time that he had been taken ill they had buried him that night as the moon rose with the wheeling planets for his funeral lamps and the flitting owls crying his requiem it was but little of him and that no more than a garment outworn that had there been laid to rest he his essential self seemed to elizabeth never to have left her through all the dark days of autumn and winter nor through the lengthening evenings of this longdelayed spring it had been a hard struggle and a stern one this work in which his spirit seemed so continually to have been at her side there was so much which appeared inextricably intertwined with her love for edward that must be cast out annihilated there was so much also and this was of even greater moment that must be so loyally and uncompromisingly kept not one of those threads of pure gold that ran through the whole fabric must be drawn out of it there must be no loss of that no turning the royal mantle into a cloak for a funeral she must not part if her shoulders on to which it had fallen were to be worthy of it with one gleam of its splendour with one atom of its gold and here was a task to test the utmost of her patience and her wisdom in preserving all this and yet unravelling and disentangling certain other threads there were feelings there were attitudes of mind there were desires connected with edward that seemed at first to be an integral part of the fabric so strictly were they woven into it it seemed that to draw these out must make rents and yet it had to be done to be done radically and completely though no rent must be seen or exist there it was not that these things were in themselves no part of love it was only that circumstances had made it impossible that they should be part of her love for him indeed they were not hers they belonged by right to edith they must come out of her fabric each one of them must come out she had to divert from it certain strains certain colours the human longing the desire the yearning even they were natural they were proper for one other woman only but not for herself how well she remembered how her father had told her that knowledge would come to her through love through love of a common man as she had added it was even so it had come to her thus and even more through the right renunciation not the mere rejection of the whole but the rejection of a certain part of it the gold all that was infinitely precious must remain but the rest was not dross merely it was not hers not only at first but through long months of patient effort the task appeared impossible so intimately was the passion of her love woven in with the love itself sensibly enough she let her subconscious mind work at it while she employed her best efforts in filling the days with other interests and occupations yet so many of these and of them all the one that hitherto had most enthralled and engrossed her namely the study of music gave her every moment stabs of recollection her passion for it had been so immensely kindled and quickened by him that when she tried to kindle it again it was still the thought of him that fed the flame all that had to go she must retrace her steps and find for it the inspiration of itself alone she had to shatter the dreams with which it filled her she had to shake herself awake from them the associations which it roused in her must be disconnected from it it had to be made to speak to her with its own voice often she thought of giving it up altogether of cutting off from the stem of her life the flowers of melody and harmony so closely were they set with thorns that made her heart bleed yet that again would have been a wanton and a mutilating renunciation instead with patience that sometimes shrank and fainted she set herself to pick off the thorns that were no essential part of the growth yet the thorns bled the very stem seemed to ooze with the lifesap and of all the spiritual tasks which filled elizabeths days with strivings and drove sleep from her during the weary nights the most haunting the most difficult of all remains to be mentionednamely that of keeping her heart sweet when she thought of edith it seemed at first that mere patience mere daily and unremitting striving was of no avail to quarry away that adamantine block the tools of her armoury were blunted at its contact she tried not to judge her or to attempt to record a verdict about an action that was morally unintelligible to her if indeed she could preserve herself from thinking it vile but when she contemplated the choice edith had made her refusal to let edward go free from the promise he had made before he knew what love was she could scarcely abstain from revolted condemnation or succeed in leaving the case unjudged it was not easy to dissociate from it the momentous personal consequences that this refusal held for her or to look at it impartially as if the situation had been presented to her as an incident that had happened among strangers but even when she most schooled herself to put her own entanglement in it out of the question she felt it difficult not to seethe with scorn over it she could not understand how a girl with respect either for herself or the great emotions could refuse to set free a man who no longer wished to be tied to her who longed as edith knew very well to be acquitted of his promise it was inconceivable even had he not given his heart elsewhere to claim a right in such a matter to refuse to uncage the bird of love which was beating its wings against the wires just because the cage was hers and in her hands it was to close or unclose the door it seemed to elizabeth that the very fact that edith loved him though it made it more difficult for her to give him up must make that giving of him up the more imperative love so it appeared to her must have relaxed the fingers that detained him had she not cared for him had she not known what love was these other desires the liking she had for him the desire in a general way to be married the feeling that she would be happy with him might have caused her to keep him or at any rate not voluntarily to release him from his promise but that she could love as elizabeth rightly felt she did and yet not find predominant over everything else the longing for his happiness was the thing that was utterly inconceivable whether edith had secured her own happiness she had no idea whatever she had but seen her some halfdozen times since edward and edith had returned from egypt in the early spring and edith seemed to have developed a sort of sheath over her a carapace that was insensitive to the touch it was naturalindeed anything else would have been impossiblethat no mention of past history or how it bore on the present should take place between them but it seemed to elizabeth that her cousin had shut herself up in this hard integument and gave no indication of her real self if she spoke of her home it was to say that they had put a fresh carpet down in the drawingroom if of her daily life to say that she often lunched with her mother if of mrs hancock that she had raised dentons wages if of edward that he seldom came back from the city before the later of the two trains once or twice it is true it had seemed to elizabeth as if edith was wanting to say something more that as if shipwrecked on some desert island she was silently waving an inconspicuous flag that might indeed not be a flag at all but nothing came of these efforts and it was impossible for elizabeth to urge her to confidence when it was so very doubtful whether she wished to confide or indeed had anything to say once elizabeth had made an impulsive attempthad said suddenly not pausing to consider the wisdom of such a speech but eager for her own sincerity oh edith i hope you are happy you are arent you and edith if she had been signalling furled her flag at once as if afraid it had been seen quite happy thank you she had said and picked up from the floor the umbrella with a false onyx top that had fallen there she proceeded to explain about the top mrs hancock had bought it in cairo very cheap and edith hoped she would never know it was not real onyx she need not have been afraid for mrs hancock had had her doubts on the subject but had resolutely put them from her before she made this present it has been said that elizabeth was eager for her own sincerity in wishing to know that edith was happy that expresses with fair accuracy the measure of her success in trying not to judge edith it may be taken also as the epitaph on the grave where her jealousy of her was buried the cynic is at liberty to reflect that since edward did not love his wife she had no cause for jealousy of all the virtues that lift the eyes of men to the hills patience is the least admired has the least to attract the attention and thus earn the encouragement of others and yet none is more certain of its results never does it fail in putting forth its fruits in due season nor in accomplishing its perfect work but for the most part its growth is imperceptible it does not shoot up like the aloe flower nor challenge attention from the brilliance of its blossoming and like the violet it hides its lovely fragrance and those who observe carelessly and without love are usually quite unaware of its blossoming it trumpets forth no deeds of valour it fills the stage with no heroic attitudes and splendid speeches and only those who watch tenderly and closely can see the growth of its sweetsmelling purple it was not a matter for wonder then that mrs fanshawe eagerly intent on herself interested in her own grief and bereavement and marvellously anxious that others should be if possible equally interested in them should have observed nothing of this modest flowering not even now when on this languid april day elizabeths plot was thick with the flowers of her silent gardening indeed she was disposed to blame her stepdaughter for many omissions in her general conduct there was much to be desired in her that she did not get when she played to her so to speak elizabeth was not always ready to dance when she mourned elizabeth did not always weep she took but a tepid interest in mrs fanshawes brilliant and absorbing economies and though she was always ready to go on searching through army lists she did not bring to that employment the eager zeal which might have been expected from one who had just lost so wellbeloved a father worse still when mrs fanshawes voice sometimes broke and her eyes filled with selfpitying tears as she read aloud to elizabeth some fresh and pathetic page of the memoir describing how her father had sat up till halfpast three on two consecutive nights so that his wife should have her fill of dancing elizabeth seemed as hard as adamant over this poignant recollection indeed elizabeth had tried to persuade her quite unsuccessfully to cut out from the preface the concluding paragraph which began out of the depths of my broken heart i wish to thank all those friends whose sympathy has supported me in my bereavement indeed mrs fanshawe was afraid that she had not been far astray when on first marrying she had formed the conclusion that elizabeth was a selfish sort of girl she had believed then that she had a great affection for her father who really rather spoiled her and had tried the dear fellow to spoil his wife as well but now so quietly did elizabeth take her bereavement she was afraid that after all her affection for her father was not so very deep otherwise she must have found the writing of the memoir a work at which it was an agonizing yet exquisite pleasure to assist otherwise again elizabeth could not have been so remarkably industrious in her music she could not within a couple of months of her fathers death begin a course of instruction in the piano at the royal institute she would have been unable to give her mind as she was undoubtedly doing to this very nice accomplishment of playing the piano but have immured herself in the privacy of oakley street and refused to see anybody but her stepmother to whom she must have been irresistibly drawn by the bond of their common sorrow incidentally too these music lessons seemed to mrs fanshawe very expensive for the gratification of a mere luxurious whim and the thought of them often impelled her to distant economical expeditions implying a huge expense in taxicabs it was on one of these that she had gone out this afternoon the object being to purchase large quantities of violet soap so cheap if you bought a large box of it and other little things that would probably occur to her from a shop in high holborn though the distance was considerable elizabeth was surprised she was not back by the time the servant brought up tea but since she might return any moment and be querulous over the fact that tea was not made she prepared it risking the other possibility that it might be cold when her stepmother returned who would then drink it with the air of a martyr or be compelled though she hated extravagance and unnecessary trouble to servants to order a fresh teapot one of the two was likely since as has been mentioned the open space at the back of the house had been for the last fortnight the horrid little backyard but an agreeable surprise was in store mrs fanshawe came in before long in the most excellent spirits full of affection and tenderness and my dear little musical cinderella has made tea she said all ready for her wicked stepmother darling you should have come out with me it is the loveliest day you are too industrious perhaps this evening you will play to me something you have been so diligently practising elizabeth poured out tea im afraid i havent been so very industrious mamma she said ive been sitting in the window nearly an hour doing nothing ah it is not doing nothing to enjoy this sweet breeze and look at the daffodils in our sweet little garden my dear what a good cup of tea nobody makes tea like you i often say it she often did though with quite a different nuance but clearly the days of the horrid little backyard were over for the present such an afternoon as i have had dear she continued you would never guess all the things that have happened to me who should i meet for instance in isaacs and redfords but your aunt julia so pleasant and full of welcome and nothing would content her but that i must promise to bring you down to stay with her next friday over the sunday her dear little elizabeth she called you we quite quarrelled over that i said you were my dear little elizabeth she has been so busy she said since her return from egypt in february getting things straight after her long absence or she would have asked me many times before i never thought it odd i am glad to say that she had not done so i always refrained from wondering at it though to be sure three months is a long time to take putting things straight after an absence of two but now she quite insists on it she simply would not let me go until i had promised and she will send her motor to the station to meet whatever train we settle to travel by here was a prospect that had long daunted elizabeth to look forward to yet of necessity it must sometime come close to her she had not so much as seen edward since he handed her the telegram last august in mrs hancocks drawingroom he and she tacitly contriving together in sundered cooperation had averted that her heart leaped and sank and leaped again she shrank from seeing him and had not known till now when in the natural course of events she must see him how much she longed to on her side there was no reasonable excuse to urge against the plan and had there been she hardly knew whether she would have urged it on his side he might escape the meeting say that he had arranged to take edith away for the sunday but she felt sure that if he understood that she had consented to go down to her aunts he would not absent himself he waited so she instinctively knew for a sign that she was willing to meet him otherwise he would long ago have been to see her she quite understood his absence and his silence any sign of emotion that might have escaped her was certainly not seen by her stepmother who was full of the wonders of this afternoon but elizabeth felt that something beyond this invitation to heathmoor had occurred to send mrs fanshawes mental barometer up to such exhilarated serenity of fair weather and she waited for it to be told her it did not come at once she mentioned first the other objects on which some ray had beamed which gilded and transfigured them such a long and dear talk i had with her she went on and she begged if it did not hurt me too much to bring down all the memoirs that i have written to read to her quietly after she had gone i bought the soap and the other little things i wanted which were even cheaper than i had anticipated and you never would guess dear how i came back here perhaps you will scarcely believe it when i tell you for i got on the top of a bus with my great box of soap and my other parcels and came all the way right to the chelsea town hall for threepence not counting the sixpence with which i tipped the conductor who was most obliging and helped me with my things really very polite in spite of my packages he of course saw i was not just a common woman like the rest of the passengers and i hesitated whether i ought to have given him a shilling but i have never enjoyed making a little economy and denying myself comforts more than i did when i got up on that bus no it was not the bus ride so thought elizabeth that had produced this exhilaration and pleasure she waited but before i got up on to my bus i gave myself just a little treat mrs fanshawe proceeded and went into one of those electric palaces as they call them where you see the cinematograph i was not quite sure whether it was the sort of thing that is thought respectable and so i looked pretty closely at the programme before i entered but i need not have been afraid i never saw anything more refined and you and i will go together one of these days dear so cheap too only a shilling why you could go every day for a week and not spend more than in one evening in the dresscircle at the theatre mrs fanshawe looked up at elizabeth with that glance of soft shy helplessness which many men found so provocatively feminine and pleading and called forth the instinct of protection in their somewhat unobservant minds for on the whole nobody was less in need of protection than she she was almost aggressively able to take care of herself and i didnt have to carry my parcels after all she said from where the bus stopped for whom should i see just coming out of the chemists there but that dear sir henry meyrick who was commanderinchief in india do you remember he came home only a couple of days ago on leave and will be here till january he stayed with us once at peshawar darling in those happy happy days mrs fanshawe took out her handkerchief and dabbed the corners of her eyes this was a piece of ritual that had lost its practical significance for there was not the semblance of moisture there and was merely the outward and visible sign of an inward grief i stayed with him afterwards at simla she said and got oh so fond of him it was while i was staying there you know that the news came that caused my poor heart to break my dear he was like a woman for tenderness to me and yet he had the strength of a man and i can never never forget what i owe dear sir henry if it had not been for him i am convinced i should quite have broken down or even made away with myself elizabeth felt sure that she had here the origin of the wonderful rise in her stepmothers spirits and an idea horrible to contemplate came close to her and stared her in the face she resolutely turned away from it yes i remember him quite well she said i thought you found him rather foolish and ridiculous foolish and ridiculous said mrs fanshawe with great energy i cannot imagine what you mean elizabeth you must be confusing him with some one else perhaps i am said the girl it is stupid of me how was he looking mrs fanshawe calmed down at once and became softly pathetic again oh so different to what he was when you saw him she said when he was so cheery and jolly and made all the women in peshawar fall in love with him at least i am sure that i did he looked so anxious and unhappy elizabeth that my heart quite went out to him and i longed to comfort him and he brightened up so when he saw me he looked quite radiant again and you will never guess what a pretty welcome he gave me though of course it was very foolish of him he said my dear little girlmy dear little girl twice over just like that and he held out both his hands to me and dropped his umbrella in a puddle and never seemed to notice it and there was i with my arms full of great heavy parcels i declare for a moment i was quite ashamed before so true a gentleman as sir henry is and he took all the parcels from meand oh my dear it was so wonderful to me in my loneliness in the crowded streets to be taken care of again like thatand carried them right up to the door and gave them to mary when she opened it he would not let me touch them again myself again the idea stood close to elizabeth holding her so it seemed not letting her turn her face away and the soft childlike voice went on he asked after you too she said so nicely and affectionately he would not come in then for he had some other appointment and though he wanted to break it i did not let him but he is coming to dine here tonight i shall not think of making any extra preparation for him he will like it best just to see me in my quiet modest little house just naturally there was a moments rather awkward pause for mrs fanshawe had to consider how to reintroduce a topic that had been spoken of that morning between her and elizabeth in hours of the horrid little backyard elizabeth had wanted to go to the queens hall to attend a concert of the most ravishing character that was to be performed that night but had given up the idea owing to a marked querulousness on her stepmothers part at the prospect of passing a deserted evening there had even been pained wonder at the girl caring to go out to an evening of pleasure so soon but she was not apt to be troubled at her own inconsistencies and the pause was not long he will be sorry not to see you i am sure darling she said but i think you told me you were going to a concert at the queens hall very likely you will not be in till nearly eleven and you may be sure i shall have a nice cosy little supper ready for you when you come back to elizabeth this seemed but to confirm the idea that had forced itself on her it needed at any rate little perspicacity to see that her stepmother with the prospect of dining alone with sir henry wanted her to keep the engagement which in deference to her desire she had abandoned nor was she surprised at the tenderness that followed mrs fanshawe rose in willowy fashion from her chair and stood behind elizabeths gently stroking her hair i want you to enjoy all the pleasures that i can contrive for you dear she said he whom we both miss so dreadfully i know would wish us to enjoyrichly to enjoy does not the bible say he would have hated to think that we were going to lose all our gaiety and happiness elizabeth felt physically unable to bear the touch of that insincere caressing hand she got up quickly yes mamma she said i am sure of that i have tried not to lose the joy of life so right darling said mrs fanshawe in a dreadful little cooing voice and we have helped each other i hope in that i know you have helped me i will not let my life be spoiled and broken it would grieve him so she paused a moment with handkerchiefritual and with her head a little on one side spoke with childlike timidity it was lovely being taken care of again she said though only in a little matter like having a parcel carried are you going now dear enjoy yourself my sweetest and stop till the very end of your concert i know what a treat music is to you i would not have you miss a note elizabeth felt the need of air after this interview and having an hour yet to spare before she need think of going to the concert went down the broad quiet street and on to the thames embankment at its lower end she felt stifled by this atmosphere of insincerity from which she had come she choked at the pitiful nauseating deception that she believed almost deceived her stepmother and caused her to refer to the duty of behaving as her late husband would have had her behave at all her little subterfuges for facilitating her own arrangements the falseness of it all was so blatant so palpable that it would not have deceived a baby and yet elizabeth was not wrong in thinking that it largely deceived the very author of it her acting might not appear at all lifelike to her audience but it seemed real to herself for years she had while diligently pursuing paths of complete selfishness been employed so to speak on modelling a figure of herself that was winning childlike and trustingly devoted to the love of others and now regarding that with conscious approval she had come to believe that it was the very image of herself and elizabeth felt sure and again was not mistaken that mrs fanshawe was even now getting herself into another graceful pose for the reception of sir henry to say that she was deliberately laying herself out to attract him would have been the coarsely true way of putting it but things that were coarse and things that were true were almost equally abhorrent to mrs fanshawes mind she told herself that she owed a great debt to sir henry for his kindness and sympathy at her husbands death a debt that she would never be able to repay she was bound to treat him as an old friend to confide in him her plans for the future to tell him how she was oh so content to live quietly here devoting her life to elizabeth who was so sweet to her and she would somehow make it appear that it was her own sweetness not elizabeths that she was really talking about she would hint that she was a great deal alone but that it was by her own wish that elizabeth spent so many evenings enjoying herself with hearing music elizabeth was right oh so right to do it and elizabeth thinking over these things executed a few wild dance steps on a lonely piece of the embankment from sheer irritation at the thought she wondered also whether her stepmother would show sir henry the written chapters of the memoir she rather thought not this little ebullition of temper passed and she let her mind quiet down again as she leaned her elbows on the stone balustrade and looked out over the beautiful river which brimmed and swirled just below for the tide near to full flood was pouring up from the sea still fresh and strong and unwearied by its journey barges were drifting up with it in a comfortable haphazard sort of fashion and a great company of seagulls hovered near chiding and wheeling together the hour was a little after sunset and the whole sky was bright with mackerelmarkings of rosy cloud and the tawny river reflecting these was covered with glows and gleams opposite the trees in the park were dim in the mist of fresh green that lay over them blurring the outlines which all the winter had stood stark and clearcut under cold grey skies and the triumphant tide of springtime which flushed everything with the tingle of new growth unfolding the bells of the tulips in the patches of riverside garden and making the sparrows busy with gathering sticks and straws for their nestings sent a sudden thrill through elizabeths heart and she was conscious again as she had not been for many weary weeks of the youth and glory of the world from the great sea of life came the vivifying wave covering for the moment the brown seaweed tangle of her trouble that had lain dry and sunbaked so long flushing and freshening and uplifting it relieved of its irritation and refreshed by this good moment of spring evening her mind went back to her stepmother she felt sure that it was her intention to marry that jolly old warrior if it could possibly be managed and that she was going to employ all her art in the shape of her artlessness and simplicity to bring that about it was but eight months since her husband had died but after all what did that matter the actual lapse of time had very little to do with the question and she would be sure to have touching and convincing reasons for such a step it had seemed horrible at first to elizabeth but where after all was the horror of course her dead husband would have wished her to be happy elizabeth knew her father well enough to know that and it was only horrible that she should give as she undoubtedly would as a reason for her marrying again what she knew his wishes would be on the subject whether sir henry would be brought up to the point was another matter and on this elizabeth had no evidence except her stepmothers account of their meeting but clearly mrs fanshawe thought that things promised well elizabeths eyes suddenly filled with tears only once had the grass sprung up on that fardistant grave not yet had the memoir so quickly taken in hand been completed daddy daddy she said aloud she turned from the rosy river and set out to walk down the embankment to the next bridge from where she proposed to take the conveyance that had thrilled her stepmother that afternoon with a sense of incredible adventure the pavement stretched empty and darkening in front of her and at the far end the lamplighter had started on his luminous round some two hundred yards off a figure was walking quickly towards her and long before she could distinguish face or feature elizabeth with heart in sudden tumult saw who it was almost at the same moment she saw him pause suddenly in his rapid progress and halt as if undetermined whether or no to turn and retrace his steps but he came on again and soon they stood face to face all the tumult in her had died down again she held out her hand with the friendliest most unembarrassed smile at last edward she said and we shall meet again soon aunt julia has asked mamma and me down for next sunday he looked at her a moment without speaking she saw that his breath came quickly as if he had been running i know she told me she was going to write he said she met mamma this afternoon and said it instead must i go away he asked of course i will if you wish it butbut maynt i see you again at his voice at the entreaty in his eyes all but her love for him unstained and brightburning vanished utterly yes why not if you want to she said but i shall understand so well if you do not i have wanted nothing else every day he said all her heart went out to him arent you happy dear she said how can you ask that im sorry she said simply and edith i dont know i dont know anything about her i try to be kind and nice to her in fact i am a wretched quivering smile broke out on the girls face conceit she said im glad we have met edward for we had to get this over you know well its over they stood in silence a moment then suddenly he broke out why wouldnt you trust your own heart elizabeth and let me trust mine what good has come of it all what has come of it but wretchedness i dont ask if you are happy i know you arent no but you kept faith that good has come of it dont say those things it isnt the best of you that says them and what are you doing here i often walk this way he said then i go up oakley street the evenings are getting light now do you mind my doing that then something swelled in her throat forbidding speech ii must go on she said at length may i walk with you a little to the corner i shall take a bus there there was but a little way to go and they stood together waiting for the bus looking at the darkling river down which poured the wild west wind seagulls she said to him pointing seagulls and spring edward and she mounted quickly up the winding iron stairs not looking back but as the bus swung round a corner a little distance up the road she could not resist turning round he was still there at the corner where she had left him a minute speck on the pavement that glowed in the rosecoloured sunset so minute so significant it seemed to her that all of her essential self her heart her power of love was standing there with him that he gazed but at an empty wraith of herself who sat on the pounding swaying bus while she stood by his side as the spring evening darkened and the seagulls hovered and wheeled chapter xiii the grisly kittens elizabeth as requested by her stepmother did not leave her concert that night until the very last note of all had died away but it is doubtful whether that request had very much to do with it the probability is that she was really incapable of doing so just as the hypnotized subject has his will taken possession of by his controller so that all his wishes his intentions his desires are for the time in abeyance and the independence of his own powers completely paralysed so that night elizabeth was taken captive by the power of sound many times before she had felt that she was penetrating into a new kingdom a fresh province of thought and feeling but tonight a more surprising adventure held her bound she penetrated into no fresh kingdoms she saw no new peaks upraise themselves or valleys carve themselves at her feet she was completely in familiar places only a fresh light one that for her had never lit sea or land shone on them which transfigured them not by fantastic effects and the sensationalism of musical limelights but with the dawning as of the everlasting day she was unconsciously prepared for this as she had never been before she or a hundred others whose souls were steeped with the love of melody might have heard just what she heard that night and have had their tastes gratified their emotions roused without being gripped in this manner so supreme so enlightening new sensations might have flitted through her new beauties been perceived new glories been manifested without this ethical perception being awakened but with her tonight all the quiet patience of these past months of the succession of dark and difficult days to solve the meaning of which she had applied herself with efforts and strivings after the light so unremitting so unnoticed had rendered her capable of receiving the true illumination cell by cell she had stored honey in the dark now with the coming of spring the workers of her soul swarmed out with rush of joyous wings into the light she was charged to the brim with supersaturated waters it wanted but the one atom the more to be added that should solidify all that had been put into her all that by the grace of god she had gathered probably the meeting with edward gave her the last crystal of the salt took out from her love the grain of bitterness that still lurked there that made her ready to receive the ultimate gift that music has to bring namely the identification of it with all other noble effort the perception of its truth which is one with the truth of everything that is beautiful and is lit by the light that illuminates the whole world and turns it into the garden of god never again in those on whom one gleam of the light has shone can it be wholly quenched for the future they know from their own selves from the recollection of the one thing in the world which it is impossible to forget that whatever storms of adversity thunderclouds of trouble lower there is no such thing any more for them as a darkness quite untransfused no place so slippery that they can doubt whether their feet are set on a rock and their goings ordered the hall was but halffilled and elizabeth seated at the back of the amphitheatre saw she would be uncumbered with the distraction of near neighbours the concert opened with the third symphony of brahms and immediately she was carried into it even as one who looks at some superb statue has his mind modelled as it were into the image of what he sees so that his body can faintly following unconsciously drop into a pose somewhat like it so listening to this she was made one with it fused into it so that while it sang its message to her she knew of no existence separate from it her mind her nature became part of it she like a sheet of calm waters burned with the glories of the melodious sky she became godlike as she inhaled that ampler ether of glorified intellect through music which perhaps alone of the arts can make wholly visible to the spiritual eye the wonder and the beauty of pure and abstract thought no longer did its melodies suggest images to her her brain strove not after similes to express as it were in mere black and white the effect of the rainbow song it revealed itself mind then the hall swam into sight again there was applause it sounded quite meaningless you did not clap your hands when daylight came there were but three items in the programme and for the second the grand piano in front of the stage was opened the player was familiar enough to her he with his magical fingers and exuberant youth but just now he seemed a detached and impersonal figure as nameless as the violholding cherubim in a canvas of bellini who make music for the reverie of the saints and angels who stand on either side of the mother of god but it was no song of heavenly soul and sexless quires that he was to sing he was the interpreter of the joy of life and of love and of the myriad emotions that spring like flowers from the fruitful earth brahms had revealed what is possible to the wise mind of man here in the great concerto tschaikowsky poured out the inspired tale of its emotions the splendour of their shining the tenderness of their reveries instantly in the presence of this more concrete more frail and human music the images leaped and danced again in elizabeths mind the noonday shone on the innumerable smile of a blue sea high above the sultry plain were fixed the spearheads of chitral the dusk fell on the indian garden with its tangle of peshawar roses more personal yet grew the appeal she walked with her father there she showed him as never yet had it been given her to show him how love had touched her even as he had said with its enchantment how the loyalty of her renunciation of its material fulfilment had not withered its stem but caused it to blossom with a rarer and more fragrant flowering she told him how the bitter waters had been sweetened how the sting had been sheathed how through darkness love had felt its way up to the day with tender glance at the pain of it that was passed they dwelt on it with smiles for her miscomprehension of its growth for her ignorance of where it led they traced its springing tendrils on which there were the traces of healed scars where it had bled but its bleeding was over and strong grew its shoots over unsightly places the whole world danced together not men and women only not only boys and girls but sun and sea and sky and the lions in the desert and the tigers burning bright in the jungle the peaks and ledges of untrodden snow danced in a whirling magical maze of rhythmic movement the angels of god joined in it the devils of hell would have done so had there been such things as devils or such a place as hell again the music grew more personal all she had ever known of joy and that was much was marshalled round her and through the dancers this crowd of earthly elements came he whom every nerve and agent of perception in her body loved her human power of emotion leaped to the supremest arc of that rainbow curve and with him stood there poised by some divine right he was hers by a right no less divine he was separated from her yet that separation was somehow one with the union then followed a pause of some ten minutes but no reaction came to her for it was no mimic show that was now over no feigned dramatic presentment that she had watched or listened to she hardly knew which but something quite real more real than the rows of dark red stalls than the shaded scarlet lights like huge inverted anemones which hung above the orchestra more real even than the actual music itself which was but the husk or at most the temporary embodiment of the truth that underlay and illumined it she had been shown the vision of mind at its highest of emotion in its supremest degree there was something still lacking which should bind them together exhibit them as they truly were parts of an infinite whole she knew what was coming and with the tenseness of an expectation that must be fulfilled with a suspense that was not the less for the certainty of its coming resolution she waited half an hour later she came out into the mellow spring night that teemed with the promise of the southwest wind just as the brahms symphony had summed up for her the glory of mind and the tschaikowsky concerto had sung of the depth and sunlit splendours of human emotion so the good friday music had bridged and connected the two and shown her whence came the light that shone on them but whereas the concerto had led her through generalities to its culmination of the appeal to her own individual personality and its needs and longings in this she was led across the dim threshold of herself so to speak into the halls that were full of light into the house of many mansions vivid and ecstatic at first had been the sense of her own intense experience she was bathed in sun and sea and then was opened to her a communion of soul with those she loved that transcended all she had ever felt before and yet very soon that faded into nothingness it passed off the shield of her perception as a breath is dispersed in frosty air soon she was no longer the centre of her consciousness but only an atom of infinite insignificance in it it was no revelation of herself that was thus manifested yet inasmuch as she was part of the vital essence of the love that crowned the human understanding the human passions inasmuch as she could give thanks for its great glory that glory was part of her her love part of it one and indivisible it stirred in her even as it moved the sun and all the stars it was with no sense of interruptions or of a broken mood that she came out into the jostling of the populous streets for truth is not a mood and they with their crowded pavements and whirring roadways were part of it also and knew her solemn and joyful secret without doubt she would not always be able to feel with the same vividness of perception that the eternal peace encompassed her but having once realized it she knew that it would be there always a sure refuge that it was the answer to all the riddles and difficulties that life assuredly would continue to ply her with again and again she knew they would puzzle and perplex her again and again she would be mistblinded by them but she had seen an authentic glimpse as from pisgah of the kingdom to which led the royal roads they might wind over stony hillsides be packed with sand or clogged with resistant mire but they led to the promised land to the kingdom that was within the gates of which stood open night and day for all who willed to enter it was late already after eleven when she dismounted from the bus at the corner of oakley street and she half expected to find that her stepmother had gone to bed it must be allowed that elizabeth would not have been very sorry if this proved to be the case for she felt that she could give but a vague attention to the voluble trivialities that would otherwise await her but not till she had softly closed the street door behind her did she bring into focus the fact that mrs fanshawe had been dining alone with sir henry or that the voluble trivialities might be supplanted by news not trivial at all the idea when first it had occurred to her had repelled her with the repulsion that a deep love must naturally feel for any selfconscious and shallow affection there was a sort of heartbreaking jar in the thought that mrs fanshawe with her pen still dipping for ink to write the memoir should be thinking about remarriage but now the repulsion had left her she found herself less jealous for her fathers memory more ready to let the immortality of love look after itself more capable of sinking her personal feeling it was not that the idea had lost its sharp edges from her greater familiarity with it she saw it as distinctly as ever only the sharp edges now failed to fret her besides how could the shallowness of her stepmothers affections the insincerity that in itself was of so unreal a nature affect anything that was real mrs fanshawe had not gone to bed but was sitting in a very pretty pensive attitude hastily assumed when she heard elizabeths step on the stairs over a brisk little fire in front of which was standing in the fender a small covered dish she had put on a white bedroom wrapper with little black bows of ribbon her long abundant hair streamed over her shoulders there was never so bewitching a little widow she held out her arm with a welcoming gesture as elizabeth entered darling how late you are she said but if you have been enjoying yourself that is all i ask of you i could not bear to think that my little elizabeth should come in and find a silent house with no one to welcome her home she got up and gave elizabeth a little butterfly kiss see dear i lit the fire for you with my own hands so that your supper might keep warm there is a napkin which i spread for a tablecloth and a little rack of toast and some lemonade with plenty of sugar in it and just the wing of a chicken which i saved for you and ate a leg myself instead and a little bunch of grapes to follow and some gingerbread cake and while you eat dear you shall tell me all about your concert fancy if some day you played at a concert at the queens hall how proud i should be and should i not burst my gloves in applauding to tell all about the concert was a somewhat extensive suggestion but there was no need for elizabeth to reply as mrs fanshawe went on without pause i could not attend to anything dear she said until i had quite settled in my mind what would be the nicest little supper i could think of for you i had quite a little squabble with sir henry about eating a leg myself though i assured him that all epicures prefer the leg and he helped me to light the fire i assure you he was as zealous on your behalf as i was and he told me to be sure and give you his love if i did not think you would consider that a liberty thank you mamma said the girl and it was good of you to take so much thought for me i almost expected to find you had gone to bed i am so late i suppose sir henry has been gone some time a quarter of an hour ago perhaps i had not more than time to take off my dress and brush my hair but i could not go without a peep at you when you returned and i promised myself a little cosy talk over the fire when you had finished your supper elizabeth left the table and sat down in a big armchair near mrs fanshawe the latter took elizabeths hand as it lay on the arm and held it in both of hers i have been thinking of you so much dear she said all the time dear sir henry was here you have been in my mind every minute such a wise kind man he is and so full of sympathy and tenderness for me and he shows it with such wonderful tact not by dwelling on my great loss but by encouraging me and cheering me up i declare i laughed outright as i have not done for months at some of his delicious droll stories he is the sort of man to whom one can open ones heart completely all kinds of things we talked aboutabout old dear happy days and about india and oh elizabeth how i long to see dear india again he quoted something which i thought so true about hearing the east acalling and said it ought to be when you hear the east abawling was not that quaint of him the east abawling yes that is just what it does dear happy days in india with all its pleasant parties and society and balls i miss the gaiety of it all in our sad secluded life here in this little tiny house why the drawingroom is not much bigger than my bathroom was at peshawar i think that i am naturally of a gay and joyous nature dear i was not made for sadness apparently mrs fanshawe was taking a rest from thinking about elizabeth all the evening she seemed to realize this and hurried back to her subject and if it is sad for me how much more sad it must be for you darling for you used to enjoy yourself so in india with your horses and dogs i am sure you used to laugh fifty times a day out there for once that i hear you laugh now but it is not only of your loss of gaiety that i have been thinking so much there are things more important than that especially while you are young the loss of your fathers care and thought for you makes such a dreadful blank and i weighed down with all the petty cares and economies which we have to practise cannot look after you as constantly as i used my days are so full with the care of the house and with writing your dear fathers memoir which all these weeks has been to me nothing less than a sacred duty and even if i was quite free it would be impossible for me a little weak silly helpless woman to supervise your growing up with the wisdom and large grasp of a man i have been doing my best i think i can say that but i know how feeble and wanting my best has been there had been no opportunity so continuous had been the prattle of this monologue for elizabeth to speak at all for this she was grateful for she would have found it difficult enough to frame any sincere reply to this endless tissue of insincerities that were only halfconscious of themselves mrs fanshawe had been so long accustomed to look upon the utterly inaccurate picture of herself of which she was the artist so long unaccustomed to look on the actual origin of it that she really had got to confuse the two or rather to obliterate the one in favour of the imaginary portrait but tonight elizabeth did not feel the smallest resentment at this imposture she regarded her mother as she would have regarded some charadeacting child and was willing to encourage its belief in the reality of its acting for mrs fanshawe as for a child this dressingup was real and elizabeth could almost see her father listening with a smile that for all its tenderness did not lack humour he would have been amused surely at it all for all his own simplicity and sincerity he had never wanted to improve and edify others at the most he only encouraged them like the beloved plants in his garden to grow and blossom besides he had loved his wife for the life of her elizabeth had never been able to guess why and that simple facta fact which no one should try to explain awaytook precedence of everything else there was a pause for a few gentle applications of a very small lace handkerchief and it became incumbent on elizabeth to say something she knew of course perfectly well what her stepmother was leading up to and since she appeared to find it difficult to come to the point elizabeth decided to help her and so you and sir henry she began that was quite enough mrs fanshawe rose swiftly from her chair bent over her and kissed her my darling yes she said and i am so glad you have guessed i was so afraid it would come as a shock to you that i only promised henry that i would tell you tonight if i could i said he must trust to my instinct as to whether i should not only begin to prepare you for it i told him that he could not know as i knew how deeply you loved your father and that i must judge whether to tell you at once or not i said i would not wound my dear little elizabeths heart for anything but now you have guessed how nice that is and oh what a true and wise friend and second father you will find in him elizabeth do you wonder now my darling that i said how much i had been thinking of you all this evening suddenly it was borne in upon the girl that this playacting was really going too far it seemed impermissible to allow even a child to take its inventions quite so seriously it was as if the child insisted on having real solid food and real champagne provided for its pasteboard banquet yet yetwas there any gain to any one in saying remember you are only acting she knew well there was not detection and exposure of even such abominable insincerities as these never yet did any good to thethe criminal it only made her resent the cruel perspicacity of their exposer or possibly exercise a little more ingenuity in their inventions she would be wiser to enter into the spirit of these imaginative flights but it was like seeing somebody waving his arms saying see i am a bird how high i fly and pretending to look upwards and be dazzled and made giddy by this reckless feat of aviation it was sweet of you to think of me as well was as much as could humanly be expected of the best intentions that did not nearly satisfy mrs fanshawe my dear my central thought was of you she declared almost the first thing i said to henry whenwhen he would not let me go for he has such an affectionate nature and oh my darling how he loves mealmost the first thing i said was what about elizabeth you must not think that i have said yes to you until you assure me that you will be a father to elizabeth and he saidit was so like himwell offer her a grandfather anyhow birdie that was what he said he must call mehis brighteyed little birdieso foolish of him the clock on the chimneypiece chimed twelve and mrs fanshawe rose to an apex of surprising fatuity gracious me what an hour she said i believe i have not sat up till twelve this last two months we must go to bed or henry will find a dulleyed little birdie when he comes back in the morning and will never love her any more he will think he has made a great mistake and want to marry elizabeth instead dear henry i shall tease him about that but only just for a minute i would not vex his big loving heart for anything she looked at elizabeth with an expression that she was familiar with in her imaginary portraits of herself an expression which she called wistful of course i shall not dream of marrying until a whole year has passed she said nor i am sure would my henry wish me to he knows what a tender heart i have for my beloved memories but i think dear that i shall put the memoir on one side or perhaps give it to your aunt julia to deal with as she likes i dare say she would be glad of something to do in her poor empty life i will take it down with me on friday perhaps it has done its work she did not explain exactly what this last sentence meant and as there was no explanation whatever of it except that it seemed to finish up with the memoir in a vague and beautiful manner it would have been idle to attempt any so sleep well my precious she said kissing elizabeth i think you will do that wont you now that all our little anxieties are removed he is really immensely welloff what a responsibility that will be for me i hope i shall prove not quite unworthy of it mrs hancock had never seen much of her sisterinlaw and perhaps she would not have been so kindly disposed towards the task of making herself better acquainted with her had she known that she had been pitied for her poor empty life for poor empty life was indeed not a phrase that fitly described the passage of a pilgrim of mr martins gospel through this pleasant world but mrs hancock had no idea that so slanderous a thing had been said of her and she looked forward to her sisterinlaws visit with considerable pleasure which was enhanced by the prospect of having elizabeth in the house again she intended elizabeth to be in the best of spirits to play the piano to her very loudly and brightly mrs hancock knew she was just a little deaf and had seen four eminent specialists on the subject who implored her so she said not to be in the least disquieted but to eat rather less meat as her very slight dullness of hearing was certainly gouty in origin to drive with her on saturday afternoon and to sit constantly by her and admire her masterly methods with the king of mexico which had rendered thrilling so many afterdinner hours in egypt then mrs fanshawe should drive with her on saturday morning and they would have a great deal of beautiful talk about the colonel in her minds eye she saw her sisterinlaw crying a little and herself with touches and caresses administering the gospel of mr martin as through a fine hose in the most copious and refreshing abundance when she was quite refreshed and had been made to see that death is the gate into life no doubt she would read her part of the memoir in which mrs hancock took a great interest seeing that she had supplied so much material for the chapter or chapters it was to be hoped on his early life she expected to enjoy the account of the early life very much in the sort of way that a mellow sunset may be imagined to enjoy thinking over its own beautiful sunrise and if she found mrs fanshawe very sympathetic and understanding she thought she almost thought that she would confide in her something that she had never yet confided in anybody and after making clear to her what her own intentions in the matter were ask her advice if it appeared probable that it would turn out consonant with what she herself had practically made up her mind to do these last six months had been crowded with incident mrs hancock did not think any year in all her tale of fortyeight summers had held so much except perhaps the one year when she had married and edith had been born for now edith had married mrs williams had had an operation for the removal of a small tumour her brother had died she had been to egypt and had brought back scores and scores of photographs which she pasted at intervals into large halfmorocco scrapbooks procured at staggering expense from the stores she had forgotten what precisely a good many of them represented but edith with her wonderful memory usually knew and if she did not mrs hancock in her exquisitely neat hand wrote under them some noncommitting title such as temple in upper egypt or nile in january which it certainly was all this was sensational enough and mrs hancock had she read about a year so full of incident in a novel would have probably felt that fiction was stranger than truth when she was asked to believe that so many things happened really all together but with her another thing had happened fraught with more potential significance than them all for the death of her brother of whom she had seen so little for so many years had not really strongly moved her mrs williams had quite recovered and cooked just as well as ever edith still constantly drove and lunched with her and agitating though the pasting in of the photographs was she had pasted one in upside down and not noticed it till the next day when the paste was quite dry and stuck she did not ever look at them again but one event seemed likely to make a real difference to her life for while they were at luxor mrs martin had been suddenly taken ill with pneumonia and had died three days later she had proved herself a charming travelling companion and mrs hancock had been very much shocked and grieved at so sad an incident marring their holiday but she did not break down under the bereavement she ordered a beautiful tombstone though not expensive since she knew that mr martin was not very well off and left luxor as soon as possible bringing back with her a large photograph of the grave the widower being what he was behaved with the most characteristic fortitude and faith and she felt that she had been permitted to be a wonderful help and consolation to him since her return desolate though he was he had not let his work suffer indeed he added to his ordinary duties the supervision of the choirpractices which his wife had always managed and after a suitable interval played golf as regularly as ever and only last sunday he had preached the most wonderful sermon that mrs hancock had ever heard on the text of the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them thankfulness and joy was the keynote of it and everybody understood that the wilderness was egypt he showed how that in the midst of death we are in life and that joy cometh in the morning he had lunched with mrs hancock afterwards and she had settled that it must be printed with a purple not black line round the cover and with in memoriam january printed on the inner leaf he did not go away till it was time for him to take the childrens service at four but before that he had asked her if when his broken heart was healed it appeared to be making excellent progress she would become in name as well as in fact the partner of his joys and sorrows she rather thought she would though there were a great many things to be considered first and she promised him his answer in a weeks time mrs hancock had practically settled what that answer was to be and at present she had told nobody nor asked anybodys advice about it she had indeed thought of seeing how edith received the idea but on the other hand she felt that she would not give her the encouragement she wanted edith indeed had been altogether rather discouraging for months past ever since the party met at cairo and did not give the lively interest in and applause of her mothers plans which she would have liked it was not that she seemed unhappy if she had mrs hancock would have applied the cheerful gospel to her she simply appeared to be like a house shut up with blinds down and shutters closed no face looked out from it it was also impossible to penetrate into it perhaps like a caretaker edward had the key but mrs hancock as already noticed did not like to pry into affairs that might possibly prove depressing and she had not asked for it besides it was difficult to imagine any cause of unhappiness that could be hers edward always came home by the train just before dinner she expected a baby in july and after a tremendous struggle with herself mrs hancock had let her have her own peerless kitchenmaid as a cook but she felt that she would like to tell somebody who would probably agree with her what she contemplated and she had great hope that her sisterinlaw would prove sympathetic it had been a prepossessing trait to find her buying soap in high holborn and she had received with touching gratitude all the stories about mrs hancock which were to go into her husbands memoir but there had been a great deal to think about before she made up her mind she had a real liking a real admiration for her vicar about which there was in spite of her eight and forty years something akin to romance he was a very wonderful and encouraging person and certainly she had needed encouragement in the lonely month after ediths marriage again she felt sure that he would be devoted to her comfort and though the ecstasy of youthful love might be denied them she did not know that she was sorry for that she was perhaps some five years older than he but as youthful ardour was not part of her programme that little discrepancy of years was but of small consequence but there were other considerations she could not possibly go to live at the vicarage where the servants entrance was close under the diningroom windows and there was no garage she could not also be expected to help in parish work beyond the knitting of thick mufflers which went to warm deepsea fishermen but his golfplaying presented no difficulties at all she could start rather earlier drive him to the clubhouse and pick him up on her way home to be sure that would somewhat restrict her drives if she always had to start and come back by the same road perhaps it would be better if denton took him there first and she could call for him then what was to happen to the present furniture in the vicarage for she did not want any more in her own house she did not intend that such difficulties should be obstacles of magnitude but her mind which so long had been completely taken up in affairs of detail the whole general course of it being already marked out could not resist the contemplation of them here again a woman who went all the way to high holborn for soap might prove both comprehending and enlightening mrs fanshawe who with elizabeth was met on the platform by denton and by the car outside the station was an immediate success after the crude sort of harbourage in oakley street with its small rooms and its dreadful backyard with its parlourmaid who had a perennial cold and no notion of cleaning silver this perfectly ordered house with its smooth service and atmosphere of complete comfort was as cream to a cat that had been living on the thinnest skimmilk she admired she appreciated with a childlike sort of pleasure ate two buns with sugar on the top at tea because they were so delicious elizabeth darling you must eat one of these lovely buns and made herself instantly popular all the time in the depth of her heart she hugged the knowledge that she would so soon be in a position of extreme affluence and a ladyship and pitied mrs hancock for her poor empty life simultaneously mrs hancock felt what a treat it must be for her sisterinlaw to have a few days of comfort and luxury instead of going all the way to high holborn to get soap a little cheaper having seen her brothers will in the paper she knew exactly how much she and elizabeth had to live upon at five per cent of the capital and doubting whether they got more than four was warmed with a sense of her own benevolence in saving them three days of household books at the cost of a thirdclass ticket she felt sure they had gone thirdclass to heathmoor it was dreadfully sad for the poor thing to be left a widow and it was not to be expected that she would find a second husband very easily but her cordial admiration of all she saw was certainly prepossessing mrs hancock felt that she would probably prove a worthy recipient of her secret and give exactly the advice she wanted more metaphysically each of them felt drawn to the other by the striking similarity between them in the point of their lack of sincerity and the success they both achieved in deceiving themselves the three dined alone that night and soon after her stepmother having discovered that her sweetest elizabeth looked tired the two elder ladies were left alone and now my dear said mrs hancock they had got to mydearing each other before dinner was half over i so want to have a good talk to you i want to know all your plans and all about the memoir which i am sure will be most interesting shall i lay out a patience while we talk i can attend perfectly while i am playing one of the easier patiences elizabeth too it is such a joy to see elizabeth again after the sad sad parting in the summer mrs fanshawe put her head a little on one side wistfully elizabeth can hardly talk of the happy weeks she spent here she said and im sure i dont wonder at her enjoyment of them my dear how happy it must make you to make everybody around you so happy i dont believe you ever think of yourself mrs hancock smiled a longwanted red queen had appeared it does make one happy not to think of oneself she said and how the time goes when you are thinking of other people i am often astounded when sunday comes round again for the weeks go by in a flash i take my dear edith out for her drivesit is so good to her to have plenty of fresh airand she comes to lunch with me every day almost so that she shall not be alone in her house with her husband away all day and it is sunday again and i get what i call my weekly refresher from our dear mr martin such a beautiful sermon he gave us last sundayah there is the ten i wantedon the subject of his sad bereavement his wife you know i took her out to egypt with me it was most important that she should get out of the winter fogs and damp of england and she died at luxor after three days illness how glad i was she had a friend with hermy dear forgive me how thoughtless i am no not thoughtless my dear said mrs fanshawe not thoughtless and mr martin tell me about mr martin i feel sure i should like mr martin mrs hancock bundled her patience cards together she had not left a patience unfinished except when the patience had finished her for years perfectly as she could attend when she was playing it she prepared now to be absolutely undistracted indeed no one could help liking mr martin she said he has the noblest of characters and with it all not a touch of priggishness to see him play golf or to hear him laugh talk you would never think he was a clergyman but to hear him preach you would think he was a bishop at least i know of nobody whom i admire more listen was not that the frontdoor bell how tiresome if we are interrupted in our talk yes i hear lind going to open it now he has shut it again ah it is only a note will you excuse me yes from edward just to say he and edith will come to lunch tomorrow as he is not going up to the city no answer lind now mrs fanshawe had not failed to mark the expression of her sisterinlaws face when she spoke of mr martin if she had worn it herself she would have called it a rapt expression but it was not so admirable on the features of a woman who to adopt mrs fanshawes point of view was already aground so to speak on the shallows of advanced middleage where there is not sufficient youth to carry you over those emotional banks still on a younger and perhaps a more spiritual face it would have been rapt and it occurred to her that in mind perhaps her sisterinlaw was not as old as she looked or as she was it would be very ridiculous if at that age a woman was the prey of sentimental notionsbut then she had a very comfortable house a delightful retreat from the stuffy little kennel in oakley street mrs hancock waited till lind had quite shut the drawingroom door and then turned to her sisterinlaw again my dear i want your advice she said for you are a woman of the world and i am sure are wise you see this spring after poor mrs martins death i saw a great deal of the vicar and i think i was able to comfort and uphold him so that he leans a good deal on me now though of course we have been very great friends for years could you give that footstool just a little kick this way he feels his loneliness very much he wants some one whom he knows and trusts and shall i say admires yes said mrs fanshawe admires i am sure how kind of you well admires to take the place of her whom he has lost and who was a very good sweet sort of woman indeed mrs hancock leaned forward he has told all this to me she said putting her hand on mrs fanshawes arm now you know what i think of him do advise mewhat am i to say to him edith and edward you see are both so young it would be a wonderful thing for them to have a father to go to in those difficulties in which a man is so much more competent to advise them than a woman lind and denton too there is a great deal that a master of a house can do to influence menservants what shall i say to him probably no more wholly original reason for matrimony had ever been put forward than that it would provide a man to look after the butler but one of the stories about the colonels early life had shown that he had the highest opinion of his sisters originality today if never before that opinion was justified mrs fanshawe did not remember the story nor did the delirious originality strike her now but she saw quite clearly what mrs hancock the owner of this comfortable house wanted her to say she got up from her chair and knelt on the footstool which she had kicked a little my dear i envy you your beautiful unselfish nature she said and let me be the first to congratulate mr martin you shall be said mrs hancock kissing her chapter xiv hearts desire mrs hancock had made so touching a tale of the help she had been to mr martin and of mr martins devotion to her and how the chief reason for her contemplated marriage was that he might exercise a wise and fatherly care over edward and edith and denton and lind that mrs fanshawe lay awake for quite a considerable time that night in spite of the extreme comfort of her bed vividly exercising her imagination to see how she might paint with an even nobler brush the loves of henry and birdie she flattered herself that she had far more promising material to work with for what in point of romance was a middleaged country vicar to compare with the commanderinchief in india or what was the elderly mrs hancock in comparison with her young and graceful sisterinlaw she was slightly chagrined that mrs hancock had already bagged as a motive for matrimony the care of a fatherless daughter but she had rendered it ridiculous when it was thought over by the addition of a butler and a chauffeur besides edith was already married and no longer in the touching desolation of a newly orphaned girl just growing up however she found she had many very beautiful things to say and only hoped that mrs hancock would prove as zealous and absorbed a listener as she herself had been she had an opportunity of testing this when they started on their drive next morning mrs fanshawe was not quite ready when the motor came round but after a prolonged debate it was decided to go round by the old mill just the same and put off lunch for five minutes her unpunctuality however was quite forgiven her when she explained that she and elizabeth had been so wrapped up in the tulips that she had no idea how late it was mrs fanshawe began preparing for her exquisite revelation without loss of time youve no idea how thrilled i was dear by what you told me last night she said i lay awake so long thinking about it and it is such a treat oh such a treat to be confided in i feel we are quite old friends already mrs hancock beamed approval we had a nice talk she said and i should not wonder if we saw mr martin playing golf in any case you will see himoh what a jolt that must have been something big on the road do you think we might have your window a little more down dear i want you to profit by this lovely air yes just like that i wonder how i shall tell mrs williams and edith and them all about it i shall feel so nervous perhaps i had better leave it to mr martin what do you think yes if you look out of this window you will see him there that is he hitting away with his golfstick at that furzebush how vigorous is he not oh did you see his ball fly away then he plays so beautifully indeed dear i feel such old friends with you too and to think thatthere he is talking to his partner now they are quite out of sight mrs fanshawe could not at once decline from the high standard of sympathy and comprehension she had set last night and i only just caught a glimpse of him she said i shall have to curb my impatience till i meet him at your house but i warn you my dear i shall be very critical of the man who is going to take care of you he will have to think about you much more than you ever think about yourself mrs hancock shook her head no quite the other way round dear she said i shall have to take care of him he wears himself out with work i have no doubt that after his game todayhe plays golf really entirely for the sake of the influence it gives him over the young men here and he introduces a spirit of earnestness among the caddiesare they not called who carry the sticksafter his game i dare say he will go straight to his study and finish up his sermon there is the great western railway look what a long luggagetrain i wonder what it contains perhaps the new lawntennis net which i ordered from the stores yesterday i know that when i have charge of mr martin i shall not let him wear himself out so he ought to have a curate for instance i wonder how much a good curate costs mrs fanshawe had no data on which to base this calculation and mrs hancock allowed the conversation to veer a little in her direction you are getting quite a colour in your cheeks dear already she said with our good air you must come here often and have plenty of it i cant tell you how often i have meant to ask you here with dear elizabeth but i was determined to get everything straight first after my long absence so that you would be quite comfortable and how often my heart has bled for you in your loneliness i remember so well after my dear husband died i thought i should never enjoy anything any more even now sometimes i should feel dreadfully depressed if i allowed myself to but i have always told myself what great causes i have for thankfulness mr martin mrs fanshawe broke in feeling that there was a limit at which sympathy passes into drivel and comprehension into idiotic acquiescence besides it was only fair that she should have some sort of an innings i feel so much all that you say dear she said especially about causes for thankfulness i am sure they are showered on me and bob was always so anxious and thoughtful for my happiness that i should feel that i should be failing in my duty to him if i lost any opportunity of securing it this sentence did not seem to come out exactly as she had meant it sounded as if the imputation of selfishness might possibly be applied to it which she did not at all wish to incur she continued hastily and happiness only lies as you dear show so well in the making of others happy i wish i had more people to take care of and think about at present there has been only elizabeth who has needed me i think i may say i have given myself to elizabeth for i am sure i have thought of little else but her and the memoir since august last i have brought down the memoir as far as i have got you will like to see it i might leave it with you when i go away on monday after my happy visit mrs hancock rapidly considered whether she wanted her new friend to stop till tuesday she felt she could not make up her mind on the spur of the moment that will be a great treat she said or perhaps you would read some of it aloud to me i am sure you have written it beautifully and i so much like being read aloud to the chapter on his early life will bring back old times look there are the towers of windsor castle we can only see them on a very clear day mr martin has wonderfully long sight mrs fanshawe wrenched the conversation back again she was going to set up another standard for their joint admiration but i want more to look after more to take care of she said and would you think it very weak of me if i said i wanted also to be a little taken care of myself i am so inexperienced and i am afraid bob spoiled me and made me used to being so lovingly looked after and there is somebody dear who wants oh so much to be allowed to look after me mrs hancock was just about to remark that the towers of windsor castle were no longer visible but this completely arrested her she had a momentary sense that mrs fanshawe had taken a mean advantage of her in allowing anything to interfere with the unique interest of her own situation it came into her mind also that any one who had married her brother ought not to think of remarriage for years and years if ever but both these impressions were overscored by curiosity she gave a little excited scream my dear how you surprise me she said yes pray tell me more who is it mrs fanshawe pulled out this ace of trumps sir henry meyrick she said commanderinchief you know in india such devotion i am sure that if i had the hardest heart in the world instead of a very soft one i should not be able to let such devotion go unrewarded and elizabeththink how he will look after elizabeth he is so devoted to her i declare i should be quite jealous if i did not know that it was just a fatherly affection this allusion to the daughtermotif seemed to mrs hancock rank plagiarism and spoiled in the stealing elizabeth was not mrs fanshawes daughter she had no right at all to use that as a reason she made up her mind if that dim mirror which reflected fleeting emotions can be called a mind that mrs fanshawe should go away on monday then immediately the mirror reflected another imageit would be rather interesting to speak about my sisterinlaw lady meyrick to be sure it was a very short time since colonel fanshawes death but then it was a much shorter time since mrs martins rapidly these evanescent images chased each other over the field and before the pause grew uncordial she fixed on one of them namely my sisterinlaw lady meyrick my dear i am quite overcome with your news she said it is most interesting and i am sure i wish you happiness with all my heart i have often seen sir henrys name in the newspapers and wondered what he was like and now to think that he is to become so near a relation by an effort of great magnanimity she decided to pass over the plagiarism altogether and what good fortune for elizabeth she said whose welfare was always such a source of thought and contriving to me and what does she think of it all why we are at the old mill already if you could just reach that speakingtube dear and call to denton to stop so that we may enjoy looking at it mr martin always calls it the most picturesque corner in middlesex how swiftly the water runs does it not of course you will not think of being married for a long time to come is it not a coincidence that our dear bob should have married twice and now you are going to do the same and mr martin too and me i declare i never heard of such coincidences you must be sure and tell sir henry to come down to see me mr martin and he must make friends and who knows that i shall not flap my wings a little further yet and come out to see you in india where does the commanderinchief live look there is the miller fishing i wonder if he has caught anything i am afraid we must turn or we shall be late for lunch which would never do as we have postponed it in order to be in time and i hope you wont dream of going away on monday you must stop till tuesday at the very least mis fanshawe was not perfectly satisfied though she felt she was being envied she determined not to be so easy of access you must get henrys leave for that she said for i promised him i would be back on monday i dont know what he would do if i broke my promise to him and such a business as i had to allow him to let me go away at all for the first time for many years mrs hancock found herself in the position of one who asked instead of granted favours ah i wonder if you could induce him to come down here on monday to take you back the next day or the day after she said mrs fanshawe greedily pursued her advantage and assumed an air of odious superiority but dear we should be taxing the capabilities of your charming little house too much she said feeling certain of her ground i should not wonder if henry was unable to go anywhere without his secretary as well as a servant he must have to keep in constant touch with the india office but it is delightful of you to suggest it only we must not trespass on your goodnature no difficulty at all cried mrs hancock there is the pink room and the best blue bedroom and the lilac dressingroom next mine into which elizabeth can go the thing is done dear if you will only say the word and if sir henry plays golf there will be mr martin delighted to lend him some golfsticks and go round with him do they not call it it will be a pleasure to him he has always had such an admiration for soldiers for to be sure as he says sometimes he is a soldier himself fighting battles continually i will get up a little dinnerparty for monday night and edward and elizabeth shall play afterwards if sir henry likes music while this kittenish comedy was going on something younger and more tragical was in progress in the two adjacent houses edward had been sitting in his smokingroom after breakfast with eyes that wandered over his uncomprehended newspaper conscious of an overmastering desire to slip across to the house next door merely to see elizabeth to satisfy the eyes that ached for her and as he knew well but to render the more acute the aching of his heart his wife as was often her custom had come in after she had attended to her household duties and sat in her usual seat by the window speaking occasionally to him or replying in perfectly commonplace fashion to his dropped observations they had spoken of their plans for the day of the arrival of mrs fanshawe and elizabeth and now and then focusing his eyes but not his mind he had mentioned some newspaper topic such halfhours they had spent a hundred times before but today each was intensely conscious of something that always lying behind their intercourse and never spoken of between them had suddenly enveloped and enshadowed like the gathering of a tropical storm the foreground of their life as well he tried to imagine himself putting down his newspaper in a leisurely way and forming his voice to say lightly and casually that he would stroll across to mrs hancocks but he felt that as if intoxicated his tongue would stammer and stumble on the words once he laid his paper down and saw that on the instant she had started into attentive expectation had fixed her eyes on him ready for what she knew would come from his lips for she read so he felt his unspoken sentence knowing what filled his mind but still he sat there unable to tell her what he ached to do while she waited in all the months of their marriage elizabeths name had been mentioned only as the name of some indifferent cousin might have been never as one who held edwards heart in the hollow of her hands for herself even as bees build up in walls of impenetrable gluelike wax some intruder and enemy to their hive edith had walled away from her life all thought of her cousin she had built her up into a separate chamber of her brain so that her workerbees the conscious denizens of her mind should have no access to her her love for edward that nipped and unexpanded bud which had never blown which had claimed possession of him instead of giving him his liberty and seeking his happiness at the cost of the last drop of her hearts blood had starved on its comfortless food and the leanness of her desire had entered into her soul for seven months she had been his wife sharer in name in all that nominally was his recipient of his unwearied kindness and affection but never for a single moment possessing his essential self she had no word or thought of complaint of him in his conduct or in his feelings towards her he gave all that was his to give she had demanded of him the fulfilment of his bargain and to the full extent of his solvency so to speak he had paid it but now she knew that he was absolutely insolvent towards her with regard to the coinage of the only true mint she had thought that her love with its hopeless limitations could make his reef of gold hers she had thought that they could settle down into a sham that would cheat both himself and her that the mask of his face would either be withdrawn or would deceive her into the belief of its reality neither had happened he must always wear a mask for her and that mask would never grow so like the human face below it so little way below and yet withdrawn into impenetrable depths that it would deceive her into believing in it and now before long she would bear a child to him and it seemed to her in the enlightenment that these smooth prosperous months of misery had brought her that her baby would be no better than a bastard it must not be supposed that this misery was acute or the degree of enlightenment it brought clear and cloudless her perceptions were not of the kind that admit great poignancy either of wretchedness or of bliss once only perhaps in all her life had the engines of her being worked up to their full power and that was when she claimed the fulfilment of edwards promise she had felt intensely and acutely then the impossibility of giving him up but since that flash of deplorable intensity she had fallen back on to her normal levels where the ground so to speak was solid and rather clayey where there were neither peaks nor precipices but it declined slowly and unintermittently into a place of featureless gloom yet except to any one who was gifted with the divine intuition of love towards her there were no signs in her normal behaviour of this inward wretchedness and for poor edith there was nobody thus inspired she had always been rather reserved and silent and even mr martin that brilliant seeker after the joys and sorrows of others had neither missed in her the steady placidity that he knew nor had detected any other change as for her mother ediths invariable punctuality her quiet recognition of objects of interest like the towers of windsor castle and the trains on the great western railway were sufficient evidence of contentment especially since edward always got home by the dinner train and she was going to have a baby here were adequate causes for thankfulness and she was sure that edith who had so strong a sense of duty appreciated them ediths enlightenment was of the same order no noonday blaze but only a diffused luminance that came veiled through those clouds not dispersing them but she no longer groped in darkness as she had done when she decided that she could not voluntarily give edward his liberty she could see more now not only could she see the utter unreality at which she had grasped but that there was in existence a real light different altogether from the phantasmal willothewisp which she had blindly followed into the quagmire she had sought her own thinking that it was love she followed she would have sought her own no longer if it had been possible for her to make choice again vaguely as she sat this morning by the window these things passed before her mind as the pictures of some wellknown and familiar book pass before the eye of one who listlessly turns the leaves at the end of the book she knew there were pictures she had not seen yet it was as if edwards finger as well as hers was on the page doubting whether to turn on or not nearly an hour wore away thus outwardly like many other hours but in reality an hour of poise and expectancy then on the road outside the gate she saw pass as she had so often seen her mothers motor mrs fanshawe was with her and next door elizabeth was alone mother going out for her drive she said mechanically she did not look round but heard the paper flutter in edwards fingers alone he asked or with whom with mrs fanshawe said she and again the silence fell suddenly a desire and a doubt came to her she did not know how they came for the impulse that prompted them seemed to have taken no part in her thoughts apparently something behind that wall of gluelike wax had stirredstirred imperatively giving her quickness and decision she rose i shall go across and see elizabeth she said i know you have been wanting to do that all morning edward but you couldnt say it i understood he got up also what do you mean he said what are you saying something perfectly simple of course you want to see elizabeth and of course you find a difficulty in telling me so do you know that we havent mentioned elizabeths name except as a stranger might mention it ever since our marriage ever since the night in fact thatthat i settled to marry you no and that was natural wasnt it certainly something stirred behind the sealedup partition the bees themselves the thoughts and workers in ediths mind were tearing the partition away i suppose it was she said but i want to see elizabeth now that is natural too because i was always fond of elizabeth and i dont blame her because you loved her you see she never loved you she told me that herself he came close to her why do you speak of elizabeth now he said after all these months of silence she shook her head i dont know why does one do anything it occurred to me i suppose to speak of elizabeth because she is here and because i was going across to see her she never loved you edward no you told me that he spoke quietly and reassuringly but it occurred to him that for some reason edith was beginning to doubt that for she looked at him so it seemed with a certain question and challenge in her eye it was as if she weighed his answer or took it like a doubtful coin and rang it to test its genuineness i shall go now she said still lingering or do you not wish me to go she paused a moment why do you not wish me to go edward she said i want you to do just as you wish dear he said for the moment a certain cloud of trouble and restlessness quite alien to her normal reasoning had seemed to disturb her but it cleared and she spoke naturally again we lunch there do we not she said i dare say i shall not come again before that till lunchtime then she traversed the hall hesitated as to whether she should take a hat decided against it and went out into the cool spring sunshine the gate of communication between the two gardens mrs hancock had eventually decided that since edith and edward used it so much more than she did it was only reasonable that he should pay for half of it had been made and she went through it leaving it aswing with a tinkling latch as she had said to edward she scarcely knew why the idea of elizabeth and the desire to see her had taken hold of her mind all these months she had deliberately and of set purpose put the idea of elizabeth from her consciously segregating it refusing it admittance into the current of her thoughts that had been natural enough for it was on the elimination of elizabeth from their joint lives that the success of their marriage she had seen must depend and today she had registered had contemplated and admitted the fact of its failure elizabeth had not been eliminated from their lives when just now edith had alluded casually almost to the fact of edwards being in love with her saying she did not blame elizabeth for that he had let that pass without challenge it had not occurred to him however lamely to take exception to it that had shown with a convincingness that she had not known before how her cousin was knitted into edwards heart it would have to be cut to bits before she could be disentangled from it quietly insensibly throughout those months that conviction had been growing on her it had been like some bulb buried in the earth she had known in her inner consciousness though there was no outward evidence of the fact that it was growing today the green vigorous horn of its sprouting showed above the ground it was not a shock to her any more than is a letter that confirms the bad news conveyed in a telegram but its authenticity now was quite beyond dispute in those seven months of their marriage elizabeths spell had lost none of its potency and edith stood between them just as she had done on the day when she had decided she could not give him up holding them apart today too a definite doubt had come into her mind and she knew that her desire to see elizabeth was connected with its possible resolution months ago elizabeth had told her that no idea of love for edward had ever been hers that she had never thought of him in such a light today for no definite reason but by process probably of the general enlightenment that her misery had brought her she wondered if that was true at first when elizabeth had told her that she had implicitly believed it now she wondered whether elizabeth had not said that for her sake whether seeing that she herself was determined not to give edward up elizabeth had not splendidly lied certainly that statement true or not had had the effect of making edith quite comfortable as her mother would say a dozen and a hundred dozen times she had told herself relying on that that edward would have been no nearer his happiness if she had given him up but edith did not so far deceive herself as to say that it would have made any difference to her decision even if elizabeth had loved him she knew herself but poorly but she knew herself sufficiently well to be aware that nothing in the world just then would have induced her voluntarily to give him his freedom it had been open to him to break his word and not marry her but it had not seemed morally possible for her to let him go elizabeth was just coming out of the long window of the drawingroom when edith passed through the gate and the two cousins met on the croquetlawn these warm days of may had made it possible to play already and edward at his wifes wish had had several games in preparation for the heathmoor tournament ellis this morning had moved several seats out of the summerhouse on to the grass and the croquet set no complete in tinlined box the most expensive set of all that could be bought at the stores which had been mrs hancocks weddingpresent to edward stood open in case anybody wished to play just a year ago as it now occurred to edith she had sat here when elizabeth on the morning after her arrival from india had come out she remembered how almost on the first mention of edwards name elizabeth had guessed their engagement edith greeted her with her usual precise and restrained manner i heard you and mrs fanshawe arrived yesterday she said mother was looking forward to your coming elizabeth kissed her i was glad to come she said i was beginning to be afraid i should never see heathmoor again edith looked at her a moment in silence did you want to she asked yes i wanted to see you too edith ii hope you are happy edith laughed a wretched little jangle of a laugh i am very comfortable mother will tell you she said edward is always very kind to me he has made a great deal of money this year he comes back from town every evening by the dinner train and i am going to have a baby the semblance of ordinary conversation had to be kept up as long as edith chose if the talk was going to get more intimate the deepening of it had to come from her quite suddenly it came i am very unhappy elizabeth she said i have not had a single happy moment since i married it has all turned out different to what i expected i wanted edward so much that i could not give him up and i thought that by degrees he would turn to me andand love me he never loved me he proposed to me and i accepted him because we both thought that we should be very comfortable together so we should have been if he had nothad not fallen in love with you elizabeth laid her hand on ediths knee my dear is there any need to speak of that she said edith turned quickly on her all her secret self suppressed through those months which by rights should have been months of such wonderful and magical expansion fell on her struggling to be allowed utterance when she came here with no more than her vague desire to see elizabeth she had not guessed how like highwaymen with cudgels and bludgeons her secret walledup life would attack her fighting to express itself i think there is need to speak of it she said and i have no one whom i can speak to but you if i told mother she wouldshe would recommend me to see mr martin if i told edward he would only try to be kinder to me elizabeth his kindness chokes me i cant breathe in it it has all been an utter utter failure i thought that he would get to love me so that it would be enough for me to be with him always i thought i should be satisfied to be his wife i thought too that he would be happy as well as i for i was not so i thought then entirely selfish i should not have refused to give him up if i had thought that it would turn out so hopelessly then there was this as well you did not love him and so i was not standing in the way of his happiness elizabeth felt her face go suddenly white had she too made an awful a lifelong mistake she knew the integrity of her purpose when she had told edith she did not love him how she had said that simply and solely for ediths sake so that having definitely and irrevocably chosen not to give edward up she might not be the prey of backthoughts and gnawings but what if all this misery all this hunger this unslaked thirst could have been avoided what if she had rejected her great renunciation had avowed her love for edward had given rein to the steeds of desire had her renunciation been no more than some savage heathen rite some mutilation of herself and him for a moment the very foundations of her world seemed to sway and all its noble superstructure to totter but edith did not notice the blanching of her face nor saw her quivering eyelids she was looking fixedly at the spot in the lawn in front of her with an intent and absent air and went on speaking in the same unemotional voice i may as well be honest she said because there does not seem to be much else left as a matter of fact i should not have done differently even if you had loved him i did not care two straws for your happiness nor for his but only for my own and yet i did love him i was passionately fond of him i thought i could make him love me or at any rate that he would forget you i told myself anyhow that it was but a sudden wild fancy he had for you that he had fallen in love with your music i did not care what i told myself so long as i got him and now at this present moment i would give anything in the world if it could be made possible that i should still love him i dont love him any more i am not even jealous that he loves you he may do as he likes if only he could cease being kind to me if only i could go right out of his life and never see him again but thats impossible soon i shall be the mother of his child and besides mother would think it so odd so would mr martin they would call me wicked but i think it is really much wickeder to go on living with him yes all the time that i was trying to get his love i was only poisoning my own i was poisoning that which was dearer to me than anything in the world i am sorry for it now it lies before me quite dead killed by me well i can say truthfully that i am sorry when you have committed a crime like that the only possible palliation is that you are sorry but i did love him even when i gave my love that first dose of poison in refusing to let him go i loved him she got up in agitation let no one say i did not love him she cried in a voice suddenly strained and shrill elizabeth got up also forcing down her terror at this tragic figure suddenly revealed to her and full of growing pity edith dear you are talking wildly she said you dont know what you are saying edith put up both hands to her head it is not wild talk she said it is sober truth but i express it badly i get confused and there was something i wanted to ask you was it really true what you told me then her face changed the hardness and restraint faded from it it became humanized again by suffering elizabeth i feel so ill she said i am in pain in great pain elizabeth was sitting in the window of edwards smokingroom where two mornings ago he and edith had sat talking and reading before she came over to the house next door late that night her baby a sevenmonths child had been born flickering faintly into life and out again and now in the room overhead edith lay dying an hour ago she had asked to see elizabeth but had passed into a state of unconsciousness before the girl could come to her so now elizabeth waited near at hand in case her cousin rallied again and again wished to see her edward in the room upstairs had promised to call her at once mrs hancock watched with him the house was very still with that curious stillness that comes with such a waiting outside the warm may wind blew in at the window laden with the scent of the wallflowers that grew just outside and the air was full of the fragrance and chirrupings of spring at the gate stood mrs hancocks motor which had just brought down a doctor from london who at this moment was holding a consultation with ediths doctor in the diningroom elizabeth had propped open the door of the room where she sat so that she might hear him come out and get a word with him but she had been told there was no hope that her cousin would live above her head from the room where edith lay came an occasional footstep sounding dim and muffled and she could hear the slow tick of the clock in the hall outside she guessed she believed with certainty what it was edith wanted to say to her namely to repeat the question that had been cut short by the coming of her pains two days before and elizabeth knew how she would answer it she sat there long in silence alert for any noise that should come from the house then the diningroom door where the physicians were consulting opened and she went out to meet them in the hall a couple of sentences told her all and the london specialist walked out to the motor waiting for him while the other went upstairs again to the silent room from outside came the whirr of the engines as denton started them again elizabeth sat down on the bottom step of the stairs her mind quite still and inactive occasionally like a cloud taking substance suddenly in a serene sky some remembered scene some sentence some trivial happening connected with edith appeared there forming itself and vanishing again and more than once ediths voice sounded in her ears as she said let no one say that i did not love him but for the most part the imminence of the great silent event that they were all waiting for kept her mind vacant in that presence she could not think of anything else those little things that kept occurring to her seemed to come from outside then she heard a stir above her the click of an opened door and looking round and up she saw edward beckoning to her she has asked for you he said as she entered edith was lying on her bed looking with wideopen eyes at the ceiling she did not seem to notice elizabeths entrance but the doctor beckoned to her and she knelt down at the right of the bed then he went back and stood some little distance off by the window the breeze streamed in through the open sash making the blind tassel rattle and tap against the wall but otherwise there was dead silence then suddenly edith spoke i want to see elizabeth she said will not elizabeth come elizabeth got up i am here edith she said i want to speak to you alone she said nobody else must hear she had turned her eyes to the girl as she bent over her and waited looking at her with a fixed anxious expression till the others had gone into the dressingroom adjoining we are alone she asked then tell me did you love him elizabeth bent lower over her and kissed her yes dear edith she said i always loved him thenthen you must get him to forgive me perhaps he will forgive me do you think he will elizabeth took hold of the white wet hand that lay outside the coverlet oh my dear she said ask him to come then said edith faintly quickly quickly next moment they stood together by the bed her lips moved once but no sound came from them only her eyes over which lay the deepening shadow looked from one to the other and back again
