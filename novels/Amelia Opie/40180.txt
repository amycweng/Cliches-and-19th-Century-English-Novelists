especially of my own that i am doubtful whether i am not following the dictates of self love when i seem to be actuated by friendship only as you have repeatedly assured me that the story of my life will not alone amuse and interest you but also hold up to an injudicious and suffering friend of yours a salutary example of the patient fulfilment of a wife's duty there is something very gratifying to one's self love in being held up as an example but remember i beg that while to oblige you i draw the veil from past occurrences and live over again the most trying scenes of my life i think myself more a warning than an example and that if i exhibit in any degree that difficult and sometimes painful task the fulfilment of a wife's duty i at the same time exhibit the rash and dangerous fervour of a woman's love i must begin my narrative by a short account of my progenitors introduction my grandfather and the grandfather of seymour pendarves were brothers and the younger sons of a gentleman of ancient family and large possessions in the county of cornwall some of whose paternal ancestors were amongst the first settlers in america disappointments of which i never heard the detail and dislike of their paternal home determined these young men to leave their native country and embark for the new world where the family had still some land remaining and on the improvement of which they determined to spend a sum of money which had been left them by a relation they carried out with them besides money enterprise industry integrity and talents after they had been settled in long island three years they found themselves rich enough to marry and the beautiful daughters of an opulent american farmer became their wives my grandfather had only one child a son but his brother had a large family of whom however one only survived a son also these two cousins were brought up together and were as much attached to each other as if they had been brothers never as i have been told was there a scene of greater domestic happiness than my grandfather's house exhibited till death deprived him of his beloved wife he did not long survive her and my uncle soon afterwards lost her equally beloved sister whose health had been destroyed first by the fatigue of attendance on her sick children and then by grief for their loss george pendarves the sad survivor of so many dear ones now lost his spirits lost that energy which had so much distinguished him before and he soon sunk under the cessation of those habits of exertion and temperance which he had once practised and after two or three years of protracted suffering died thus the two youthful cousins found themselves both orphans before they had reached the age of twenty they had not inherited their parents' dislike of europe on the contrary when their fathers imparted to them the learning and the elegant arts which they had acquired at the university and in the society of england they were impressed with respect and admiration for the sources whence such precious stores were derived and resolved to enter themselves at an english college accordingly having put a confidential agent into their farms they set sail for the land of their ancestors and arrived at pendarves castle the seat of their eldest paternal uncle who had come into possession of the estates on the death of his father at this time my mother and lady helen seymour the daughter of lord seymour were both on a visit there the young americans had now been some months expected and their relations had long been amusing themselves with conjecturing what these savages as they fancied them would be like while they anticipated much pleasure from beholding their surprise at manners scenes and accommodations so different from their own nor was my mother though she was their relation and herself a pendarves less forward than her friend lady helen to hold up these strangers in a ridiculous view to her imagination and to express an unbenevolent eagerness for the arrival of the yankees at length they came and it was on the evening of a ball given by mr pendarves to celebrate the birth day of his wife the dance was begun before they arrived and their uncle was called out of the room to receive them he went with a heart warmed with fraternal affection and yearning towards the representatives of his regretted brothers but the emotion became overpowering when he beheld them for those well remembered brothers seemed to stand before him in improved loftiness of stature dignity of person and beauty of feature from their mothers they had inherited that loveliness and symmetry which so peculiarly distinguish american women and in stature they towered even above their father's family the young men at the same time were considerably affected at sight of mr pendarves as he reminded them strongly of their parents while these endearing recollections were uppermost in their minds mr pendarves at first wholly forgot how different his nephews were from the pictures his laughter loving family had delighted to draw of them but when he did recollect it he enjoyed the idea of the surprise which their appearance would occasion their dress as well as their manners bespoke them perfect gentlemen but their hair was not yet spoiled by compliance with the fashion of england at that period for it curled uncontaminated by powder in glossy clustering ringlets on their open brows such were the young men who now followed mr pendarves to the apartment in which his lady received her guests dear me how surprising cried that lady who was very pretty very volatile and very apt to think aloud are these the yankees why i protest they look more like christians than savages and are like other people except that they are much handsomer than other people this last part of her speech made some amends for the first part but had she been of a contrary opinion mrs pendarves would have uttered it and the glow of indignation on their cheek was succeeded by that of gratified vanity for their hostess added to her compliment by asking mr pendarves if he was not quite proud of his nephews he replied in the affirmative declaring himself impatient to show them to the assembled family it was therefore with cheeks dyed with becoming blushes and eyes sparkling with delight at the flattering welcome which they had received that they followed their uncle to the ball room but at his desire they stopped within the folding doors whence they surveyed the gay groups before them mr pendarves made his way amongst the dancers and accosting his guest lady helen seymour and julia pendarves his niece told them they must leave the dance a little while for he must present to them the yankees who were just arrived i will come as soon as i have been down the dance they both exclaimed but how unfortunate they should come to night for what can we do with them in a fine party like this because said julia though they may do to laugh at in our own family circle one should not like to see one's relations supply subjects for laughter to other people the dance was now beginning and mr pendarves smiling sarcastically as he listened to his niece allowed her to dance to the bottom of it secretly resolving that she should now ask him for that introduction which she had thus delayed and in the meanwhile he amused himself with watching for the first moment when lady helen and julia should discover the two strangers which he knew they could not fail to do as the dance down which they were now going fronted the folding doors mr pendarves did not watch long in vain lady helen and her companion saw them at the same instant and were so struck with their appearance that they were out in the figure and wondered to their partners who those strangers could be i cannot think replied one of the gentlemen but they look like brothers and are the finest and handsomest men i ever saw julia whispered lady helen is it possible these can be your yankee cousins if so i am so ashamed and so am i and do look at my uncle he is laughing at us oh it must be they i am so shocked when they reached the bottom of the dance they vainly looked towards mr pendarves he cruelly kept aloof the strangers turned however eagerly round at hearing some one behind them address another by the name of miss pendarves their glowing cheeks their animated looks were not lost on their equally conscious observers and mr pendarves now good naturedly came forward to put a stop to this embarrassing dumb show by presenting the cousins to each other and then introducing them to lady helen you remember my mother and you have seen a picture of lady helen you will not wonder therefore that the sudden admiration which lady helen felt that evening for george pendarves and my mother for charles was as warmly returned it even seemed that their attachment foreran that of their lovers for the cousins went to college without disclosing their love on their return however finding the dangerous objects whom they meant to avoid still at pendarves they ventured to make their proposals and unsanctioned by parental authority lady helen and my mother accepted the vows of their lovers and pledged theirs in return i shall pass over the consequent misery which they underwent and simply state that the two friends were at last so hurried away by their romantic affection that they allowed the cousins to carry them to gretna green and that after the ceremony they embarked from the nearest scotch port for america at first lady helen was too happy in the new ties which she had formed to feel much sorrow or much compunction when she remembered those which she had broken but when she became a parent herself and learnt the feelings of a mother she thought with agonizing regret on the pains which she had inflicted on her own and in the bitterness of awakened remorse she supplicated to be forgiven the answer to this letter was sealed with black and was in the hand of her father it was as follows your mother is dead and it was your disobedience which killed her expect therefore no forgiveness from me seymour a fever of the brain was the consequence of this terrible stroke and her life was despaired of in the agonies therefore of anxious affection george pendarves wrote to lord seymour retorting on him his own blow for he told him that his letter had killed lady helen the wretched husband inflicted as much pain as he intended for lady helen however faulty was lord seymour's favourite child his only daughter and the next letters from america were expected with trembling anxiety the information therefore that lady helen was better was received with gratitude though it did not procure an offer of forgiveness my mother though not quite such a culprit as lady helen because she was one of many daughters left an aged grandmother and an affectionate uncle with whom she lived but the former pronounced her forgiveness before she breathed her last and suffered the will to remain in force in which he had left her a handsome legacy nor was her uncle himself slow to pronounce her pardon she therefore had no drawbacks on her felicity but the sight of lady helen's constant dejection which was so great that my father thought it right to make an effort to procure her the comfort of lord seymour's pardon the troubles in america were now on the eve of breaking out for it was the year and the joy of my birth was considerably damped to my affectionate parents by the increasing agitation of the country but george pendarves was too miserable and too indignant to write himself he therefore gladly deputed my father to write for him while they were impatiently awaiting the reply they both busied themselves in politics in order to escape from domestic uneasiness and though undetermined which side to take they were considerably inclined to espouse the cause of the mother country when lord seymour's answer arrived in which he offered lady helen and her husband his entire forgiveness on condition that the latter took part against the rebels as he called them and accepted a commission in the english army which would soon be joined by his son colonel seymour it is impossible to say which at this trying moment was the governing motive of george pendarves whether it was chiefly political conviction or whether he was influenced insensibly by the wish of conciliating his father in law in order to restore peace to the mind of the woman whom he adored but certain it is that this letter hastened his decision and that my father who loved him as a brother coincided with him in that decision and resolved to share his destiny accordingly both the cousins accepted commissions in the british army and when colonel seymour met his brother in law at head quarters he presented to him a letter from his father containing a fervent blessing for lady helen and himself the husband and the brother soon after obtained permission to visit the one his wife and the other his sister and something resembling peace of mind on one subject at least returned to the patient lady helen while with a mother's pride she put into the arms of her brother her only child seymour pendarves to whom unpermitted she had given the name of her family and who was then seven years old but now a new source of anxiety was opened upon her her husband was become a soldier and she had to fear for his life nor was she in a state to follow him to battle as she would otherwise have done because she had lately been confined with a dead child my mother was in this respect more fortunate for she was able to accompany her husband to the seat of war and she persisted to do so though both my father and his cousin earnestly wished her to stay with lady helen and myself i being at that period only two years old but my mother had set up her husband as the only idol whom she was called upon to worship and before that idol she bowed down in singleness of adoration nor could the inconvenience to which her resolution exposed him at all shake her constancy she was equally insensible also to the anxiety which her leaving lady helen at such a time occasioned both to the husband and the brother of that amiable being the reply of it is my duty to accompany my husband as long as i can silenced all objections from others and all the whisperings of her own affectionate heart and she tore herself away though not without considerable pain from the embrace of her friend and committed me to her maternal care dreadful was the moment of separation between lady helen and her husband but the former bore it better than the latter for as her mind was impressed with the idea that she had deserved her afflictions she believed that by patient submission to the divine will she could alone show her sense of the error which she had committed yet independently of the violence thus done to the enjoyment of affections it was impossible for a feeling heart and a reflective mind to contemplate that awful moment without agony that moment when brother was about to arm against brother when men speaking the same language and hitherto considering themselves as subjects of the same king were marching in dread array against each other and breathing the vows of vengeance against those endeared to them perhaps by habits of social intercourse and the interchange of good offices such was the scene now exhibited at lexington in the april of for there the first blood was spilt in the american contest in that hour of deadly strife my mother's trial was not equal to lady helen's for she could linger around the fatal field she could ask questions of stragglers from the army and her daily suspense would end with every day while other anxious wives around her by sharing soothed her uneasiness but lady helen was in a sick chamber surrounded by servants and by objects of interest which only served to heighten her distress for as she gazed upon her son and her charge she knew not but that she was gazing at that moment upon fatherless orphans there is certainly no comparison in strength between the uneasiness which can vent itself in exertion and that which is obliged by circumstances to remain in inaction but not at the battle of lexington was the heart of lady helen doomed to bleed her husband escaped unwounded and once more he returned to her and to his children the interview was indeed short but it was a source of comfort to lady helen which ended but with her life his looks his words of love during that meeting were treasured up with even a miser's care for after their parting embrace after that happy interview they never met more george pendarves fell in the next decisive battle which was fought near his residence by desire of his afflicted brother the body was conveyed to his own house which was near to that of the unconscious widow the bearers mistook their orders and conveyed it home lady helen who was at that moment teaching me my letters after having set seymour his lesson broke off to listen to an unusual noise of feet in the hall then gently opening the door she leaned over the baluster to discover the cause young as i was never can i forget the shriek she uttered which told she had discovered it while wildly rushing down stairs she threw herself upon the bloody corse we echoing her cry followed her in helpless terror but fear and horror were my only feelings poor seymour on the contrary was old enough to take in the extent of the misery and i yet hear his fond and fruitless exclamations of papa dear papa and his vain but still repeated supplication that he would open his eyes and speak to him lady helen now neither screamed nor spoke nor wept but she sat in the silent desolation of her soul on the couch by the body of pendarves with eyes as fixed and even as rayless as his there was a something in this still grief which seemed to awe the by standers into stillness also no hand was lifted to remove her from the body nor the body from her the only sounds of life were the sobs of seymour for my cries had been checked by alarm and the groans of the compassionate witnesses or the grief of the servants but this state of feeling could not last long and i remember that seymour destroyed it for looking terrified by his mother's changed countenance he threw his arms passionately around her conjuring her not to look so terribly but to take him on her lap and speak to him the attendants now came up to take her away but she resisted all their efforts with the violence of frenzy till she sank exhausted into their arms and could resist no longer the month that ensued was a blank in the existence of lady helen that pressure on the brain from which she had suffered so much before returned and delirium ending in insensibility ensued when consciousness was restored her feelings of humble piety and deep contrition returned with it and kissing the rod which had chastised her she resolved for our sakes to struggle with her grief and enter again upon a life of usefulness my father meanwhile fought and my mother followed his fortunes once he was brought wounded to his tent and she was allowed to nurse him till he recovered after that she had to cross the country and endure incredible hardships but her husband lived and hardships seemed nothing to her during this time a period of two years i have heard seymour pendarves say that he dreaded his mother's receiving a letter from the army because it made her so wretched he used to call my father and mother uncle and aunt and when in seeing her affliction he asked her whether uncle pendarves was shot or aunt pendarves ill she was accustomed to reply no they are indeed sufferers but have much to be thankful for for he lives they are together and she is happy in the october of the british army commanded by general burgoyne under whom my father now served and held a major's commission were obliged to lay down their arms at saratoga yet not before my father had been severely wounded and taken prisoner this was a new trial to my mother's constancy but her courage and her perseverance seemed to increase with the necessity for them and had she wanted any other incitement to fortitude than her conjugal affection and her sense of duty she would have found it in the splendid example of lady harriet ackland whose difficulties and dangers in the performance of a wife's extremest duty will ever form a brilliant page in the annals of english history some of the dangers and many of the difficulties of lady harriet had been endured by my mother but had ended in her being allowed to share the prison of my father when on the surrender of general burgoyne's army the officers were allowed to return on their parole to england my father therefore was glad to hasten to that spot from choice to which he might be ultimately driven by necessity and my mother who never liked america was rejoiced to return to the dear land of her birth lady helen meanwhile had undergone another sorrow but one which during its progress had given a new interest to life her brother colonel seymour had been desperately wounded at the beginning of the year and had been conveyed in a litter to the house of his widowed sister had the wounds of lady helen's heart ever been entirely closed this circumstance would have opened them afresh so she was heard to say would i have nursed and watched over my husband and tried to restore him to life but to go at once no warning no preparation but god's will be done and then she used to resume her quiet seat by the bedside of her brother whom however neither skill nor tenderness could restore he died in her arms blessing her with his last breath colonel seymour was only a younger brother but having married an heiress who died soon after leaving no child and bequeathing him in fee her large fortune he was a rich man this fortune as soon as he was able to hold his pen he bequeathed equally between his sister lady helen and her son desiring also that his remains might be sent to england to be interred in the family vault of his wife i was five years old when my father and mother returned to us to prepare for their departure to england and to prevail on lady helen to accompany them and i have a perfect recollection of my feelings at that moment or rather i should say of my first seeing them for seymour and i were both in bed when they arrived i have heard since that my father's resemblance to his brother awoke in lady helen remembrance even to agony and that he was not much less affected i also heard that my mother soon hastened to gaze upon her sleeping child and to enjoy the luxury of being a parent after having been so long engrossed by the duty of a wife for though she had been confined once during her perils her confinement had not added to her family the next morning i remember to have felt a joy i could not tell why at hearing that my father and mother were come and that i was both pleased and pained when seymour ran into the nursery screaming out oh ellen my uncle and aunt are come and i have seen them but they are very ill looking poor souls and my uncle is so lame ill looking and my papa lame thought i it was with difficulty the nurse could prevail on me to obey the summons and i behaved so ill when i got to their bedside that they were glad to send me away it was impossible that i could know either of them they were really so pale and haggard through fatigue and suffering and i shrunk frightened and averse from their embraces true the name of mother was associated in my mind with all that i best loved for by that name i called lady helen but why did i so because she had been to me the tenderest of guardians and had fulfilled the duty which my real parent had been forced to resign on returning to the nursery i found lady helen to whom i clung in an agony of tears satisfied that she was my own dear mamma but when my father and mother were seated at the breakfast table and gave me some of the nice things set before them i became less averse to their caresses and before the day was over i consented to have one papa and two mammas while seymour assured me he thought my papa though ill very handsome and like his own poor papa at first lady helen shrunk from the idea of returning to england but she at length consented from consideration of the superior advantages which her two young charges would receive from an english education and as it was evidently in conformity to her brother's intention accordingly in the beginning of the year we arrived at liverpool bringing with us the bodies of colonel seymour and george pendarves well was it for lady helen that we reached the inn at liverpool at night and that she had some hours of refreshing slumber to prepare her for the surprise which awaited her the next day while she and my parents were at breakfast the following morning and seymour and i were amusing ourselves with looking out at the window we saw a very elegant carriage drive up to the door our exclamations called lady helen to us what are those pretty things painted on the sides mamma asked seymour an earl's coronet and supporters to the arms my dear repeated lady helen in a faint voice and suddenly retreating as she saw there were gentlemen in the carriage who looked up on hearing the children's voices it was her father's nor had time suffering and sickness so altered her beautiful features as to render them irrecognizable by a father's heart catching the arm of lord mountgeorge his son who was with him lord seymour exclaimed o frederic surely i have beheld your sister and with trembling limbs he alighted and reached the rooms bespoken for him he was on his way from london to the seat of a gentleman near liverpool from whose house he was to proceed to his own place in the north he now sent for the landlord and begged to know if there were not some american strangers in the house and on receiving from him a confirmation of his suspicions he desired one of the waiters to tell major pendarves that a gentleman begged to see him on entering the room major pendarves took in silence the hand which the agitated earl in silence tendered to him the past and the present rushed over the minds of both while lord mountgeorge whose emotion was less violent begged the major to prepare his sister to receive them in the meanwhile lord seymour with his heart full of his lost son surveyed with respectful pity the faded cheek and altered form of the once blooming charles pendarves you did not look thus when we last met said he but you have suffered in a noble cause and you have only lost your health here the lip of the bereaved parent quivered with agitation and lord mountgeorge turned mournfully away my father then rejoined his party with evident agitation what new sorrow awaits me cried lady helen for i see it is for me you are affected not for yourself no my friend these tears are tears of emotion but of pleasure also pleasure yes lord seymour and your brother are in the next room and eagerly long to see you the feelings which now strove for victory in lady helen's breast were too much for her weakened frame to support and shuddering and panting she caught hold of my mother to save herself from falling while the scream of the terrified seymour as he beheld her nearly fainting on the sofa was heard by the anxious expectants who hastily entered the room lady helen who had not lost her senses instantly sunk on one knee before her agitated parent and pushing her son toward him desired him to plead for his unhappy mother helen cried lord seymour in a voice broken by sobs you need no advocate but my own heart and lady helen was once more clasped to his bosom and is this fine creature my grandson said he gazing with delight on seymour while he kissed his open forehead then seating himself by his daughter on the sofa while lord mountgeorge sat by her on the other side he drew the wondering boy to his knee my father now presented my mother and myself to lord seymour i am disappointed said he civilly i hoped mrs pendarves that this lovely girl was my grandchild also this was enough to conciliate my young heart and i wondered to myself i remember why my lady mamma should have seemed so sorry at seeing such a good natured old gentleman nor could i conceive why lord seymour as he kept looking on lady helen should shed so many tears my poor helen cried he your face tells a tale of sad suffering and augustus too both gone but they fought bravely ay but they died cried lady helen clasping her hands convulsively and they shall both have a magnificent monument erected to their memory my child cried lord seymour lady helen looked gratefully up in her father's face as he said this lord seymour now wrote to his friend to say that he and his son were prevented paying him the promised visit and the next day we all set forward for the seat of lord seymour i forbear to describe poor lady helen's feelings when we reached seymour park and what she endured when she visited at her own family vault the remains of her beloved mother after she had seen her husband and brother interred in that of the latter but she had the consolation of knowing that lord seymour's resentment had made him unjust as a mortal malady had long been preying on her existence having only visited seymour park in order to witness the funeral solemnities my father and mother soon took their leave and to my great agony insisted that i should accompany them on their projected visit to pendarves castle and also to my grandfather and grandmother and i well recollect the violent sorrow which i experienced when i was torn from seymour and lady helen i was told however that i should certainly come back to them and not soon leave them again and that pacified me indeed it was my father's intention to settle near lady helen pendarves who meant to fit up a cottage in her park for their residence when my father and his cousin first came over to england they had found some property due to them in right of their father's will this property was vested in the english funds and there it had remained untouched both principal and interest for eight years during this period it had accumulated so much as to be sufficient for us to live upon should the event of the war be such as to cause the confiscation of our american estates and my mother had also to receive the legacy bequeathed by her grandmother their present enjoyment therefore was not clouded over to my parents by the fear of pecuniary distress and after their first arrival at pendarves castle that scene so fraught with grief in its results to friends most dear to them they looked forward with joyful anticipations to the future they were speedily joined there by my mother's uncle and her parents thither too lady helen had at last resolution to venture also and i was again united to my brother seymour as i always called him on leaving her carriage lady helen desired to be shown to my mother's apartment in order to recover herself before she saw the rest of the family for she dreaded to encounter the thoughtless mrs pendarves who would say things that wounded the feelings in the most susceptible part on the third day while she was administering a nervous medicine to her widowed guest she could not help exclaiming poor dear what will all the physic in the world do for you cousin helen as the man says in the play 'what can minister to a mind diseased' and 'give physic to the dogs' here my mother with a pathetic look motioned her to be silent but in vain nay my dear julia said she i must speak my dear cousin helen will not know else how i have cried and lain awake all night with thinking of her miseries she does not doubt your kind sympathy dear aunt she does not indeed but she cannot be sure of it mrs charles unless i tell her of it and tell her 'i cannot but remember such folks were and were most dear to all' oh he had 'an eye like mars' and that is quite appropriate you know as he died in battle i mean your poor husband poor george pendarves not your brother i never saw him my mother looked aghast since the death of george pendarves no one had ever ventured to name him to lady helen but fools rush in where angels dare not tread and lady helen hid her face in agonizing surprise on my mother's shoulder ah one may see by your eyes that you have shed many tears why they tell me you never knew what had happened till you saw the poor dear love lying dead and bleeding there was a shock oh how i pity you dearest soul i have often thought it was a mercy that you did not fall over the balusters and break your neck it broke my heart screamed out lady helen in the voice of frenzy unable to support any longer the horrible picture thus coarsely brought before her and in another moment the house resounded with her hysterical cries while mrs pendarves added she could not but think lady helen was very bad still as she could not bear to be pitied though pity was said to be very soothing and though she like pity on one side her grief subduing voice applied as my mother expected lady helen now conceived a terror of mrs pendarves which nothing could conquer and her health became so visibly worse that she quitted the place the following week accompanied by my father and mother and my mother's uncle to london leaving seymour and myself behind to be spoiled by our too indulgent relatives in a short time my father and mother had settled their pecuniary concerns and purchased furniture for their new habitation of which they now hastened to take possession and there we soon joined them i have detailed thus minutely the sentiments and sorrows of those with whom my earliest years were passed as i believe that by them my character was in a great measure determined and that i owe the merit which you attribute to me and the crimes of which i am conscious to having been the pupil of lady helen and the daughter of julia pendarves the next three years passed quietly away but my parents observed with pain that lady helen's visits to seymour park became more and more frequent though lord seymour had married a young wife before his daughter's return who was jealous to excess of lady helen's influence over her lord and that she had evidently lost much of her enjoyment of their society the truth was that though lady helen did not envy the happiness of my parents it was not always that she could bear to witness it because it recalled painfully to her mind the period of her life when she was equally happy and she had no longer that sympathy with my mother which is the foundation and the cement of friendly intercourse so true is it that equality of prosperity like equality of situation is necessary to give stability to friendship my mother though she felt this was too delicate openly to repine my intercourse with her and the benefit which i derived from her instructions remained the same for i was always allowed to accompany lady helen to seymour park but alas the tide of sympathy towards my poor mother which had been checked in lady helen's bosom by happiness now flowed again with increased fulness when she was summoned to console her under a sorrow kindred with her own my father had been saved from the dangers of war to perish at home by a violent death he was thrown from his horse struck his head against a stone and died upon the spot lady helen having removed her to her own house devoted her whole attention to the offices of a comforter in proportion as my poor mother's sense of happiness had been keen her sense of privation was overwhelming but so curiously so mercifully are we fashioned that we are sometimes able to derive medicine for our suffering from its very excess my mother was as you well know a woman of high aspirings and loved to be pre eminent in all things she was proud of her conjugal love she was proud of the dangers which she had dared under its influence and of the sufferings to which she rose superior to prove the tender excess of that love she was proud also of her good fortune in having her husband's life so long preserved to her and she gloried in his devoted and faithful affection but now of this idolized husband she was bereaved in a moment and without any alleviating circumstances soothing though painful are the tears which we shed for those who fall in battle and sweet like music in the dead of night heard after distressing dreams or while we are kept waking by mournful realities falls the sound of a nation's regret on the ear of those who weep over a departed hero but my father died ingloriously and yet my mother felt pride derived from that very source for it made her in her own estimation pre eminent in trial for how hard was it after having shared her husband's dangers and the struggles of war to see him perish at home the victim of an ignoble accident had he died in the field of glory i might have found she cried some solace in his renown and i was prepared to see him fall when others fell around him but to perish thus oh never was woman's trial so severe and thus while descanting on the pre eminence of her misfortunes she got rid of much of their severity you remember with what eloquence my mother used to describe what she had endured in america you have also i believe heard her speak of the manner of my poor father's death but you never heard what i have often listened to with the pity which i could not utter lady helen's assertion of her own trying sorrow when my mother had harrowed up her feelings by the painful comparison you may remember that you were happy many years but i here tears choked her voice remember that while you were allowed to prove your love by soothing the sufferings of the being whom you adored and had his smile to reward you i was forced to prove mine only in the privacy of solitary and almost maddening recollections till recently you have never known a real affliction and i oh when have i for years experienced an enjoyment this language used to silence if it did not convince my mother but however they might dispute on the superiority of their trials they loved each other the better for them and were now scarcely ever separated hence seymour and i were in a measure educated together till it was judged fit that he should go to a public school this painful trial was imposed on lady helen by her relations and approved by her own judgment against the suggestions of her feelings when i was eleven and seymour near fifteen years old and when our mothers as i was not long in discovering had projected a union between us and had promised each other to do all they could to ensure it thus ends my introduction here begins my dear friend the history of seymour and helen pendarves forgive me if i introduce my narrative with a very vulgar but a most excellent proverb which is that little pitchers have wide ears or that children hear many things which they ought not to hear and which they were certainly not intended to hear now to illustrate the truth of this proverb and this explanation of it it certainly could not be the intention of two such sensible women that i should know i was designed for the wife of seymour pendarves and yet they talked of their plans so openly before me that i was perfectly mistress of their designs and that precocity of mind which they had often remarked in me was increased so much by this consciousness that while they fancied i was thinking on my doll or my baby house i was in reality meditating on my destined husband till my heart was prepared to receive the passion of love at an age when it would have been better for me to have been ignorant of its existence and this passion i was authorized to feel and for a most engaging object i leave you to judge how pleasant i found this permission how much young as i was the idea of seymour pendarves now mixed itself with every thing i thought and did and said small was the chance therefore that even my highly honoured mother could ever succeed in changing the bent of those inclinations which she had herself given in the pliant hours of childhood and earliest youth it was some time before lady helen recovered her spirits after the departure of her son i also gave myself the air of being very dejected but as with me it was the season of the tear forgot as soon as shed and of the preponderating influence of animal spirits i bounded over the lawn as usual after the first three days were gone by and at length won lady helen from her reveries and her gloom but i had the satisfaction of hearing the mothers say to each other what sensibility she really seemed to regret his absence with a sentimental dejection unusual at those years this idea so flattering to my self love i took care to keep alive by frequently inquiring how long it was to the christmas vacation and when that long expected time arrived and i found it settled that lady helen should meet her son at lord seymour's in london and spend the holidays with him there i gave way to the most violent lamentations declaring that she should not go without me nor in this instance did i at all exaggerate my feelings of disappointment for seymour's absence made a sad void in my amusements and i had looked forward to his return with the sincerest satisfaction but my entreaties and my expostulations were equally vain seymour however wrote to me twice at least from london these letters i treasured up with the fondest care and read them once every day though i could not but think there was not quite love enough in them and that i was too big to be called little helen and to be told by my correspondent that he blew me a kiss i remember also that when i showed my mother my answers which were those of a little old woman and not of an artless girl she used to say i wonder where the child got those ideas when the holidays were over lady helen returned and brought me a beautiful writing box as a present from her son with a guitar as a present from herself we immediately began our practice upon this instrument and i made a rapid progress from the hope of being able to charm seymour when we next met but again lady helen went to meet her son in london and it was not till two years after his first departure that he revisited the north never shall i forget the flutter which i felt at the idea of his return but i am very sure that i was more taken up in spite of my sentimentality with thinking what effect i was likely to have on him at our meeting than with the idea of the pleasure which i should have in seeing him two years had made a great improvement in my person but i was not tall for my age and i was so thin that i looked much younger than i really was my glass however and the injudicious praises of flattering visiters had told me i was handsome and i really believe i expected to take seymour's heart of the actual possession of which i had some doubts by a coup de main for i had both heard and read of love at first sight never before had i been so difficult to please in the shape of my frocks which i in vain tried to persuade my wiser mother to alter into gowns as vainly did i try to persuade her to let me have my hair dressed and wear ear rings she coolly told me simplicity was the beauty of a child's dress and i swallowing as i could that mortifying appellation was obliged to let my auburn ringlets fall in natural glossy curls into my neck unfrizzed and untormented but unable to keep my vexation to myself to the great amusement of my mother i said rather petulantly as i was leaving the room one day well i must do as you please mamma but i am sure mr seymour pendarves who is used to london young ladies will think me a great fright mr who my dear whose opinion is of so much consequence to you seymour pendarves replied i blushing and leaving out the mr oh master pendarves really my dear i can't think it matters much what such a mere boy as that thinks and it is enough for you that you are a good child and obey your mamma at length seymour arrived and the delighted lady helen brought her idol to our house while i gazed with wonder as well as pleasure and embarrassment on the change which two years had made in my youthful companion he though only seventeen had assumed the dress of manhood his throat was tied up with a large cravat his hair was powdered and worn in a club behind according to the then fashion his hat was set on one side and he was dressed in a grass green coat nothing so smart had ever met my sight before and what with his fine teeth his dimpled cheek and his sparkling eyes i thought i had never even read of any one so beautiful and this lovely youth was intended to be my husband but had he himself any such intentions that i could not say and i was both mortified and displeased at the way in which he first addressed me even though i drew up my long neck as high as possible to look as tall and womanly as i could he flew up to me calling me dear little helen how are you i am so glad to see you again and then in spite of my dignity he clasped me round the neck gave me a kiss which might have been heard in the next room and left the mark of his metal sleeve buttons on my throat my mother saw my confusion and as she did not approve such familiar and boisterous ways coolly said my daughter is not used to such rough salutations my dear seymour and i did not expect such a remnant of the great romping boy from you alas all remnant of youthful unrestraint and of the boy now vanished natural feeling which the sight of his early companion and playfellow had called forth disappeared and the manners of the young men of the world then and for ever replaced them but what provoked me was though he seemed to consider himself as a man he never even for a moment treated me as a woman i was his little helen and his chicken and his tiny pet and then dreadful degradation he used to chuck me under the chin nay once he asked me pulling up his neck cloth and looking in the glass whether the neighbourhood was improved and whether there were any fine women in it who visited our mothers i had a mind to answer what does it signify to you whether there are or not but as i dared not so reply it was a relief to me when my mother came in and put a stop to his inquiries but never indeed have i since felt more jealousy than i experienced during seymour's residence at home in various ways soon after his return i went with one of my cousins from pendarves castle then on a visit to us to a public walk in a neighbouring town which was then much frequented and seymour accompanied us i conscious that my straw hat and purple ribands became me and that my young friend who was remarkably plain served only as a foil to my charms now then thought i his hour is come while glorying in this imagined security i was hurled down into the depths of despair for we scarcely reached the mall when we met some fine showy looking women whom i thought old as they seemed past five and twenty seymour to my great consternation inquired who these lovely creatures were declaring they were the handsomest women he had seen since he had left london my cousin can introduce you said harriet pendarves i not i indeed why not dear helen cried seymour because because i have only lately known them oh that is quite enough he hastily returned but i still refused however the ladies returned accompanied by a young man of seymour's acquaintance and in a few minutes we beheld him laughing and talking with the party my feelings at that moment still live in my memory as vividly as ever i was thunder struck what seymour pendarves the friend of my childhood to leave me for women whom he never saw before and call them handsomer than any thing he had seen since he left london it was in vain that two youths of my acquaintance one of them a young lord joined my deserted side i was silent absent and unhappy for seymour remained with his new acquaintance it never occurred to me to talk and laugh with my beaux for i was a stranger to coquetry and the natural feelings of my heart were allowed to display themselves still an untaught delicacy made me try to hide the cause of my oddness from my companions and a headache which was not feigned was my excuse the ladies however at length left the walk and seymour was forced to return to us he immediately launched forth into rapturous praises of their charms and elegant manners while i listened in angry silence as i had expected him to apologize for leaving me and nothing i perceived was further from his thoughts but what is the matter cried he are you not well helen that you do not speak not quite helen has a headache said my cousin poor child cried seymour kindly then let us go home directly it grows late and i believe you do not sit up to supper yet helen except on great occasions here was an affront i angrily replied indeed mr seymour pendarves you seem to know very little about me and to care very little about me now mr and a tossed up chin and a flushed face why really helen i find i did not know much about you i took you for a sweet tempered girl but i have often thought you captious and pettish of late and i never could imagine why but let me tell you miss helen pendarves that if you lose your good temper you will lose your greatest charm any woman's greatest charm this reproach i could not bear from him for i knew if i was become pettish and captious affection for him was the cause and i burst into tears but struggling with my feelings i sobbed out and i suppose sir you think i have no other charm than my good temper i helen no such thing i think quite the contrary and i do assure you the ladies i have just left they o yes cried i they i suppose have every charm possible they have great charms certainly both of face and person still they are only fine women but you helen are quite a little beauty only you are as yet but a child you know away went my ill humours and even my jealousy for i was sure though the boy of seventeen thought it more manly to talk to women grown i knew as he advanced in life and i too he would be of a different opinion and i also knew a few years would fade the ladies whom he so much admired while the same number of years would leave me still young and still a beauty yes he thought me a beauty and he had told me so and i repeated his words to myself so often that in a reverie i once spoke them aloud and my mother asked child what are you saying about helen and beauty helen was a great beauty mamma was she not said i blushing at my own duplicity but the subterfuge weighed heavily on my mind nor could i rest till i told the whole truth to my mother who in consideration of my ingenuousness merely observed to me that when from the exaggeration to which even boys were much given seymour called me a beauty he only meant i was a pretty girl but i thought differently seymour now remained at home full six months with a private tutor as he was too old to go back to school and lady helen thought him too young for oxford during that time my mother from as i suspected some private information began to form an unfavourable opinion of his steadiness of conduct and the anxieties of a mother for his future well being clouded the still beautiful countenance of lady helen once as i was apparently engaged in reading i overheard lady helen say to my mother do you not discern any symptoms yet of a growing attachment on his side he may be on his guard before me none whatever he seems to consider her still only as a beautiful child and she is certainly not at all more womanly in her appearance this last year i am sorry for it was the answer for there is no guard so good for the morals of a young man as a virtuous attachment yes said my mother and i had hoped that by being so much with helen he would have loved her as it were by anticipation i never could find out whether they meant me to hear this conversation or not but the assurance which it conveyed that seymour did not love me yet was not lost upon me and it was possible that all this was said for that purpose the consequence was that i put the strictest guard over my words and manners lest seymour should discover the attachment which i had with much confidence indulged and the attachment itself i resolved to resist with all the energy possible for surely thought i if i am too young to inspire love i ought to be too young to feel it and i am too proud to love where i am not beloved and i kept the former part of my resolution for my attachment remained unsuspected nor did its strength hold out entirely uninjured against the conviction of the utter indifference of its object however an affectionate grasp of my hand and a respectful salute of my cheek replaced the boisterous familiarity of his greeting when we first met surely said i to myself his feelings towards me have undergone a change and while hope was thus restored to my bosom i felt that my former feelings would on the slightest encouragement return with undiminished force i have since learnt though not till long after the period in question that lady helen had thought proper to have a conversation with her son on the subject nearest her heart namely a marriage between him and me in the course of a few years he listened to her i found with great surprise but great complacency only exclaiming but she is such a child at present dear mother but she will not always be a child replied lady helen and though i believe she is quite indifferent to you now i am much mistaken if that 'child' as you call her did not at your first arrival feel something resembling love and jealousy too is it possible exclaimed seymour and i not to be conscious of it dear little helen and then he recollected the scene in the walk and my petulance silence and tears for which he now accounted in a manner flattering to his vanity and it was so new so piquant to be loved by a child that he was charmed with the idea of his conquest but then lady helen had told him he had lost this affection and as none can bear to renounce the power which they have once possessed he was resolved to pay me those attentions by the want of which i had been alienated he was too conscious however to be able to act upon his resolves and he had learnt to consider me in so new a light that he felt embarrassed when he should have been assiduous and though i saw a change in his manner during the last four days it was far from being a favourable one it was only on the last of the four days that he seemed to have shaken off the trammels which hung about him that day as i was drawing at the window and he was reading aloud by his mother i saw him lay down his book and whisper in her ear helen said she what do you think seymour says he says that he has now found that you are no longer a child indeed replied i blushing but in a tone of pique and since when that is a discovery which i have long made and since when have you yourself made it dear helen said he with that saucy smile of his which you have often said was irresistible these four years at least i answered trying to avoid his eyes do not fib helen was his impertinent reply you make helen blush my dear son so much the better she never looks so beautiful as when she blushes and i dare say some little time hence we shall have some english priam exclaiming of this modern helen 'no wonder britons that such heavenly charms for ten long years have set the world in arms' while i shall sit and sing 'ah chloris could i now but sit as unconcern'd as when thy infant beauty could beget nor happiness nor pain' i was now so pleased so confounded yet so happy that i knew not where to look or how to behave but remembering that the best part of valour is discretion i fled from the danger i could not face and had just presence of mind enough to run away what is the matter with helen cried seymour when i was gone is she angry no replied lady helen more skilled in the nature of woman's feelings she is only conscious of being too well pleased that's all and from that time had not seymour left us the next day the chances are that we should soon have become lovers i meanwhile had gone into my own chamber where i found my mother i threw myself into her arms without saying a word and hid my blushes and my tears in her bosom my mother untold knew those tears were not tears of sorrow and soon drew from me a part of the truth for i told her seymour had been so full of his compliments that i came away during the course of that day seymour was continually exclaiming how provoking it is that i should be forced to go away just now ah cried i pertly enough and insincerely too what will poor miss salter do this was the name of one of the ladies with whom he had fancied himself charmed miss salter 'i think not of miss salter my fancy has no image now but ' here my mother rather pettishly interrupted him i think for miss salter's sake young man it is well you are going as you certainly took great pains to make her think you admired her and i must say i am no friend to coquetry be it in man or woman nor i said lady helen and i trust the next time my son makes love he will do it with his whole heart and not mistake the illusions of fancy for the dictates of attachment i trust so too my dear mother he replied and that the object will be one whom you approve the next morning he set off and every thing at first seemed a blank to me he wrote frequently during the first weeks of his residence at oxford but my mother discouraged my answering his letters and he soon grew remiss in his correspondence even with lady helen who found that his allowance though handsome was insufficient for his wants and suspected that the life must be dissipated which required such an exorbitant expenditure my mother knew that it was so why she imparted what she heard to her friend i cannot tell because it made lady helen unhappy and she wrote to her son in the language of expostulation i was vexed to find that my mother gave such implicit credence to the stories of seymour's errors as the accounts might be exaggerated and when i had once admitted that he was the victim of misrepresentation pity for seymour added force to my attachment it seemed a very long time to me till the next vacation came but seymour passed it in london at his grandfather's my mother was glad but i was disappointed nor did he come down into the country till half of the long vacation was expired and after he had spent a week with lady helen my mother took me to pay a visit to a relation of her's in vain lady helen remonstrated and seymour entreated she replied she had put off her journey in the expectation of seeing him in june and she could no longer delay her visit he sighed looked conscious and confused and forbore to urge her again my mother was certainly right in thus resolving for she knew though i did not that lady helen had communicated to him her views and wishes with regard to me and she left home with a firmness and decision of manner which promised ill for the success of her hopes when we came back seymour was returned to oxford the following christmas lady helen whose health seemed evidently declining went to london for the advice of physicians and seymour attended her home but he only stayed a week as he was under an engagement he said to accompany some friends abroad he departed however with evident dejection and reluctance and seemed while with us to enjoy the quiet of our domestic scenes but as his actions were not regulated by a steady principle of right and under the restraint of moral and religious obligation no sooner was he removed from our purifying influence than he became again the follower of pleasure while as he was driven backward and forward upon the ocean of the world my image which his poor mother thought would save him from temptation appeared to him only as a beacon at a distance to remind him of that shore of safety which the waves forbad him however much he wished it to approach during the next term and in spite of his dissipation seymour obtained a prize for writing the best prose essay and he sent it to his mother just after some very unfavourable accounts of the society which he frequented in london had reached her and had been only too strongly confirmed by my mother's secret informant these reports had not been communicated to me but i happened to be present when lady helen received two copies of the essay accompanied by a letter in which he begged that his dearest friend helen would not only accept but do him the favour to criticise the little production which he had sent as he knew no one whose praise he should so highly value or to whose censures he should pay greater attention methinks i still see the delight yet gleaming mournfully through tears which beamed from lady helen's countenance when she received the essay and read the letter alas that renewed and increased brightness was but too like the flame of an expiring taper my dear julia cried she to my mother in a voice almost inarticulate with emotion what a foolish thing is a fond mother's heart now it is all fear and now all hope now it is broken and now healed again this boy this dear naughty good boy it was but yesterday i cried for his weakness and now i cry for his strength no one i believe ever doubted your son's talents said my mother coldly and i thought crossly true replied lady helen meekly and this prize i own is not proof of amended conduct i know not cried i eagerly what fault poor seymour has committed but of this i am sure that if he was so very idle as ill natured people say he is he could not have found time to write for a prize and still less have been able to gain it thank you my dearest girl for being my poor boy's advocate for what you say is very just and seymour shall know how kindly you took his part i must beg he may not know said my mother angrily indeed answered lady helen mournfully but i cannot now blame your change of feeling on this subject for i myself should hesitate to give my daughter to a youth such as seymour is said to be i now turned round and looked at lady helen with so alarmed and inquiring a countenance that she could not withstand the appeal she took my hand and said yes helen your mother and i had pledged our words to each other to do all in our power to promote a union between my son and you and to cherish every symptom in you of a mutual attachment but now owing to some too well founded reports i fear of his faulty conduct she wishes to retract her promise and here as one of my last acts and deeds for i feel that i shall not be with you long i solemnly give her back that promise in your presence declaring to you my beloved child that unless your mother thinks seymour deserving of you i cannot wish you to be his wife and that it will be my parting injunction to you helen never never to marry an immoral man lady helen had scarcely said this while i listened with downcast eyes when my mother threw herself into her arms sobbing out convulsively my own dear generous friend for your sake i will try to think well of your son and to believe he will reform only don't talk of dying i can't bear that but i wish to prepare you for it prepare helen prepare do you think anything can make me endure the idea of losing you oh it will be losing all i ever loved a second time lady helen shook her head but did not speak for she knew that her friend must soon undergo this dreaded trial and she too felt that for some blows there is no such thing as preparation the night that followed was the first of real agonizing sorrow which i had ever known i had heard that seymour was believed even by his own mother to be unworthy of me and that mine was decidedly averse to that union which she had originally made the first desire of my heart i had also heard from lady helen's own lips a solemn assurance that she was dying at my time of life however the spirits are never long depressed especially by an uncertain and remote sorrow but as a captive butterfly when the pressure on its wings is removed flutters them again in air with all their glittering dyes and buoyancy uninjured so do the spirits of youth quickly resume their brilliancy and their elasticity when i rose the next morning i was sure that lady helen would recover i was sure that seymour would reform even if the reports concerning him were not exaggerated and i was also sure that some time or other i should be his wife but alas lady helen had not spoken from momentary dejection and still less from the ungenerous wish to excite interest and alarm in the hearts that tenderly loved her she spoke from her deep conviction a conviction only too well founded in less than two months she was attacked by fever and inflammation of the brain such as had before seized her on the death of her husband she had however lucid intervals and though my mother and myself felt our hearts wrung by her delirious ravings during which she called upon her son's name in the most affecting language still we suffered more when on recovering her senses she asked for this darling son and we were obliged to reply that he was not yet arrived and where oh where was he at a moment like that we knew not as soon as lady helen's attack was judged to be a dangerous one my mother wrote to him at oxford desiring him to set off immediately or he might come too late and as oxford was only a ten hours' journey from home he might have been with us the next morning had he been at college it was also term time but yet he came not though on such an occasion leave of absence was easily to be obtained my mother was too angry to be as wretched as i was at this distressing circumstance for indignation often swallows up every other feeling and once she hinted to me that he must have received the letter and that mere idle neglect kept him away but the poor invalid who unsuspected by us overheard our conversation exclaimed no julia whatever are his other faults my poor boy loves me tenderly loves me and even from a sick bed he would hasten to his dying mother oh no he has never received your letter he is not in college then where is he in college he ought to be true julia but he is young and thoughtless and we ought to remember that we were so once ourselves we ought not to have run away from our parents yet we did so julia we did indeed cried my mother abashed and silenced yes continued lady helen and therefore i have always endeavoured to be mild in my judgment of other people especially of the young helen cried my mother forgive me thou blessed spirit i will be merciful to him even though it makes me unjust to no your first duty is to your daughter but listen to me julia be sure to convince seymour when i am no more that i did not impute his absence to want of love but merely to accident be sure you do for he will feel only too much when he comes and finds that he has no longer a mother the afflicting image thus presented to my mind of what would be seymour's misery if he indeed arrived too late was more than i could bear and i was forced to leave the room soon afterwards lady helen's senses wandered again but when i returned she was sensible though exhausted and as i entered she hastily put back the curtain and said oh i hoped it was my dear dear boy her breath now grew fainter and she exclaimed oh where where is he must i die without seeing him once more and giving him my blessing helen julia be sure to speak very kindly to him and tell him that i blessed him but thy will o lord be done still as long as consciousness remained her eyes were anxiously turned towards the door as if looking for that beloved object whom she was never more to see we thought in this world at that moment however my watchful ear heard a quick step on the stairs and an exclamation of agony not mistaken by me he is here i am sure he is here cried i bending over her pillow and in another moment seymour was on his knees at the bedside never shall i forget his look of speechless woe when he found her last agony approaching but it seemed as if affection struggled successfully with death for a few short moments she could not speak but her eyes were eloquent and as she laid her hand upon the head of her child those eyes were raised to heaven in earnest supplication they then turned on him while she reclined her head on my mother's bosom and her right hand was clasped in mine i cannot go on the scene is still too present to my view deep as was my affliction it sunk into nothingness compared with that of the bereaved and self reproving son it was really a relief to me to see his sense of anguish suspended by his insensibility when he recovered there was something so full of woe and yet of a woe so stern in the look with which my mother ordered me away that i had not the heart to resist it it was near an hour before she came to me and never before had i seen her so overpowered with affliction she called upon lady helen by the tenderest names talked of her patient gentleness of the sweetness of that temper which she had so often tried and reproached herself for having thus tried it but she spoke not of seymour and deep as my regret was for the dead it was equalled by my anxiety for the living i therefore ventured to say but how is poor seymour unfeeling girl cried my mother you can think only of him when his angel mother lies dead she would have thanked me for my anxiety i replied rendered courageous by distress i shall go and inquire after him hold helen he is extremely wretched so much so that i could not bear to listen to his self upbraidings nor to witness his caresses of that hand which replied no longer to his grasp and then his wild entreaties that she would speak to him once more and say that she forgave him and could you have the cruelty to leave him alone in such a state cried i do you think his mother would so have left your child my mother started you are right said she i will return and do my duty by him oh let me go with you no helen i must do my duty by you too and the poor youth at this moment is only too dangerous she was right and i submitted but i had gained my point and she was gone back to the poor afflicted one before she went however she insisted on my going to bed where wearied with three nights of watching i fell into a heavy slumber but oh that wretchedness on waking which attends the recollection of a recent affliction and i was giving way to all the misery i felt when soon after eight in the morning my mother came into my room she told me she had not been in bed all night for that she dared not leave seymour how kind it was in you my dearest mother no it was only right she answered in great agitation he was a bitter and penitent sufferer and if my departed friend is conscious of what is passing here i trust that she was satisfied with me for i tried to do a mother's part by him and now my dear child we must both return home this you know is no place for you helen and must i go without taking leave of poor seymour what leave is there to take i had nothing to reply and we came away as my mother knew that seymour's sleep was likely to be long she did not return to the house of death for some hours but when she did i earnestly conjured her to let me accompany her i pleaded however and wept in vain in vain did i urge that seymour would think me unkind in forsaking him wholly at such a time as this was my mother said she feared that seymour would only be too ready to attribute his not seeing me to her commands rather than my own inclinations and disappointed and wretched i threw myself on the bed in an agony of grief and never rose from it feeding my distress by every means in my power i must own however that temper and contrivance had some share in this self abandonment or sensibility which i thought would at once punish my mother for her obstinacy as i called it and induce her to give up her resolution how often is grief like love made up of materials which we dream not of and how often has temper much to do with it but my seeming unmixed sorrow had no effect on my excellent parent whose decisions where i was concerned were the result of firm principle her first observation was this excessive misery helen accompanied as i see it is with a degree of sullenness is not likely to make me change my purpose but rather to confirm me in it the more because it proves to me the great extent of the danger to which my compliance would expose you when you can thus in spirit at least be rebellious and this at a time too when i want every comfort possible these words subdued every particle of resentment in me i threw myself on her neck and assured her she should never have so to reproach me again nor did i even venture to inquire for seymour but she was generous enough to speak of him unasked she told me he woke after a long sleep more composed than she expected though on his first waking he started me excessively she said by asking for his mother and wondering to see me instead of her my tears seemed to force back his recollection and in a faint voice and with a look of wretchedness he added 'ah i remember now' and hiding his face in the pillow he wept aloud and i i was but a sad consoler for i wept in silence by him when he was calm again i wished him to rise and before i left him in the fulness and tenderness of my heart poor child i stooped down and kissed his burning forehead but i soon repented for he exclaimed 'oh that was so like her but she never no never more ' and again he lay almost convulsed with his feelings when this fresh paroxysm was over i left him but i am sure said i that he will be soothed by that kind kiss in remembrance though it affected him painfully at the time perhaps so but his grief violent though it be will soon go off and be after a time forgotten lady helen was his mother and he loved her but she had not been the chosen playfellow of his childhood the friend of his youth the companion of his riper years the sharer of every joy the soother of every sorrow and the being endeared to him by daily and confidential intercourse and yet all these was she to me helen but dearest mother the love and regrets of a child are very strong i own it helen especially when as in the case of this miserable boy self reproach mingles with them and deepens every pang helen my child my only treasure now she added speaking with difficulty never never when i shall be as she is now may you have cause to shed such tears as his helen remember there are no upbraidings so terrible as those of one's own heart and for your own sake if not for mine be dutiful i was too much affected to reply and my mother continued yes he will recover his loss you will recover yours helen but what can ever replace to me the loss of the friend of my whole life the sole relic of the joys that are past george charles helen you are all gone now and i here she raised her arms with a sort of appealing look to heaven i stand alone unsupported and unsupporting too like the sole remaining pillar of a once noble temple to speak of former pride and present desolation as my mother's imagination had now entered into play my fears for her health in a great degree vanished for i knew that the grief which can vent itself in imagery however gloomy is not of that sort which preys rapidly on life for it is the grief that doth not speak falls on the burthen'd heart and bids it break taking advantage of a pause during the first part of which my mother seemed engaged in fervent devotion i now ventured to ask her if seymour had inquired why he did not see me she told me that he had and that he had been told in reply there were sufficient reasons for our not meeting amongst the foremost of which was the certainty that we should make each other worse and with this reason he had seemed satisfied she did not tell me however that he inquired for me every day nor did she relate to me any of their conversation except the one which took place the evening before the funeral and that she felt it to be her duty to disclose i have to inform you my dear child said she that when seymour and i stood together to take our last look and last kiss before the coffin was closed he suddenly seized my hand and wildly addressing the unconscious dead conjured that pale cheek and that closed eye to appeal to my heart in his favour and to remind me of the promised pledge to his mother to promote his union with you this was the language of passion and there was a strange effect in it i thought neither of which you know can affect me i therefore replied though not without emotion that it was a subject which i could not discuss in that room accordingly after he had taken many more last looks and leaves of the beloved dead i led him from the chamber when he was calmed a little i had resolution to resume the conversation and to own the truth helen i was glad to discuss it without the presence of that mournful object which spite of myself armed my feelings against my judgment here my mother walked about the room in considerable agitation but she soon recovered herself i then related to him our conversation with lady helen and did you tell him how i defended him cried i no certainly i did not she coldly replied but i convinced him that his mother gave me back my promise and that her last parting words to yourself should be 'helen never marry an immoral man' on hearing this he exclaimed 'did my mother say this did she think me an immoral man oh insupportable agony well madam' added he turning fiercely round 'and so i suppose you have said the same to your daughter and have engaged her to combat the regard she once felt for me for i know she loved me once or would have done so for so the lips that never deceived assured me but mark me madam i will not take a refusal from any lips but hers' 'if you wish to alienate my affection entirely from you seymour' i replied 'you will make this appeal to helen for neither by letter nor personal application will i sanction it till i am convinced your improved conduct makes you more worthy of my daughter' 'but you deny me the motive to improvement by forbidding my addresses to her' 'o seymour' answered i 'if you have no better motive such a change is not to be depended upon nor would i entrust to you under such a precarious alteration the happiness of my child' he looked distressed but rather proudly replied 'well madam we will talk further on this subject some other time i cannot pursue it now' and soon after i took my leave and will you not allow him to have one interview with me before he returns to oxford no i will not expose you to his dangerous eloquence as he is not really in love with you he would have more self possession and plead his cause so much the better not in love with me no his attachment is now irritated by obstacles and also stimulated by fancied duty but could he if he really felt a virtuous passion maintain a disgraceful connexion in london as i know him to do helen my child what ails you here her voice sounded like thunder in my ears and i fainted i had certainly been led to believe that seymour led a life of general dissipation and i had not allowed myself to attempt to define the exact nature of the charges against him but when i heard him positively accused of an improper attachment to one individual object a mixed feeling of jealousy disgust misery and indignation came over me with the sickness of death and for the first time in my life i lost all consciousness how long i remained insensible i know not but when i recovered i found my mother weeping over me not because she had feared for my life but because she did fear for my peace of mind she was consoled however when i assured her that from that moment i should think it my duty to drive seymour pendarves from my mind and that i had no longer any difficulty in submitting to her wishes she kissed me called me her dear good girl and we parted for the night the next morning was the morning of the funeral lady helen had desired it might be a private one and had she not it could not have been otherwise for lord seymour though not an old man was fallen into a state of imbecility lord mountgeorge was at lisbon attending his dying wife and mr pendarves our great uncle was confined in cornwall by the gout poor seymour cried my mother as she heard this account of the family there is much to be said in your excuse for how completely has he been left to himself amidst the dangers of a metropolis my mother when she said this was certainly thinking aloud but my hearing her had at that moment no bad effect on me as my jealousy remained unappeased and my mortification unsoothed and nothing could reinstate him as yet in my estimation nay i believed i should see him the next day without any emotion that could be attributed to him as the cause of it when we reached the house of mourning we found seymour anxiously expecting us on seeing me he seized my hand and unable to speak kissed it repeatedly then turned away in tears and i must own at that moment i forgot his unworthiness and my own resolution and remembered only his sorrow and his apparent affection my mother might be right but i began to suspect she might be wrong all these feelings however were soon swallowed up in those of deep and tender sorrow the procession began and clinging to each other's arm for support my mother and i followed the unsteady steps of the chief mourner but why need i dwell on the details of a scene so common suffice that seymour did not return with us he remained in the church in order to give way to the lately suppressed agonies of his heart my mother wished to do the same but she respected the sacredness of his sorrow and she could visit the vault at another time the rest of the day was spent by seymour in visits to those who had been maintained or assisted by lady helen in order that he might personally assure them that his intention was to do all she would have done had life been spared to her having thus performed his duty to the utmost he appeared to my mother's eye to have recovered some of his usual brilliancy of countenance the next night he was to return to oxford in the afternoon of that day he called at our house and requested to see my mother and me i rose involuntarily in great perturbation tell mr pendarves said my mother that i will wait on him directly helen my child it is but one struggle more and all the difficulty will be over for i conclude you not only in obedience to my will but in compliance with your own wise wishes refuse to see him what could i say could i tell her that the meeting of yesterday and his subsequent conduct towards his mother's dependants had altered my feelings i could not do it and i remained above stairs after a long conference my mother came back to me and i heard the hall door close till this moment i had hoped she would relent and allow me to see him at least i guess so from the cold chill which i felt at my heart when i heard the noise of the closed door however i saw him from the window i myself unseen and his handkerchief was held to his eyes when my mother returned i observed that she had been excessively moved and the traces of recent tears were on her cheeks helen she at length said i trust i have done by seymour pendarves what i should wish a friend to do by a child of mine and is he not her child the child of that lost matchless being whom i loved only second to yourself since one dearer than either was removed from me yes i admonished him as a mother would have done and though i refused his request i did it indeed i did with gentleness and with anguish helen she resumed if ever you should doubt the affections of your mother remember what for your sake she has undergone this day she has though her heart bled to do it wounded that of one whom she loves now next to yourself and that one too the child of her adored lady helen but the sense of a mother's duty aided by a higher power has supported me through it and he is gone yes and he reproached me bitterly for my cruelty helen but if he could see me now do you think he would censure me for hardness of heart mournful were the hours that followed and we retired early to rest but my mother rested not i heard her walking backward and forward in her room till near day break and till she had ceased i was too uneasy to close my eyes when i rose the next day and was walking in the garden before breakfast i found my mother's windows still shut and it was very late before she came down stairs i had previously felt disposed to indulge my own dejection but as soon as i saw her all thought of myself vanished for never did i see the expression of hopeless grief stronger than in her speaking face as she did not talk i vainly tried to converse of indifferent things she smiled but every smile was succeeded by a sigh and once she exclaimed no they cannot come to me but i shall go to them dearest mother cried i rising and looking up in her face you forget me surely you do not wish to leave me do not ask me she cried clasping me fondly to her bosom i fear i am ungrateful for my remaining blessing from that time she struggled with her grief and became as you know in company at least the agreeable companion for about that time it was i think that your amiable husband succeeded to the living and you came to enliven and adorn the rectory however as your friend for whose inspection this is written does not know any of the subsequent events i shall proceed with the detail of my story during the ensuing six weeks we had only one letter from seymour but that was a pleasant one for he told us that he had been studying very hard and had gotten another prize and he sent us his composition adding in a very touching manner that as the eye which he most wished to please by his production was for ever closed his proudest desire now was to have it approved by those whom he and she best loved my mother was gratified by this compliment as well as myself for she augured favourably of his amendment from this close application and she owned to me in the fulness of her heart that she had informed him his obtaining my hand depended entirely on himself i have said that my mother appeared quite recovered in company but such was the constant recurrence of one anxious subject to her mind in private that every thing unconnected with it soon became uninteresting to her this was the renewal of virtuous friendship in another world and she read and tried to procure every thing in the shape of a sermon or essay that had ever been written on the subject one sermon and it was a most eloquent one bearing the title the renewal of virtuous friendship in another world delighted her so much that it was never out of her reach and though she found it difficult to deduce from the scriptures any certain grounds for this consoling doctrine still she delighted to indulge in it and as she could never rest till she had tried to convert others to her own opinions especially where those opinions were likely to increase individual happiness those only with whom she was not intimate could avoid hearing her descant on this subject with all that plausible and ingenious fluency which usually attends reasoning from analogy and imagination while her mind was thus employed it ceased to prey on its own peace and though her system sometimes failed to satisfy her she still found a soothing conviction in the thought that should we not be permitted to know and love our friends in heaven we should be sure not to be conscious of the want of those who had been the dearest to us when on earth but should find all the ways of god vindicated to man footnote see a volume of sermons written by the rev p houghton it was now while my mother was too constantly thinking of the regretted dead and i of the still tenderly remembered living that a new acquaintance was introduced to us who had power to withdraw our thoughts from these interesting speculations and fix them for some time at least upon himself methinks my dear friend i see you smile at this distance and remark to your husband now we shall see what she says of the impression which count ferdinand de walden first made on her for i never could understand how she could ever prefer another man to him you forget how very early in life my affections were turned towards pendarves and how soon i learnt to look on constancy in love as a sort of virtue you also forget the fascinating graces and the irresistible archness to use your own expression of seymour's smile but this is perhaps an ill timed digression where was i oh at the introduction of a new acquaintance my parents had made an acquaintance in america with the count de walden the elder whom curiosity and the love of travelling had led thither on the breaking out of the war he returned to his native country switzerland by way of england where he was so much pleased with the manners of the people and constitution of the government that he resolved his nephew and heir ferdinand de walden who was like himself a protestant should come over and enter himself at one of the universities when the time for his admission arrived the count remembered with renewed interest his acquaintance with my parents and their cousins and that they now resided in england nor was it difficult for him to obtain particulars of their present residence and situation his uncle heard with pain that my mother seymour and myself were the only survivors of that happy family which he had so much loved in the new world to my mother however he was still anxious to introduce his nephew and he hoped that in seymour he would find a durable friend at college but in this expectation he could not be gratified as he had resolved that ferdinand should go to the mathematical university and seymour was of oxford this impossibility my mother thought a fortunate circumstance for ferdinand when de walden came and showed among other letters one of recommendation to mr seymour pendarves she coldly observed that letter need not be delivered yet and certainly the appearance of ferdinand de walden did not promise much congeniality of disposition and pursuit with seymour for the latter from the light gaiety of his manner and countenance seemed as if he never thought at all and the former from the grave pensiveness and reserve of his appeared at first sight as if he did nothing but think the open eye of seymour invited confidence the penetrating one of de walden repelled it and as the one when first seen was sure to inspire admiration if not love the other was as sure to excite alarm if not a feeling resembling aversion for myself i must own that when de walden was presented to me by my mother i experienced towards him a little of the first though none of the second sensation for i had been accustomed to look on seymour as my model for personal beauty and captivation and the young swiss therefore had not a chance of charming me at first sight i had not seen my mother so animated for years as she was on the arrival of her foreign guest for she had greatly esteemed his uncle and ferdinand strongly resembled him with him of course were associated the ever remembered hours of youth and friendship wedded love and happiness and de walden shone with a radiance not his own but my mother much to my annoyance was not conscious of this she insisted that his brilliancy was all self derived that if she had never known his uncle she should still have admired him by this admiration i am ashamed to confess i was piqued and mortified because i fancied it interfered with the rights of seymour and i suspected that if he should repay the regard of the mother by loving the daughter i could not without disobedience remain constant to my first attachment as de walden was not to go to college till october he had leave to stay with us till that time since it was rather an unusual thing for a fine young man unless he was a relation to be the guest of a widow lady and her daughter for so long a period i was therefore certain that my mother must have some particular point to carry and that point was i believed the alienation of my heart from seymour pendarves these suspicions certainly made me regard ferdinand the two first days of his arrival with prejudiced eyes not unmixed with fear of his keenness of penetration but in spite of myself my fear of him vanished and much of my prejudice with it when i found that this grave sententious personage who talked theology with my mother and tried poor man to explain to us some new german philosophy could laugh as heartily as if he never read and never thought and had a sense of the ridiculous which he found sometimes dangerous and troublesome to his good breeding this welcome discovery happened to me at breakfast while he was reading to us aloud some amusing extracts from a kind of periodical paper published in france by the baron de grimm one of which was so ludicrous that he laid down the book to laugh at his ease while i exclaimed is it possible is what possible my dear said my mother that mr de walden i repeated rather uncivilly can laugh so very heartily n'est il pas permis en angleterre mademoiselle was his answer footnote is it not permitted in england oh yes said i blushing and looking very foolish only oh je comprends apparemment c'est mademoiselle qui ne veut pas qu'on rit devant elle helas belle helene il faut rire tant qu'on le peut quand on a le bonheur de jouir souvent de votre aimable societe car il me semble qu'en ce cas la on pourroit bien avoir raison de pleurer bientot et peut etre pour la vie footnote oh i comprehend you do not like any should laugh in your presence alas beautiful helen one must laugh while one can when one has the happiness of being in your society for one runs the risk of crying very soon and perhaps for life here was gallantry too and returning good for evil though i was rude he was polite i was humbled and ashamed while he with increasing archness said mais qu'est ce que vous voulez dire avec votre 'is it possible' what you think me a disciple of crassus and fancy me never laugh till i see an ass eat a thistle he added in his foreign english footnote but what did you mean with your 'is it possible' shall i tell you what i take you for now replied i venturing to look up in his face which for the first time animated as it now was by pleasantry and the consciousness of appearing to advantage struck me with the conviction of its excessive physiognomical beauty and i ceased to wonder at my mother's regard for him not because he was possessed of great personal attractions but because beauty of physiognomy cannot exist without corresponding beauty of mind if not of heart well he replied and what do you take me for speaking with that accent which in him i have often thought an additional charm a kind hearted man and a good christian for you returned good for evil and repaid impertinence by making it the foundation of a compliment still i must presume again and tell you that i believe your laughs are like jours de fete they do not come every day pour les jours de fete non ils ne me sont point venus tous les jours que depuis mon arrivee ici mais a present mademoiselle tous les jours sont pour moi des jours de fete et ma sainte est sainte helene footnote for holidays no they never came to me every day till i came hither but now all days are holidays to me and my saint is saint helen i was not yet old enough to know how to receive compliments like these without embarrassment and to hide my awkwardness i exclaimed why what can have become of them i have lost them they are quite gone qu'avez vous perdu mademoiselle permettez moi de le chercher dites donc footnote but what are you seeking let me look for it tell me my fear and awe of you fear and awe of me oh qu'ils s'en aillent tout de bon ce ne sont pas les sentiments que je voudrais vous inspirer pour moi as he said this there was an expression in his dark eyes which made me turn mine away and addressing my mother i told her that our guest reminded me of a little french paper toy which i had seen called deux tetes sous un bonnet that at first view it was a monk with a cowl on but that when the cowl was thrown off there was a gay and smiling young man so it was with mr de walden when he first came he seemed a grave philosopher and now he is an absolute lover of fun and a laugher of the first order footnote oh let them go away entirely these are not the sentiments with which i wish to inspire you de grace mademoiselle dites moi lequel des deux caracteres vous plait le plus mais ne me dites pas je vous le demande en grace que je vous offense le moins dans mon role de philosophe helas aupres de vous qui pourroit rester philosophe footnote in pity tell me which of these two characters pleases you the most but pray do not tell me that i offend you less as a philosopher for who that is near you can long remain a philosopher i wish you said i to resemble democritus who united the two characters of laugher and philosopher and you if you please shall be the latter with my mother you shall talk wisely and gravely with her but laugh and talk nonsense now and then with me vous convenez donc de la justice de ma proposition qu'aupres de vous on ne peut etre philosophe footnote you agree then to the justice of my proposition that near you no one can remain a philosopher i shook my head and held up my hand at him not knowing exactly how to answer he seized it and pressed it fervently to his lips my mother i saw enjoyed this dialogue but my own heart reproached me for having allowed myself to be amused and flattered into a sort of infidelity to seymour by a man too who would be i foresaw warmly encouraged by my mother by this conversation which has never been effaced from my memory you will suspect that my flippancy and the evident pleasure with which i kept it up were proofs that nothing but a prior attachment could have preserved my affections from the power of de walden when he once displayed to me all the variety of his talents and the graces of his mind even as it was they would have had a more certain effect but for the injudicious eagerness with which my mother tried to force a conviction of them upon me for then my alarmed feelings took the part of seymour and i was piqued into underrating her idol because she seemed to overrate him how very rarely is it that one can obtain or give an opinion uninfluenced by temper prejudice or interest is he not very handsome she used to say yes but i have seen a handsomer man oh you mean seymour he is handsomer certainly but then he is not near so tall no but he is better made that i never remarked and i hope you will only impart the result of your observation to me others might think it indelicate what a fine countenance he has yes sometimes but not always and i prefer one that is always so i like perpetual rather than occasional sun shine it is disagreeable to have to watch the sun peeping out from behind clouds helen helen replied my mother weak foolish girl to like what no one can on earth obtain perpetual sun shine in the moral world and after all when one considers what this life is its long pains and its short pleasures the riches of one day succeeded by the poverty of the next the ties which are firmly knit only to be severed in a moment and our capacity and cause for enjoyment never equal to our capability and cause of suffering my child what a poor thoughtless frivolous being must that be whose lip can always smile and whose eye can always sparkle whom fears for himself can never depress nor fears for time or for eternity or anxiety for the welfare or the peace of others can alarm into self government you know that when my mother was roused into any mental emotion she did not talk she harangued she spoke as if she read out of a book it was as you perceive the case now my dear mother replied i such a being as you describe would be as odious to me as he could be to you and his vivacity either of manner or countenance must be the result of want of feelings affections or intellect to such perpetual sun shine i like you should object but then the clouds must not be occasioned by the absence of good humour or by the presence of sulkiness and ill humour or by hypochondriacal tendencies you do not suppose helen she cried with quickness that de walden is grave only because he is cross and thoughtful only because he is hypochondriacal were we talking of individuals mamma if not you know we were thinking of them helen and i feel only too sensible that the pique with which you answer when i praise ferdinand springs from your still powerful attachment to seymour i could not deny it but my conscience reproached me for having from a feeling of jealousy on poor seymour's account not only seemed to insinuate an ill opinion of ferdinand which i did not entertain but for having also given unnecessary pain to my mother oh my dear friend how often since i lost her have i reproached myself with these little offences and what i suffered for the more painful trials which i inflicted on her no words can describe no regret can atone sad state of human blindness and human infirmity when one seems conscious of the duties which one owes to a parent only after one is utterly deprived of the means to atone for the neglect of them by what i have said of my jealousy of my mother's admiration of ferdinand you will see how much i had forgiven seymour's imputed ill conduct and how little i adhered to my resolution of forgetting him his letter and his new prize had much contributed to this the latter was a proof that he had been leading a regular and studious life and the former declared that my mother and myself were dearer to him than any one else in existence and that our approbation was what he most coveted alas when one loves one easily believes what the beloved object asserts still however spite of my constancy de walden by his varied talents his rational pursuits his instructive conversation and his active benevolence gained on my esteem every day he was constantly occupied himself and his example stimulated us to equal industry weeks therefore fled as if they were days and i felt raised in my own estimation by seeing myself the constant object of interest to such a man and also by feeling myself able to appreciate him if seymour had not been able to write elegant prose and gain prizes my constancy would have been in great danger but as it was there was intellectuality on both sides and i had only to weigh talent against strength of mind and extensive information throwing a great many pleasant make weights beside into the scale with the first my feelings toward seymour were now called into fresh vigour by a letter from him informing my mother that instead of having a monument made on purpose for his beloved parent which would not have been ready for a considerable time he had purchased one which had been nearly finished for a gentleman who died before it was completed and who had intended it for his wife and which the sculptor had been desired by the heir at law not to trouble himself to complete this monument pendarves said had met all his ideas of simple and classical beauty and it would soon be ready for the inscription this he added he had also enclosed for the approbation of my mother and his cousin helen as he called me considering the former as the representative of his mother and me as the only woman after her whom he wished to consult on any of his plans we were excessively affected at the receipt of this letter and de walden who was present appeared distressed at the sight of our emotion what do you think of the inscription my dear asked my mother ask mr de walden what he thinks of it i replied it was as follows here lieth all that was mortal of the lady helen pendarves reader pity only her survivors on the reverse side were to be the following words this monument is erected to her memory as a token of love and gratitude by her only child whose proudest boast it will always be that he was the son of such a woman as i expected he exclaimed in its praise and as he was a great theorizer he added much that delighted me and much that consequently made my mother uncomfortable it is cried he simple and comprehensive oh i must know him simple virtues simple manners and simple heart pompous writers not much real feeling not true i must know pendarves a good son makes a good friend good every thing when shall i see him my mother looked grave and i saw that the observant eye of de walden remarked our contrary emotions with surprise if not with uneasiness then i may tell pendarves that you like the inscription may i helen said my mother oh yes that it is every thing i could wish and she retired to write when she returned it was evident that she had been weeping violently and de walden without saying a word took her hand and pressed it respectfully to his lips this action though it was at once feeling and affectionate displeased me for it seemed to my oblique manner of viewing such things an injury to pendarves and in no very pleasant disposition of mind i left the room nor can i doubt but that my absence gave my mother an opportunity of telling de walden all the circumstances of our situation with seymour for on my rejoining them i found my mother looking agitated though also much pleased and de walden dejected abstracted and silent need i add that i had long since had the pain of discovering that he had conceived an attachment for me you may easily believe that this letter from seymour and my mother's assurance that he would certainly come to see the monument put up did not tend to further the suit which i foresaw in process of time would be urged to me by de walden but the monument was sent down and erected and yet pendarves did not arrive consequently we thought he would not come at all still as precaution is wisdom my mother with much earnestness conjured me to pledge my solemn word to her that if he came i would not converse with him alone should he be ever so desirous of an interview and that i would avoid him when he called at our house this was a trial of my filial duty for which i was not prepared but my mother was so bent on carrying her point and she so solemnly expressed her conviction that his conduct when in london was not amended that i gave at last the promise which she requested now then said i to myself i hope poor seymour will not come down lady helen's monument was placed next that of her husband on which by desire of lord seymour an account of the two families and of the manner of his death had been engraved in an ostentatious manner consequently it had not been necessary for seymour to give any additional details my mother likewise had found herself at liberty when she hung up a beautiful tablet to the memory of her husband to confine herself to the simplicity which she loved and these last furnished a curious contrast to the pompous copiousness of the first still it was not to enjoy the superiority of my mother's and seymour's taste that i now so often visited the church and resumed the custom which i had adopted in america of strewing the graves i honoured with flowers oh no it was because the mother of seymour pendarves and the dearest friend of my youth slept beneath that spotless marble and i not only gratified my own feelings but was sure my tribute would be gratifying to those of pendarves of his father i had no recollection and of my own not sufficient to make such a tribute had i paid it to him more than an act of coldly remembered duty but my whole heart was interested when i performed it in honour of lady helen and the chill and colourless marble looked warm and glowing from the profusion of blooming flowers which i loved to scatter on it one morning after offering as usual my tribute on this precious monument and while kneeling beside it a deep sigh startled me and i beheld seymour pendarves who had entered at another door standing in pleased contemplation of me but the view which i allowed myself of him was short indeed my promise to my mother forcibly recurred to my mind and the shriek of surprise and even of alarm which i uttered on beholding him so unexpectedly was succeeded by my flying with the speed of phrensy to the door behind me before seymour thunder struck mortified and overcome by my seeming terror on observing him could recover himself sufficiently to prevent or overtake me alas by the beating of my heart and the trembling of my whole frame i knew too well that on hiding myself from him depended my only chance of keeping my promise i therefore took refuge in a cottage the owner of which was well known to me instead of hastening home along the park where he must with ease have overtaken me accordingly i followed a sharp turning which led through a little lane to the cottage and making my way through the first room into the back one i threw myself on a bed trembling and breathless what is the matter my dear young lady cried the cottager ask no questions but shut the door was my answer she obeyed me and i listened for several minutes for the sound of rapid footsteps but in vain i felt mortified at finding that seymour did not trouble himself to pursue me still i dared not go home lest i should meet him on my road i was therefore obliged to tell the cottager that i had a particular reason for wishing to avoid seeing mr pendarves and i would thank her to watch if she could do it unsuspected for his quitting the church and inform me which way he went yes yes replied the woman shaking her head he shall not see you if i can help it for though to be sure i hear he is very good to the poor folks say he is but a wild one and they do say here with an agonizing heart and a gesture of indignant impatience i bade her begone and do as i desired when she had disappeared i clasped my hands together convulsively i sobbed aloud in the anguish of a wounded spirit and can it be i cried that he whose sweet and pensive countenance so full of mournful tenderness i have just gazed upon for a moment and shall never be able to forget again can he be a man whose notoriously profligate habits make him the theme of abuse to a person like this no there is not one pang in the catalogue of human suffering so acute as that which the heart feels from the consciousness of the decided depravity of a being tenderly beloved the woman on her return told me mr pendarves was certainly seeking me that he had on leaving the church looked round and then ran several yards at full speed down the park after which he stopped and she thought it probable that he would soon be past the front window but she would look out and see she did so and having told me in a whisper adding that through a hole in the little muslin curtain i could see him without being seen i was weak enough to take advantage of the opportunity he walked dejectedly and with folded arms the glow on his cheek which the sight of me had deepened was now succeeded by a deadly paleness and i felt a bitterness which not even my sense of his errors could assuage that he was wretched and that i had made him so my spy watched him into his own house and only then i ventured to return to mine i must say that i look back on this morning spite of the sufferings which i endured with much self satisfaction as i had completely acted up to the dictates of filial duty under the strongest temptation of disobeying them as my mother was gone with de walden to spend the day from home and had i not conscientiously avoided seymour i might even without any positive infringement of duty have exposed myself to the risk of seeing him undisturbed by her presence happily however my principles were too firm to allow me to be satisfied with this subterfuge and as i before said i recall this day with satisfaction every hour i expected that seymour would call but he did not come however i saw his servant ride up to the gate deliver a note and wait for an answer i gave it verbally to my own maid it was that mrs pendarves was gone out for the whole day shall i confess that i hoped seymour would on hearing this make an attempt to see me though i was resolved to refuse him attendance and i was mortified that he did not just before i expected my mother and de walden would return i saw seymour's servant come to the door again and deliver another note as it seemed but when it was brought into the room i found it was a letter to me i was at once relieved agitated miserable and delighted yet my hand trembled so much i thought i should never be able to open the letter the following were its contents when this letter reaches you miss pendarves i shall be at a distance from that scene which to me can now never again be a home but which is endeared to me by such tender recollections that not even by the miserable ones which now must succeed to them can they be ever effaced oh my beloved mother could you have believed that your son could be refused admittance within the doors of your dearest friend and forbidden even to speak to the playfellow and companion of his childhood and the once appointed sharer of his heart and his fortunes could you have thought that the friend who adored you would have gone from home purposely to avoid him and to avoid his just reproaches because without any new offence on his part she had not only resolved never to allow him to address her daughter but had pledged that daughter's hand as he is informed to another and yet her parting words were 'your marriage with helen depends wholly on yourself' these words i never have forgotten they regulated my conduct they gave strength to my resolutions i came hither full of hope and i go hence overwhelmed with despair for my claims claims which i have never resigned have been disregarded and helen will be the wife of a stranger the acquaintance of yesterday nay more at sight of me helen herself the conscious helen fled as from a pestilence and at what a moment too when i had surprised her in an office the most flattering to your memory and the most precious to my heart cruel helen what have you done and what have i done to be so treated surely it was from your mother herself that i should first have heard of your intended marriage but no i refused to believe it till your flight and your countenance of terror on seeing me confirmed the horrible truth but though you might not be able to tell it me yourself why did mrs pendarves avoid me why when i wrote to tell her i was coming for a single day did she not make a point of seeing me either at her own house or at mine but i will not detain you much longer from your attention to the happy stranger oh helen had you continued to encourage my hopes i might have been a happiness to myself and an ornament to society but now yes now it will be well if i am not a disgrace to it but why do i continue to write shall i tell you helen it is because i feel that i am addressing you for the last time for the wife of the count de walden must not i know receive letters from seymour pendarves though i now think and you will probably think so too that this letter was written full as much from the head as from the heart you will not wonder that it bent me to the earth in agony and that when my mother entered the hall on her return she heard my voice uttering the tones of loud lamentation and found me in the arms of the terrified servants never have i since suffered myself to be so weakly overpowered i try to excuse such weakness by the state of my health at the time indisposition and a tendency to a severe feverish cold had prevented me from accompanying my mother and de walden nor did the sudden surprise of seeing pendarves steady my nerves or decrease my fever but these circumstances prepared the way for the letter to affect me as it did and to excuse in some measure the state in which my mother beheld me an open letter near me in the hand writing of pendarves accounted for all that she saw i was become more composed though i did not speak and she then eagerly inquired but she soon desisted to express her surprise at the charge of having gone out purposely to avoid him for no such letter had ever reached her in consequence of some accident it did not arrive till the next day she declared she could not sleep till she had written to seymour to exonerate herself from so heavy a charge i wished to say and to assure him i hope that i am not engaged to de walden that on the contrary he is not even a declared lover but i dared not say this and my mother read on but she read hastily and wished i saw to conceal from me the painful emotions which the letter occasioned her she therefore insisted on my forgetting these ill founded reproaches as she called them she then left me to write to seymour the next morning seymour's servant came to say he was going to rejoin his master and wished to know if we had any commands for him to him therefore was consigned the exculpatory letter but of this i had no knowledge at the time for when my mother and the servant entered the room next day they found me in all the restlessness of fast increasing illness and my mother before night was assured by the medical attendants that i was suffering under a very formidable attack of the scarlet fever for three days and nights my life was despaired of and as according to the merciful dispensations of providence good always springs from evil my mother learnt to know from the danger of her only child that life was not so valueless to her as she was sometimes disposed to think it but hope succeeding to fear on the fourth morning from my seizure i was pronounced out of danger yet a cloud and that a dark one still hung over my mother's prospects for i had named seymour in my delirium in such terms as convinced her that he was ever uppermost in my mind and that my illness had been the consequence of misery endured on his account de walden during this time was in a state of painful anxiety scarcely could he be prevailed upon to keep out of the infected chamber his nights were never once passed in bed till i was declared to be in safety and on my recovery i had to experience the mortifying necessity of owing gratitude where i believed that i could never make an adequate return of affection well i recovered though i remained for many weeks thin languid and afflicted with the disagreeable local complaints which often attend on the subsiding of a fever like mine particularly inflammations of the eyelid and i could not bear for some time to have my eyes uncovered during this period of suffering de walden devoted his whole time to amusing me he read to me while i reclined upon the sofa and i forgot my complaints while listening to his intelligent comments on what he read it was therefore with considerable concern that i saw him depart for cambridge in october but my concern was joy to his never did i see any one more agitated on such an occasion and scarcely could the presence of my mother restrain the declaration of love which hovered on his lips and which i dreaded to hear but he did restrain it for he had promised her that he would do so on her assurance that the time was not come for its being favourably received at christmas he returned to us and the surprise which he showed at sight of me convinced us of the great change which had taken place in my appearance in consequence as is sometimes the case at my age for i was not yet seventeen of a severe fever i was become taller by several inches that is i had become from five feet five full five feet eight and from my upright carriage as i have heard you remark i look considerably taller but i am quite sure that had the attachment of de walden been founded on my personal appearance it would during his stay with us have completely vanished for my eyes were inflamed my embonpoint had not increased and my colour was not only gone but my complexion looked thick as well as pale i perceived however no diminution in the ardent devotion which his manner expressed and i sighed while i thought that had seymour pendarves seen me he perhaps would not have remained so constant what an argument was this belief for me to try to conquer my attachment but certain it is that the example of lady helen and my mother influenced me even unconsciously to myself and that i considered eternal constancy as praiseworthy and not blameable love had led my mother and my admirable friend and monitress to leave their parents and country and they had wept the loss of husbands thus exclusively beloved in sacred singleness of attachment it was in vain therefore that my mother told me love was to be conquered and that she insinuated it was even indelicate to pine after an object who was perhaps unworthy and certainly negligent if not faithless her example as i before said had raised the passion in my estimation the object of my love was one on whom my eyes had first opened one who was associated with my earliest and happiest recollections one too who she must remember had at an early age saved my life at the hazard of his own a story i shall tell by and by and i could not but think she wished me to forget seymour chiefly because she preferred ferdinand i believe i have forgotten to mention that seymour pendarves went abroad as soon as he left our village and that he did not receive my mother's explanatory letter till several months after it was written in january de walden returned to college and i was still so unwell that my mother wished me to change the air and as business required her to undertake a journey we set off in february on a tour i have never i believe during my whole narrative mentioned some of my relations more than once and this has been from a wish of not encumbering it with unnecessary characters the uncle with whom my mother had lived previously to her marriage who occasionally spent months at our house and whom we visited in return died suddenly at a very advanced age during my illness it was this event which called my mother as one of the executors as well as residuary legatee from her home the weather was cold dry february weather and the brightness of the road from the effect of frost and sun was so painful to my eyes that my mother resolved to travel all night and repose in the day after our second stage from london and we set off for oxford at one in the morning from the ruggedness of the road however and the care which our coachman always took of our horses we had full leisure to dwell on the possibility of our being robbed when about three in the morning two horsemen rode past the carriage and one of them looked into the window next my mother which she had just let down but he rode on and we were grasping each other's hand in terrified silence when he came back again and desired the postilions to stop our footman who was on the box was disposed to resist this command when a faint voice the voice of the other gentleman who now rode slowly up conjured them to stop for mercy's sake for they were not highwaymen the first now came up to the window and begged to be heard he and his friend he said were oxford students who had been to london without leave and if they were missing another morning at chapel they were liable to a punishment which they wished to avoid but they should certainly have reached oxford in excellent time had not his companion been taken extremely ill and unless we would take him in he must stop at the next house at whatever risk you may suppose that my mother did not hesitate she instantly desired the footman to assist the gentleman into the coach and mount his horse a plan which was thankfully acceded to his companion instantly galloped off at full speed for oxford the invalid unable to speak sank back exhausted in one corner and seemed most thankful though he spoke almost inaudibly for the use of my mother's smelling bottle the weather had now experienced such a change that the frost was gone though the night was so dark that the stranger could not distinguish our faces nor we his indeed he appeared to be insensible of external objects and heedless of sounds for he did not always answer my mother's kind inquiries i meanwhile was as silent as the invalid and sat back in the coach to indulge in the feelings which agitated me at the idea that before long i should be in the very place which probably contained pendarves but without the remotest chance of seeing him at length we heard a village clock strike four and day began to dawn my mother let down the glass to feel for a while the refreshing breeze of morning as she did this desiring me to keep my thick veil wrapped close round my face for fear of cold the invalid said he would put his head out of the window for he thought that the air would revive him my mother drew back to make room for him when as the rays of the red and yellow dawn fell on his wan face she recognized in this object of her kindness seymour pendarves himself he too as her veil was thrown back knew her at the same moment and faintly ejaculating is it possible he turned his eyes eagerly toward me then seized both her hands and resting them on her knees buried his face in them and burst into tears while with the hand next me he grasped mine which was involuntarily extended towards him a painful silence ensued the result of most uncomfortable feelings which on the side of pendarves were accompanied by the most distressing consciousness for we had as it were detected him in a breach of college rules and but for us his irregularity of conduct might perhaps have exposed him to the disgrace of expulsion so much for that amendment on which alone depended his union with me that was an event however which though we knew it not he had ceased to make probable for the report of my engagement to de walden was still current wherever we were known and if he had not known that mr pendarves the head of the family knew nothing of this intended marriage seymour would have been convinced it was a fact himself my mother's tears now fell silently down her cheek and in spite of herself she pressed her forehead on the head of seymour as it still rested on her knees certain it is that she loved him with much of a mother's tenderness loved him also because he resembled his father and mine and loved him still more because he was all that remained to her of her ever regretted friend the opposition to our union therefore was the strongest proof possible of the strength of her principles and of her affection for me for though she thus loved she rejected him because she was sure that he was not likely to make her daughter happy my mother was the first to break silence in a voice of great feeling she said seymour unhappy young man why do i see you here infringing college rules and why do i see you thus have you been ill long have you had no advice it was now quite day and as he raised his head the wild wanness of his look was terrible to us both and it was with difficulty that i could prevent myself from sobbing audibly while i anxiously expected his answer spare me spare me cried he mournfully a painful confession of follies did not business carry you to london seymour no nor kept me there it was the search of pleasure and i have scarcely been in bed for three nights yet no let me do myself some little justice i was unhappy and i am unhappy by denying me all hope of helen you made me desperate and i fled to riotous living to get away from myself therefore do not reproach me i am quite punished enough by seeing before me the intended wife of the count de walden curses on the name tell me cried he wildly seeing that my mother hesitated to speak am i not right is not my helen as i once thought her betrothed to de walden oh no no cried i eagerly and i caught my mother's eye rather sternly fixed upon me but i regarded it not for i felt at the very bottom of my heart the sudden change from misery to joy which seymour's face now exhibited he could not speak his heart was too full but leaning back overcome both with physical and moral exhaustion he nearly fainted away he was soon however roused to new energy by the indignation with which he listened to what my mother felt herself called upon to say i shall not enter into a detail of her observations suffice that she candidly told him her objections to his being allowed to address me remained in full force as did her ardent wish that i should marry de walden who had offered himself as my lover and who she was certain would as surely make me happy in marriage as he would make me miserable when she had ended he thanked her for her candour but coldly reminded her that he had always said he would never take a refusal from any lips but mine and he retained his resolution and now said he the opportunity is arrived helen such as i am not worthy of you i own except as far as tender and constant love can make me so i offer myself to your acceptance speak yes or no and speak as your heart dictates i remained silent for a minute then faltered out sighing deeply as i spoke i have no will can have no will but my mother's enough replied he in a tone and with a look which seemed to me to be the climax of despair hark cried he the oxford clocks are striking six why do i linger here for here i am sure i have no longer any business he let down the glass and desired the postilions to stop while the footman rode up to the door this little exertion seemed too much for him and he sunk back quite exhausted while my mother tried to take one of his hands pshaw cried he throwing her hand from him give me love or give me hate no half measures for me nor hope when you and your daughter have given me my death blow that i will accept of emollients i thank you madam as i would a stranger for your courtesy in admitting me here and i wish you both good morning again his strength failed him and he was forced to wipe the dews of weakness from his forehead go i must even if i die in the effort he then exclaimed i could not bear this and while my mother herself greatly affected held me back i tried to catch him by the arm and in a voice which evinced the deep feeling of my soul i exclaimed stay dear seymour you are not fit to go you are not indeed but i spoke in vain he mounted his horse assisted by the servant while i broke from my mother and stretched out my clasped hands to him in fruitless supplication then giving me a look of such mixed expression that i could not exactly say whether it most pained or gratified me he was out of sight in a moment while i looked after him till i could see him no longer and even then i still looked in hopes of seeing him again i did see him again just as we had entered oxford and were passing magdalen he stood at the gate he had therefore seen my long earnest gaze as if in search of him and though i felt confused i also felt comforted by it in another moment we were near him and his eyes met mine with an expression mournful tender and i thought grateful too for the interest which i took in him he kissed his hand to me and then disappeared within the gates helen said my mother i meant to have stopped here to refresh the horses and ourselves but after what i have seen this morning i shall proceed immediately she left the footman however behind to bring us word the next day how mr pendarves was oh how i loved her for this kind attention but then she was a rare instance of the union of strong feelings with unbending principle methinks i hear you say i hope you were now convinced that seymour's attachment as well as ferdinand's was founded on too good a basis to be shaken by your altered looks no indeed i was not for so conscious was i that my looks were altered i never once lifted up my veil before pendarves i dare say both he and my mother imputed this to the wish of hiding my emotion whereas it was in fact only to hide my inflamed eyes and my ugliness but what a degrading confession for a heroine to make to plead guilty of having bad eyes and a plain face it is as bad as amelia's broken nose but n'importe my eyes like her nose will get well again and like her i shall come out a complete beauty when no one could expect it we awaited with great impatience the return of the servant from whom we learnt that mr pendarves had been seized with an alarming fit on leaving the chapel and was pronounced to be in an inflammatory fever o my dear mother cried i wildly he has no one to nurse him now that loves him but he shall have she replied and in another hour we were on our road to oxford my mother insisted on being admitted to the bedside of the unconscious sufferer who in his delirium was ever blaming the cruelty of her who was now watching and weeping beside his pillow long was his illness and severe his suffering but he struggled through and the first object whom he beheld on recovering his recollection was my mother leaning over him with the anxiety of a real parent never could poor seymour recall this moment of his life without tears of grateful tenderness he was too much disappointed however to find that her resolution not to allow him to address me remained in full force for the circumstances on which it was founded were added to rather than diminished nor could his assertion that his dissipation was owing to the despair into which she had plunged him at all excuse him in her eyes for she could not admit that any sorrow could be an excuse for error this indeed far from its being a motive to move her heart in his favour closed it the more against him as it proved she thought that from his weakness of character he never could deserve to be intrusted with the happiness of her child bitter therefore was his mortification when on expressing the hopes to which her kindness had given birth she assured him that her sentiments remained unaltered then madam cried he why were you so cruel as to save my life young man she gravely replied was it not my duty to try to save your life that you might try to amend it were you prepared to meet that terrible tribunal from which even the most perfect shrink back appalled on his complete recovery my mother and i proceeded to the house of my uncle now become our property and thence we returned home the following vacation seymour finally left college and again went abroad he wrote a farewell letter to my mother as eloquent as gratitude and even filial affection could make it she wept over it and exclaimed oh that the generous hearted creature who wrote this should not be all i wish him he is like a beautiful but unsupported edifice fair to behold but dangerous to lean against there was one part of the letter however which my mother did not understand i fancied that i did though i did not own it he assured her that in spite of everything he carried more hope away in his heart than he had ever yet known hope and even a precious conviction which he had never known before and which he was sure his cousin helen would wish him to possess as it would be to him the strongest shield against temptation my dear said my mother after long consideration how stupid i have been not to understand this sooner he certainly means that he is become very religious and that this hope this sweet conviction are faith and another world dear seymour i am so glad for though i do not choose you should marry a methodist and one extreme is to me as unpleasant as another still i believe methodists to be a very happy people and i hope seymour for his own sake will not change again i smiled but said nothing for i put a very different interpretation on his words as it appeared to me his hope and conviction were that he possessed my love and that my compliance with my mother's will was wholly against my own for i recollected the tone in which i had replied to his question concerning my engagement to de walden oh no no and also my scream of agony in spite of his alarming weakness when he persevered in leaving us and the anxiety with which i looked at him at the gates of magdalen yes when we exchanged that look i felt that our hearts understood each other and i was sure that the shield to which seymour alluded was his conviction of my love but alas he was absent de walden was present he came to us at the beginning of the long vacation and was to remain with us till he returned to college my mother now urged me to admit the addresses of de walden showing me at the same time a letter from his uncle in which he expressed his earnest desire that his nephew should be a successful suitor and offering to make a splendid addition to his fortune whenever he should become my husband in short could the prospect of rank and fortune could manly beauty superior sense unspotted virtues and uncommon acquirements have made me unfaithful to my first attachment unfaithful i should soon have become but though the attentions of de walden could not annihilate they certainly weakened it no wonder that they should do so when i was so little sure of the stability of seymour's affection that i was fearful it would be weakened by any change in my external appearance and as i had often heard him say he did not admire tall women i own i was weak enough to be uneasy at the growth consequent upon my fever and i was glad when we met in the coach not only that my veil concealed my altered looks but that as i was seated he could not discover my almost may pole height de walden on the contrary admired tall women and declared that i had now reached the exact height which gave majesty to the female figure without diminishing its grace and as i really thought myself too tall his praise for flattery it was not was particularly welcome to me whatever was the cause whether i liked de walden so well that i liked seymour so much less as to cease to be fretted by his absence i cannot tell but certain it is that i recovered my bloom and that from the increase of my embonpoint my mother feared i should become too fat for a girl of seventeen my spirits too recovered all their former gaiety so that october the time for the departure of de walden arrived before i was conscious that he had been with us half his accustomed time my mother now naturally enough augured well for the success of his suit and i owned that i was no longer averse to listen to his love but that i would on no account engage myself to him till i was quite sure i had conquered my attachment to pendarves this was certainly conceding a great deal and de walden left us full of hope for the first time while i who felt much of my affection for him vanish when i no longer listened to the deep persuasive tones of his voice should have repented having gone so far had i not seen happiness beaming in my beloved mother's face at christmas de walden came to us again and i then found that in such cases it is impossible to use an expressive phrase to say a without saying b i had gone so far that i was expected to go further and but for the secret misgivings of my own heart and the firm dictates of my own judgment de walden would have returned to college in january my betrothed husband but though we had not received any tidings from pendarves and my mother felt assured of his inconstancy i persevered firmly in my resolution not to engage myself till i had seen him again and could be assured by seeing him with indifference that my heart had really changed its master you will wonder perhaps how a man of ferdinand's delicacy could wish to accept a heart which had been so long wedded to another and that other a living object but my mother had convinced herself and had no difficulty in convincing him that i was deceived in the strength of my former attachment that she had originally though unconsciously directed my thoughts to him that like a romantic girl i had thought it pretty to be in love and that my fancied passion had been irritated by obstacles but that when once his wife i should find that he alone had ever been the real possessor of my affections it is curious to observe how easily even the most sensible persons can forget and believe according to their wishes my mother had absolutely forgotten the proofs of my strong attachment to seymour which she had once so much deplored she forgot my illness which if not caused was increased by his letter of reproach she forgot the tell tale misery which i had exhibited on the road to oxford and she did not read in the firmness with which i still persisted to see seymour again a secret suspicion of still lingering love but the crisis of our fates was fast approaching i received an invitation to spend the months of may and june in london with a friend who had once resided near us and who had gone to reside in the metropolis i felt a great desire to accept this invitation and my mother kindly permitted me to go but declined going herself saying that it was time i should learn to live without her and she without me accordingly for the first time we were separated but this separation was soon soothed to me by the charms of the life which i was leading i was a new face i was only seventeen and i was said to be the heiress of considerable property this you know was an exaggeration my fortune was handsome but not very large however i was followed and courted but none of my admirers were in my opinion at all equal to seymour or de walden they gratified my vanity but they failed to touch my heart one day at an exhibition i met a newly married lady who when single had been staying in the neighbourhood of my mother's uncle during our last visit and was much admired both by my mother and myself this meeting gave us great pleasure and she hoped i would come and see her at her lodgings i promised that i would but there is nothing like the time present will you go home with me now and spend a quiet day you must come again when my husband is at home and i have a party but he dines out to day and i shall be alone till evening but i am not dressed oh i can send for your things and your maid and such an opportunity as this of telling you all about my love and my marriage may never occur again i was as eager to hear as she was to tell my friend consented to part with me and i accompanied her home in the afternoon while we were expecting two or three ladies of her acquaintance and were preparing to walk with them in the park my friend received a little note from her husband that is so like ridley said she however this is an improvement for he often goes out and invites half a dozen people to dinner without giving me any notice but now he has only invited one man to supper and has sent to let me know they are coming his name i see is the same as yours seymour pendarves is he a cousin of yours what cried i almost gasping for breath seymour pendarves in england and coming hither yes but what is the matter or why are you so agitated if you please i will go home i had rather go home mrs ridley looked at me with wonder and concern but she was too delicate to ask me for the confidence which she saw i was not disposed to give she therefore mildly replied that if i must leave her she would order her servant to attend me a few moments had restored my self possession and i thought that as the time was now arrived when i could by seeing pendarves enable myself to judge of the real state of my heart i should be wrong to run away from the opportunity but pray tell me said i when you expect mr ridley and his friends oh not till it is dark not till near supper time immediately i am ashamed of my girlish folly i had a strong desire to discover whether seymour would recognise my person altered as it was in height and in size and i also wished to get over the first flutter of seeing him without its being perceived by him in consequence i told mrs ridley that seymour was my cousin but that he had not seen me standing since i was grown so very tall and i had a great wish to ascertain whether he would know me therefore said i do not order candles till we have sat a little while mrs ridley smiled fully persuaded that though i might speak the truth i did not speak all the truth i was at liberty in the mean time during our walk in the park to indulge in reverie and to try to strengthen my agitated nerves against the approaching interview but concerning what was i now anxious not so much to ascertain whether i loved him but whether he loved me alas this anxiety was a certain proof that he was still the possessor of my heart and that of course i ought not to be and could not be the wife of de walden just as we stopped at the door on our return from our walk mr ridley was knocking at it accompanied by seymour i felt myself excessively agitated while i pulled my hat and veil over my face to avoid a shower we had crowded into a hackney coach luckily i had not to get out first but judge how i trembled when i found seymour's hand presented to assist me my foot slipped and if he had not caught me in his arms i should have fallen mrs ridley however good naturedly observed that she had been nearly falling herself the step was so bad and her friend miss pen was also very short sighted i now walked up stairs tottering as i went fanny whispered mr ridley to his wife who is she she told him i was a miss pen and she would tell him more by and by pray fanny when do you mean to have candles said mr ridley not yet not till we go to take off our bonnets i like this light it is so pleasant to the eyes yes and so cheap too replied her husband but i wonder you should like this sort of light fanny for you are far removed yet from that period of life when le petit jour is so favourable to beauty you are still young enough to bear the searching light of broad eyed day and so i trust are all the ladies present though i must own a veil is always a suspicious circumstance he added coming up to me yes yes said his wife i always suspect a veil is worn to conceal something but it may be worn in mercy he added and perhaps it is so here if i may judge of what is hidden by what is shown if i may form an opinion indeed from that hand and arm on which youth and beauty are so legibly written i here confused and almost provoked i drew on my gloves and mrs ridley who loved fun whispered her husband do not go on she is quite ugly scarred with the confluent small pox blear eyed and hideous you will be surprised when you see her face she then begged to speak to me and as i walked across the room in which we sat to join her in the next i saw ridley whisper pendarves may be so he replied but her figure and form are almost the finest i ever saw and yet i am so very tall said i to myself with a joy that vibrated through my frame the conversation now became general and on a lady's being mentioned who had married a second husband before the first had been dead quite a year pendarves to my consternation began a violent philippic against women declaring that scarcely one of us was capable of a persevering attachment that the best and dearest of husbands might be forgotten in six months and that those men only could expect to be happy who laid their plans for happiness independently of woman's love it is strange but true that the indignation which this speech excited in me enabled me to conquer at once the agitation which had hitherto kept me silent coming hastily forward i exclaimed while he rose respectfully is it for you mr seymour pendarves to hold such language as this have you forgotten lady helen your own blessed mother and her friend and yours so saying while he stood confounded self judged and full of wonder for the voice and manner were mine but the height and figure were no longer so i left the room and a violent burst of tears relieved my oppressed heart mrs ridley then rang for a candle and considerately left me to myself oh the flutter of that moment when i re entered the drawing room which i found brilliantly lighted up seymour who had i found now doubted and now believed the evidence of his ears in opposition to that of his sight was standing at the window but he turned hastily round at my entrance and our eyes instantly met helen exclaimed he springing forward to meet me while my hand was extended toward him and i believe my countenance was equally encouraging that yielded hand was pressed by turns to his lips and his heart but still we neither of us spoke and seymour suddenly disappeared mr ridley who was that melancholy thing to other people a professed joker to my great relief as it enabled me to recover myself now came up to me bowing respectfully and begged me to veil my face again for he saw that my excessive ugliness had been too much for his poor friend and he hoped for his sake as well as that of the rest of mankind i would conceal myself from sight i told him when his friend came back i would consider of his proposition and if he approved it i would veil directly before seymour returned i asked mr ridley whether he suspected who his presuming monitor was pray madam he archly replied say that word again what are you to mr pendarves i said 'monitor' oh monitor i thought you were something to him but did not exactly know what no wonder he was so alarmed at sight of you for monitors i believe have a right to chastise their pupils and i begin now to fear he will not come back do you use the ferule or the rod miss pendarves you have not yet answered my question sir oh i forgot 'heavens' cried he as you closed the door 'is it possible could that be my cousin helen pendarves yes it could be no other and yet' is that like him madam oh very 'well' i in the simplicity of my heart replied 'your cousin she may be but my wife told me her name was pen' 'oh yes it must be helen it was her own sweet voice and manner' 'she is given to scolding then is she' said i 'oh' said he 'she is' but i will spare your blushes madam though i must own that i could not believe you were the lady in question because my wife told me you were hideous to behold and he said you were a beauty besides when he last saw you he added you were thin and short but then he eagerly observed that a year and a half made a great difference sometimes and you had not met during that period but here comes the gentleman to answer your questions himself what i further said did not at all please him no what was it sir that if you were indeed miss helen pendarves you were a great nuisance for that you had won and broken at least a dozen hearts but that it was a comfort to know you would soon be removed from the power of doing further mischief as you were going to be married to a swiss gentleman and would soon leave the kingdom and you told him this cried i turning very faint yes i did and he had just turned away from me when you made your appearance seymour now entered the room and i was from this conversation at no loss to account for the gloom which overspread his countenance while he hoped miss pendarves was well my dear fanny said mr ridley who must have his joke i hope you will make proper apologies to this gentleman and me for having exposed us to such a horrible surprise as the sight of that lady's face has given us pray was this ungenerous plan of concealment miss pendarves's or yours her's entirely but what was her motive she wished to see whether her cousin would know her through her veil oh she was acting clara in the duenna you know she plays don ferdinand some such trick true but ferdinand and clara were lovers not cousins cannot cousins be lovers fanny here the entrance of the servant with supper interrupted the conversation and seymour and i sat down to it with what appetite we could it is astonishing said mr ridley what use and habit can effect i have already conquered my horror at sight of your friend's face and i see mr pendarves has not only done the same but i suspect he is meditating a drawing of it to send to the royal society as a lusus naturae in spite of himself seymour smiled at this speech and replied while i looked very foolish that he was gazing at me with wonder as he could not conceive how i had gained so many inches in height since he saw me i grew several inches after my fever i replied fever when where what fever helen i never heard you were ill oh yes i was and my life was despaired of you in danger helen and i never knew it it was really very unkind said ridley to keep such a delightful piece of intelligence from you but when was it dear helen when i saw you on the road to oxford i was only just recovered only just recovered you did not look ill but i remember you had your veil down so i really did not see your face so so wearing her veil down is a common thing with her is it i am glad she is so considerate these jokes however had their use for they tended to keep under the indulgence of feelings which required to be restrained in both of us in the presence of others but when were you first seized helen and what brought on your fever said seymour as if urged by some secret consciousness you will not wonder that i blushed and even stammered as i answered i was not quite well when i saw you in the church and and and what i was seized that night and when my mother returned she found me very ill indeed that night here he started from his seat ah fanny cried mr ridley you would buy them i always objected to them buy what my dear ridley these chairs i always said they were such uneasy ones no one could sit on them long you see mr pendarves can't endure them i was very glad when seymour sat down again when he did he leaned his elbows on the table and gazed in my face as if he would have read the very bottom of my soul but hope seemed to have supplanted despair mr ridley now suddenly rose and holding his hand to his side cried oh in such a comic yet pathetic manner that though his wife really believed he was in pain she could not help laughing then seizing a candle he went oh ing and limping out of the room leaning on her arm and declaring he believed he must go to bed if we would excuse him there was no mistaking his motive and seymour was not slow to profit by the opportunity thus good naturedly offered him helen he exclaimed seating himself by me and seizing my hand is what i heard true am i the most wretched of men is this hand promised to de walden no not yet promised then you mean to give it to him certainly not now why that emphasis on now because i am sure i do not love him sufficiently and since when have you found this out i did not answer but my tell tale silence emboldened him to put his own interpretation on what i had said and now for the first time unrestrained by any unwelcome witness he passionately pleaded the interests of his own love and drew from me an open confession of mine nor was there long a secret of my heart which was withheld from him and while he rejoiced over the certainty that his rival's hopes were destroyed by this interview i rejoiced in hearing that the conviction he had received of my affection for him had preserved him from temptations to which he would probably otherwise have yielded but they are returning cried he tell me where you are and promise to see me to morrow my own precious helen never never was i so happy before nor i i could have added but i believe my eyes spoke for me and i promised to see him the next day at eleven he had just time to resume his chair when mr and mrs ridley returned i have been very unwell said ridley and am so still but i would come back as she would not leave me because i was sure what with the uneasy chairs and miss pen's ugly face you would be so fretted mr pendarves that you would never come hither again 'but then my dear' said fanny 'you forget they are relations and must love each other' 'that i deny' said i 'if they are not both loveable' 'and then' says she 'they have not met for so long a time and have so much to say' 'i don't believe that' says i 'if so they would have taken care to meet sooner' but pray what has happened to you both since we went away well i declare such roses on cheeks and diamonds in eyes and i protest miss pen has learnt to look straight forward and is all dimples and smiles and this too when for aught you both knew i might be dying seymour and i were now too happy not to be disposed to laugh at any absurdity which ridley uttered and never before or since did i pass so merry an evening seymour was as gay and delightful as nature intended him to be you will own that the word fascinating seemed made on purpose to express him and i as he has since told me appeared to him to exceed in personal appearance that evening animated as i was with the consciousness of loving and being beloved all the promises of my early youth nor could he help saying really helen i cannot but look at you that is very evident observed ridley yes but i mean that i look at her because because you cannot help it and it requires no apology i have a tendency to the same weakness myself but i mean you are so surprisingly altered so grown so say no more my dear sir cried ridley interrupting him for it must mortify the young lady to see how much she has outgrown your knowledge and your liking and she is such a disgrace to your family that it is a pity there is no chance for her changing her name poor thing those blear eyes must prevent that i see very clearly indeed she is likely to die helen pendarves this observation much to ridley's sorrow evidently clouded over the brows of us both for we both thought of my mother and i of poor de walden but the cloud soon passed away for we were together we were assured of each other's love and we were happy nor did we hear the watchman call past one o'clock without as much surprise as pain however pendarves walked home with me and that walk was not less interesting than the evening had been but alas my mother's image awaited me on my pillow i could not help mourning over the blighted hopes of de walden nor could i drive from my startled fancy the suspicion that i had committed a breach of duty in receiving and returning vows unsanctioned by her permission or satisfy my conscience that i had done right in allowing him to call on me the next day but i quieted myself by resolving that i would instantly write to my mother tell her what had passed and see seymour only that once till she gave me her permission to see him more frequently he came at eleven and i told him what i meant to do he fully approved but declared he would not consent to meet evil more than half way and give up seeing me on the contrary he was resolved to see me every day till she came and as mr pendarves our uncle was just come to his house in town he meant to tell him how we were situated and he was very sure that he would approve our meeting as much as possible on leaving me he proceeded to lay his case before our uncle while i sat down to write to my mother it was a long letter bathed with my tears for was i not now pleading almost for life and death if i loved pendarves when my affection was not fed by his professions of mutual love how must that flame be now increased in fervour when i had heard him plead his cause two days successively and had enjoyed with him hours of the tenderest uninterrupted intercourse wisely had my mother acted in forbidding us to meet as she wished to annihilate our partiality for absence and distance are the best preventives if not the certain cures of love my letter which was full of passion regrets apologies and pity for de walden was scarcely finished when i was told that a gentleman who was going immediately into warwickshire and would pass close by my mother's door would take charge of it i foolishly confided it to his care i say foolishly because the post was a surer conveyance however i could not foresee that this gentleman would fall ill on the road that he would not deliver my packet till ten days after it was written and that i was therefore allowed to spend many hours with pendarves unprohibited for my uncle approved our meeting and desired our union declaring that he had always thought my mother severe in her judgment of his nephew and that while considering the fancied interests of her own child she had disregarded his besides added he i am the head of the family and i command you to meet as often and to love as much as ever you choose alas i obeyed him only too well though my judgment was not blinded to the certainty that he had no rights which could invalidate those of my mother and though i rejoiced at not receiving her command to cease to receive pendarves i was beginning to feel uneasy at her silence when a letter from her reached me saying she was on her road to london where she would arrive that night and should take up her abode with our friend mr nelson never before had i been parted from my mother and till i met pendarves i had longed for her every day during my stay in london but now self reproved and ashamed i felt that a yet dearer object had acquired possession of my thoughts and wishes and the once devoted child dreaded rather than desired to be re united to one of the best of mothers she came and we met again as we had parted with tears but the nature of those tears was altered and neither of us would have liked to analyze the difference long and painful was the conversation we had together that night before we attempted to sleep i found my mother fully convinced that there was a necessity for my not marrying de walden a necessity of which he was now himself convinced for she had gone round by cambridge in order to see him but she was not equally convinced that there was a necessity for my marrying pendarves as all her objections to that marriage remained in the fullest force the next morning she opened her heart on the subject to mrs nelson who was seymour's warm advocate and assured her that if she made proper inquiries she would find that the character of pendarves was universally spoken of as unexceptionable and that whatever might have been the errors of the youth they were forgotten by other people in the merits of the man ay but a mother's heart can't forget them she exclaimed when her child's happiness is at stake and she begged to have no private conversation with seymour till the next day in consequence she saw him only in a party at my uncle's where she was struck with the great improvement both of his face and person for both now wore the appearance of health and the countenance which when she last surveyed it bore the stamp of sickness and sorrow now beamed with all the vivacity of youth and hope the party was a mixed one of cards and dancing and as she gazed on pendarves when he stood talking to me he recalled forcibly to her mind the image of my father as she first beheld him in a similar scene four and twenty years before the next day seymour obtained the desired interview with my mother she brought forward his former errors in array against him his debts his dissipations and his love of play and though she expressed her readiness to believe him reformed still as he ingenuously admitted that his improvement was chiefly owing to my influence over him she could not deem it sufficiently well founded to obviate her objections and he was still pleading and she objecting when mr pendarves insisted on entering mrs nelson and i accompanied him i tell you what niece said he you do not use this young man well you bring up a parcel of old tales and dwell upon the naughtiness of them as if he was the only young man who ever erred i know all his sins he has made me his confessor in the affair to which you allude he was much more to be pitied than censured and yielded at seventeen to temptations which might have overcome seven and thirty since then he has distinguished himself at college he has paid all his old debts and incurred no new ones he has steered clear of the quicksands of foreign travel shielded as he says by the hopes of one day possessing helen and by the idea that he was the object of her love and what would you have more besides helen tells me he once saved her life i did so cried seymour eagerly seizing her hands i did so and you promised to be for ever grateful how was it my dear nephew i will tell you sir cried i gathering hope from my mother's agitation it was at the isle of wight soon after we came to england he and i were playing on the shore and i not knowing the tide was coming in paddled across a run of water to what i called a pretty little island and there amused myself with picking up sea weed when the sea flowed in and he saw that i must perish no one was near us luckily he spied a boat on the dry land which with all his boyish strength he pushed off to my assistance and jumped into it in one minute more it floated towards me just as my cries had reached the ears of my mother who was reading on the rock and who now saw my situation helen helen cried my mother i can't bear it the scene was too horrible to recall but i persevered seymour seized my hand just as i was sinking and dragged me into the boat but in another moment the waves came swelling round us and without oar or help i and my preserver were both tossed to and fro upon the ocean helen cried seymour with great feeling and clasping me fondly to his heart i could almost wish we then had died for then we should have died together go on said my uncle i hope you will live together yet i have not much more to tell except that my mother's screams had now procured assistance and a boat was sent out to follow our uncertain course when we were overtaken they found seymour holding me on his lap and crying over me in agony unutterable for he thought that i was dead and he had come too late who can paint my mother's transports when she received me safe and living in her arms and how she embraced me helen cried seymour and called me her noble boy the preserver of her child for she saw all i had done and how she owned she should ever love me as her own child and vowed her gratitude should end but with her life it never will end but with my life cried my mother throwing herself on seymour's neck but is your having saved my child's life an argument for my authorizing you to risk the happiness of that life julia julia i am ashamed of you cried my uncle was there ever a better or more devoted wife than yourself yet what did you do at helen's age you ran away from your parents out of an ungovernable passion for a handsome young man but is my error an excuse or justification of his no but you are a proof that error can be atoned for and never repeated as you have been a model for wives and mothers but beware mrs pendarves of carrying things too far beware lest you tempt helen and seymour to copy your example rather than conform to your precepts ha cried my mother clasping her hands in agony now then said seymour with every symptom of deep emotion the moment is come when i am authorized to obey the commands of the beloved dead and fulfil the last injunctions of my mother a pause which no one seemed inclined to break followed this unexpected observation and seymour taking a letter from his bosom kissed it and presented it to my mother 'tis helen's hand cried she and her seal too you observe said seymour the envelope you perceive is addressed to me and i have therefore broken it the other is entire my mother read the envelope to herself and these were its contents my conscience reproaches me my beloved son with having too lightly surrendered your rights and probably your wishes in giving my friend back her promise to promote your union with her daughter as i know julia's ability to act up to her strict sense of a mother's duty even at the expense of her own happiness and risk of her child's safety but i have given up that promise which might have pleaded for you my poor child when i was no more and ensured to you opportunities of securing helen's affections which may now perhaps be for ever denied to you however i may be mistaken therefore if helen's affections should ever be yours avowedly yours and her mother still withhold her consent give her the enclosed letter and probably the voice of the dead may have more power over her than that of the living for your sake i have thus written with a trembling hand and with a dying pulse but value it as a last proof of that affection which can end only with my life helen pendarves the letter to my mother was as follows i speak to you from the grave my dearest julia and in behalf of that child on whom my soul doted while on earth but this letter will not be given you till he is assured he possesses the heart of your daughter and when if your consent is denied to their union nothing but an act of disobedience can make them happy in each other are you prepared julia to expose them to such a risk and thus tempt the child you love to the crime of disobedience that crime which though it dwelt but lightly on your mind weighed upon mine through the whole of my existence as it helped to plunge my mother in an untimely tomb perhaps you flatter yourself that helen's education has fortified her against indulging her passion at the expense of her duty but remember that your precepts are forcibly counteracted by your example anxious however as i am that helen should not err i am still more anxious that my son should not lead her into error as i feel that he is doubly armed against her filial piety by the example of her mother and his own and must my crime be thus perpetuated by those whom i hold most dear must the misery of my life be renewed perhaps in that of her whom i have loved as my own child and must my son be the cause of wretchedness to the dearest of my friends through the medium of her daughter forbid it heaven i conjure you my beloved julia by our past love by tanta fede e si dolce memorie e si lungo costume listen to this my warning my supplicating voice and let your consent give dignity and happiness to the union of our children helen pendarves my mother after having read this letter covered her face with her hands and rushed out of the room it was in a state of anxious suspense that we awaited her return when she appeared her eyes were swelled but her countenance was calm her look resigned and her deportment as usual dignified her assumed composure however failed again when her eyes met those of pendarves my son cried she opening her arms to him into which seymour threw himself as much affected as she was then beckoning me to her she put my hand in his and prayed god to bless our union little of this part of my life remains to be told my mother had given her consent and in two months from that period we were married here ends my narrative of a woman's love when next i treat of it it will be as united to a wife's duty
