harper brothers publishers illustrations lets go and have a look at it bootles proud of his new accomplishment lifted the child awkwardly in his arms i cant condemn that helpless thing to the workhouse mignons ownillustration mrs gray rose and went close to him laying her hand upon his arm but lacy was already on the ground and caught miss mignon out of harms way what a lot of medals youve got in another moment they had drawn up at the great gothic doorway lacy was occupied in making desperate love to the russian lady then with one imploring backward look she went away and left him alone he dropped into a chair and took her in his arms the swarming crowd round the other was watching a more exciting race than that which they had just witnessed a race between life and death bootles watched themthe two things he loved best on earth chapter i it was considerably after midnight when one of three officers seated at a whisttable in the messroom of the cavalry barracks at idleminster where the scarlet lancers were quartered called out bootles come and take a handtheres a good chap captain algernon ferrers more commonly known as bootles looked up i dont mind if i do he said rising and moving towards them what do you want me to do whos my partner the three other men stared at one another in surprise for bootles was one of the best whistplayers in the regiment and in an ordinary way would as soon have thought of counting honors as of settling the questions of partners other than by cutting except in the case of a revenge why take a card of course my friend laughed lacy in a ridiculously soft voice lacy was a recent importation from the white dragoons and had taken possession of the place left vacant in bootless everyday life by scott lauries marriage ah yes to be surecut of course i believe said bootles looking at the three faces before him in an uncertain wayi believe ive got a headache oh nothing like whist for a headache answered hartog turning up the last card ace of diamonds however after stumbling through one gameafter twice trumping his partners trick a revoke and several such like blundershe rose to his feet its no use you fellows im no good tonighti cant even see the cards get some one to take my place and make a fresh start why youre ill bootles cried preston what is it its a devil of a headache answered bootles promptly heres milesthe very man goodnight goodnight called the fellows after him then they settled down to their game and preston dealt never saw bootles seedy before said lacy oh yes he gets these headaches sometimes answered hartog not often though miles your lead meantime bootles went wearily away almost feeling his road under the veranda of the messrooms along the broad pav in front of the officers quarters and up the wide flight of stone steps to his rooms facing the green of the barrack square being the senior captain with only one bachelor fieldofficer in the regiment he had two large and pleasant rooms not very grandly furnished for though a rich man he was not an extravagant one and saw no fun in having costly goods and chattels to be at the tender mercies of soldier servants but they were neat clean and comfortable with a sufficiency of great easy travellingchairs plenty of fur rugs and lots of pretty little pictures and knickknacks the fire in his sittingroom was fast dying out but a bright and cheerful blaze illumined his sleepingroom shining on the brass knobs of his cot on the silver ornamentations at the corners of his dressingcase on three or four scent bottles on the tall cretonnepetticoated toilette table and on the tired but resplendent figure of bootles himself he dragged the big chair pretty near to the fire and dropped into it with a sigh of relief absolutely too sick and weary to think about getting into bed just then as hartog had said sometimes these headaches seized him but it did not happen often in fact he had not had one for more than a yearquite often enough he said well he had been lying in the big and easy chair his eyes shut and his hands hanging idly over the broad straps which served for arms for perhaps half an hour when to his surprise he heard a soft rustling movement behind him his first and not unnatural thought was that the fellows had come to draw him so without moving he called out oh confound it all dont come boring a poor devil with a headache by jove its cruelty to animals neither more nor less the soft rustling ceased and bootles closed his eyes again with a devout prayer that they would in response to this appeal take themselves off but presently it began again accompanied by a sound which made his heart jump almost into his mouth and beat so furiously as to be simply suffocating it stoppedwas repeatedthedevil muttered bootles but it was not the devil at allmore like a little angel in truth for after a moments irresolution he sprang from his chair and faced the horror behind him it really was a horror to him for there sitting up among the pillows of the cot with the clothes pushed back was a baby a baby whose short golden curls shone in the firelighta little child dressed in white with a pair of wideopen wondering eyes as bright as stars and as blue as sapphires bootles stood in dismay staring at it where in the name of all thats wonderful did you come from he asked aloud keeping at a safe distance lest it should suddenly start howling but the little stranger did not howl on the contrary as its bewildered eyes fell upon bootless resplendent figure his goldlaced scarlet jacket and goldembroidered waistcoat of white velvet his goldlaced overalls and jingling spurs it stretched out its little arms and cried boo boo boo bootles took a step back in his surprise and his headache vanished as if by magic byjove he exclaimed boobooboo crowed the usurper of the cot cheerily bootles went a step nearer why youre a queer little beggar he remarked where did you come from eh the queer little beggar suddenly changed its tone and started another system of crowing more triumphant and cheery than the first chuckachuckachuckachuck it went bootles began to laugh cant talk hey well what do you want as it struggled fiercely to rise and stretched out its small arms more impatiently than before want to be lifted up hey oh but dash it scratching his head perplexedly i cant lift you up you know its out of the questionimpossible by jove i might let you drop and smash you chuckachuckachucka boooooo gobbled the baby as if it were the best joke in the world bootles positively roared you dont mind well come along then approaching very gingerly and wondering where he should begin to get hold of it so to speak the baby soon settled that question holding out its arms towards his neck then somehow he gathered it up and carried it in doubt and trepidation to the big chair by the fire where the creature sat contentedly upon his knee the curly golden head resting against his scarlet jacket the soft fingers of one baby hand tight twined round one of his the other picking and wandering aimlessly about the scrolls and curves of the gold embroidery on his waistcoat by jove youre a jolly little chap said bootles just as if it could understand him but the question is where did you come from and whats to be done with you you cant stop here you know the babes big blue eyes raised themselves to his and the fingers which had been twined round his made a grab at his watchchain gargargarrrah it remarked in such evident delight that bootles laughed again oh you like it do you well youre a queer little beggar no mistake about that i wonder whom you belong to and where you live when you are at home cant be a barrack childtoo daintylooking and not slobbery enough and this dresstaking hold of the richly embroidered white skirtthis must have cost a lot and its all lace too he knew what embroidery cost by his own mess waistcoats and his tunics then not only was the dress of the child of a very costly description but its sleeves were tied up with cambridge blue ribbons that were evidently new and its waist was encircled by a broad sash of the same material and tint altogether it was just such a child as he was occasionally called upon to admire in the houses of his married brother officers yet that any lady in the regiment would lend her baby for a whole night to a set of harumscarum young fellows for the purpose of playing a trick on a brother officer was manifestly absurd and besides that bootles was so goodnatured and such a favorite with the ladies of the regiment that he thought he knew all their babies by sight and he became afraid that this one was indeed a little stranger in the land welcome or unwelcome yet if it was the fellows doing where had they got it and if it was not the fellows doing why should any one leave a baby asleep in his cot the whole thing was inexplicable just then the child in playing with his chain slipped a little on the smooth cloth of his overalls and bootles with a whoa whoa my lad hauled it up again in doing so he felt a piece of paper rustle somewhere about the embroidered skirt a note this grows melodramatic said bootles craning his head to find it oh here we are now we shall see the note was written in a firm large yet thoroughly feminine hand and ran thus you will not absolve me from my oath of secrecy respecting our marriage though now that i have offended you i may starve or go to the workhouse i cannot break my oath though you have broken all yours but i am determined that you shall acknowledge your child i am going to leave her tonight in your rooms with her clothes by midnight i shall be out of the country i do this because i have obtained a good situation and because when i reach my destination i shall have spent my last shilling i give you fair warning however that if you desert the child or fail to acknowledge her i will break my oath and proclaim our marriage if you engage a nurse she will not be much trouble she is a good and sweettempered child and i have called her mary after your dear mother oh how she would pity me if she could see me now farewell from that moment bootles absolved the fellows from any share in the affair but what to do with the child he had not the least idea it is the very devil he said aloud watching the busy fingers still playing with his chain he gathered it awkwardly in his arms and rose to look for the clothing spoken of in the letter yes there it was a parcel of goodly size wrapped in a stout brown paper cover and on the chair beside his cot lay the outdoor garments of a young childa white coat bordered with fur a furtrimmed cap and some other things which bootles did not quite understand the use of white wool fingerless gloves at least he did not know what else they could be and some longer things of the same class like stockings without feet bootles shook his head bewilderingly mother means it to stop i dont know what to do he said helplessly it occurred to him then that perhaps some of the fellows might be able to make a suggestion he did not know what to do with the child for the night nor for the matter of that what to do with it for the moment he had the sense not to take it out into the chill midnight air and when he attempted to put it back into the cot it rebelled clinging to his watchchain with might and main well have it then he said slipping it off the baby pleased with the glittering toy set up a cry of delight and bootles took the opportunity of slipping out he entered the anteroom with a very rueful face finding it pretty much as he had left it lacy was the first to catch sight of him halloo bootles whats the mattah he asked is your head worse my head oh i forgot all about it bootles replied but i say im in a mess theres a baby in my room a what they cried with one voice a baby repeated bootles dismally alive asked lacy with his head on one side alive oh very very much so and means to stop for it has brought its entire wardrobe and a letter of introduction with it holding the letter for any one to take who chose it was lacy who did so and he asked if he should read it up yes do said bootles dropping into a chair with a groan perhaps some one else will own to it so lacy read the letter in his ridiculous drawl of a voice and ceased amid profound silencefaahwell well said bootles finding no one seemed inclined to speak well well said preston solemnly if you want my opinion bootles i think you ought to be ashamed of yourself a general laugh followed but bootles protested oh dont imagine its me ive nothing to do with it i shouldnt have come to you fellows if i had no no of course not returned miles promptly but with an air which raised another shout then its a plant announced preston in a tone of conviction of course its a plant cried bootles but why in the wide world should it be planted on me why indeed echoed miles feelingly besides bootles continued some of you know my mother and that her name was not mary but margaret now as several of those present had known lady margaret ferrers very well that was a strong point in favor of prestons assertion that the affair was a plant the chief question however was what could be done with the little stranger for that night some woman of course must look after it but who it was then after two oclock and the lights had been out hours ago in the married peoples quarters bootles did not know what to do and said so is it in your room now preston asked yes where did you find it in my cot the devil you did i wonder you werent frightened out of your very wits i nearly was bootles admitted did you see it at once was it howling howling not a bit of it never saw a jollier little beggar in all my life oh ejaculated miles blankly i say you fellows dont that sound to you very much like the proud papah you fellows all laughed at this even perplexed bootles and hartog asked a question did you see it directly bootles oh no not for half an hour or more what on earth did you do why i looked at it of course what would you have done did you touch it bootles laughed yes by jove the little beggar came to me like a bird great gods uttered miles and you can doubt the fatherliness of that oh what an ass you are returned hartog then as if by a bright inspiration suggested i say lets go and have a look at it thereupon the assembled officers five of them trooped along the way bootles had stumbled over alone in the blindness of his now forgotten headache the baby was still in the cot contentedly playing with the watch and chain and at the sight of the five resplendent figures it set up a loud booboobooing followed by a chuckachuckachuckaing evidently it considered this was the land of goshen seems to take after its mother in its love for a scarlet jacket remarked miles sententiously ive heard that the child is father of the manseems of the woman too bootles said lacy gravely isnt it very pwretty yes poor little beggar lets see you nurse it cried hartog so bootles proud of this new accomplishment lifted the child awkwardly in his arms pretty much as he might have done if it had been a sackful of eggs and he had made a wager he wouldnt break one of them he carried it to the fire picture lets go and have a look at it just light the candles one of you he said its the image of bootles persisted miles well it isnt mine except by deed of gift returned bootles with a laugh bootles said lacy look back over your past life here he made a pause well said bootles expectantly twry to think if you can twrace any likeness to some early love who may have marwriedor for that matter not have marwriedsome one else anderwremembering your kind heartfor you have a dashed kind heart bootles theres no denying itmay have found herself hard up or too much encumberedforeryou know a babay is sometimes an awkward addition to a ladys belongingsand may have twrusted to yourergeneralwell shall we say softness of chawracter to see it well pwrovided forersee no i dont of course i see what you mean but i cant weller lacy broke in ierpewraps was not thinking so much of your case as of my own you see appealing to the other three the advent of thiserbabay cwreates a precedent anderif it should chance to occur to my first loveit would be awkwardfor me very awkward her name plunging headlong into a story they all knew was naomi andersheerin fact jilted me for an elephantine parson whose reverend name waserfligg solomon fligg now if mrsersolomon fligg was to take it into her head to pack up theereleven little fliggs and send em to meit would be what i should call awkwarddevilish awkward lacys four hearers positively roared and the baby on bootless knee chuckled and crowed with delight i believe it understands preston laughed no but it seems a jolly little chap answered bootles oh i forgot tis a girl i say i do wish you fellows would advise me what to do how can i get any one to attend to it oh roll it up in the bedclothes and sleep on the sofa it will go to sleep when its tired said one with its clothes on said bootles doubtfully i rather fancy they undress babies when they put em to bed i dont advise you to try oh it wont hurt for tonight picture bootles proud of his new accomplishment lifted the child awkwardly in his arms theres a cab just driven up i believe its the grays i saw them go out dressed before dinner said hartog the grays were the adjutant and his wife who lived in barracks she would help you in a minute oh go and see theres a good chap bootles cried eagerly hartog therefore went out he found that it was the adjutant with his wife returning from a party and to the lady he addressed himself oh mrs gray bootles is in such trouble he began in troublebootlescaptain ferrers she said what is the matter well hes got a baby hartog answered got what mrs gray cried a baby its been left in his rooms clothes and all and bootles dont know what the de what in the world i mean to do with it shall i go in and see it mrs gray asked i wish you would some of the others are there well eventually mrs gray carried off the little stranger to her own quarters and put it to bed as for bootles he too went to bed but during the whole of that blessed night he never slept a wink chapter ii when bootles showed his face in the messroom the following morning he was greeted by such a volley of chaff as would have driven a more nervous man or one less of a favorite than himself to despair already the story had gone the round of the barracks and bootles found the greater part of his brother officers ready and willing to take miless view of the affair whether in chaff or downright good earnest he could not say halloo bootles my man shouted one when he entered whats this story we hear is it possible that bootlesour immaculate and philanthropical bootles oh bootles bootles how are the mighty fallen hey inquired bootles sweetly i wouldnt have believed it of you bootles i wouldnt indeed any other fellow in the regimentthat softheaded lacy grinning over there for instancebut our bootles he broke off as if words could not express the volumes he thought but found his tongue and went on again before bootles could open his mouth our bootles with an unacknowledged wife sworn not to disclose her marriageour bootles with a babyour bootles a papa oh lor why didnt you manage better bootles cried another you might have sent her an odd fiver now and then you have plenty is she pretty bootles asked a third was there by any chance a flaw in the marriage inquired a fourth do you think im a fool asked bootles pleasantly i tell you its a plant i know nothing about the creature just my view struck in miles just what i said last night its absurd you know to expect him to own it no fellow would besides does bootles look like the father of a fine bouncing baby that goes chucka chucka chuck its absurd you know even bootles joined in the laugh which followed and miles continued the only thing isand it really is awkward for bootlesthe extraordinary likeness blue eyes golden hair fair complexion i should say myselflooking at his comrade critically that at the same age bootles was just such a baby as that which turned up so mysteriously last night thats as may be any way the youngster is not mine said bootles emphatically and what to do with the little beggar i dont know send it back to its mother suggested dawson but i dont know who the mother is bootles answered impatiently oh no so you say well then the brat must have growed like topsy if i were you i should send it to the policestation the policestation oh no hang it all the poor little beggar has done nothing to start the world in that way bootles answered did any of you asked miles of the general company ever hear of a chap called solomon ierdid answered lacy promptly his other name waserfligg the reverend solomon fligg oh weve all heard of him but i meant a rather more celebrated person there is a story about himi rather think its in proverbseliciting a yell of laughter not proverbs well perhaps its in the song of solomon its about two mothers who each had a baby and one of them managed to smother hers in the night and finding it dead when she woke up in the morning claimed the other baby of course the other woman kicked up a row a regular shindy and they came before solomon to get the matter settled both claim it said he oh chop it in half and let each have a share but you all know the rest how the real mother gave up her claim sooner than see the child halved now in this case you see bootles hasnt the heart to send the child off to the policestation as he would if heres the colonel said some one at this point and in less than two seconds he appeared why ferrers he said ive been hearing a queer tale about you yes sir said bootles dismally and where it will end i dont know here am i saddled well of course you know whether the child has any claim upon you the colonel began upon my honor it has not colonel said bootles earnestly then that of course settles the question replied the colonel with a frown at the grinning faces along the table i should send the child to the workhouse immediately the workhouse repeated bootles reflectively ill bet any one a fiver he dont murmured miles to his neighbors not he madame la mre knew what she was doing when she picked out bootles hell get one of the sergeants wives to look after it see if he dont after the chief had left the room bootles continued his breakfast in silence considering the two suggestions for the disposal of the child now if the truth be told bootles had a horror of workhouses he had gone deeply into the casual question and pitied a tramp from the very inmost recesses of his kind heart it fairly made him sick to think of that bonny golden head growing up among the shorn and unlovely locks of a pauper broodto think of the little soft fingers that had twined themselves so confidently about his own and had picked at the embroideries of his mess waistcoat being slapped by the matron or set as soon as they should be strong enough to do coarse and hard work to develop into the unnaturally widened and unkempt hand of a marchionessto think of that little dainty thing being nourished on skilly or on whatever hard fare pauper children are fedto think of that little aristocrat being brought up among the children of thieves and vagabonds oh confound it all he broke out i cant i never expected you could retorted miles it wouldnt be natural if you did this time bootles did not laugh on the contrary he looked up and regarded miles with a grave and searching gaze rather disconcerting to that quizzical young gentleman are you judging me out of your own bushel he asked how what do you mean miles stammered do you happen to know anything of the matter bootles persisted i oh no on my honor i dont ah as the colonel said just now that settles the question youre a very witty fellow miles very i shouldnt wonder after a while if you aint quite the sharp man of the regiment only your jokes are like the clowns jokes at the circusone gets to know them theyre in this kind of way ever been in paris mr lando yes of course bell ever been in vienna mr lando to be sure bell ever been in geneva mr lando of course i have bell ever been in jail mr lando of course i have bellat leastthats to sayi meanno of course i havent why mr lando i saw you there you saw me in jail bell and what were you doing to see me oh grandly i was staying with the governor for the good of my ealth and hadnt stealing a cow something to do with it eh bell yah who stole a watch a jersey cow eh bell yah what time is it mr lando just about milking time bell my friend its all very funny once you know miles bootles ended disdainfully but when youve been to the circus half a dozen times you dont see anything to laugh at somehow for graces sake miles was obliged to laugh for every one else roared except bootles who went on speaking very gravely i know its very amusing to make a joke of the affair to say i know more about it than i will confess i have told the colonel on my honor that the child is not mine nor do i know whose it is if it were mine i should not have made the story public propertyits not in reason that i should my difficulty is what to do with it the colonel suggests the workhouse dawson the policestationone simply means the other and i cant bring me to do it it is an awful thing for the child of a tramp or a thief to be reared in a workhouseand this is no common persons child for anything i know it may belong to one of you thats true enough observed a man who had not yet taken part in the discussion except to laugh now and then but remember bootles if you saddle yourself with the child you will have to go on with it it will stick to you like a burr and though we are all ready to accept your word of honor the world may not be so if you put the brat out to nurse in the regiment the story may crop up years hence just when you least desire or expect it and you know a storymixed and confused by time and repetitionabout a deserted wife may come to have a very ugly sound about it now if as the colonel suggests you send the child to the workhouse you wash your hands of the whole business then again if the brat is brought up in the regiment with the disadvantage of your protection what will she be in twenty years time neither fish flesh nor good red herring far better the oblivion of pauperism than the distinction among the men of being captain ferrerssshall we say protge yes theres a great deal in that bootles admitted he had at all times a great respect for harkness and profound faith in the soundness of his judgment he saw at once that any plan of bringing the child up among the married people of the regiment would not do and yetthe workhouse he rose from the table and settled his forage cap upon his head i dare say you fellows will laugh at me he said almost desperately as he pulled the chinstrap over his mustache but i cant condemn that helpless thing to the workhousei cant and thats all about it it seems to me he went on rubbing the end of his whip on the back of a chair and looking at no oneit seems to me that the childs future in this world and the next depends upon the course i take now and you may laugh at mei dare say you will he said quite nervously for himbut i shall get a proper nurse to take charge of it and i shall keep it myself until some one turns up to claim itoror for good picture i cant condemn that helpless thing to the workhouse just then officerscall sounded and bootles made a clean bolt of it leaving his brother officers staring amazedly at one another the first of them to make a move was lacythe first too to speak upon my soul said he bootles is a devilish fine fellow and d it all he added getting very red and scarcely drawling in his intense rage of admiration if there were a few more fellows in the world like him it would be a vewry diffewrent place to what it is chapter iii as soon as bootles had a spare moment he made his way to the adjutants quarters where he found mrs gray playing with the mysterious baby oh is that you captain ferrers she exclaimed come and see your waif she is the dearest little thing why i do believe she knows you bootles whistled to the child which promptly made a grab at his chain and when he sat down on the sofa on which it was sprawling tried very hard to get at the gold badge on his collar shoulder badges had not then come in mrs gray bootles said shes very well dressed is she not oh very mrs gray answered smoothing out the childs skirt so as to display the fine and deep embroidery unusually so all its clothes are of the finest and most expensive description i thought so it doesnt look like a common child eh not at all replied the lady promptly picture mignons ownillustration well bootles told her ive been most unmercifully chaffed which was only to be expected but the colonel takes my word about it and of course the others dont matter i cant think though why the mother has chosen me all well you see captain ferrers said the adjutants wife with a smile it is rather inconvenient sometimes to have a character for great kindness of heart i should say you are the greatest favorite in the regiment and naturally enough the officers speak of it sometimes in society oh bootles is this and bootles is that bootles wouldnt turn a dog from his door bootles would share his last sixpence with a poor chap who was down and so on i have heard captain ferrers of your emptying your pockets to divide among three poor tramps who had begged no more than a pipe of tobacco i have heard of your standing up forwith a deeper smilethe poor devils of casuals and if i hear it why not others why not the mother of this child true but i think you all overrate my character bootles replied modestly you know i dont go in for being saintly at all that is just it if you did you would have no more influence than major allardyce whom every one laughs at but you dont you are one of themselves and yet you will always help a man who is down you will do any unfortunate creature a good turn oh i hear a good deal though you choose to make light of it and you know captain ferrers we are not told that the good samaritan made a great spluttering about what he did but the professional saints the priest and the levite passed by on the other side you are very complimentary bootles said blushing a little much more than i deserve im sure the fellowslaughing at the remembrancewere much less merciful then about the child dawson suggests sending it to the policestation the colonel to the workhouse and one means the other of course mrs gray caught the child to her breast with a cry of dismay and bootles went on yes i feel as you do about it i cant do it and thats all about it it would be on my conscience all my life besides some day the mother might come back for it and though of course as the colonel says there is no claim upon me yet if for the sake of a few pounds i had turned the poor little beggar adrift ruined its lifewhy i simply couldnt face her and thats all about it and besides that mrs gray i have a lurking suspicion that the letter is genuine and that it was not written to or intended for me it reads to me like the letter of a woman who was desperate yes a woman must have been desperate indeed to willingly part with such a child as that said mrs gray smoothing the gold baby curls so i think for nature is nature all the world over bootles answered and besides to tell you the honest truth there is a resemblance in the child to some one i knew once yes eagerly oh no not that she is dead she was engaged to a fellow i knew desperately fond of him and hejilted her mr kerr bootles stared who told you he told me himself i think to ease his mind she answered quietly ah well it killed her she died heartbroken i saw her he said rising and going to the window whence he stood staring out over the square a few hours after she died that childs mother may look like that now and i cant and wont turn it adrift whatever the fellows or any one else chooses to think or say and thats all about it two bright tears gathered in mrs grays eyes and falling fell upon the babys curls of gold two priceless diamonds from the unfathomable and exhaustless mines of pity for a moment or two there was silence broken at last by the childs laugh as a ray of sickly winter sunshine fell upon the glittering chain in its little hands the sound recovered bootles who turned from the window and so mrs gray he said carefully avoiding the gaze of her wet eyes i have determined to keep the little beggar but harkness whos no fool you know has convinced me that it wont do to trust to any of the barrack women to look after her therefore if you wont mind undertaking it for a few days i will advertise for a respectable elderly nurse to take entire charge of the creature i dare say i can arrange with smithers for an extra room and youll let me come to you for advice now and then wont you mrs gray rose and went close to him laying her hand upon his arm captain ferrers she said earnestly you will have your reward god will bless you for this picture mrs gray rose and went close to him laying her hand upon his arm oh please dont mrs gray bootles stammered really id rather youd chaff me mrs gray laughed outright well you know what my sentiments are so for the future i will chaff you unmercifullycome in she added in a louder tone as a taptap sounded on the door the permission was followed by the entrance of lacy who came in with a pleasant goodermorning and a soft laugh at the sight of the baby on the sofa ierthought old bootles would be here he explained and besidesierwanted to see the babay seems to me bootles he added staring with an absurd air of reflective wisdom at the infant as if the face is somehow familiar to me oh i dont mean you it isnt a bit like you but there is a likeness though i dont know where to plant it perhaps it will grow suggested bootles ah pewraps it will and pewraps it wont the worst of the affair is that it is cwreating a pwrecedentnot for worlds would he have admitted to his friend that he thought him the fine fellow he had declared him in the messroom that morningand if we are all inundated with babays i wreally dont know plaintively what the wregiment will come to garahgarah chuckled the subject of this speech over the gold knob at the top of lacys whip cluckcluckcluck little beggah seems to find it a good joke any way lacy cried im a gwreat hand at nursing our adjutants wife in the white dwragoons had thwreeall at once i say mrs gwray stick something on it and ill take it out and show it wround dare you she asked dawre i just twry bythebye its cold this morningvewry cold mrs gray therefore fetched the childs white coat and cap and those other white woollen articles which bootles now discovered to be leggings and quickly transformed the little woman into a sort of snowball the two men watched the operation with intense interest la figlia del wreggimento laughed lacy i declare bootles shes quite a credit to us i never saw such a petite mademoiselle bootles started it reminded him who had been jilted by his friend and died for love he had always called her mademoiselle mignon mademoiselle mignon he said carelessly not a bad name for her vewry good returned lacy preparing to present arms he proved himself a much better nurse than bootles he gathered the child on his left arm and marched off to the anteroom in front of which the officers were standing about waiting for church they set up a shout at the sight of him and crowded round to inspect the new importation mademoiselle mignon bore the inspection calmly conscious perhapsas she was such a knowing little personof the effect of her big blue starlike eyes under the white fur of her cap what a pity she aint twenty years older was the first comment and it was said in such a tone of genuine regret that all the fellows laughed again miss mignon gobbled with satisfaction seems a jolly little beggar said another chutchutchut remarked miss mignon never saw such a jolly little beggar in all my life asserted another voice pretty work shell make in the regiment sixteen or seventeen years hence grumbled old garnet ah well nevah mind garnetnevah you mind major garnet sir cried hartog we shall all be dead by then but this being an exceedingly old and threadbare regimental joke was instantly snubbed in the face of the new and substantial one has it any teeth demanded miles the orderly officer for the day dont know open your mouth little one said lacy gravely at this point miss mignon made a delighted lunge in the direction of the belt across miless breast lacy shouted whoa whoa and miles immediately backed out of reach miss mignons mouth went dismally down until lacy remembered the knob of his whip and held it up for delectation booboo she crowed by jove she can half say bootles already ejaculated hartog and here he comes now then bootles called out have any of you fellows made up your mind to own this little baggage no none of us they laughed but one man gilchrist by name said with a sneer he should rather think not and added two unnecessary wordsworkhouse brat bootles turned and looked down upon him in profoundest contempt my dear chap he said coolly to charge you with being the father of that child pointing with his whip to the picture in lacys arms would be a compliment on your personal appearance which i should never under any circumstances have dreamed of paying you ill tell you what it is said hartog afterwards to lacy bootles is a dashed good fellowone of the best fellows in the world i dont know that theres another id trust as far or as thoroughly but all the same bootles is sometimes best left alone and for my part i think gilchrist and every one else had best leave him alone about this youngster yaas returned lacy then began to laugh oh but it was fine though about personal appearance and then he added ugly little beast chapter iv it was not to be expected and bootles did not expect it that the story of the mysterious little stranger could be confined to barracks in fact in the course of a few hours it had flown all over the town gaining additions and alterations by the frequency of its repetition until at last bootles himself could hardly recognize it a baby had been found in captain ferrerss rooms no one knew where it had come from nor to whom it belonged thencaptain ferrers had rescued a young baby from a brutal father who was going to dash its brains out against the doorpost thencaptain ferrers had picked up a newborn infant while hunting with the dukes hounds thencaptain ferrers was suffering from mental aberration or to speak plainly was getting a bit cracked and had adopted a child a year old out of idleminster workhouse thenit was really most romantic but captain ferrers had been engaged to and jilted by a young lady long agowhich of course accounted for his being impervious to the fascinations of the idleminster girlswho had married been deserted by her husband and now diedsome versions of the story said committed suicideleaving him the charge of a baby etc some people told one version of the story and some people told another but nobody blamed bootles very much it might be because he was so rich and so handsome and pleasant it might be because idleminster society was free from that leaven of censoriousness which causes most people to look at most things from the worst possible view but bootles went on his serene way telling the true state of the case to every one who mentioned the affair to him and always ending and hang it you know its a pretty little beggar and i couldnt send it to the workhouse he made no secret about it at all and on the saturday following the advent of the child an advertisement appeared in the idleminster chronicle which made idleminster tongues clack for a week wanted immediately a highly respectable and thoroughly experienced nurse of middle age to take the entire charge of a child about a year old good wages to a suitable person apply to captain ferrers scarlet lancers in due time this advertisement produced the right sort of person and a staid and respectable widow of about fifty was soon installed in a room next to mr grays quarters in charge of miss mignon as the child had already come to be called by everybody it was a charming childstrong and healthy seemed to have no trouble with temper or teeth hardly ever cried and might be seen morning and afternoon being wheeled by its nurse in a babycarriage about the barrack square or along the road outside the broad arrow boundaries and so as the weeks rolled by and wore into months it began to toddle about and could say bootles as plain as a pikestaff in april the scarlet lancers were moved from idleminster to blankhampton where bootles had to undergo a new experience for every one there took him for a widower on account of the child bootles would explain take her about with me yes she likes it always wants to go when she sees the trap a bother not a bit of it the jolliest little woman in creation and as good as gold what am i going to do with her when she grows up well lacy says he is going to marry her if he dont somebody else willno fear taking it all round miss mignon had a remarkably good time of it and seemed thoroughly to appreciate the pleasant places in which her lines had fallen it was wonderful too what an immense favorite she was with the fellows at first she had been bootless brat but very soon that was dropped and by the time she could toddle which she did in very good time no one thought of mentioning her or of speaking to her except as miss mignon scarcely any of the officers dreamed for a moment of returning after a few days leave without taking along as the americans say a box of sweets or a bundle of toys for miss mignon indeed the young lady came to have such a collection that after a while mrs nurses patient soul arose and with captain ferrerss permission all the discarded ones were distributed among the less fortunate children of the regiment but miss mignons favorite plaything was bootles himselfafter bootles lacy people said it was wonderful the depth of the affection between the big soldier of thirtyfive and the little dot of a child scarcely two bootles she adored and where bootles was she would be if by hook or by crook she could convey her small person into his presence once she spied him turn in at the gates on the right hand of the colonel when the regiment was returning from a fieldday and escaping from her nurses hand set off as hard as she could run in the direction of the band which immediately preceded the commanding officer mrs nurse gave chase but alas mrs nurse was stout and had the ill luck moreover to come a cropper over a drain tile lying conveniently in her way while the child unconscious of danger ran straight for bootles neither bootles nor lacy who was on the colonels left perceived her until she was close upon them waving her small hands and shouting in her shrill and joyous childs voice bootles bootles it seemed to bootles as be looked past the colonel that the child was almost under the hoofs of lacys charger lacy he called outlacy but lacy was already on the ground and caught miss mignon out of harms way but when he turned round he saw that his friends face was as white as chalk picture but lacy was already on the ground and caught miss mignon out of harms way as for the colonel when he saw mrs nurse gathering herself up with rueful looks at the drain tile he simply roared and miss mignon chimed in as if it were the finest joke in the world that was a smash she remarked from her proud position on lacys shoulder just like humpty dumptya comment which gave that estimable person the name of mrs humpty dumpty as long as she remained with the regiment a few weeks after this the annual inspection came off and miss mignon resenting the lengthened absence of her bootles again managed to escape from her nurse and pattered boldly as fast as her small feet would carry her right into the messroom where bootles was sitting just opposite the general at the late lunch miss mignon not seeing him at first wandered coolly behind the row of scarletclad backs until she spied him at the other side of the table then having no awe whatever of inspecting officers she wedged herself in between his chair and the colonels with a triumphant and joyous laugh the general gave a great start and the colonel laughed bootles in dismay jumped up and came quickly round the table to take her away well you little rogue said the colonel reaching a nectarine for her what do you want i wanted bootles sir said miss mignon confidentially and nurse falled asleep so i tooked french leave almost the only peculiarity in her speech was the habit of making all verbs regular and who are you my little maid the general asked in extreme amusement oh im miss mignon with dignity the old general fairly chuckled with delight and as he had put his arm round the child bootles who was standing behind could not very well take her away oh miss mignonhey and whom do you belong to why to bootles in surprise at his ignorance to bootles and who is bootles bootles is bootles and i love him miss mignon replied as if that settled everything happy bootles cried the old soldier what a lot of medals youve got cried miss mignon pressing closer im afraid sir she is troubling you bootles interposed at this point but secretly delighted with the turn affairs had taken picture what a lot of medals youve got no no let her see my medals replied the general who was as proud of his medals as bootles of miss mignon are you a sir too miss mignon asked gazing at the handsome old man with more respect what does she mean he cried bootles laughed well sir she hears us speak to the colonel so that is all dear me what a remarkably intelligent and attractive child exclaimed the general quietly how old is she about two sir now it happened that the old general had a craze for absolute accuracy and he caught bootles up with pleasant sharpness oh does that mean more or less i cant say sir she is about two i do not know the date of her birth then she is not yours i am not her father sir but at present she belongs to me bootles said smiling im afraid not at all but perhaps she had better go what a charming child this last was perhaps because miss mignon finding her time had comeand she never made a fuss on such occasionsput two soft arms round his neck and gave him such a genuine hug of friendship that the old mans heart was quite taken by storm so miss mignon was carried off looking back to the last over bootless shoulder and waving her adieu to the handsome old man who had such a fascinating array of clasps and medals i didnt quite understandwhat relation is the child to him he asked of the colonel none whatever ferrers found her late one night in his bed with her wardrobe and a letter from the mother written as if ferrers was the father he however gave me his word of honor that he knew nothing about it and some of us think the whole affair was simply a plant as he is known to be a very kindhearted fellow others however ferrers among them think that note and child were intended for one of the others nobody however would own to it and ferrers has kept the child ever sincei dont suppose he would part with her now for anything i wanted him to send her to the workhouse but tis a jolly bright little soul and i am glad he did not then he is not married oh dear no he pays a woman fifty pounds a year to look after her and all her meals go from the mess in fact he is bringing her up as if she were his own and the child adores himsimply adores him i respect that man said the general warmly it is an awful thing for a child to be reared in a workhouseawful yes bootles feels very strongly on the subject replied the colonel absently by the time bootles returned the officers had risen from the table and he met the guests and the seniors just entering the anteroom ill shake hands with you captain ferrers if you please said the general cordially i agree with you that it is an awful thing for a child to be brought up in a workhouse it is a subject upon which i feel very stronglyvery strongly a child reared as a pauper does not start the world with a fair chance i have met so often in the course of my military experience with recruits bred in the unionsi never knew one do well no pauperism is ground into them and they are never able to shake it off well sir that is my opinion said bootles modestly i hope though you wont think my little maid is often so obtrusive as today she is really always very good a charming little child replied the general as if he meant it too and then he shook hands with bootles again chapter v there was only one blot in the sweetness and light of miss mignons baby character so far as the officers of the scarlet lancers were concerned among them all there was only one whom she did not like she had degrees of lovebootles ranked first then lacy then two or three groups of friends whom she liked best better and well but she had no degrees of dislike where she did not love she hated hated fiercely and furiously hated with all her baby heart and soul there were several persons in her small world whom she detested thus absolutely declining to hold communication or to accept overtures from them however sweetly made but there was only one of the officers who came under this head and he was gilchrist the man who had dubbed her at first workhouse brat miss mignon could not endure him when old enough to understand that a certain box of sweeties had come from mr gilchrist she would drop it as if it burned her fingers draw down the corners of her mouth and remark miss mignon is very much obliged an observation which invariably sent bootles and lacy off into fits of laughter at which the little maid would fly openarmed to him and cry but mignon loves bootles but the fact remained the same that miss mignon detested gilchrist who indeed was not a favorite in the regiment nor indeed did gilchrist seem to like miss mignon any better though he now and then brought his offerings of toys and bonbons like the rest in the face of bootless severe snub about the two odious words he had applied to her he was hardly such a simpleton as to further rouse or annoy the most popular man in the regiment yet if he could possibly cast a slur on bootles or on the child he did it never from his lips came the pet name miss mignon never did his black eyes rest on her without a sneer or a jibe if he could by any chance twist bootless words into an admission that the child was really his he took care never to lose the opportunity oh come now preston cried one day when he had been sneering at bootles and lacy who had just driven away with the child between them bootles is a right good sortno mistake on that point no sneaking hypocrisy about him it would be well for you and me if we were half as fine chaps but we are not gilchrist and what is more we never shall be oh no but where is the mother of that brat how should i know or bootles i shouldnt mind laying my life that bootles never did and never will cause her or any other woman to write such a letter as came with the child that night jolly good thing for this one if she was bootless wife instead of being tied up to the hound who bound her to secrecy and deserted her perhaps shes dead poor soul who knows perhaps she isnt gilchrist sneered some people never die goodnatured and not very wise preston stared at him and hartog looked from behind his newspaper aghast at the bitterness of his tone good heavens gilchrist preston cried are you wanting somebody to die gilchrist tried to laugh and succeeded very badly he rose from his chair knocking a few scattered cigar ashes carefully off his braided cuff well i confess i should not be sorry to see that prating brat of bootless out of the road we should perhaps get at the truth then and having delivered himself of this feeling speech he went out banging the door after him well upon my soul exclaimed preston oh the mans got a tile loose in his upper story said hartog decidedly no man in his senses would talk such miserable rot as that always thought gilchrist a crazy fool myself but im sure of it now and how he sticks to it miss mignon is bootless own childas if it could be any good for him to say she isnt if she is no i shall tell bootles to keep an eye on gilchrist i say what a comfort it would be if he would only exchange i suppose we cant manage to dazzle him with the delights of india eh not very well besides he lost ever so much seniority by coming to us no such luck its queer though he should be so persistent about bootles and miss mignon i suppose he wants to daub bootles with some of his own mud thinks if he only throws enough some of its sure to stick and so it would with most men happily however it dont in the least matter what a little cad like gilchrist chooses to say about a man like bootlesa jealous little beast neither of them said any more about the matter but hartog took the earliest opportunity of repeating to bootles what that ass gilchrist had said about seeing that prating brat of bootless out of the road and in consequence a kind of watch was set upon the child not that bootles though he had a very poor opinion of gilchrist and gilchrists brains was afraid for a moment that he would give miss mignon poisoned bonbons or run off with her and drop her in the river yet he did think it not improbable that he might encourage an already dangerous spirit of adventure and of course be absolutely blameless if she could get trampled by a horses cruel hoofs or crushed by one of the many traps going in and out of barracks when bootles had taken his first long leave after miss mignons coming he had left her at idleminster in charge of her nurse but when long leave came round again and she must have been about two and a half he decided to take her with him one reason for this was certainly a fear of any pranks gilchrist might choose to play another that lacy was taking his leave at the same time and bootles was afraid in the absence of both miss mignon might fret herself into a fever and besides he had missed the child during a fortnights deerstalking in scotland that autumn more than he would have liked to own from blankhampton therefore they went to his place ferrers court where he was to entertain a rather large party for christmas with a sister of his mothers and his only near relative to do the honors for him and among his guests a mrs smith a widow and sister to that dead girl to whom he fancied a resemblance in miss mignon however at the last moment mrs smith wrote to excuse herself i am very very sorry she said but a very dear friend of mine with whom i spent two winters in italy has suddenly appeared with a travelling companion and two maids to pay me a longpromised visit of at least two months she is a russian countessa widow like myself and wishes i fancy to improve her english which she already speaks very well of course i am dreadfully disappointed but cannot help it now it happened that bootles had a very deep and great respect and liking for mrs smith and not for all the widowed countesses in russia was he willing to upset his plans therefore he wrote off at once to mrs smith after a five minutes consultation with lady marion to beg her to carry out her original intentions and bring madame and her retinue along would she telegraph her reply mrs smith did so the reply being yes moreover she supplemented the telegram by a letter in which she mentioned among other things that madame gourbolskas travelling companion must be treated in all ways as an ordinary guest so at the time originally appointed for mrs smiths coming the party of sixthree ladies and three maidsarrived bootles himself went to the station to meet them he found that madame gourbolska was young not more than thirty of the plump and fair russian type quite fair enough to hold her own beside mrs smith whom he regarded as the most beautiful woman of his acquaintance the third lady miss grace was fair also perhaps not so positively beautiful as either the english or the russian lady but fairhaired fairskinned with soft bluegray eyes intensely blue in some lights as bootles noticed directly graceful she was to a degree and as he watched her move across the little station he thought how wonderfully her name suited her mrs smith smiled at him as he helped her to mount to the top of the omnibus is not the likeness wonderful she said with one of those quick sighs with which we speak of our dead and then she said poor rosy bootles turned and looked at miss grace again his mind going back to those dark days past and gone now when he and his best friend had been estranged for honors sake when he and this imperially beautiful woman had stood side by side watching a young life die out had together seen the sacrifice of a heart the martyr of love to man yes it is very great he said briefly that dead sister of mrs smith had always been and would always be a nottobebroken bond of union between them for the widow knew how gladly that grand bootles as she always called him would have tried to make up for the love she had lost while to bootles mrs smith stood out from the rest of womankind as the sister of the only woman he had ever wished or asked to marry him he helped miss grace up to the seat beside mrs smith and took his own place beside the russian lady who entertained him very well during the three miles drive between eagles station and ferrers court picture in another moment they had drawn up at the great gothic doorway oh but what a paradise she cried as the carriage turned into the courtyard i am delighted that it pleases you he answered glancing round to see what effect his ancestral home had upon miss grace lovely she murmured to mrs smith in another moment they had drawn up at the great gothic doorway and immediately the figure of a little child dressed in white appeared on the top of the broad steps kissing her small hands in token of welcome go in directly youll get cold go in i say bootles called out it was indeed bitterly cold and a few flakes of snow were falling but miss mignon had a budget of news for her bootles and was not to be done out of telling it lal has had a letter from home she piped out in her shrill voice lal was her name for lacy and home meant blankhampton barracks and the st bernard has gotted two puppiesbeautiesand im to have one lal says so and terry has broked his leg terry was one of bootless grooms and major allys going to be married bootles was so surprised that he forgot the cold and his order that miss mignon should go in what he exclaimed incredulously just then lacy himself came to the top of the steps with open arms so to speak and carried off mrs smith into the house miss mignon took advantage of the opportunity to run down the steps just as bootles helped madame gourbolska to the ground i welcome you with much pleasure he said cordiallymiss grace also as he gave her his hand to jump the last step i am afraid you are tired you are very white i am tired she said in a low voice not looking at him but at the child it is so bitterly cold dont stand a moment mignon will you go in miss mignon skipped up the steps and the russian lady caught her in her arms oh you little angel and what is your name im miss mignon youre a very pretty lady returned mignon critically i wanted to go to the station but bootles said it was too cold and lal madame does not know what bootles and lal mean interrupted bootles this is bootles and thats lal miss mignon informed her im miss mignon and i belong to bootles oh you belong to bootles i am sure he must be very proud of you madame answered i believe im a great bother to him miss mignon announced in a matteroffact tone bootles laughed come to the fire madame he said then turning to miss grace im sure you are very coldyou are as white as a ghost im sure addressing lady marion aunt marion wine would be much better than this tea no no tea they criedat least the two elder ladies for miss grace seemed to have no ears for any one but the child wont you speak to me she asked presently as miss mignon gravely regarded her with her big blue eyes miss mignon went close to her immediately did bootles let you drive she asked with interest miss grace shook her head and lifted miss mignon onto her knee i did not ask him she said oh then after a pause i always do but not a pair in surprise miss mignon nodded when theyre not too fresh bootles would have letted you if youd asked him i will another time lacy said bootles suddenly is it true about allardyce hartog says so they say sheerdwrinks like a duck pooh but bootles laughed as if it was a great joke and mrs smith begged to be enlightened oh dont you remember allardyce hes the great military teetotal light anderhe wreally is an awful duffah remarked miss mignon in so exact and so unconscious an imitation of lacys drawl that her hearers went off into fits of laughter and miss grace clasping her close to her breast bent and kissed the luxuriant golden curls youre crying said miss mignon promptly scanning miss graces face with her big eyes no but you made me laugh she said hastily some people do cry when they laugh miss mignon informed her our colonel does now major garnet always chokes and then bootles thumps him i dont know what hell do she added in a tone of deep concern if he chokes while we are away i never saw such an original little piece of mischief in my life cried mrs smith and how charmingly dressedis she not madame so sensible of you to cover her up with that warm serge up to her throat and down to her wrists who put you up to it i fancy we evolved the idea among us you see she runs in and out of my rooms her own and mrs grays the adjutants wife that is bootles answered and barrack corridors are not exactly hothouses besides our doctor keeps his eye on her and he blames the wrappingup for her never having a days illness i believe in it asserted mrs smith and ioh our married ladies tell me i am quite an authority on the subject i can tell you we get fearfully chaffed about her lacy and i why miss grace asked well because she goes about with us a good deal and people seem to find the situation difficult to understand he took it for granted that she knew all about miss mignon and she did not press the question further but half an hour later when mrs smith was thinking of dressing miss grace tapped at her door and entered could you lend me a few black pins she asked madame and i have both forgotten them certainly my deartake the box but miss grace only took a few in the pink palm of her hand what a pretty child that is she said carelessly did the mother die when it was born oh my dear cried mrs smith she is not captain ferrerss child no relation whatever no whose then ah that is a question then she briefly told miss mignons history ending but he will never part with her now he is so fond of her and she adores him he is a fine fellow said miss grace toying with the pins in her hand a fine fellow he is a splendid character mrs smith cried warmly i assure you i have studied that manand i have known him for yearsand i cannot find a fault in him years ago when we were in great trouble my mother and i at the time my sister died oh he was so good sowell with a quick sigh i cannot explain it all but he was such a comfort to us and she died poor darling under very painful circumstances especially for me oh there are very few in the world like himnot one in ten thousand take his action as regarded that dear little child for instance his brother officers wanted him to send her to the workhouse but as he wrote to me some day i may meet the mother and how should i face her ah murmured miss grace and mrs smith went on it was no small undertaking for a man in his position for he has not left her to the entire care of servantsshe is continually with him and mr lacy who is also very fond of her do you know he pays her nurse fifty pounds a year in fact she is just as if she were really his own child but it is just like him and they would have sent her to the workhouse one or two of themnot mr lacy of course miss grace was silent for a few moments then she roused herself as from a brownstudy well i am detaining you mrs smith and shall be late myself thank you very much then she went away passing softly down the corridor and entered her room locking the door behind her but once in that safe shelter she flung the pins on the table and dropped upon her knees burying her face in her hands while the scalding tears forced their way between her fingers and the great sobs shook her frame some day he might meet the mother she sobbed and how should he face her oh my child my little child how shall i face him how shall i bear it how shall i live in the same house with him without falling on my knees and blessing him for saving my little child fromgod knows what picture lacy was occupied in making desperate love to the russian lady chapter vi a month had passed and the three ladies still remained at ferrers court though other visitors had come and gone lots of them lacy was still there also and occupied in making desperate love to the russian lady utterly ignoring two important factsone that she only laughed at him the other that she was three years his senior but while all this was going on bootles had fallen in love at last as men and women only fall once in their lives and of course the lady was madame gourbolskas friend miss gracehad he but known it the mother of mignon but bootles never suspected that for a moment true there was a likeness so strong as to proclaim the truth and many a time miss grace wondered when she caught sight of the childs face and her own in a glass that all these people did not see it yet neither bootles nor any one else did see it and the game of love was played on with desperate earnestness on his side and with equally desperate desire to prevent it on hers but bootles admired shy game and miss graces evident shyness made him only the more earnest and not being troubled with that faint heart which never won fair lady he had no intention of allowing madame gourbolska to depart from beneath his roof without asking miss grace to return to it as its mistress therefore one afternoon when he returned from hunting in much bespattered pink and went into the firelit library where he found miss grace half dreaming by the fire he shut the door with the intention of getting it over at once miss grace rose with some signs of confusion dont go for a minute said bootles i want to speak to you it seems to me that you have grown very fond of my little mignon is it not so miss grace caught at the carvings of the oaken chimneyshelf to steady herself and her heart began to beat hard and fast yes i am very fond of her she stammered i wish you would take her for your own bootles said very gently formy own sharply what do you mean for a moment she thought he knew all but his next words undeceived her if she had such a mother as you poor little motherless waif and if i had such a wife and if ferrers court had such a mistress oh dont you understand what i mean taking her hand miss grace snatched the hand away oh dont dont dont she said turning away but bootles possessed himself of it again must i tell you more oh my darling how from the very first day i ever saw you i loved you with all my heart and soul how when i bade you welcome to my house i could and would if i had dared have taken you up to my heart and kissed you before every one how oh tell me nothingnothing she cried with feverish haste dont you understand it cannot be it is impossiblequite impossible impossible he echoed blankly why is it impossible not because you dont care that ill swear she said nothing or if that is so look at me and say i dont love you but miss grace did not speak nor yet did she look or will you tell me that there is some one else whom you like better he asked regaining hope no miss grace did not seem inclined to vouchsafe that information either or that the care of the child would be an objection no she burst out in an agonized tone then what do you mean by impossible he asked it seems to me very possible indeed she looked at himthat proud handsome erect man with a smile of expectant happiness on his good faceand tried to take her hands away oh she sobbed out dont you think i would if i could i have not been so happy that i would throw away such happiness as you could give me some day you may know what it costs me to tell you that it is quite impossible you give me no hope he asked in a dull voice and she saw that he had grown white to his very lips none she returned then added bitterly oh hope and i have had nothing to say to one another this long long while bootles dropped her hand listlessly then it is no use my boring you he said turning away picture then with one imploring backward look she went away and left him alone a fierce denial rose to the girls lips but she choked it down and suffered his words in silence then meekly and with one imploring backward look at his tall figure as he stood his head well up in spite of his defeat looking into the fire she went away and left him alone chapter vii so it was all over this was the end of all his hopes and dreams and wishes this was the end none of his bright hopes would ever benone of his golden dreams would come to pass his wishes had no weight with the woman he loved he had looked forwardlike a fool he thought bitterlyand had pictured her in a dozen different ways at the head of his table in the huntingfield in the middle age and in the decline of life as mignons mother as his wife but it was all over now when madames visit was over she would go from under his roof never to come back to it any more forever he was still standing there when the door opened with some difficulty and miss mignon appeared on the threshold bootles she said inquiringly bootles turned round to her well he answered miss mignon heard the misery in his voice and ran to him bootles got a headache she asked picture he dropped into a chair and took her in his arms he dropped into a chair and took her in his arms such a headache mignon miss mignon knew what bootless headaches were and drew his head down upon her small shoulder with an air of protecting and comforting dignity equally pretty and absurd in one so young mignon loves bootles she whispered will mignon always love bootles he asked always was the confident reply mignon will always love bootles and so in and because of his trouble the little child crept closer and closer into his heart and drove out the greatest bitterness of his disappointment and the clasp of her soft arms about his neck seemed to take away the sharpest sting of defeat the touch of her baby lips upon his aching foreheadand it did achebrought him a larger measure of comfort than any living thing had power to do at that moment if only he had known that mignon was her child but bootles was not the man to sulk with fate if miss grace would not have him no more was to be said and no one but mrs smith saw anything unusual between them but trust mrs smith she walked into miss graces room and taxed her with ittaxed her in so friendly a way that the girl began to cry miserably mrs smith fumed it is absurd she cried to refuse such a mansuch a positionsuchsuch oh its absurd i have no patience with you you will never have such a chance againnever oh never she sobbed why then throw it away let me go and tell no tell him nothing i have already told him it is impossible oh mrs smith she cried passionately do you think any woman in her senses would refuse him if she could help it not i i assure you it is inexplicable said mrs smith but she protested no further so the next day they left ferrers court bootles driving them to the station but it was all very different nowvery different too from the last time he had driven them anywhere there was no laughter no joking no promise to come again he was not outwardly angry not harsh nor hard in any way but he was very polite and politeness from him was heartbreaking it was soon over when they reached the stationa few minutes of that kind of conversation which people make when they are waiting for a carriage or a train as they said the passengers of the london made while walking up and down quietly waiting for the end there was a handshaking all round the lifting of bootless and lacys hats a fuss over miss mignon and that was all miss grace on looking out of the carriage window with teardimmed eyes saw that they were together the childs hand in his miss mignons last words were yet ringing in her ears bootles has gotted such a headache then mignon must be very kind to him miss grace whispered ay miss mignon had need to be kind for bootles had gotted such a heartache too chapter viii a crowd of roughs a lesser crowd of thirdrate spectators and a lesser gathering of fashionable ones were assembled on the blankhampton racecourse for it was the day of the scarlet lancer steeplechases on the grand stand were to be seen most of the rank and fashion of the neighborhood and a goodly show of that class of people who are always to be found about towns which are also military stationsthe class of people who have daughters to marry and not much money to marry them with there were all the scarlet lancer ladies in full force from the colonels wife in blue velvet and sables to the quartermasters lady in a hard felt hat with long diamond and pearl earrings there were officers in cords and boots their silken finery hidden by newmarket coats and there was the bride mrs allardyce in pink and gray the majors racing colorsoh lor as the fellows said when they saw her and there was miss mignon a little threeyearold belle got up in bootless colorsscarlet purple and goldadapted in her small case to a warm frock of purple velvet braided with scarlet and gold and on her golden curls a jockeycap to match it utterly absurd most people said but bootles didnt seem to see it nor for the matter of that did miss mignon herself held by bootles or when bootles was riding by lacy she sat on the broad ledge of the balcony and surveyed the world like a queen in miniature it was a fine place for seeing yes and a fine place for hearing too as lacy testified afterwards in his own peculiar style of delivery eri and miss mignon were waiting for bootles to come down the lawn whenera laday next to usera little unpwrepossessing personi found out afterwards that her name is berwrywith a nose like a teapotspout and a mouth of the bulldog ordahlittle daughter bythebye pretty much of the same type but just a

to him bootles she calledbootles bootles glanced up and waved his hand anderthe old party called berwry turned wound and eyed her sharply saw the scarlet purple and gold of her dwress looked at her

winsferrers wins all up with the others ferrers wins and then the company good bad and indifferent had time to remember that a man was downno not one man but two to find out that hartog was bruised and stunned but able with help to get to the dressingroom and recover himself to learn that the swarming crowd around the other was watching a more exciting race than that which they had just witnessed with shouts and applause that they were watching with awe and in silence a race between life and deathfor gilchrist the odd man of the regiment the man who had been nobodys friend nobodys chum was lying in the midst of them with his back broken waiting for a hurdle they were all as sorry as men could be who had never been moved by feelings of friendship the proceedings were stopped at once and they went gravely back to barracks those who had ridden to get into morningclothes and all of them to hang about waiting for news but there was no hope absolutely no hope whatever with all his faults failings and peculiarities gavor gilchrist was passing away from their midst by exchange as hartog had once wishedthe exchange not of one regiment for another but of this world for the next picture the swarming crowd round the other was watching a more exciting race than that which they had just witnessed it was about six oclock that the senior of the two surgeons in attendance on gilchrist entered the anteroom and looking around beckoned for bootles what news asked several voices he wont last the night bootles he wants you ill come said bootles rising sure to want bootles observed preston oh yes i should myself returned another wont last the night remarked a third well i never did like gilchristnever but all the same im deuced sorry for him now poor chap for oh by jove its a fearful thing when you come to that and then they fell into silence again waiting for bootles to come back half an hour passedthreequarters then bootles did not come an hour then bootles appearedcame with a white face and a scared look in his blue eyes followed by the doctor who had fetched him every man in the room was roused from a lounging attitude to one of expectation and surprise bootles said lacy moving towards him but bootles did not even look at him he turned to the doctor and uttered words the like of which none of his hearers had ever heard from him before i kept my temper doctoryou think i did i know the mans dying yes i know and i shouldnt like to think i lost my temper with a poor chap who was dying butbutno i wont say a word ill go away and keep to myself until ive got over it a little if i stop here i shall say something i shall be sorry for all the rest of my life what is it bootles broke in lacy in his soft voice but bootles did not reply for a moment he stood still trying hard to control himself but lacy who had laid his hand upon his sleeve felt that he was shaking from head to foot and his very lips were trembling tell us said lacy persuasively what is it he is mignons father bootles answered and then he broke from lacys grasp and fled impossible lacy cried not at all it is true the doctor answered he is making his will now leaving bootles sole guardian and trustee to the child the brute burst out preston indignantly remembering gilchrists wordsnot so long ago picture a race between life and death hush hush the man is dying and death alters everything the doctor cried and bootles kept his temper said nothing not one wordof reproach has he seen her no he would not though bootles asked him his own childand she miss mignon all the better she cannot endure him by jove but what a blow for bootles how will he take it will it make any difference as wregards miss mignon what wrot you talk as if bootles but there lacy broke off in disgust and the babel of surmises questions and answers went on and that night gavor gilchrist died chapter ix oh but it was a blow for bootles to find he had been duped tricked made a fool of all this time to remember the anxiety the trouble the expense to which he had been put nay to recall the chaff he had endured and then to discover that miss mignon was gilchrists childthe child of the man he went perhaps nearer to hating than any one he had ever known in all his life everything came back to him thenthe dead mans jibes and sneers and taunts his unwearied efforts to tax him with an offence which he knew he had not committed and though he had failed in that oh what a fool gilchrist had made of him that was the sting bootles felt most of anything for hours after he left the anteroom bootles kept out of every ones wayindeed until lacy came to tell him that gilchrist was dead then it being close upon the hour of eleven he went and knocked at the door of mignons nursery the nurse opened it a few inches and seeing who it was set it open wide is miss mignon asleep he asked yes sir hours ago the woman answered he passed into the inner room where the child was lying a candle burned on a table beside the cot casting its light on the fair baby face now flushed in sleep and on the tangled golden curls both her arms lay outside the eider coverlet one hand grasping the whip with which he had ridden and won that day the other holding the card of the races bootles bent and scanned her face closely but not one trace could he discern of likeness to the fathernot oneand he drew a deep breath of relief that it was so well he remembered lacys puzzled scrutiny of the yearold baby theres a likeness but i dont know where to plant it if there had been a likeness to gilchrist then it had now passed away and as bootles satisfied himself that it was so his love for her which during the last few hours had hung trembling in the balance though he would hardly have acknowledged it even to himself reasserted itself and rose up in his heart stronger than ever just then she moved uneasily in her sleep lal where is bootles she asked then after a pause gotted another headache and an instant later miss grace said mignon was to be very kind to bootles bootles bent down and kissed her and she awoke bootles she said in sleepy surprise then imperatively take me up so bootles carried her to the fire in the adjoining room where the nurse was sewing a fresh frill of lace on the pretty velvet frock with its braidings of scarlet and gold which she had worn that day lal said mignon wasnt to go to bootles she said reproachfully bootles has been bothered mignon he answered poor bootles stroking his cheek with her soft hand bootles was vexed lal said so but not with mignon mignon told lal so confidently never with mignon answered bootles resting his cheek against the tossed golden curls and feeling as if he had done this faithful baby heart a moral injustice by his hours of anger and doubt there was a moment of silence broken by the nurse have you heard sir how mr gilchrist is she asked bootles roused himself he is dead nurse died half an hour ago then if you please sir she asked hesitatingly might i ask if it is true about miss mignon yes it is true his face darkening because sir miss mignon should have mourning she began when bootles cut her short i shall not allow her to wear mourning for mr gilchrist he said curtly so the nurse dared say no more three days later the funeral took place and if the facts of the dead mans having acknowledged miss mignon as his child and having admitted to bootles that he had transferred her that night from his own quarters to bootless rooms created a sensation it was as nothing to the intense surprise caused by the will which was read by the dead mans desire before all the officers of the regiment in it he left his entire property to his daughter mary gilchrist now in the care of captain ferrers and commonly known as mignon on condition that captain ferrers consented to be her sole guardian and trustee until she had attained the age of twentyone or until her marriage provided it should be with her guardians sanction and on the express understanding that captain ferrers should not give up the care of the child to her mother even temporarily to his wife helen gilchrist a copy of this testament was to be sent forthwith should any of the conditions be violated the whole property of which he died possessed should go to his cousin lucian gavor gilchrist but if the conditions be faithfully observed captain ferrers should have the power of applying any or all of the income arising from the estate for the use and maintenance of the said mary gilchrist cwrazy murmured lacy to bootles who listened in contemptuous silence and wondered in no small dismay what kind of a life he should have if mignons mother chose to make herself objectionable but the will was not crazy at all far from it it was only a very cleverly thoughtout plan for keeping mother and child apart bootles would take care not to endanger mignons inheritance and gilchrist had taken advantage of it to carry out his animosity towards his wife to the bitter end but of course there was one contingency he had never thought of or provided formarriage it was less than a week after gilchrists death that bootles received a note by hand signed helen gilchrist already he groaned impatiently may i trouble you to send the child to see me for half an hour during this afternoon she said and that was all but bootles did not see sending the child to be quietly stolen away he forgot quite that since gilchrist had not left his widow a farthing she would probably be now no better able to provide for the child than she had been when compelled to cast her baby upon the fathers mercy therefore immediately after lunch he drove down to the hotel from which the note had been written yes mrs gilchrist was withinthis way and thenthenbootles with the child fast holding his hand was shown into a room and there they foundmiss grace the truth flashed into his mind instantly she rose hurriedly and he saw that she was clad in black but was not in widows dress she fell upon her knees and almost smothered mignon with kisses mignon mignon she cried mignon has been very kind to bootles mignon explained not knowing whether to laugh or cry my mignon my baby the mother sobbed bootles watched themthe two things he loved best on earth have you nothing to say to me he asked at last what shall i say she had risen from her knees and now moved shyly away you might say said bootles severely that you are very sorry that you a married woman deceived me and stole my heart away you might say that for one thing but i am not sorry cried mignons mother audaciously then you might take a leaf out of mignons book and say as she says when i have a headache mignon loves bootles picture bootles watched themthe two things he loved best on earth i wreally do think remarked lacy to the fellows when the astounding news had been told and freely discussed that now we must let that poor malicious cwrookedminded chap wrest in his gwrave in peace seems to me he continued with his most reflective air thatersolomon was wright and said a vewry wise thing when he said love laughs at locksmiths solomon cried a voice amid a shout of laughter oh wasnt it solomon questioned lacy mildly its of no consequence some one said it but only think of that poor devil spending his last moments wraising a barwrier to keep mother and child apart and old bootles fulfils all the conditions to the letter and bwreaks them all in the spirit bymarwriage the end
