ark stands on the firmer ararat of history my invention being confined to the figure of peloni the hebrew for nobody the other stories have also a basis in life but neither in pathos nor heroic

every monday and thursday for a twelvemonth that zillah's long yearning for a child was gratified she gave birth o more than fair dealing god to a boy jossel who had years ago abandoned the hope of an heir to pray for his soul was as delighted as he was astonished his wife had kept him in ignorance of the fasts by which she was appealing to heaven and when of a monday or thursday evening on his return from his boot factory in bethnal green he had sat down to his dinner in dalston no suspicion had crossed his mind that it was zillah's breakfast he himself was a prosaic person incapable of imagining such spontaneities of religion though he kept every fast which it behoves an orthodox jew to endure who makes no speciality of sainthood there was a touch of the fantastic in zillah's character which he had only appreciated in its manifestation as girlish liveliness and which zillah knew would find no response from him in its religious expression not that her spiritual innovations were original inventions from some pious old crone after whom as she could read hebrew a cluster of neighbouring dames repeated what they could catch of the new year prayers in the women's synagogue zillah had learnt that certain holy men were accustomed to afflict their souls on mondays and thursdays from her unsuspecting husband himself she had further elicited that these days were marked out from the ordinary even for the man of the world by a special prayer dubbed the long 'he being merciful' surely on mondays and thursdays then he would indeed be merciful to make sure of his good will she continued to be unmerciful to herself long after it became certain that her prayer had been granted ii both zillah and jossel lived in happy ignorance of most things especially of their ignorance the manufacture of boots and all that appertained thereto the synagogue and religion misunderstood reminiscences of early days in russia the doings and misdoings of a petty social circle and such particular narrowness with general muddle as is produced by stumbling through a sabbath paper and a sunday paper these were the main items in their intellectual inventory separate zillah from her husband and she became even poorer for she could not read at all yet they prospered the pavements of the east end resounded with their hob nailed boots and even in many a west end drawing room their patent leather shoes creaked but they themselves had no wish to stand in such shoes the dingy perspectives of dalston villadom limited their ambition already sufficiently gratified by migration from whitechapel the profits went to enlarge their factory and to buy houses a favourite form of investment in their set zillah could cook fish to perfection both fried and stewed and the latter variety both sweet and sour nothing in fine had been wanting to their happiness save a son heir and mourner when he came at last little that religion or superstition could do for him was left undone an amulet on the bedpost scared off lilith adam's first wife who perhaps because she missed being the mother of the human race hankers after babes and sucklings the initiation into the abrahamic covenant was graced by a pious godfather with pendent ear locks and in the ceremony of the redemption of the first born the five silver shekels to the priest were supplemented by golden sovereigns for the poor nor though zillah spoke the passable english of her circle did she fail to rock her brum's cradle to the old yiddish nursery songs sleep my birdie shut your eyes o sleep my little one too soon from cradle you'll arise to work that must be done almonds and raisins you shall sell and holy scrolls shall write so sleep dear child sleep sound and well your future beckons bright brum shall learn of ancient days and love good folk of this so sleep dear babe your mother prays and god will send you bliss alas that with all this brum should have grown up a weakling sickly and anaemic with a look that in the child of poorer parents would have said starvation iii yet through all the vicissitudes of his infantile career zillah's faith in his survival never faltered he was emphatically a child from heaven and providence would surely not fly in its own face jossel not being aware of this had a burden of perpetual solicitude which zillah often itched to lighten only not having done so at first she found it more and more difficult to confess her negotiation with the celestial powers she went as near as she dared if the highest one has sent us a son after so many years she said in the yiddish which was still natural to her for intimate domestic discussion he will not take him away again as well say jossel replied gloomily that because he has sent us luck and blessing after all these years he may not take away our prosperity hush don't beshrew the child and zillah spat out carefully she was tremulously afraid of words of ill omen and of the evil eye against which she felt vaguely even heaven's protection was not potent secretly she became more and more convinced that some woman envious of all this luck and blessing was withering brum with her evil eye and certainly the poor child was peaking and pining away marasmus a physician had once murmured wondering that so well dressed a child should appear so ill nourished take him to the seaside often and feed him well was the universal cry of the doctors and so zillah often deserted her husband for a kosher boarding house at brighton or ramsgate where the food was voluminous and where brum wrote schoolboy verses to the strange fascinating sea for there were compensations in the premature flowering of his intellect even other mothers gradually came round to admitting he was a prodigy the black eyes seemed to burn in the white face as they looked out on the palpitating universe or devoured every and any scrap of print a pity they had so soon to be dulled behind spectacles but zillah found consolation in the thought that the glasses would go well with the high black waistcoat and white tie of the british rabbi he had been given to her by heaven and to heaven must be returned besides that might divert it from any more sinister methods of taking him back in his twelfth year brum began to have more trouble with his eyes and renewed his early acquaintance with the drab ante rooms of eye hospitals that led at the long expected ting ting of the doctor's bell into a delectable chamber of quaint instruments but it was not till he was on the point of bar mitzvah confirmation at thirteen that the blow fell unwarned explicitly by any physician brum went blind oh mother was his first anguished cry i shall never be able to read again iv the prepared festivities added ironic complications to the horror after brum should have read in the law from the synagogue platform there was to have been a reception at the house brum himself had written out the invitations with conscious grammar present their compliments to mr and mrs solomon and shall be glad to see them not you as was the fashion of their set it was after writing out so many notes in a fine schoolboy hand that brum began to be conscious of thickening blurs and dancing specks and colours now that the blind boy was crouching in hopeless misery by the glowing fire where he had so often recklessly pored over books in the delicious dusk there was no one handy to write out the countermands as yet the wretched parents had kept the catastrophe secret as though it reflected on themselves and by every post the confirmation presents came pouring in brum refused even to feel these shining objects he had hoped to have a majority of books but now the preponderance of watches rings and penknives left him apathetic to his parents each present brought a fresh feeling of dishonesty we must let them know they kept saying but the tiny difficulty of writing to so many prevented action perhaps he'll be all right by sabbath zillah persisted frenziedly she clung to the faith that this was but a cloud for that the glory of the confirmation of a future rabbi could be so dimmed would argue an incomprehensible providence brum's performance was to be so splendid he was to recite not only his own portion of the law but the entire sabbath sedrah section he will never be all right said jossel who in the utter breakdown of zillah had for the first time made the round of the doctors with brum none of the physicians not even the most expensive hold out any hope and the dearest of all said the case puzzled him it was like the blindness that often breaks out in russia after the great fasts and specially affects delicate children yes i remember said zillah but that was only among the christians we have so many christian customs nowadays said jossel grimly and he thought of the pestilent heretic in his own synagogue who advocated that ladies should be added to the choir then what shall we do about the people moaned zillah wringing her hands in temporary discouragement you can advertise in the jewish papers came suddenly from the brooding brum he had a flash of pleasure in the thought of composing something that would be published yes then everybody will read it on the friday said jossel eagerly then brum remembered that he would not be among the readers and despair reconquered him but zillah was shaking her head yes but if we tell people not to come and then when brum opens his eyes on the sabbath morning he can see to read the sedrah but i don't want to see to read the sedrah said the boy petulantly i know it all by heart my blessed boy cried zillah there's nothing wonderful said the boy even if you read the scroll there are no vowels nor musical signs but do you feel strong enough to do it all said the father anxiously god will give him strength put in the mother and he will make his speech too won't you my brum the blind face kindled yes he would give his learned address he had saved his father the expense of hiring one and had departed in original rhetorical ways from the conventional methods of expressing filial gratitude to the parents who had brought him to manhood and was this eloquence to remain entombed in his own breast his courageous resolution lightened the gloom his parents opened parcels they had not had the heart to touch they brought him his new suit they placed the high hat of manhood on his head and told him how fine and tall he looked they wrapped the new silk praying shawl round his shoulders are the stripes blue or black he asked blue a beautiful blue said jossel striving to steady his voice it feels very nice said brum smoothing the silk wistfully yes i can almost feel the blue later on when his father a little brightened had gone off to the exigent boot factory brum even asked to see the presents the blind retain these visual phrases zillah described them to him one by one as he handled them when it came to the books it dawned on her that she could not tell him the titles they have such beautiful pictures she gushed evasively the boy burst into tears yes but i shall never be able to read them he sobbed yes you will no i won't then i'll read them to you she cried with sudden resolution but you can't read i can learn but you will be so long i ought to have taught you myself and now it is too late v in order to insure perfection and prevent stage fright so to speak it had been arranged that brum should rehearse his reading of the sedrah on friday in the synagogue itself at an hour when it was free from worshippers this rehearsal his mother thought was now all the more necessary to screw up brum's confidence but the father argued that as all places were now alike to the blind boy the prominence of a public platform and a large staring audience could no longer unnerve him but he will feel them there zillah protested but since they are not there on the friday all the more reason since he cannot see that they are not there he can fancy they are there on saturday he will be quite used to them but when jossel yielding brought brum to the synagogue appointment the fusty old beadle who was faithfully in attendance held up his hands in holy and secular horror at the blasphemy and the blindness respectively a blind man may not read the law to the congregation he explained no said jossel why not asked brum sharply because it stands that the law shall be read and a blind man cannot read he can only recite but i know every word of it protested brum the beadle shook his head but suppose you make a mistake shall the congregation hear a word or a syllable that god did not write it would be playing into satan's hands i shall say every word as god wrote it give me a trial but the fusty beadle's piety was invincible he was highly sympathetic toward the human affliction but he refused to open the ark and produce the scroll i'll let the chazan cantor know he must read to morrow as usual he said conclusively jossel went home sighing but silenced zillah however was not so easily subdued but my brum will read it as truly as an angel she cried pressing the boy's head to her breast and suppose he does make a mistake haven't i heard the congregation correct winkelstein scores of times hush said jossel you talk like an epicurean satan makes us all err at times but we must not play into his hands the din judgment is that only those who see may read the law to the congregation brum will read it much better than that snuffling old winkelstein sha enough the din is the din it was never meant to stop my poor brum from the din is the din it won't let you dance on its head or chop wood on its back besides the synagogue refuses so make an end i will make an end i'll have minyan congregation here in our own house what and the poor man stared in amaze always she falls from heaven with a new idea brum shall not be disappointed and she gave the silent boy a passionate hug but we have no scroll of the law brum said speaking at last and to the point ah that's you all over zillah cried jossel relieved loud drumming in front and no soldiers behind we can borrow a scroll said zillah jossel gasped again but the iniquity is just the same he said as if brum made mistakes if you were a rabbi the congregation would baptize itself jossel quoted zillah writhed under the proverb it isn't as if you went to the rabbi you took the word of the beadle he is a learned man zillah donned her bonnet and shawl where are you going to the minister jossel shrugged his shoulders but did not stop her the minister one of the new school of rabbis who preach sermons in english and dress like christian clergymen as befitted the dignity of dalston villadom was taken aback by the ritual problem so new and so tragic his acquaintance with the vast casuistic literature of his race was of the shallowest no doubt the beadle is right he observed profoundly he cannot be right he doesn't know my brum worn out by zillah's persistency the minister suggested going to the beadle's together aware of the beadle's prodigious lore he had too much regard for his own position to risk congregational odium by flying in the face of an exhumable din at the beadle's the din was duly unearthed from worm eaten folios but zillah remaining unappeased further searching of these rabbinic scriptures revealed a possible compromise if the portion the boy recited was read over again by a reader not blind so that the first congregational reading did not count it might perhaps be permitted it would be of course too tedious to treat the whole sedrah thus but if brum were content to recite his own particular seventh thereof he should be summoned to the rostrum so zillah returned to jossel sufficiently triumphant vi abraham the son of jossel shall stand in obedience to the cantor's summons the blind boy in his high hat and silken praying shawl with the blue stripes rose and guided by his father's hand ascended the platform amid the emotion of the synagogue his brave boyish treble pursuing its faultless way thrilled the listeners to tears and inflamed zillah's breast as she craned down from the gallery with the mad hope that the miracle had happened after all the house gathering afterward savoured of the grewsome conviviality of a funeral assemblage but the praises of brum especially after his great speech were sung more honestly than those of the buried than whom the white faced dull eyed boy cut off from the gaily coloured spectacle in the sunlit room was a more tragic figure but zillah in her fineries and forced smiles offered the most tragic image of all every congratulation was a rose wreathed dagger every eulogy of brum's eloquence a reminder of the rabbi god had thrown away in him vii amid the endless babble of suggestions made to her for brum's cure one repeated several times by different persons hooked itself to her distracted brain germany there was a great eye doctor in germany who could do anything and everything yes she would go to germany this resolution at which jossel shrugged his shoulders in despairing scepticism was received with rapture by brum how he had longed to see foreign countries to pass over that shining sea which whispered and beckoned so at brighton and ramsgate he almost forgot he would not see germany unless the eye doctor were a miracle monger indeed but he was doomed to a double disappointment for instead of his going to germany germany came to him so to speak in the shape of the specialist's annual visit to london and the great man had nothing soothing to say only a compassionate head to shake with ominous warnings to make the best of a bad job and fatten up the poor boy nor did zillah's attempts to read take her out of the infant primers despite long hours of knitted brow and puckered lips and laborious triumphs over the childish sentences by patient addition of syllable to syllable she also tried to write but got no further than her own name imitated from the envelopes to occupy brum's days jossel gaining enlightenment in the ways of darkness procured braille books but the boy had read most of the stock works thus printed for the blind and his impatient brain fretted at the tardiness of finger reading jossel's one consolation was that the boy would not have to earn his living the thought however of how his blind heir would be cheated by agents and rent collectors was a touch of bitter even in this solitary sweet viii it was the sabbath fire woman who appropriately enough kindled the next glimmer of hope in zillah's bosom the one maid of all work who had supplied all the help and grandeur zillah needed in her establishment having transferred her services to a husband zillah was left searching for an angel at thirteen pounds a year in the interim the old irishwoman who made a few pence a week by attending to the sabbath fires of the poor jews of the neighbourhood became necessary on friday nights and saturdays to save the household from cold or sin och the quare little brat she muttered when she first came upon the pale gnome like figure by the fender tapping the big book for all the world like the leprechaun cobbling and can't he see at all at all she asked zillah confidentially one sabbath when the boy was out of the room zillah shook her head unable to speak nebbich compassionately sighed the fire woman who had corrupted her native brogue with yiddish and wud he be borrun dark no it came only a few months ago faltered zillah the fire woman crossed herself sure and who'll have been puttin' the evil oi on him she asked zillah's face was convulsed i always said so she cried i always said so the divil burrun thim all cried the fire woman poking the coals viciously yes but i don't know who it is they envied me my beautiful child my lamb my only one and nothing can be done she burst into tears nothin' is a harrd wurrd if he was my bhoy the darlint i'd cure him aisy enough so i wud zillah's sobs ceased how she asked her eyes gleaming strangely i'd take him to the pope av course the pope repeated zillah vaguely ay the holy father the ownly man in this wurruld that can take away the evil oi zillah gasped do you mean the pope of rome she knew the phrase somehow but what it connoted was very shadowy and sinister some strange mighty chief of hostile heathendom who else wud i be manin' the holy mother i'd be for prayin' to meself but as ye're a jewess i dursn't tell ye to do that but the pope he's a gintleman an' so he is an' sorra a bit he'll moind that ye don't go to mass whin he shpies that poor weeshy pale shrimp o' yours he'll just wave his hand shpake a wurrd an' whisht in the twinklin' of a bedposht ye'll be praisin' the holy mother zillah's brain was whirling go to rome she said the fire woman poised the poker well ye can't expect the pope to come to dalston no no i don't mean that said zillah in hasty apology only it's so far off and i shouldn't know how to go it's not so far off as ameriky an' it's two broths of bhoys i've got there isn't it asked zillah no lord love ye an' sure gold carries ye anywhere nowadays ixcept to heaven but if i got to rome would the pope see the child as sartin as the child wud see him the fire woman replied emphatically he can do miracles then inquired zillah what else wud he be for not that 'tis much of a miracle to take away the evil oi bad scran to the witch then perhaps our rabbi can do it too cried zillah with a sudden hope the fire woman shook her head did ye ever hear he could no admitted zillah thrue for you mum divil a wurrd wud i say aginst your priesht wan's as good as another maybe for ivery day use but whin it comes to throuble and heart scaldin' i pity the poor craythurs who can't put up a candle to the blessed saints an' so i do niver a bhoy o' mine has crassed the ocean without the virgin havin' her candle and did they arrive safe they did so ivery mother's son av 'em ix the more the distracted mother pondered over this sensational suggestion the more it tugged at her science and judaism had failed her perhaps this unknown power this heathen pope had indeed mastery over things diabolical perhaps the strange religion he professed had verily a saving efficacy denied to her own why should she not go to rome true the journey loomed before her as fearfully as a polar expedition to an ordinary mortal germany she had been prepared to set out for it lay on the great route of jewish migration westwards but rome she did not even know where it was but her new skill in reading would she felt help her through the perils she would be able to make out the names of the railway stations if the train waited long enough but with the cunning of the distracted she did not betray her heretical ferment p o p e pope she spelt out of her infants' primer in brum's hearing pope what's that brum oh haven't you ever heard of the pope mother no said zillah crimsoning in conscious invisibility he's a sort of chief rabbi of the roman catholics he wears a tiara kings and emperors used to tremble before him and don't they now she asked apprehensively no that was in the middle ages hundreds of years ago he only had power over the dark ages over the dark ages repeated zillah with a fresh vague hope when all the world was sunk in superstition and ignorance mother then everybody believed in him zillah felt chilled and rebuked then he no longer works miracles she said faintly brum laughed oh i daresay he works as many miracles as ever of course thousands of pilgrims still go to kiss his toe i meant his temporal power is gone that is his earthly power he doesn't rule over any countries all he possesses is the vatican but that is full of the greatest pictures by michael angelo and raphael zillah gazed open mouthed at the prodigy she had brought into the world raphael that sounds jewish she murmured she longed to ask in what country rome was but feared to betray herself brum laughed again raphael jewish why so it is it's a hebrew word meaning 'god's healing' god's healing repeated zillah awestruck her mind was made up x knowest thou what jossel she said in yiddish as they sat by the friday night fireside when brum had been put to bed i have heard of a new doctor better than all the others after all it was the doctor the healer the exorcist of the evil eye that she was seeking in the pope not the rabbi of an alien religion jossel shook his head you will only throw more money away better than throwing hope away well who is it now he lives far away in germany again no in rome in rome why that's at the end of the world in italy i know it's in italy said zillah rejoiced at the information but what then if organ grinders can travel the distance why can't i but you can't speak italian and they can't speak english madness work but not wisdom i could not trust you alone in such a strange country and the season is too busy for me to leave the factory i don't need you with me she said vastly relieved brum will be with me he stared at her brum brum knows everything believe me jossel in two days he will speak italian let be let be let me rest and on the way back he will be able to see he will show me everything and mr raphael's pictures 'god's healing' she murmured to herself but you'd be away for passover enough no we shall be easily back by passover o these women the almighty could not have rested on the seventh day if he had not left woman still uncreated you don't care whether brum lives or dies zillah burst into sobs it is just because i do that i ask how are you going to live on the journey and there are no kosher hotels in italy we shall manage on eggs and fish god will forgive us if the hotel plates are unclean but you won't be properly nourished without meat nonsense when we were poor we had to do without it to herself she thought if he only knew i did without food altogether on mondays and thursdays xi and so brum passed at last over the shining wonderful sea feeling only the wind on his forehead and the salt in his nostrils it was a beautiful day at the dawn of spring the far stretching sea sparkled with molten diamonds and zillah felt that the highest god's blessing rested like a blue sky over this strange pilgrimage she was dressed with great taste and few would have divined the ignorance under her silks mother can you see france yet brum asked very soon no my lamb mother can you see france yet he persisted later i see white cliffs she said at last ah that's only the white cliffs of old england look the other way i am looking the other way i see white cliffs coming to meet us has france got white cliffs too cried brum disappointed on the journey to paris he wearied her to describe france in vain she tried her untrained vision and poor vocabulary could give him no new elements to weave into a mental picture there were trees and sometimes houses and churches and again trees what kind of trees green brum was in despair france was then only like england white cliffs without trees and houses within he demanded the seine at least yes i see a great water his mother admitted at last that's it it rises in the cote d'or flows nnw then w and nw into the english channel it is more than twice as long as the thames perhaps you'll see the tributaries flowing into it the little rivers the oise the marne the yonne no wonder the angels envy me him thought zillah proudly they halted at paris putting up for the night by the advice of a friendly fellow traveller at a hotel by the gare de lyon where to zillah's joy and amazement everybody spoke english to her and accepted her english gold a pleasant experience which was destined to be renewed at each stage and which increased her hope of a happy issue how loud paris sounds said brum as they drove across it he had to construct it from its noises for in answer to his feverish interrogations his mother could only explain that some streets were lined with trees and some foolish unrespectable people sat out in the cold air drinking at little tables oh how jolly said brum but can't you see notre dame what's that a splendid cathedral mother very old do look for two towers we must go there the first thing to morrow the first thing to morrow we take the train the quicker we get to the doctor the better oh but we can't leave paris without seeing notre dame and the gargoyles and perhaps quasimodo and all that victor hugo describes i wonder if we shall see a devil fish in italy he added irrelevantly you'll see the devil if you go to such places said zillah who besides shirking the labor of description was anxious not to provoke unnecessarily the god of israel but i've often been to st paul's with the boys said brum have you she was vaguely alarmed yes it's lovely the stained windows and the organ yes and the abbey's glorious too it almost makes me cry i always liked to hear the music with my eyes shut he added with forced cheeriness and now that'll be all right but your father wouldn't like it said zillah feebly father wouldn't like me to read the pilgrim's progress retorted brum he doesn't understand these things there's no harm in our going to notre dame no no it'll be much better to save all these places for the way back when you'll be able to see for yourself too late it struck her she had missed an opportunity of breaking to brum the real object of the expedition but the seine anyhow he persisted we can go there to night but what can you see at night cried zillah unthinkingly oh mother how beautiful it used to be to look over london bridge at night when we came back from the crystal palace in the end zillah accepted the compromise and after their dinner of fish and vegetables for which brum had scant appetite they were confided by the hotel porter to a bulbous nosed cabman who had instructions to restore them to the hotel zillah thought wistfully of her warm parlour in dalston with the firelight reflected in the glass cases of the wax flowers the cab stopped on a quay well said brum breathlessly little fool said zillah good humouredly there is nothing but water the same water as in london but there are lights aren't there yes there are lights she admitted cheerfully where is the moon where she always is in the sky doesn't she make a silver path on the water he said with a sob in his voice what are you crying at the mother didn't mean to make you cry she strained him contritely to her bosom and kissed away his tears xii the train for switzerland started so early that brum had no time to say his morning prayers so the carriage being to themselves he donned his phylacteries and his praying shawl with the blue stripes zillah sat listening to the hour long recitative with admiration of his memory early in the hour she interrupted him to say how lucky i haven't to say all that i should get tired that's curious replied brum i was just saying 'blessed art thou o lord our god who hath not made me a woman' but a woman has to pray too mother else why is there given a special form for the women to substitute 'who hath made me according to his will' ah that's only for learned women only learned women pray well you'd like to pray the benediction that comes next mother i know say it with me do she repeated the hebrew obediently then asked what does it mean 'blessed art thou o lord our god who openest the eyes of the blind' oh my poor brum teach it me say the hebrew again she repeated it till she could say it unprompted and then throughout the journey her lips moved with it at odd times it became a talisman a compromise with the god who had failed her blessed art thou o lord our god who openest the eyes of the blind xiii mountains were the great sensation of the passage through switzerland brum had never seen a mountain and the thought of being among the highest mountains in europe was thrilling even zillah's eyes could scarcely miss the mountains she painted them in broad strokes but they did not at all correspond to brum's expectations of the alps don't you see glaciers he asked anxiously no replied zillah but kept a sharp eye on the windows of passing chalets till the boy discovered that she was looking for glaziers at work great masses of ice he explained sliding down very slowly and glittering like the bergs in the polar regions no i see none she said blushing ah wait till we come to mont blanc mont blanc was an obsession his geography was not minute enough to know that the route did not pass within sight of it he had expected it to dominate switzerland as a cathedral spire dominates a little town mont blanc is feet above the sea he said voluptuously eternal snow is on its top but you will not see that because it is above the clouds it is then in heaven said zillah god is there replied brum gravely and burst out with coleridge's lines from his school book 'god let the torrents like a shout of nations answer and let the ice plains echo god god sing ye meadow streams with gladsome voice ye pine groves with your soft and soul like sounds and they too have a voice yon piles of snow and in their perilous fall shall thunder god' who openest the eyes of the blind murmured zillah there are five torrents rushing down also added brum 'and you ye five wild torrents fiercely glad' you'll recognize mont blanc by that don't you see them yet mother wait i think i see them coming presently she announced mont blanc definitely described it with glaciers and torrents and its top reaching to god brum's face shone poor lamb i may as well give him mont blanc she thought tenderly xiv endless other quaint dialogues passed between mother and son on that tedious and harassing journey southwards there'll be no more snow when we get to italy brum explained italy's the land of beauty always sunshine and blue sky it's the country of the old gods venus the goddess of beauty juno with her peacocks jupiter with his thunderbolts and lots of others but i thought the pope was a christian said zillah so he is it was long ago before people believed in christianity but then they were all jews oh no mother there were pagan gods that people used to believe in at rome and in greece in greece though these gods changed their names so said zillah scornfully i suppose they wanted to have a fresh chance and what's become of them now they weren't ever there not really and yet people believed in them is it possible zillah clucked her tongue with contemptuous surprise then she murmured mechanically 'blessed art thou o lord our god who openest the eyes of the blind' well and what do people believe in now the pope brum reminded her and yet he's not true zillah's heart sank but he's really there she protested feebly oh yes he's there because pilgrims come from all parts of the world to get his blessing her hopes revived but they wouldn't come unless he really did them good well if you argue like that mother you might as well say we ought to believe in christ hush hush the forbidden word jarred on zillah she felt chilled and silenced she had to call up the image of the irish fire woman to restore herself to confidence it was clear brum must not be told his unfaith might spoil all no the deception must be kept up till his eyes were opened in more than one sense xv after mont blanc brum's great interest was the leaning tower of pisa it is one of the wonders of the world he said there are seven altogether yes it is a wonderful world said zillah i never thought about it before and in truth italy was beginning to touch sleeping chords the cypresses the sunset on the mountains the white towns dozing on the hills under the magical blue sky all these broad manifestations of an obvious beauty under the spur of brum's incessant interrogatory began to penetrate nature in unusual combinations spoke to her as its habitual phenomena had never done her replies to brum did rough justice to italy florence recalled romola to the boy he told his mother about savonarola he was burnt what cried zillah burn a christian no wonder then they burnt jews but why he wanted the people to be good all good people suffer oh nonsense brum it is the bad who suffer then she looked at his wasted white face grown thinner with the weariness of the long journey through perpetual night and wonder at her own words struck her silent xvi they arrived at last in the eternal city having taken a final run of many hours without a break but the pope was still to seek leaving the exhausted brum in bed zillah drove the first morning to the vatican where brum said he lived and asked to see him a glittering swiss guard stared blankly at her and directed her by dumb show to follow the stream of people the pilgrims zillah told herself she was made to scrawl her name and thanking god that she had acquired that accomplishment she went softly up a gorgeous flight of steps and past awe inspiring creatures in tufted helmets into the sistine chapel where she wondered at people staring ceilingwards through opera glasses or looking downwards into little mirrors zillah also stared up through the gloom till she had a crick in the neck but saw no sign of the pope she inquired of the janitor whether he was the pope and realized that english was after all not the universal language she returned gloomily to see after brum and to consider her plan of campaign the great doctor was not at home she said we must wait a little and yet you made us hurry so through everything grumbled brum brum remained in bed while zillah went to get some lunch in the dining room a richly dressed old lady who sat near her noticed that she was eating lenten fare like herself and assuming her a fellow catholic spoke to her in foreign sounding english about the blind boy whose arrival she had observed zillah asked her how one could get to see the pope and the old lady told her it was very difficult ah those blessed old times before ah the splendid ceremonies in st peter's do you remember them zillah shook her head the old lady's assumption of spiritual fellowship made her uneasy but st peter's stuck in her mind brum had already told her it was the pope's house of prayer clearly therefore it was only necessary to loiter about there with brum to chance upon him and extort his compassionate withdrawal of the spell of the evil eye with a culminating inspiration she bought a photograph of the pope and overcoming the first shock of hereditary repulsion at the sight of the large pendent crucifix at his breast she studied carefully the pontiff's face and the papal robes then when brum declared himself strong enough to get up they drove to st peter's the instruction being given quietly to the driver so that brum should not overhear it it was the first time zillah had ever been in a cathedral and the vastness and glory of it swept over her almost as a reassuring sense of a greater god than she had worshipped in dingy synagogues she walked about solemnly leading brum by the hand her breast swelling with suppressed sobs of hope her eyes roved everywhere searching for the pope but at moments she well nigh forgot her disappointment at his absence in the wonder and ghostly comfort of the great dim spaces and the mysterious twinkle of the countless lights before the bronze canopy with its golden flashing columns where are we mother said brum at last we are waiting for the doctor but where in the waiting room it seems very large mother no i am walking round and round there is a strange smell mother i don't know what something religious oh nonsense she laughed uneasily i know what it smells like cold marble pillars and warm coloured windows her blood froze at such uncanny sensibility it is the smell of the medicines she murmured somehow his divination made it more difficult to confess to him it feels like being in st paul's or the abbey he persisted when i used to shut my eyes to hear the organ better he had scarcely ceased speaking when a soft slow music began to thrill with life the great stone spaces brum's grasp tightened convulsively a light leapt into the blind face both came to a standstill silent in zillah's breast rapture made confusion more confounded and as this pealing grandeur swelling more passionately uplifted her high as the mighty dome she forgot everything even the need of explanation to brum in this wonderful sense of a power that could heal and her hebrew benediction flowed out into sobbing speech 'blessed art thou o lord our god who openest the eyes of the blind' but brum had fainted and hung heavy on her arm xvii when brum awoke in bed again after his long fainting fit he related with surprise his vivid dream of st paul's and zillah weakly acquiesced in the new deception especially as the doctor warned her against exciting the boy but her hopes were brighter than ever for the old lady had beneficently appeared from behind a pillar in st peter's to offer eau de cologne for the unconscious brum and had then interesting herself in the couple promised to procure for her fellow catholics admission to the next papal reception being a very rich and fashionable old lady she kept her word but unfortunately when the day came round brum was terribly low and forbidden to leave his bed zillah was distracted if she should miss the great chance after all it might never recur again brum she said at last this is the only day for a long time that the great eye doctor receives patients do you think you could go my lamb why won't he come here like the other doctors he is too great well i daresay i can manage it's miserable lying in bed fancy coming to rome and seeing nothing with infinite care brum was dressed and wrapped up and placed in a specially comfortable brougham and thus at last mother and son stood waiting in one of the ante chambers of the vatican amid twenty other pilgrims whispering in strange languages zillah was radiantly assured the mighty power whatever it was that spoke in music and in mountains would never permit such weary journeyings and waitings to end in the old darkness the malice of witches could not prevail against this great spirit of sunshine for brum too the long pilgrimage had enveloped the doctor with a miraculous glamour as of an eighth wonder of the world drooping wearily on his mother's arm but wrought up to joyous anticipation brum had an undoubting sense of the patient crowd around him waiting as in his old hospital days for admission to the doctor's sanctum his ear was strung for the ting ting of the bell summoning the sufferers one by one at last a wave of awe swept over the little fashionable gathering and set zillah's heart thumping and the room fading in mist through which the tall venerable robed figure the eagle features softened in benediction gleamed like a god's then she found herself on her knees with brum at her side and the wonderful figure passing between two rows of reverent pilgrims why must i kneel mother murmured brum feebly hush hush she whispered the great doc she hesitated in awe of the venerable figure the great healer is here the great healer breathed brum his face was transfigured with ecstatic forevision 'who openeth the eyes of the blind' he murmured as he fell forward in death ii transitional ii transitional i the day came when old daniel peyser could no longer withstand his wife's desire for a wider social sphere and a horizon blacker with advancing bachelors for there were seven daughters and not a man to the pack indeed there had been only one marriage in the whole portsmouth congregation during the last five years and the christian papers had had reports of the novel ceremony with the ritual bathing of the bride and the breaking of the glass under the bridegroom's heel to mrs peyser brought up amid the facile pairing of the russian pale this congestion of celibacy approached immorality portsmouth with its careless soldiers and sailors might be an excellent town for pawnbroking especially when one was not too punctiliously acceptant of the ethics of the heathen but as a market for maidens even with dowries and pretty faces it was hopeless but it was not wholly as an emporium for bachelors that london appealed it was the natural goal of the provincial jew the reward of his industry the best people had all drifted to the mighty magic city whose fascination survived even cheap excursions to it would father deny that they had now made enough to warrant the migration no father would not deny it ever since he had left germany as a boy he had been saving money and his surplus he had shrewdly invested in the neighbouring soil of southsea fast growing into a watering place even allowing three thousand pounds for each daughter's dowry he would still have a goodly estate was there any social reason why they should not cut as great a dash as the benjamins or the rosenweilers no father would not deny that his girls were prettier and more polished than the daughters of these pioneers especially when six of them crowded around the stern granite figure arguing imploring cajoling kissing but i don't see why we should waste the money he urged with the cautious instincts of early poverty waste and the pretty lips made reproachful oh's yes waste he retorted in india one treads on diamonds and gold but in london the land one treads on costs diamonds and gold but are we never to have a grandson cried mrs peyser the indian item was left unquestioned so that little schnapsie whose childish imagination was greatly impressed by these eventful family debates had for years a vivid picture of picking her way with bare feet over sharp pointed diamonds and pebbly gold indeed long after she had learned to wonder at her father's naive geography the word india always shone for her with barbaric splendour environed by so much persistent femininity the rugged elderly toiler was at last nagged into accepting a leisured life in london ii and so the family spread its wings joyfully and migrated to the wonder town only its head and tail old daniel and little schnapsie felt the least sentiment for the things left behind old daniel left the dingy synagogue to whose presidency he had mounted with the fattening of his purse and in which he bought for himself or those he delighted to honour the choicest privileges of ark opening or scroll bearing left the cronies who dropped in to play klabberjagd on sunday afternoons left the bustling lucrative saturday nights in the shop when the heathen housewives came to redeem their sabbath finery and little schnapsie who was only eleven and not keen about husbands left the twinkling tarry harbour with its heroic hulks and modern men of war amid which the half penny steamer plied left the great waves that smashed on the pebbly beach and the friendly moon that threw shimmering paths across their tranquillity left the narrow lively streets in which she had played and the school in which she had always headed her class and the salt wind that blew over all little schnapsie was only schnapsie to her father her real name was florence the four younger girls all bore pagan names sylvia lily daisy florence symbolic of the influence upon the family councils of the three elder girls grown to years of discretion and disgust with their own leah rachael and rebecca between these two strata of girls jewish and pagan two boys had intervened but their stay was brief and pitiful so that all this plethora of progeny had not provided the father with a male mourner to say the kaddish but it seemed likely a grandson would not long be a wanting for the eldest girl was twenty five and all were good looking as if in irony the jewish group was blond almost christian in colouring for they took after the teuton father while the pagan group had characteristically oriental traits in little schnapsie these eastern charms a whit heavy in her sisters were repeated in a key of exquisite refinement the thick black eyebrows and hair were soft as silk dark dreamy eyes suffused her oval face with poetry and her skin was like dead ivory flushing into life iii the first year at highbury that genteel suburb in the north of london was an enchanted ecstasy for the mother and the jewish group of girls taken at once to the bosom of a great german clan and admitted to a new world of dances and dinners of at homes and theatres and card parties the eldest of the pagan group sylvia tyrannically kept young in the interests of her sisters was the only one who grumbled at the change for lily and daisy found sufficient gain in the prospect of replacing the elder group when it should have passed away in an odour of orange blossom the scent of that was always in the air and mrs peyser and her three hopefuls sniffed it night and day no no rebecca shall have him not me i am not going to marry a man with carroty hair leah's the eldest it's her turn first thank you my dear don't give away what you haven't got every new young man who showed the faintest signs of liking to drop in provoked a similar semi facetious but also semi serious canvassing his person his income and the girl to whom he should be allotted supplying the sauce of every meal at which he or his fellow was not present thus whether in the flesh or the spirit the young man for so many of him appeared on the scene that he hovered in the air rather as a type than an individual was a permanent guest at the peyser table but all this new domestic excitement did not compensate little schnapsie for her moonlit waters and the strange ships that came and went with their cargo of mystery and poor old daniel found no cronies to appeal to him like the old nothing in the roar of london to compensate for the saturday night bustle of the pawn shop no dingy little synagogue desirous of his presidential pomp he sat inconspicuously in a handsome half empty edifice and knew himself a superfluous atom in a vast lonely wilderness he was not indeed an imposing figure with his ragged graying whiskers and his boyish blue eyes in the street he had the stoop and shuffle of the ghetto and forgot to hide his coarse red hands with gloves in the house he persisted in wearing a pious skull cap at first his more adaptable wife and his english bred daughters tried to fit him for decent society and to make him feel at home during their at homes but he was soon relegated to the background of these brilliant social tableaux for he was either too silent or too talkative with old fashioned jewish jokes which disconcerted the smart young men and with hebrew quotations which they could not even understand and sometimes there thrilled through the small talk the trumpet note of his nose as he blew it into a coloured handkerchief gradually he was eliminated from the drawing room altogether but for some years longer he reigned supreme in the dining room when there was no company old habit kept the girls at table when he intoned with noisy unction the hebrew grace after meals they even joined in the melodious morceaux that diversified the plain chant but little by little their contributions dwindled to silence and when they had smart company to dinner the old man himself was hushed by rows of blond and bugle eyebrows especially after he had once or twice put young men to shame by offering them the honour of reciting the grace they did not know daniel's prayer on such occasions was at length reduced to a pious mumbling which went unobserved amid the joyous clatter of dessert even as his pious skull cap passed as a preventive against cold last stage of all the mumbling of his company manners passed over into the domestic circle and this humble whispering to god became symbolic of his suppression iv i don't think he means rachael at all oh how can you say so leah it was me he took down to supper nonsense it isn't either of you he's after that's only his politeness to my sisters didn't he say the bouquet was for me don't be silly rebecca you know you can't have him the eldest must take precedence this changed tone indicated their humbler attitude toward the young man as the years went by for the first young man did not propose either to the sisterhood en bloc or to a particular sister and his example was followed by his successors in fact a procession of young men passed and repassed through the house or danced with the girls at balls without a single application for any of these many hands and the first season passed into the second and the second into the third with tantalizing mirages of marriage balls dances dinners a universe of nebulous matrimonial matter on the whirl but never the shot off star of an engagement mrs peyser's hair began to whiten faster she even surreptitiously called in the shadchan or rather surrendered to his solicitations pooh not find any one suitable he declared rubbing his hands i have hundreds of young men on my books just your sort real gentlemen at first the girls refused to consider applications from such a source it was not done in their set they said mrs peyser snorted sceptically oh indeed and pray how did those rosenweiler girls find husbands oh yes the rosenweilers they shrugged their shoulders they knew they had not that disadvantage of hideousness nevertheless they lent an ear to the agent's suggestions as filtered through the mother though under pretence of deriding them but the day came when even that pretence was dropped and with broken spirit they waited eagerly for each new possibility and with the passing of the years the young man aged he grew balder less gentlemanly poorer once indeed he turned up as a handsome and wealthy christian but this time it was he that was rejected in a unanimous sisterly shudder five slow years wore by then of a sudden the luck changed a water proof manufacturer on the sunny side of forty appeared the long glacial epoch was broken up and the first orange blossom ripened for the peyser household it was rebecca the youngest of the jewish group who proved the pioneer to the canopy but her marriage gave a new lease of youth even to the oldest and miraculously mysteriously within a few months two other girls flew off mrs peyser's shoulders a jewish and a pagan though sylvia was not yet formally out and though leah the first born still remained unchosen yet sylvia's marriage to a bayswater household had raised the family status and provided a better field for operations the shadchan was frozen off but he returned for despite all these auguries and auspices another arctic winter set in no orange blossoms only desolate lichens of fruitless flirtation gradually the pagan group pushed its way into unconcealable womanhood the problem darkened all the horizon the young man grew middle aged again he lost all his money he wanted old daniel to set him up in business even this seemed better than a barren fine ladyhood and leah might have even harked back to the parental pawn shop had not another sudden epidemic of felicity married off all save little schnapsie within eighteen months mrs peyser was knocked breathless by all these shocks first a rich german banker then a prosperous solicitor for leah then a cape financier any one in himself catch enough to gouge out the eyes of the neighbours i told you so she said her portly bosom swelling portlier with exultation as the sixth bride was whirled off in a rice shower from the highbury villa while the other five sat around in radiant matronhood i told you to come to london daniel pressed her hand in gratitude for all the happiness she had given herself and the girls if it were not for florence she went on wistfully ah little schnapsie sighed daniel somehow he felt he would have preferred her hymeneal felicity to all these marvellous marriages for there had grown up a strange sympathy between the poor lonely old man now nearly seventy and his little girl now twenty four they never conversed except about commonplaces but somehow he felt that her presence warmed the air and she she divined his solitude albeit dimly had an intuition of what life had been for him in the days before she was born the long days behind the counter the risings in the gray dawn to chant orisons and don phylacteries ere the pawn shop opened the lengthy prayer and the swift supper when the shutters were at last put up all the bare rock on which this floriage of prosperity had been sown and long after the others had dropped kissing him good night she would tender her lips partly because of the necessary domestic fiction that she was still a baby but also because she felt instinctively that the kiss counted in his life through all these years of sordid squabbles and canvassings and weary waiting all those endless scenes of hysteria engendered by the mutual friction of all that close packed femininity poor schnapsie had lived shuddering sometimes a sense of the pathos of it all of the tragedy of women's lives swept over her she regretted every inch she grew it seemed to shame her celibate sisters so she clung willingly to short skirts until she was of age wore her long raven hair in a plait with a red ribbon well florence said leah genially when the last outsider at daisy's wedding had departed it's your turn next you'd better hurry up thank you said florence coldly i shall take my own time fortunately there is no one behind me humph said leah playing with her diamond rings it don't do to be too particular why don't you come round and see me sometimes there are so many of you now murmured florence she was not attracted by the solicitors and traders in whose society and carriages her mother lolled luxuriously and she resented the matronly airs of her sisters with leah however she was conscious of a different and more paradoxical provocation leah had an incredible air of juvenility all those unthinkable innumerable years little schnapsie had conceived of her eldest sister as an old maid hopeless senescent despite the wonderful belt that had kept her figure dashing but now that she was married she had become the girlish bride kittenish irresistible while little schnapsie was the old maid the sister in peril of being passed by and indeed she felt herself appallingly ancient prematurely aged by her long stay at seventeen yes you are right leah she said pensively with a touch of malice to morrow i shall be twenty four what shrieked leah yes florence said obstinately and oh how glad i shall be she raised her arms exultingly and stretched herself as if shooting up seven years as soon as the pressure of her sisters was removed do you hear mother whispered leah that fool of a florence is going to celebrate her twenty fourth birthday not the slightest consideration for us i didn't say i would celebrate it publicly said florence besides she suggested smiling very soon people will forget that i am not the eldest then your folly will recoil on your own head said leah little schnapsie gave a devil may care shrug a ghetto trait that still clung to all the sisters yes added mrs peyser think what it will be in ten years' time i shall be thirty four said florence imperturbably another little smile lit up the dreamy eyes then i shall be the eldest madness cried mrs peyser aloud forgetting that her daughters' husbands were about god forbid i should live to see any girl of mine thirty four hush mother said florence quietly i hope you will indeed i am sure you will for i shall never marry so don't bother to put me on the books i'm not on the market good night she sought out poor daniel who awed by the culture and standing of his five sons in law not to speak of the guests was hanging about the deserted supper room smoking cigar after cigar much to the disgust of the caterer's men who were waiting to spirit away the box having duly kissed her father little schnapsie retired to bed to read browning's love poems her mother had to take a glass of champagne to restore her ruffled nerves to the appropriate ecstasy v poor portly mrs peyser was not destined to enjoy her harvest of happiness for more than a few years but these years were an overbrimming cup with only the bitter drop of florence's heretical indifference to the young man environed by the six households which she had begotten mrs peyser breathed that atmosphere of ebullient babyhood which was the breath of her jewish nostrils babies appeared almost every other month it was a seething well spring of healthy life religious ceremonies connected with these chubby new comers or medical recipes for their bodily salvation absorbed her but her exuberant grandmotherliness usually received a check in the summer when the babies were deported to scattered sea shores and thus it came to pass that the summer of her death found her still lingering in london with a bad cold with only daniel and little schnapsie at hand and before the others could be called mrs peyser passed away in peace in the old portsmouth bed overlooked by the old hebrew picture exiled from the london dining room it was a curious end she did not know she was dying but daniel was anxious she should not be reft into silence before she had made the immemorial proclamation of the unity at the same time he hesitated to appall her with the grim knowledge he was blubbering piteously yet striving to hide his sobs the early days of his struggle came back the first weeks of wedded happiness then the long years of progressive prosperity and godly cheerfulness in portsmouth ere she had grown fashionable and he unimportant and a vast self pity mingled with his pitiful sense of her excellencies the children she had borne him in agony the economy of her house management the good bargains she had driven with the clod pated soldiers and sailors the later splendour of her social achievement and little schnapsie wept with a sense of the vanity of these dual existences to which she owed her own empty life suddenly mrs peyser over whose black eyes a glaze had been stealing let the long dark eyelashes fall over them sarah whispered daniel frantically say the shemang hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one said the sensuous lips obediently little schnapsie shrugged her shoulders rebelliously the dogma seemed so irrelevant mrs peyser opened her eyes and a beautiful mother light came into them as she saw the weeping girl ah florrie do not fret she said reassuringly in her long lapsed yiddish i will find thee a bridegroom her eyes closed and little schnapsie shuddered with a weird image of a lover fetched from the shrouded dead vi after his sarah had been lowered into the house of life and the excitement of the tombstone recording her virtues had subsided daniel would have withered away in an empty world but for little schnapsie the two kept house together the same big house that had reeked with so much feminine life and about which the odours of perfumes and powders still seemed to linger but father and daughter only met at meals he spent hours over the morning paper with the old quaint delusions about india and other things he read of and he pottered about the streets or wandered into the beth hamidrash which a local fanatic had just instituted in north london and in which under the guidance of a polish sage daniel strove to concentrate his aged wits on the ritual problems of babylon at long intervals he brushed his old fashioned high hat carefully and timidly rang the bell of one of his daughters' mansions and was permitted to caress a loudly remonstrating baby but they all lived so far from him and one another in this mighty london from sylvia's where there was a boy with buttons he had always been frightened off and when the others began to emulate her his visits ceased altogether as for the sisters coming to see him all pleaded overwhelming domestic duty and the frigidity of florence's reception of them now if you lived alone or with one of us but somehow daniel felt the latter alternative would be as desolate as the former and though he knew some wide vague river flowed between even his present housemate's life and his own yet he felt far more clearly the bridge of love over which their souls passed to each other figure then the septuagenarian's amaze when one fine morning as he was shuffling about in his carpet slippers the servant brought him word that his six daughters demanded his instantaneous presence in the drawing room the shock drove out all thoughts of toilet his heart beat quicker with a painful premonition of he knew not what this simultaneous visit recalled funerals weddings he looked out of a window and saw four carriages drawn up and that completed his sense of something elemental he tottered into the drawing room grown dingy now that it had no more daughters to dispose of and shrank before the resplendence with which their presence reinvested it they rustled with silks shone with gold necklaces and impregnated the air with its ancient aroma of powders and perfumes he felt himself dwindling before all this pungent prosperity like some more creative frankenstein before a congress of his own monsters they did not rise as he entered the jewish group and the pagan group were promiscuously seated marriage had broken down all the ancient landmarks they all looked about the same agelessness a standstill buxom matronhood daniel stood at the door glancing from one to another some coughed others fidgeted with muffs sit down sit down father said rachael kindly though she retained the arm chair and there was a general air of relief at her voice but the old embarrassment returned as the silence reestablished itself when daniel had drooped into a stiff chair at last leah took the word we have come while florrie is at her slumming at her slumming repeated sylvia with more significance and a meaning smile spread over the six faces yes daniel murmured because we did not want her to know of our coming it concerns schnapsie he murmured yes your little schnapsie said daisy viciously yes she has no time to come and see us cried rebecca but she has plenty of time for her slumming well she does good he murmured apologetically a fat lot of good sniggered rachael to herself corrected lily i do not understand he muttered uneasily well began lily you tell him leah you know more about it you know as much as i do he looked appealingly from one to the other i always said the slums were dangerous places for people of our class said sylvia she doesn't even confine herself to her own people the faces began to lighten evidently they felt the ice broken dangerous he repeated catching at the ominous word dreadful in a common shudder he half rose you have bad news he cried the faces gloomed over the heads nodded about schnapsie he shrieked jumping up sit down sit down she's not dead said leah contemptuously he sat down well what is it what has happened she's engaged in leah's mouth the word sounded like a death bell engaged he breathed with a glimmering foreboding of the horror to a christian said daisy brutally he sank back pale and trembling a tense silence fell on the room but how who he murmured at last the girls recovered themselves now they were all speaking at once another slummer he's the son of an archdeacon an awful christian crank and that's your pet schnapsie if we had wanted christians we could have been married twenty years ago it's a terrible disgrace for us she doesn't consider us in the least she'll be miserable anyhow when they quarrel he'll always throw it up to her that she's a jewess and wouldn't join our daughters of mercy committee had no time wasn't going to marry turned up her nose at all the jewish young men but she would have told me he murmured hopelessly i don't believe it my little schnapsie don't believe it snorted leah why she didn't even deny it have you spoken to her then have we spoken to her why she says judaism is all nonsense she will disgrace us all the blind racial instinct spoke through them the twenty five centuries of tested separateness but daniel felt in super addition the conscious religious horror but is she to be married in a christian church he breathed oh she isn't going to marry yet his poor heart fluttered at the reprieve she doesn't care a pin for our feelings went on leah but of course she won't marry while you are alive lily took up the thread we all told her if she'd only marry a jew we'd all be glad to have you in turn but she said it wasn't that she could have you herself her alfred wouldn't mind it's the shock to your religious feelings that keeps her back she doesn't want to hurt you god bless her my good little schnapsie he murmured his dazed brain did not grasp all the bearings was only conscious of a vast relief disgust darkened all the faces he groped to understand it putting his hand over the white hairs that straggled from his skull cap but then then it's all right yes all right said leah brutally but for how long her meaning seized him like an icy claw upon his heart for the first time in his life he realized the certainty of death and simultaneously with the certainty its imminence we want you to put a stop to it now said sylvia for our sakes make her promise that even when you're the only one who has any influence over her she rose as if to wind up the painful interview and the others rose too with a multiplex rustling of silken skirts he shook the six jewelled hands as in a dream and promised to do his best and as he watched the little procession of carriages roll off it seemed to him indeed a funeral and his own vii ah god that it should have come to this little schnapsie could not be happy till he was dead well why should he keep her waiting what mattered the few odd years or months he was already dead there was his funeral going down the street to speak to schnapsie he had never intended even while he was promising it those years of silent life together had made real conversation impossible the bridge on which his soul passed over to hers was a bridge over which hung a sacred silence under the weight of words especially of angry parental words it might break down forever and that would be worse than death no little schnapsie had her own life and he somehow knew he had not the right to question it even though it seemed on the verge of deadly sin he could not have expressed it in logical speech was not even clearly conscious of it but his tender relation with her had educated him to a sense of her moral rightness which now survived and subsisted with his conviction that she was hopelessly astray no he had not the right to interfere with her life with her prospect of happiness in her own way he must give up living little schnapsie must be nearly thirty the best of her youth was gone she should be happy with this strange man but if he killed himself that would bring disgrace on the family and little schnapsie perhaps too alfred would not marry her was there no way of slipping quietly out of existence but then suicide was another deadly sin if only that had really been his funeral procession o god god of israel tell me what to do viii a sudden inspiration leapt to his heart she should not have to wait for his death to be happy he would live to see her happy he would pretend that her marriage cost him no pang indeed would not truly the pang be swallowed up in the thought of her happiness but would she be happy could she be happy with this alien ah there was the chilling doubt if a quarrel came would not the man always throw it in her face that she was a jewess well that must be left to herself she was old enough not to rush into misery through all these years he had taken her pensive brow as the seat of all wisdom her tender eyes as the glow of all goodness and he could not suddenly readjust himself to a contradictory conception by the time she came in he had composed himself for his task ah my dear he said with a beaming smile i have heard the good news the answering smile died out of her eyes she looked frightened it's all right little schnapsie he said roguishly so now i shall have seven sons in law and alfred the second eh you have heard yes he said pinching her ear thinks she can keep anything from her old father does she but do you know that he is a a a christian of course what's the difference as long as he's a good man eh he laughed noisily little schnapsie looked more frightened than ever were her father's wits wandering at last but i thought thought i would want you to sacrifice yourself no no my dear we are not in india where women are burnt alive to please their dead husbands little schnapsie had an irrelevant vision of herself treading on diamonds and gold she murmured who told you leah leah but leah is angry about it so she is she came to me in a tantrum but i told her whatever little schnapsie did was right father with a sudden cry of belief and affection she fell on his neck and kissed him but isn't the darling old jew shocked she said half smiling half weeping cunning lent him clairvoyance how much judaism is there in your sisters' husbands he said and without the religion what is the use of the race why father that's what i'm always preaching she cried in astonishment think what our judaism was in the dear old portsmouth days what is the sabbath here a mockery not one of your sons in law closes his business but there when the sabbath came in how beautiful gradually it glided glided you heard the angel's wings then its shining presence was upon you and a holy peace settled over the house yes yes his eyes filled with tears he saw the row of innocent girl faces at the white sabbath table what had london and prosperity brought him instead and then the atonement days when the ram's horn thrilled us with a sense of sin and judgment when we thought the heavenly scrolls were being signed and sealed who feels that here father some of us don't even fast true true he forgot his part then you are a good jewess still she shook her head sadly we have outlived our destiny our isolation is a meaningless relic but she had kindled a new spark of hope can't you bring him over to us to what to our empty synagogues then you are going over to him he tried to keep his voice steady i must his father is an archdeacon i know i know he said though she might as well have said an archangel but you do not believe in in i believe in self sacrifice that is christianity is it i thought it was three gods that is not the essential thank god he said then he added hurriedly but will you be happy with him such different bringing up you can't really feel close to him she laughed and blushed there are deeper things than one's bringing up father but if after marriage you should have a quarrel he would always throw up to you that you are a jewess no alfred will never do that then make haste little schnapsie or your old father won't live to see you under the canopy she smiled happily believing him but there won't be any canopy she said well well whatever it is he laughed back with horrid imagining that it might be a cross ix it was agreed between them that to avoid endless family councils the sisters should not be told and that the ceremony should be conducted as privately as possible the archdeacon himself was coming up to town to perform the ceremony in the church of another of his sons in chalk farm after the short honeymoon daniel was to come and live with the couple in whitechapel for they were to live in the centre of their labours poor daniel tried to find some comfort in the thought that whitechapel was a more jewish and a homelier quarter than highbury but the unhomely impression produced upon him by his latest son in law neutralized everything all his other sons in law had more or less awed him but beneath the awe ran a tunnel of brotherhood with this alfred however he was conscious of a glacial current which not all the young man's cordiality could tepefy are you sure you will be happy with him little schnapsie he asked anxiously you dear worrying old thing but if after marriage you quarrel he will always throw it up to you that you are and i'll throw it up to him that he is a christian and oughtn't to quarrel he was silenced but his heart thanked god that his dear old wife had been spared the coming ordeal this too was for good he murmured in the hebrew proverb and so the tragic day drew nigh x one short week before daniel was wandering about dazed by the near prospect an unholy fascination drew him toward chalk farm to gaze on the church in which the profane union would be perpetrated perhaps he ought even to go inside to get over his first horror at being in such a building so as not to betray himself during the actual ceremony as he drew near the heathen edifice he saw a striped awning carriages a bustle of people entering a pressing peeping crowd a wedding ah good there was no doubt now he must go in he would see what this unknown ceremony in this unknown building was like it would be a sort of rehearsal it would help to steel him at the tragic moment he was passing through the central doors with some other men but a policeman motioned them to a side door he shuffled timidly within full as the church was the chill stone spaces struck cold to his heart all the vast alien life they typified froze his soul the dread word meshumad apostate seemed echoing and reechoing from the cold pillars he perceived his companions had bared their heads and he hastily snatched off his rusty beaver the unaccustomed sensation in his scalp completed his sense of unholiness nothing seemed going on yet but as he slipped into a seat in the aisle he became aware of an organ playing joyous preludes almost jiggish for a moment he wondered dully what there was to be gay about and his eyes filled with bitter tears a craning forward in the nondescript congregation made the old man peer forward he saw at the far end of the church a sort of platform upon which four men in strange flowing robes stood under a cross he hid his eyes from the sight of the symbol that had overshadowed his ancestors' lives when he opened his eyes again the men were kneeling would he have to kneel he wondered would his old joints have to assume that pagan posture presently four bridesmaids shielded by great glowing bouquets appeared on the platform and descending passed with measured theatric pace down the farther avenue too remote for his clear vision his neighbours stood up to stare at them and he rose too and throughout the organ bubbled out its playful cadenzas a stir and a buzz swept through the church a procession began to file in at its head was a pale severe young man supported by a cheerful young man other young men followed then the bridesmaids reappeared and finally target of every glance there passed a glory of white veil supported by an old military looking man in a satin waistcoat ah that would be he and schnapsie then up that long avenue beneath all these curious christian eyes he daniel peyser would have to walk he tried to rehearse it mentally now so that he might not shame her he paced pompously and stiffly with beautiful schnapsie on his arm a glory of white veil he saw himself slowly reaching the platform under the chilling cross then everything swam before him and he sank shuddering into his seat his little schnapsie she was being sucked up into all this hateful heathendom to the seductive music of satanic orchestras he sat in a strange daze vaguely conscious that the organ had ceased and that some preacher's recitative had begun instead when he looked up again the bridal party before the altar loomed vague as through a mist he passed his hand over his clouded brow of a sudden a sentence of the recitative pierced sharply to his brain therefore if any man can show any just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together let him now speak or else hereafter forever hold his peace o god of israel then it was the last chance he sprang to his feet and shouted in agony no no she must not marry him she must not all heads turned toward the shabby old man an electric shiver ran through the church the bride paled a bridesmaid shrieked the minister taken aback stood silent a white gloved usher hurried up do you forbid the banns called the minister the old man's mind awoke and groped mistily come what have you to say snapped the usher i i nothing he murmured in awed confusion he is drunk said the usher out with you my man he hustled daniel toward the side door and let it swing behind him but daniel shrank from facing the cordon of spectators outside he hung miserably about the vestibule till the wedding march swelled in ironic triumph and the human outpour swept him into the street xi his abstracted look his ragged talk troubled schnapsie at the evening meal but she could not elicit that anything had happened in the evening paper her eye avid of marriage items paused on a big headed paragraph i forbid the banns strange scene at a chalk farm church when she had finished the paragraph and read another the first began to come back to her shadowed with a strange suspicion why this was the very church a jewish looking old man great heavens then all this had been mere pose self sacrifice and his wits were straying under the too heavy burden only blind craving for her own happiness could have made her believe that the mental habits of seventy years could be broken off well father she said brightly you will be losing me very soon now his lips quivered into a pathetic smile i am very glad he paused struggling with himself if you are sure you will be happy but haven't we talked that over enough father yes but you know if a quarrel arose he would always throw it up that nonsense nonsense she laughed but the repetition of the old thought struck her poignantly as a sign of maundering wits and you are sure you will get along together quite sure then i am glad he drew her to him and kissed her she broke down and wept under the conviction of his lying he became the comforter in his turn don't cry little schnapsie don't cry i didn't mean to frighten you alfred is a good man and i am sure even if you quarrel he will never throw it the mumbling passed into a kiss on her wet cheek xii that night after a long passionate vigil in her bedroom little schnapsie wrote a letter dearest alfred this will be as painful for you to read as for me to write i find at the eleventh hour i cannot marry you i owe it to you to state my reason as you know i did not consent to our love being crowned by union till my father had given his consent i now find that this consent was not the free outcome of my father's soul that it was only to promote my happiness try to imagine what it means for an old man of seventy odd years to wrench himself away from all his life long prejudices and you will realize what he has been trying to do for me but the wrench was beyond his strength he is breaking his heart over it and i fear even wandering in his mind you will say let us again consent to wait for a contingency which i am not cold blooded enough to set down more openly but i do not think it is fair to you to let you risk your happiness further by keeping it entangled with mine a new current of thought has been set going in my mind if a religion that i thought all formalism is capable of producing such types of abnegation as my dear father then it must too somewhere or other hold in solution all those ennobling ingredients all those stimuli to self sacrifice which the world calls christian perhaps i have always misunderstood we were so badly taught perhaps the prosaic epoch of judaism into which i was born is only transitional perhaps it only belongs to the middle classes for i know i felt more of its poetry in my childhood perhaps the future will develop or recultivate its diviner sides and lay more stress upon the life beautiful and thus all this blind instinct of isolation may prove only the conservation of the race for its nobler future when it may still become in very truth a witness to the highest a chosen people in whom all the families of the earth may be blessed i do not know all this is very confused and chaotic to me to night i only know i can hold out no certain hope of the earthly fulfilment of our love i too feel in transition and i know not to what but dearest alfred shall we not be living the christian life the life of abnegation more truly if we give up the hope of personal happiness forgive me darling the pain i am causing you and thus help me to bear my own your friend till death florence it was an hour past midnight ere the letter was finished and when it was sealed a sense of relief at remaining in the jewish fold stole over her though she would scarcely acknowledge it to herself and impatiently analyzed it away as hereditary and despite it if she slept on the letter would it ever be posted but the house was sunk in darkness she was the only creature stirring and yet she yearned to have the thing over irrevocable perhaps she might venture out herself with her latch key there was a letter box at the street corner she lit a candle and stole out on the landing casting a monstrous shadow which frightened her in her over wrought mood it almost seemed an uncanny creature grinning at her her mother's death bed rose suddenly before her her mother's voice cried ah florrie do not fret i will find thee a bridegroom was this the bridegroom was this the only one she would ever know father father she shrieked with sudden terror a door was thrown open a figure shambled forth in carpet slippers a dear homely reassuring figure holding the coloured handkerchief which had helped to banish him from the drawing room his face was smeared his eyelids under the pushed up horn spectacles were red he too had kept vigil what is it what is it little schnapsie nothing i i i only wanted to ask you if you would be good enough to post this letter to night good enough why i shall enjoy a breath of air he took the letter and essayed a roguish laugh as his eye caught the superscription ho ho he pinched her cheek so we mustn't let a day pass without writing to him eh she quivered under this unforeseen misconception no she echoed with added firmness we mustn't let a day pass but go to bed at once little schnapsie you look quite pale if you stay up so late writing him letters you won't make him a beautiful bride no she repeated i won't make him a beautiful bride she heard the hall door close gently upon his cautious footsteps and her eyes dimmed with divine tears as she thought of the joy that awaited his return iii noah's ark iii noah's ark i on a summer's day toward the close of the first quarter of the nineteenth century after christ peloni walked in the good place of the frankfort judengasse and pondered at times he came to a standstill and appeared to study the inscriptions on the tumbled tombstones or the carven dragons shields and stars but his black eyes burnt inward and he saw less the tragedy of jewish death than the tragedy of jewish life for the good place was the place of death here alone in frankfort in this shut in bit of the shut in jew street was true peace for israel the rest of the jew street offered comparative tranquillity even for the living yet when ninety years before peloni was born the great fire had raged therein the inhabitants had locked the ghetto gate against the christians less fearful of the ravaging flames than of their fellow citizens even to day if he ventured outside the judengasse peloni must tread delicately the foot path was not for him he must plod on the dusty road with all the other beasts in some places the very road was too holy for him and any passer by might snatch off his hat in punishment for his breaking bounds the ragged street urchin or the staggering drunkard might cry to him 'jud' mach mores jew mind your manners some ten years ago the frankfort ghetto had been verbally abolished by a civilized archduke caught up in the wave of napoleonic toleration peloni had shared in the exultation of the jews at the final dissipation of the long night of mediaevalism he had written a hebrew poem on it brilliantly rhymed congested with apt quotations from bible and talmud the whole making an acrostic upon the name of the enlightened karl theodor von dalberg henceforth israel would take his place among the peoples honour on his brow love in his heart manhood in his limbs a gracious letter of acknowledgment from the archduke was displayed in the window of peloni's little bookselling establishment amid the door amulets phylacteries praying shawls purim scrolls and hebrew volumes but now the prince had been ousted napoleon was dead everywhere the ghetto gates were locked again and the poem lay stacked on the remainder shelves in vain had the grateful jews hastened to fight for the fatherland tendered it body and soul poor little curly haired peloni had been attacked in the streets as an alien that very morning roysterers had raised the old cry of hep hep fatal immemorial cry ghastly heritage of the crusades century after century that cry had gone echoing through europe century after century the jews thought they had lived it down bought it down died it down but no it rose again buoyant menacing irresponsible ah what a fool he had been to hope there was no hope rarely indeed since the dark ages had persecution flaunted itself so openly riots and massacres were breaking out all over germany and in his own ghetto peloni had seen sights that had turned his patriotism to gall and crushed his trust in the christian his beautiful bubble dreams of the millennium rothschild himself whose house in the judengasse with the sign of the red shield had been the centre of the attack was well nigh unable to maintain his position in the town and these local successes inflamed the jew haters everywhere let the children of israel be sold to the english recommended a popular pamphlet of the period who could employ them in their indian plantations instead of the blacks the best plan would be to purge the land entirely of this vermin either by exterminating them or as pharaoh and the people of meiningen wuerzburg and frankfort did by driving them from the country oh god thought peloni as his mind ran over the long chain from pharaoh to frankfort evermore to wander stoned and derided thou hast set a mark on his forehead but his punishment is greater than he can bear the dead lay all around him one upon another new red stones shouldering aside the gray stones that told to boot of the death of the centuries and the pressure of all this struggle for death room had raised the earth higher than the adjacent paths he thought of how these dead had always come here even in their lifetime when the enemy raged outside here they had put the women and children and gone back to the synagogue to pray ah the cowards always oscillating betwixt cemetery and synagogue why did they not live why did they not fight yes but they had fought fought for germany and this was germany's reply but could they not fight for themselves then with money with the sinews of war if not with the weapons with gold if not with steel could they not join financial forces all through the world but no there was no such solidarity as the christians dreamed and they were too mixed up with the european world to dream of self concentration even while the frankfort rothschild's house was surrounded by rioters the paris rothschild was giving a ball to the elite of diplomatic society no the old jews were right there was only the synagogue and the cemetery but was there even the synagogue that too was dead the living faith the vivid realization of israel's hope which had made the dark ages endurable and even luminous were only to be found now among fanatics whose blind ignorance and fierce clinging to the dead letter and the obsolete form counterbalanced the poetry and sublimity of their persistence in the middle ages peloni felt his poems would have been absorbed into the liturgy for when the liturgy and the religion were alive they took in and gave out like all living things but no the synagogue of to day was dead remained only the cemetery jude verrek jew die like a beast yes what else was there to do for he was not even a rothschild he told himself with whimsical anguish only a poor poet unread unknown unhealthy a shadow that only found substance to suffer a set of heart strings across which every wind that blew made a poignant passionate music a lamentation incarnate a voice of weeping in the wilderness a bubble blown of tears a dream a mist a nobody in short peloni the dead generations drew him he fell weeping passionately upon a tomb ii there seemed an unwonted stir in the judengasse when peloni returned to it was there another riot threatening he thought as he passed along the narrow street of three storied frame houses most of them gabled and all marked by peculiar signs and figures the bear or the lion or the garlic or the red shield rothschild outside the synagogue loitered a crowd and as he drew near he perceived that there was a long proclamation in a couple of folio sheets nailed on the door it was doubtless this which was being discussed by the little groups he had already noted about the synagogue door the throng was so thick that he could not get near enough to read it himself but fortunately some one was engaged in reading it aloud for the benefit of those on the outskirts 'wherefore i mordecai manuel noah citizen of the united states of america late consul of said states to the city and kingdom of tunis high sheriff of new york counsellor at law and by the grace of god governor and judge of israel have issued this my proclamation' a derisive laugh from a dwarfish figure in the crowd interrupted the reading father noah come to life again it was the possemacher or wedding jester who was not sparing of his wit even when not professionally engaged a foreigner an american sneered a more serious voice who made him ruler in israel that's what the wicked israelite asked moses cried peloni curiously excited nun nun go on cried others 'announcing to the jews throughout the world that an asylum is prepared and hereby offered to them where they can enjoy that peace comfort and happiness which have been denied them through the intolerance and misgovernment of former ages an asylum in a free and powerful country where ample protection is secured to their persons their property and religious rights an asylum in a country remarkable for its vast resources the richness of its soil and the salubrity of its climate where industry is encouraged education promoted and good faith rewarded a land of milk and honey where israel may repose in peace under his vine and fig tree and where our people may so familiarize themselves with the science of government and the lights of learning and civilization as may qualify them for that great and final restoration to their ancient heritage which the times so powerfully indicate' the crowd had grown attentive peloni's face was pale as death what was this great thing fallen so unexpectedly from the impassive heaven his hopelessness had challenged but the possemacher captured the moment father noah's drunk again a great laugh shook the crowd but peloni dug his nails into his palms read on read on he cried hoarsely 'the place of refuge is in the state of new york the largest in the american union and the spot to which i invite my beloved people from the whole world is called grand island' peloni drew a deep breath his face had now changed to the other extreme and was flushed with excitement noah's ark shot the possemacher dryly and had his audience swaying hysterically for god's sake brethren cried peloni this is no joke have you forgotten already that here we are only animals and they went in two by two said the possemacher the clean beasts and the unclean beasts hush hush let us hear from some of the crowd 'here i am resolved to lay the foundation of a state named ararat' ah what did i say the exultant possemacher shrieked at peloni ha ha ha laughed the crowd noah's ark resting on ararat the dullest saw that peloni was taken aback for a moment but why should not the place of israel's ark of refuge be named ararat he asked of his neighbours if only his name wasn't noah they answered that makes it even more appropriate he murmured but noah's ark was the nickname that kills though the reader continued it was only to an audience exhilarated by a sense of arabian nights fantasy but the elaborate description of the grandeurs of this grand island and the eloquent passages about the century of right and the ancient oracles restored peloni's enthusiasm to fever heat it is too long said the reader wearying at last peloni rushed forward and took up the task the first sentence exalted him still further 'in god's name i revive renew and reestablish the government of the jewish nation under the auspices and protection of the constitution and the laws of the united states confirming and perpetuating all our rights and privileges our name our rank and our power among the nations of the earth as they existed and were recognized under the government of the judges of israel' peloni's voice shook with fervour as he began the next sentence 'it is my will' he stretched out his hand with an involuntary regal gesture the spirit of noah was entering into him and he felt almost as if it was he who was re creating the jewish nation 'it is my will that a census of the jews throughout the world be taken that those who are well treated and wish to remain in their respective countries shall aid those who wish to go that those who are in military service shall until further orders remain true and loyal to their rulers 'i command' peloni read the words with expansive magnificence his poet's soul vibrating to that other royal dreamer's across the great atlantic 'that a strict neutrality be maintained in the pending war betwixt greece and turkey 'i abolish forever' peloni's hand swept the air 'polygamy among the jews' but where have we polygamy interrupted the possemacher 'as it is still practised in africa and asia' read on peloni severely i'm off at once for africa and asia cried the marriage jester pretending to run good business for me there you'll find better business in america said peloni scathingly for do not all our austrian young men fly thither to marry seeing that at home only the eldest son may found a family a pretty fatherland indeed to be a citizen of a step fatherland listen on the contrary to the noble tolerance of the jew 'christians are freely invited' ah do you know who'll go broke in a narrow faced zealot the missionaries peloni continued hastily 'ararat is open too to the caraites and the samaritans the black jews of india and africa shall be welcome our brethren in cochin china and the sect on the coast of malabar all are welcome' ha ha ha laughed a burly jew so we're to live with the blacks enough of this joke but peloni went on solemnly 'a capitation tax on every jew of three silver shekels per annum ' ah now we have got to it and a great roar broke from the crowd not a bad geschaeft eh and they winked he is no fool this noah peloni's blood boiled do you believe everybody is like yourselves he cried listen 'i do appoint the first day of next adar for a thanksgiving day to the god of israel for his divine protection and the fulfilment of his promises to the house of israel i recommend peace and union among ourselves charity and good will to all toleration and liberality toward our brethren of all religions ' didn't i say a missionary in disguise murmured the zealot peloni ended with tremulous emotion 'i humbly entreat to be remembered in your prayers and earnestly do i enjoin you to keep the charge of the holy god to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his commandments and his judgments and testimonies as written in the laws of moses that thou mayest prosper in all thou doest and whithersoever thou turnest thyself 'given under our hand and seal in the state of new york on the d of ab in the fiftieth year of american independence' peloni's efforts to organize a company of pilgrims to the new jerusalem brought him only heart ache the very rabbi who had good naturedly consented to circulate the fantastic foreigner's invitation tapped his forehead significantly a visionary of good intentions doubtless but still a visionary besides according to our dogmas god alone knows the epoch of the israelitish restoration he alone will make it known to the whole universe by signs entirely unequivocal and every attempt on our part to reassemble with any political national design is forbidden as an act of high treason against the divine majesty mr noah has doubtless forgotten that the israelites faithful to the principles of their belief are too much attached to the countries where they dwell and devoted to the governments under which they enjoy liberty and protection not to treat as a mere jest the chimerical consulate of a pseudo restorer noah's a madman and you're an infant peloni's friends told him since the destruction of the temple he quoted in retort the gift of prophecy has been confined to children and fools you are giving up a decent livelihood they warned him you are throwing it into the atlantic 'cast thy bread upon the waters and it shall return to thee after many days' but in the meantime 'man doth not live by bread alone' as you please but don't ask us to throw up our comfortable home here comfortable home and peloni grew almost apoplectic as he reminded them of their miseries persecution they shrugged their shoulders it comes only now and again like a snow storm and we crawl through it that's just it the lack of manliness the poisoned atmosphere bah the goyim refuse us equal rights because they know we're their superiors let us not jump from the frying pan into the fire so peloni sailed for new york alone iii he was rather disappointed to find no other pilgrim even on the ship true there was one jew but the business paradise of new york was his goal across this waste of waters and of noah's ark he had never heard peloni's panegyric of grand island was rendered ineffective by his own nebulous conception of its commercial possibilities he passed the slow days in the sailing vessel polishing up his english the literature of which he had long studied in new york peloni's hopes revived major noah for it appeared he was an officer of militia likewise was in everybody's mouth editor of the national advocate the leading organ of the bucktails or tammany party a journalist whose clever sallies and humorous paragraphs were widely enjoyed an author of excellent travels a playwright of the first distinction whose patriotic dramas were always given on the fourth of july a critic regarded as sir oracle a politician lawyer and man of the world a wit the gay centre of every gathering surely in this lion of new york who was also the lion of david israel had at last found a deliverer they called him madman down in frankfort did they well let them come here and see he wrote home to the scoffers of the judengasse all the information about the great man that was in the very air of the american city though the man himself he had only as yet corresponded with he told the famous story of how when noah was canvassing for the office of high sheriff of new york it was urged that no jew should be put into an office where he might have to hang a christian to which noah had retorted wittily pretty christian to have to be hanged and you all fancied 'father noah' would fall to pieces before the possemacher's wit peloni commented with vengeful satisfaction i rejoice to say that noah will never have anything to do with a possemacher for he is president of the old bachelors' club the members of which are pledged never to marry he told of noah's adventurous career of how when he was a mere boy clerk in the auditor's office of his native philadelphia congress had voted him a hundred dollars for his precocious preparation of the actuary tables for the eight per cent loan of the three duels at charleston in which he had vindicated at once the courage of the jew and the policy of american resistance to great britain of his consulate in tunis his capture at sea by the british fleet during the war his release on parole that enabled him to travel about england of his genius for letters a very david in israel of his generosity to hundreds of strugglers of his quixotic disdain of money of his impoverishing himself by paying two hundred thousand dollars of other people's debts as the price of his impulsive shrieval action in throwing open the doors of the debtor's jail when the yellow fever broke out within yes wrote peloni exultantly in new york they talk no more of shylock and with all the temptations to christian fellowship or pagan free living a pillar of the synagogue nay israel's one hope in all the world it was a wonderful moment when peloni at last invited to call on the judge of israel palpitated on the threshold of his study and gazed blinkingly at the great man enthroned before his writing table amid elegant vistas of books and paintings what a noble poetic vision it seemed to him the broad brow with the tumbled hair the long delicate featured face tapering to a narrow chin environed with whiskers but clean of beard or even of mustache so that the mobile sensitive mouth was laid bare peloni's glance also took in a handsome black coat with a decoration on the lapel a high peaked collar a black puffy bow a frilled shirt and a very broad jewelled cuff over a white long fingered hand that held a tall quill with a great breadth of feather ah come in said the governor of israel waving his quill you are peloni of frankfort come three thousand miles to kiss the hem of your garment noah permitted the attention i am obliged to you for your hebrew poem in honour of my project he said urbanely i approve of hebrew it is a link that binds us to our forefathers i am myself editing a translation of the book of jasher you will have found my verses a very poor expression of your divine ideas you use a difficult hebrew but the general drift seemed to show you had caught the greatness of my conception ah yes i have lived in judengasse oppressed and derided but there is worse than oppression there is inward stagnation of the spiritual life my idea came to me in tunis where the jews are little oppressed you know president madison appointed me consul of the united states for the city and kingdom of tunis one of the most respectable and interesting stations in the regencies of barbary i had long desired to visit the country of dido and hannibal to trace the field of zama and seek out the ruins of utica whose sites i believe i have now successfully established but it was my main design to investigate the condition of the barbary jews of whom you will remember we have no account later than benjamin of tudela's in the thirteenth century but do not stand take a chair well i found our brethren to the number of seven hundred thousand controlling everything in barbary farming the revenue regulating the coinage keeping the dey's jewels and almost his person in short anything but persecuted though of course the majority were miserably poor they did not know i was a jew though secretary monroe recalled me because i was and it was monroe's doctrine that judaism would be an obstacle to the discharge of my functions absurd the catholic priest was allowed to sprinkle the consulate with holy water the barefooted franciscan received an alms nor did i fail to acknowledge by a donation the decorated branch sent on palm sunday by the greek bishop and as for the slaves i assure you they were not backward in coming to ask favours the only people who never came to me were precisely the jews i went about among them incognito so to speak like haroun alraschid among his subjects hence i was able to see all the evils that will never be eliminated till israel is again a nation ah your words are the words of wisdom you touch the root of the evil it is what i have always told them noah rose to his feet displaying a royal stature in harmony with his broad shoulders yes i resolved it should be mine to elevate my people to make them hold up their heads worthily in this century of freedom and enlightenment it is the ark of the convenant as well as of the deluge which will rest on ararat true and like the first noah i may become the progenitor of a new world i have communications from the four corners of the earth you are the type of thousands who will flee from the rotting tyrannies of europe into the great free republic which i shall direct he began to pace the room peloni had visions of great black lines of pilgrims converging from every quarter of the compass but this grand island is it yours he inquired timidly i have bought thousands of acres of it i and a few others who believe in the great future of our people jews no not jews capitalists who know that we shall become the commercial centre of the new world that is of the world of the future peloni groaned and jews will not believe we must go to the gentiles jews will only put their money into gentile schemes will build always for others never for themselves it is the same everywhere alas for israel it is what i preach why administer barbary for a savage dey when you can administer grand island for yourself seven hundred thousand jews in savage barbary and throughout these vast free states not seven thousand ah but they will come they will come ararat will gather its millions but will there be room the state of new york replied noah impressively is the largest in the union containing forty three thousand two hundred and fourteen square miles divided into fifty five counties and having six thousand and eighty seven post towns and cities together with six million acres of cultivated land the constitution is founded on equality of rights we recognize no religious differences in our seven thousand free schools and gymnasia four hundred thousand children of every religion are being educated here in this great and progressive state the long wandering of my beloved people shall end but grand island itself murmured peloni feebly come here and noah unrolled a great map see how nobly it is situated in the niagara river near the world famed falls which will supply water power for our machinery it is twelve miles long and from three to seven broad and contains seventeen thousand acres lake erie is two hundred and seventy miles long and borders new york pennsylvania and ohio as well as canada and see by navigable streams this great lake is connected with all that wonderful chain of lakes by short canals we shall connect with the illinois and mississippi and trade with new orleans and the gulf of mexico through the ontario see here we traffic with quebec montreal and touch the great atlantic the niagara falls as i said turn our machinery the fur trade the lumber trade all is ours our cattle multiply our lands wave with harvests we are the centre of the world the capital of the future and look see what the albany gazette says 'here the hebrews can have their jerusalem without fearing the legions of titus here they can erect their temple without dreading the torches of frenzied soldiers here they can lay their heads on their pillows at night without fear of mobs of bigotry and persecution' peloni drew a long breath enraptured by this holy el dorado sparkling on the map amid its tributary lakes and rivers you will see the eighteenth chapter of isaiah fulfilled noah went on for what is the 'land shadowing with wings which is beyond the rivers of ethiopia' which shall send messengers to a nation scattered and peeled what but america shadowing us with the wings of its eagle as it is written elsewhere 'i will bear thee on eagle's wings' it is true the english bible translates 'woe to the land' but this is a mistranslation it should be 'hail to the land' also the word 'goumey' they translate 'bulrushes' 'that sendeth messengers in vessels of bulrushes' but does not 'goumey' also mean 'rush impetus' and is it not therefore a prophecy of those new steam vessels that are beginning to creep up one of which has just crossed from england to india erelong they will be running between america and all the world it is the lord making ready for the easy ingathering of his people ay and along these lakes the prophet's finger swept the map will be heard the panting of mighty steam monsters all making for ararat by the way ararat lies here and he indicated a spot of the island opposite tonawanda on the mainland peloni bent down and poetically pressed his lips to the spot like jehuda halevi kissing the holy soil there is no one in possession there he inquired anxiously maybe a few iroquois indians said noah but they will not have to be turned out like the hittites and amorites and jebusites by our ancestors no murmured peloni of course not they are our own brothers carried away by the king of assyria there can be not the slightest doubt that the red indians are the lost ten tribes of israel what cried peloni vastly excited i shall publish a book on the subject yes in worship dialect language sacrifices marriages divorces burials fastings purifications punishments cities of refuge divisions of tribes high priests wars triumphs 'tis our very tradition then i suppose one could lodge with them i am anxious to settle in ararat at once you can scarcely settle there till the forest is cleared said the great man arching his eyebrows the forest repeated peloni taken aback ah you are dismayed you are a european accustomed to ready made cities we americans we change continents while you wait build up aladdin's palaces over night as soon as i can manage to go over the ground i will plan out the city you haven't been there yet gasped peloni ah my dear peloni when should i find time to travel all the way to buffalo a busy editor lawyer playwright what not true the time that other men give to domestic happiness the president of the old bachelors' club is able to give to his fellow men but the slow canal voyage at this moment there was a knock at the door and a servant inquired if major noah could see his tailor ah a good augury cried the major here is the tailor come to try on my robe of governor and judge of israel the man bore an elaborate robe of crimson silk trimmed with ermine which he arranged about noah's portly person making marks with pins and chalk where it could be made to fit better do you like it said noah puffing himself out regally peloni's uneasiness vanished doubt was impossible before these magnificent realities ah the americans were wonderful i had to go through our annals noah explained to find which period of our government we could revive kingship was opposed to the sentiment of these states in the epoch of the judges i found my ideal indeed what is the president of the united states but a shophet a judge of israel ah you are looking at that painting of me i shall have to be done again in my new robes that elegant creature who hangs beside me is miss leesugg the hebe of english actresses as she appeared in my 'she would be a soldier or the plains of chippewa' there is a caricature of my uncle aaron j phillips as the turkish commander in my 'grecian captive' dear me shall i ever forget how he tumbled off that elephant ha ha ha that is miss johnson in my 'yusef carmatti or the siege of tripoli' the black and white is a fancy sketch of 'marion or the hero of lake george' a play i wrote for the reopening of the park theatre and to celebrate the evacuation of new york by the british in ah i was there major said the tailor it was bully but the house was so full of generals and colonels you could hardly hear a word fortunately for me laughed noah yes i asked them to come in full uniform for the eclat of the occasion which reminds me here is a ticket for you for the play murmured peloni as he took it noah started and looked at him keenly but his flush of anger faded before peloni's innocent eyes no no he explained for the opening ceremony of the foundation of ararat peloni's black eyes shone there will be a great crush and only ticket holders can be admitted into the church into the church echoed peloni paling yes said the judge of israel impressively as he stood before a glass to adjust the graceful folds of his crimson robe our fellow citizens in buffalo have been good enough to lend us the episcopal church for the ceremony what ceremony he faltered as horrid images swept before him and he heard all the way from frankfort the taunting cry of missionary the laying of the foundation stone of ararat laying the foundation stone in a church peloni was puzzled ah said the major misunderstanding him it seems strange to you nursed in the musty lap of europe but here in this land of freedom and this century of enlightenment all men are brothers but surely the foundation stone should be laid on grand island it would have been desirable but so many will wish to be present at this great celebration buffalo alone has some thirteen hundred inhabitants how should we get them across there are scarcely any boats to be had and ararat is twelve miles away no no it is better to hold our ceremony in buffalo it is after all only a symbolism the corner stone is already being inscribed in hebrew and english 'hear o israel the lord is our god ararat a city of refuge for the jews founded by mordecai m noah in the month tishri corresponding with september in the fiftieth year of american independence' the sonorous recitation by the shophet in his crimson and ermine robe somewhat restored peloni's equanimity but when will the actual city be begun he asked the shophet waved his hand airily a matter of days but are you sure we can build there look at the map here is grand island ours here is the site of ararat it is all as plain as a pikestaff and talking of pikestaffs it would not be a bad idea to plant a staff on ararat with the flag of israel peloni took fire yes yes let me go and plant it i'll journey night and day you shall plant it said the shophet graciously yes i'll have the flag made at once the property man at the park theatre will attend to it for me the lion of judah and seven stars it shall be waving on grand island before you open the celebration in buffalo peloni went out like a lion his head in the seven stars could it be possible that to him peloni had fallen the privilege of proclaiming the new jerusalem iv after the bustle of new york the scattered village of buffalo was restful but somewhat chilling to the ghetto bred poet with his quick brain unaccustomed to the slow processes of nature buffalo with its muddy unpaved streets and great trees up which squirrel and chipmunk ran was still half in and half out of mother earth man's artifice ruled in the high street with its stores and inns some of which were even of brick but in the byways every now and then a primitive log cabin broke the line of frame cottages and in the outskirts cows and pigs walked about unconcernedly it was a reminder of all that would have to be done in ararat ere a temple could shine like a lighthouse of righteousness to the tossing nations but when peloni learned that it was only twelve years since the scarcely born village had been burnt down by the british and indians in the war he felt reencouraged warming himself at the flame so to speak and when he found that the citizens were all agog about ararat and the church celebration that it divided interest with the erie canal the hanging of the three thayers and the recent reception of general lafayette at the eagle tavern his heart expanded in a new poem it was indeed an auspicious moment for noah's scheme all eyes were turned on the coming celebration of the opening of the great canal to be the terminus of which buffalo had fought victoriously against black rock golden visions of the future gleamed almost tangibly and amid the general magnificence noah's ornate dream took on equal solidity endless capital would be directed into the neighbourhood of buffalo for ararat was only twelve miles away besides all the great men of buffalo and there were many had been honoured with elaborate cards of invitation to the grand ceremony of the foundation stone a few old baptist farmers were surly about the threatened vast jewish immigration but the majority proclaimed with righteous warmth that the glorious american constitution welcomed all creeds and that there was money in it peloni looked about for a jew to guide him but could find none finally a seneca indian from the camp just below buffalo undertook to look for the spot it was with a strange thrill that peloni's eyes rested for the first time on a red indian was this indeed a long lost brother of his he cried shalom aleikhem in hebrew but the indian despite noah's theories did not seem to understand ultimately the dialogue was carried on in the few words of broken english which the indian had picked up from the trappers and in the gesture language in which with his genius for all languages peloni was soon at home and in truth he did find at heart some subtle sympathy with this copper coloured savage which was not called out by the busy citizens of buffalo on a sunlit morning bearing his flagstaff with the flag wrapped round it a blanket and a little store of provisions for camping out over night peloni slipped into the birch canoe and the indian paddled off for miles they glided in silence along the sparkling niagara lone denizens of a lonely world suddenly peloni thought of the judengasse of frankfort and for a moment it seemed to him that he must be dreaming what a few short months ago he was selling prayer books and phylacteries in the shadow of the old high gabled houses and now in a virgin district of the new world in company with a half naked red indian he was going to plant the flag of judah on an island forest and to found the new jerusalem what would they say his old friends if they could see him now and he the possemacher what winged jest would he let fly a perception of the monstrous fantasy of the thing stole on poor peloni was he perhaps dreaming after all no there was the niagara river the village of black rock on his right hand and on the other side of the gorge the lively fort erie and the poplar fringed canadian shore and there too on the map noah had given him ararat lay waiting the indian paddled imperturbably throwing back the sparkling water with a soft soothing sound peloni lapsed into more pleasurable reflections how beautiful was this great free place of sun and wind of water and forest after the noisome jew street he was not dreaming nor thank god was noah strange indeed that thus should deliverance for israel be wrought yet what was israel's history but a series of miracles and his peloni's humble hand was to plant the flag that had lain folded and inglorious these twenty centuries they glided by a couple of little islands duly marked on the map and then a great wooded dark purple mass rose to meet them with a band of deep orange on the low coast line it was grand island peloni whispered a prayer obeying the map marked by noah the canoe glided round the island keeping to the american side as they shot past a third little island a dull booming began to be audible what is that peloni's face inquired the indian smiled not go many miles farther he indicated the rapids soon then whizz then big jump niagara dead fortunately ararat was due much sooner than niagara as they drew near the fourth of the little islands which lay betwixt grand island and the mainland of the states and saw the tonawanda creek emptying itself into the river peloni signed to the indian to land for it was here that ararat was to arise the landing was easy the river here being shallow and the bank low the beauty of the spot as it lay wild and fresh from god's hand in the golden sunlight moved peloni to tears the indian who seemed curious as to his movements and willing to share his mid day meal tied his canoe to a basswood tree and followed the standard bearer there was a glorious medley of leafy life elm oak maple linden pine wild cherry wild plum which peloni could only rejoice in without differentiating it by names and as the oddly assorted couple walked through the sun dappled glades they startled a world of scurrying animal life snipe and plover and partridges and singing birds squirrels and rabbits and even deer that frisked and fluttered unprescient of the new jerusalem that menaced their immemorial inheritance the joy of city building had begun at last to dawn on peloni the immense pleasure to the human will of beginning afresh of shaking off the pressure of the ages of inscribing free ideas on the plastic universe as he wandered at random in search of a suitable spot on which to plant the flagstaff the romance of this great american world thrilled him of this vast continent won acre by acre from nature and the savage covering itself with splendid cities a retrospective sympathy with the citizens of buffalo and their coming canal warmed his breast of a sudden he heard a screaming and looking up he observed two strange huge birds upon a blasted pine eagles said the laconic indian eagles and peloni's heart leaped with a remembrance of noah's words here under their wings shall our flag be unfurled and that blasted tree is israel that shall flourish again he dug the pole into the earth a breeze caught the flag and the folds flew out and the lion of judah and the seven stars flapped in the face of an inattentive universe peloni intoned the hebrew benediction closing his eyes in pious ecstasy blessed art thou o lord our god who hast kept us alive and preserved us and enabled us to reach this day as he opened his eyes he perceived in the distance high in air rising far above the island a great mist of shining spray amid which rainbows netted and tangled themselves in ineffable dream like loveliness at the same instant his ear caught over the boom of the rapids the first hint of another a mightier a more majestic roar niagara murmured the indian but peloni's eyes were fixed on the celestial vision the shechinah he whispered the divine presence that rested on the tabernacle and on solomon's temple and that has returned at last to ararat v the booming of cannon from the court house and from the terrace facing the lake saluted the bright september dawn and reminded the citizens of buffalo that the messianic day was here but they needed no reminding the great folk had laid out their best clothes military insignia and masonic regalia had been furbished up troops guarded st paul's church and kept off the swarming crowd the first act of the great historic drama mordecai manuel noah or the redemption of israel passed off triumphantly to the music of patriotic american airs the procession which marched at eleven from the lodge through the chief streets did honour to this marshaller of stage pageants order of procession grand marshal col potter on horseback music military citizens civil officers state officers in uniform president and trustees of the corporation tyler stewards entered apprentices fellow crafts master masons senior and junior

square and compass borne by a master mason the judge of israel in black wearing the judicial robes of crimson silk trimmed with ermine and a richly embossed golden medal suspended from the neck a master mason royal arch masons knights templars at the church door there was a halt the troops parted to right and left the pageant passed through into the crowded church gay with the summer dresses of the ladies the band played the grand march from judas maccabaeus the organ pealed out the jubilate on the communion table lay the corner stone of ararat the morning service was read by the rev mr searle in full canonicals the choir sang before jehovah's awful throne then came a special prayer for ararat and passages from jeremiah zephaniah and the psalms charged with divine promises and consolations for the long suffering of israel idyllic pictures of the messianic future symbolized by the silver cups with wine corn and oil that lay on the corner stone at last arose with that crimson silk robe trimmed with ermine thrown over his stately black attire and with the richly embossed golden medal hanging from his neck the master of the show the dramatist of the real the humorist without a sense of humour the dreamer of the ghetto and american man of action the governor and judge of israel the shophet in brief mordecai manuel noah he delivered a great discourse on the history of israel and its present reorganization which filled more than five columns of the newspapers and was heard with solemn attention by the crowded christian audience save a few indians and his own secretary not a single jew was present to hold in check the orator's oriental imagination then the glittering procession filed back to the lodge and the brethren and the military dined joyously at the eagle tavern and noah's wit and humour returned for the after dinner speech he withdrew early in order to write a full account of the proceedings for the buffalo patriot extra a salvo of twenty four guns rounded off the great day of israel's restoration vi meantime peloni on his island awaited the coming of its ruler he heard faintly the cannonade that preceded and concluded the laying of the foundation stone in the chancel of the church and he expected noah the next day at the latest but the next day passed and no noah peloni fed on the remains of his corn and drank from the river but though his indian guide was gone and he was a prisoner he had no fear of starvation because he saw the wigwams of another indian encampment across the river and occasionally a party of them would glide past in a large canoe despite hunger his sensations on this first day were delicious the poet in him responded rapturously to the appeal of all this new life to feel the brotherhood of wild creatures to sleep under the stars in the vast night to watch the silent passionate beauty of the sunrise ripening to the music of the birds on the second day his eyes were gladdened by the oncoming of a boat rowed by two whites they proved to be a stone mason and his man and they bore provisions a letter and newspapers from noah my dear peloni a hurried line to report a glorious success thank heaven a finer day and more general satisfaction has not been known on any similar occasion all the dignity and talent of the neighbourhood for miles was present i hear that a vast concourse also assembled at tonawanda expecting that the ceremonies would be at grand island but that many of them came up in carriages in time to hear my inaugural speech you will see that the newspapers especially the buffalo patriot extra have reported me fully showing how they realize the importance of this world stirring episode in israel's history their comments too are for the most part highly sympathetic of course the new york herald will sneer but then bennett was once in my employ on the courier and enquirer they tell me that you duly set out to plant the flag of judah and i assume it is now by god's grace waving over ararat heaven bless you my heart is too full for words i had hoped to find time to day to behold the sublime spectacle myself but urgent legal business calls me back to new york but i am resolved to start the city without delay and the bearers of this have my plan for a little monument of brick and wood with the simple inscription 'ararat founded by mordecai manuel noah ' from the summit of which the flag can wave i leave you to superintend the same and take any measures you please to promote the growth of the city and to receive as my representative the inflowing immigrants from the ghettos of the world i appoint you moreover keeper of the records to you shall be given to write the new book of the chronicles of israel my friend mr smith one of the proprietors of the island will communicate with you on behalf of the shareholders as occasion arises expect me shortly perhaps with my bride for i am entering into holy wedlock with the most amiable and beautiful of her sex and meantime receive my blessing mordecai manuel noah judge of israel pro ab seixas secr pro tem while the little monument was building and the men were coming to and fro in boats peloni made friends with the indians the smoke wreaths of whose lodges hovered across the river and he picked up a little of their language also he explored his island drawn by the crescendo roar of niagara it was at burnt island bay that he had his first if distant view of the falls themselves the rapids gurgling and plunging with foam and swirl and eddy quickened his blood but the cataracts disappointed him after that rainbow glimpse of the upper spray and it was not till he got himself landed on the canadian shore and saw the monstrous rush of the vast tameless flood toward the great leap that he felt the presence and the power that were to be with him for the rest of his days the bend of the horse shoe was hidden by a white spray mountain that rose above its topmost waters as they hurled themselves from green solidity to creamy mist and as he looked lo the enchanting rainbows twinkled again and he had a sense as of the smile of god of the love of that awful unfathomable being eternally persistent while the generations rise and fall like vaporous spray the tide was low and drawn by an irresistible fascination he adventured down among the rocks near the foot of the fall but a tingling storm of spray smote him half blind and wholly breathless and all he could see was a monstrous misty brocken spirit upreared and in his ears were a thousand thunders a wild elemental passion swelled and lifted him yes force force was the secret of things the vast primal energies that sent the stars shining and the seas roaring force life strength that was what israel needed it had grown anaemic slouching along its airless judengassen oh to fight to fight like the warriors who went out against the greeks who defended the holy city against the romans for the lord is a man of war and he shouted the cry of david blessed be the lord my rock who teacheth my hands to war and my fingers to fight but he stopped smitten by an ironic memory this very blessing was uttered every sabbath twilight in every ghetto by every bloodless worshipper to a melancholy despairing melody in the lightless dusk of the synagogues the monument was speedily erected and being hollow proved useful for peloni to sleep in as the october nights grew chilly and thus peloni lived a latter day crusoe he had now procured fishing tackle and grew dexterous in luring black bass and perch and whitefish from the river also he had found out what berries he might eat occasionally a boat would sell him cornmeal from buffalo but his savings were melting away and he preferred to forage for himself relishing the wild flavour of uncivilized living he even wished it were possible to eat the birds or the rabbits he could have killed but as various points of jewish law forbade such diet there was no use in buying a musket or a bow and arrow so his relations with the animal world remained purely amicable the robins and bluebirds and thrushes sang for him the woodpeckers tapped on his monument to wake him in the morning the blue jays screamed without wrath and the partridges drummed unmartially the squirrels frolicked with him and the rabbits lost their shyness one would have said these were the lost ten tribes he had found peloni had become not the keeper of the records but the keeper of noah's ark vii so winter came and there was still nothing to record save the witchery of the muffled white world with its blue shadows and fantastic ice friezes and stalactites great icicles glittered on the rocks showing all the hues beneath peloni wrapped in his blanket crouched on his monument over a log that burnt in an improvised grate it was very lonely he had heard from no one neither from noah nor smith nor any jewish or even indian pilgrim to the new jerusalem and the stock of winter provisions had exhausted his little hoard of coin the old despair began to twine round him like some serpent of ice as he listened in such moods to the distant thunder of niagara which waxed louder as the air grew heavier till it quite dominated the ever present rumble of the rapids the sound took on endless meanings to his feverish brain now it was no longer the voice of the eternal being it was the endless plaint of israel beseeching the deaf heaven the roar of prayer from some measureless synagogue now it was the raucous voice of persecution the dull bestial roar of malicious multitudes and again it was the voice of the whole earth groaning and travailing and the horror of it was that it would not stop it dropped on his brain this falling water as on the prisoner's in the mediaeval torture chamber could no one stop this turning wheel of the world jar it grindingly to a standstill spring wore slowly round again the icicles melted the friezes dripped away the fantastic mufflers slipped from the trees and the young buds peeped out and the young birds sang the river flowed uncurdled the cataracts fell unclogged in peloni's breast alone the ice did not melt no new sap stirred in his veins the very rainbows on the leaping mist were now only reminders of the biblical promise that the world would go on forever forever the wheel would turn and israel wander homeless and at last one sunny day a boat arrived with a message from the master alas even noah had abandoned ararat i am beginning to see he wrote that our only hope is palestine zion alone has magnetism for the jew the great war against gog prophesied in ezekiel will be in palestine gog is russia and the russians are the descendants of the joint colony of meshech and tubal and the little horn of daniel russia in an attempt to wrest india and turkey from the english and the turks will make the holy land the theatre of a terrible conflict but yet in the end in jerusalem shall we reerect solomon's temple the ports of the mediterranean will be again open to the busy hum of commerce the fields will again bear the fruitful harvest and christian and jew will together on mount zion raise their voices in praise of him whose covenant with abraham was to endure forever in whose seed all the nations of the earth are to be blessed this is our destiny peloni wandered automatically to the apex of the island at burnt ship bay and stood gazing meaninglessly at the fragments of the sunken ships before him raced the rapids frenziedly anxious for the great leap even so he thought had noah and he dreamed israel would haste to ararat and niagara maintained its mocking roar its roar of gigantic laughter reerect solomon's temple in palestine a ruined country to regenerate a ruined people a land belonging to the turks centre of the fanaticisms of three religions and countless sects a soil which even to noah was the destined theatre of world shaking war as he lifted his swimming eyes he saw to his astonishment that he was no longer alone a tall majestic figure stood gazing at him a grave sorrowful indian feathered and tufted habited only in buckskin leggings and girdled by a belt of wampum a musket in his hand showed he had been hunting and a canoe peloni now saw tethered to the bank indicated he was going back to his lodge peloni knew from his talks with the tonawanda indians opposite ararat that this was red jacket the famous chief of the iroquois the ancient lords of the soil peloni tendered the salute due to the royalty stamped on the man red jacket ceremoniously acknowledged the obeisance then they gazed silently at each other the puny stooping scholar from the german ghetto and the stalwart kingly savage tell me said red jacket imperiously what nation are you that build a monument but never a city like the other white men nor even a camp like my people great chief replied peloni in his best iroquois we are a people that build for others i would ye would build for my people then for these white men sweep us back farther farther till there is nothing but and he made an eloquent gesture implying the sweep into the river into the jaws of the hurrying rapids yet methinks i heard of a plan of your people of a great pow wow of your chiefs in a church of a great city to be born here it is dead before birth said peloni strange mused red jacket scarce twenty summers ago joseph elliott came here to plan out his city on a soil that was not his and lo this buffalo rises already mighty and menacing to morrow it will be at my wigwam door and we another gesture hopeless yet full of regal dignity rounded off the sentence and in that instant it was borne in upon peloni that they were indeed brothers the jew who stood for the world that could not be born again and the red indian who stood for the world that must pass away yes they were both doomed israel had been too bent and broken by the long dispersion and the long persecution the spring was snapped he could not recover he had been too long the pliant protege of kings and popes he had prayed too many centuries in too many countries for the simultaneous welfare of too many governments to be capable of realizing that government of his own for which he likewise prayed this pious patience this rejection of the burden on to the shoulders of messiah and miracle was it more than the veil of unconscious impotence ah better sweep oneself away than endure the long ignominy and niagara laughed on may i have the privilege of crossing in your canoe he asked you are not afraid said red jacket the rapids are dangerous here afraid peloni's inward laughter seemed to himself to match niagara's when he got to the mainland he made straight for the fall he was on the american side and he paused on the sward on the very brink of the tameless cataract that had for immemorial ages been driving itself backward by eating away its own rock his fascinated eyes watched the curious smooth purring slide of the vast mass of green water over the sharp edges unending unresting the eternal revolution of a maddening imperturbable wheel o that blind wheel turning turning while the generations waxed and waned one succeeding the other without haste or rest or possibility of pause creatures of meaningless majesty shadows of shadows dreaming of love and justice and fading into the kindred mist while this solid green cataract roared and raced through aeons innumerable stable as the stars thundering in majestic meaninglessness and suddenly he threw himself into its remorseless whirl and was sucked down into the monstrous chaos of seething waters and whirled and hurled amid the rocks battered and shapeless but still holding noah's letter in his convulsively clinched hand while the rainbowed spray leapt impassively heavenward the corner stone of ararat lies in the rooms of the buffalo historical society and no one who copies the inscription dreams that it is the gravestone of peloni and while the very monument has mouldered away in ararat buffalo sits throned amid her waters the queen city of the empire state with the world's commerce at her feet and from their palaces of medina sandstone the christian railroad kings go out to sail in their luxurious yachts vessels not of bulrushes but driven by steam as predicted by mordecai manuel noah governor and judge of israel iv the land of promise iv the land of promise i telegraph how many pieces you have in this wise did the steamship company convey to the astute agent its desire to know how many russian jews he was smuggling out of the pale into the steerage of its atlantic liner the astute agent's task was simple enough the tales he told of america were only the clarification of a nebulous vision of the land flowing with milk and honey that hovered golden rayed before all these hungry eyes to the denizens of the pale in their cellars in their gutter streets in their semi subterranean shops consisting mainly of shutters and annihilating one another's profits to the congested populations newly reinforced by the driving back of thousands from beyond the pale and yet multiplying still by an improvident reliance on providence to the old people pauperized by the removal of the vodka business to christian hands and the young people dammed back from their natural outlets by pan slavic ukases and clogged with whimsical edicts and rescripts the astute agent's offer of getting you through germany without even a russian passport by a simple passage from libau to new york was peculiarly alluring it was really almost an over baiting of the hook on the part of the too astute agent to whisper that he had had secret information of a new thunderbolt about to be launched at the pale whereby the period of service for jewish conscripts would be extended to fifteen years and the area of service would be extended to siberia three hundred and seventy seven pieces ran his telegram in reply in a letter he suggested other business he might procure for the line confine yourself to freight the company wrote cautiously for even under sealed envelopes you cannot be too careful the more the better freight the word was not inexact did not even the government reports describe these exploiters of the muzhik as in some places packed in their hovels like salt herrings in a barrel as sleeping at night in serried masses in sties which by day were tallow or leather factories to be shipped as cargo came therefore natural enough nevertheless each of these pieces being human after all had a history and one of these histories is here told ii nowhere was the poverty of the pale bitterer than in the weavers' colony in which srul betrothed himself to biela the dowries which had been wont to kindle so many young men's passions had fallen to freezing point and biela if she had no near prospect of marriage could console herself with the knowledge that she was romantically loved even the attraction of kest temporary maintenance of the young couple by the father in law was wanting in biela's case for the simple reason that she had no father both her parents having died of the effort to get a living for marriage portion and kest biela could only bring her dark beauty and even that was perhaps less than it seemed for you scarcely ever saw biela apart from her homely quasi mother her elder sister leah who like the original leah had tender eyes which combined with a pock marked face to ensure for her premature recognition as an old maid the inflamed eyelids were the only legacy leah's father had left her from srul's side though his parents were living came even fainter hope of the wedding canopy srul's father was blind perhaps a further evidence that the local hygienic conditions were nocuous to the eye in particular and srul himself who had occupied most of his time in learning to weave rabbinic webs had only just turned his attention to cloth though heaven was doubtless pleased with the gear of gemara he had gathered in his short sixteen years the old weaver had in more than one sense seen better days before his affliction and the great factories came on days when the independent hand weaver might sit busily before the loom from the raw dawn to the black midnight taking his meals at the bench days when moreover the piece of satin faced cloth was many ells shorter but they make up for the extra length he would say with pathetic humour by cutting the pay shorter the same sense of humour enabled him to bear up against the forced rests that increasing slackness brought the hand weavers while the factories whirred on now is the proverb fulfilled he cried to his unsmiling wife for there are two sabbaths a week alas as the winter grew older and colder it became a week of sabbaths the wheels stood still in all the colony not a spool was reeled it was unprecedented gradually the factories had stolen the customers some sat waiting dazedly for the raw yarns they knew could no longer come at this season others left the suburb in which the colony had drowsed from time immemorial and sought odd jobs in the town in the frowning shadows of the factories but none would enter the factories themselves though these were ready to suck them in on one sole condition ah here was the irony of the tragedy the one condition was the one condition the poor weavers could not accept it was open to them to reduce the week of sabbaths to its ancient and diurnal dimensions provided the sabbath itself came on sunday nay even the working day offered them was less and the wage was more than their own the deeper irony within this irony was that the proprietor of every one of these factories was a brother in israel jeshurun grown fat and kicking even the old blind man's composure deserted him when it began to be borne in on his darkness that the younger weavers meditated surrender the latent explosives generated through the years by their perusal of un jewish books in insidious yiddish versions now bade fair to be touched to eruption by this paraded prosperity of wickedness wickedness that had even discarded the caftan and shaved the corners of its beard but thou apple of my eye the old man said to srul thou wilt die rather than break the sabbath father quoted the youth with a shuddering emotion at the bare idea i have been young and now i am old but never have i seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging for bread my son a true spark of the patriarchs and the old man clasped the boy to his arms and kissed him on the pious cheeks down which the ear locks dangled but if biela should tempt thee so that thou couldst have the wherewithal to marry her put in his mother who could not keep her thoughts off grandchildren not for apples of gold mother will i enter the service of these serpents nevertheless biela is fair to see and thou art getting on in years murmured the mother leah would not give biela to a sabbath breaker said the old man reassuringly yes but suppose she gives her to a bread winner persisted the mother do not forget that biela is already fifteen only a year younger than thyself but leah kept firm to the troth she had plighted on behalf of biela even though the young man's family sank lower and lower till it was at last reduced from the little suburban wooden cottage with the spacious courtyard to one corner of a large town cellar whose population became amphibious when the vistula overflowed and srul kept firm to the troth israel had plighted with the sabbath bride even when his father's heart no longer beat so could not be broken the old man remained to the last the most cheerful denizen of the cellar perhaps because he was spared the vision of his emaciated fellow troglodytes he called the cellar arba kanfos after the four cornered garment of fringes which he wore and sometimes he said these were the four corners from which according to the prophets god would gather israel iii in such a state of things an agent scarcely needed to be astute pieces were to be had for the picking up the only trouble was that they were not gold pieces the idle weavers could not defray the passage money still less the agent's commission for smuggling them through if i only had a few hundred roubles srul lamented to leah i could get to a land where there is work without breaking the sabbath a land to which biela could follow me when i waxed in substance leah supported her household of three for there was a younger sister tsirrele who being only nine did not count except at meal times on the price of her piece work at the christian umbrella factory where by a considerate russian law she could work on sunday though the christians might not thus she earned by literal sweating in a torrid atmosphere three roubles all except a varying number of kopecks every week and when you live largely on black bread and coffee you may in the course of years save a good deal even if you have three mouths therefore leah had the sum that srul mentioned so wistfully put by for a rainy day when there should be no umbrellas to make and as the sum had kept increasing the notion that it might form the nucleus of an establishment for biela and srul had grown clearer and clearer in her mind which it tickled delightfully but the idea that now came to her of staking all on a possible future was agitating we might perhaps be able to get together the money she said tentatively but she shook her head and the russian proverb came to her lips before the sun rises the dew may destroy you srul plunged into an eager recapitulation of the agent's assurances and before the eyes of both the marriage canopy reared itself splendid in the land of promise and the figure of biela flitted crowned with the bridal wreath but what will become of your mother leah asked srul's soap bubbles collapsed he had forgotten for the moment that he had a mother she might come to live with us leah hastened to suggest seeing his o'erclouded face ah no that would be too much of a burden and tsirrele too is growing up tsirrele eats quite as much now as she will in ten years' time said leah laughing as she thought fondly of her dear beautiful little one her gay whimsies and odd caprices and my mother does not eat very much said srul wavering in this way srul became a piece and was dumped down in the land of promise iv to the four females left behind odd fragments of two families thrown into an odder one the movements of the particular piece srul were the chief interest of existence the life in the three roomed wooden cottage soon fell into a routine leah going daily to the tropical factory biela doing the housework and dreaming of her lover little tsirrele frisking about and chattering like the squirrel she was and srul's mother dozing and criticising and yearning for her lost son and her unborn grandchildren by the time srul's first letter with its exciting pictorial stamp arrived from the land of promise the household seemed to have been established on this basis from time immemorial i had a lucky escape god be thanked srul wrote for when i arrived in new york i had only fifty one roubles in my pocket now it seems that these rich americans are so afraid of being overloaded with paupers that they will not let you in if you have less than fifty dollars unless you can prove you are sure to prosper and a dollar my dear biela is a good deal more than a rouble however blessed be the highest one i learned of this ukase just the day before we arrived and was able to borrow the difference from a fellow passenger who lent me the money to show the commissioners of course i had to give it back as soon as i was passed and as i had to pay him five roubles for the use of it i set foot on the soil of freedom with only forty six however it was well worth it for just think beloved biela if i had been shipped back and all that money wasted the interpreter also said to me 'i suppose you have got some work to do here' 'i wish i had' i said no sooner had the truth slipped out than my heart seemed turned to ice for i feared they would reject me after all as a poor wretch out of work but quite the contrary it seemed this was only a trap a snare of the fowler poor caminski fell into it you remember the red haired weaver who sold his looms to the maggid's brother in law he said he had agreed to take a place in a glove factory it is true you know that some polish jews have made a glove town in the north so the poor man thought that would sound plausible hence you may expect to see caminski's red hair back again unless he takes ship again from libau and tells the truth at the second attempt i left him howling in a wooden pen and declaring he would kill himself rather than face his friends at home with the brand on his head of not being good enough for america he did not understand that contract labourers are not let in protection is the word they call it hence i thank god that my father his memory for a blessing taught me to make truth the law of my mouth as it is written verily was the word of the talmud tractate sabbath fulfilled at the landing stage 'falsehood cannot stay but truth remains forever' with god's help i shall remain here all my life for it is a land overflowing with milk and honey i had almost forgotten to tell my dove that the voyage was hard and bitter as the egyptian bondage not because of the ocean over which i passed as easily as our forefathers over the red sea but by reason of the harshness of the overseers who regarded not our complaints that the meat was not kosher as promised by the agent also the butter and meat plates were mixed up i and many with me lived on dry bread nor could we always get hot water to make coffee when my biela comes across the great waters god send her soon she must take with her salt meat of her own from the first srul courageously assumed that the meat would soon have to be packed nay that leah might almost set about salting it at once even the slow beginnings of his profits as a peddler did not daunt him a great country he wrote on paper stamped with the stars and stripes with an eagle screaming on the envelope no special taxes for the jews permission to travel where you please the schools open freely to our children no passports and papers at every step above all no conscription no wonder the people call it god's own country truly as it is written this is none other but the house of god this is the gate of heaven and when biela comes it will be heaven letters like this enlarged the little cottage as with an american room brightened it as with a fresh wash of blue paint despite the dreary grind of the week sabbaths and festivals found the household joyous enough the wedding canopy of srul and biela was a beacon of light for all four which made life livable as they struggled toward it nevertheless it came but slowly to meet them nearly three years oozed by before srul began to lift his eye toward a store the hereditary weaver of business combinations had emerged tardily from beneath the logic weaver and the cloth weaver but of late he had been finding himself if i could only get together five hundred dollars clear he wrote to leah for that is all i should have to pay down for a ladies' store near broadway and just at the foot of the stairs of the elevated railway what a pity i have only four hundred and thirty five dollars stock and goodwill and only five hundred dollars cash the other five hundred could stand over at five per cent if i were once in the store i could gradually get some of the rooms above there is already a parlour in which i shall sleep and then as soon as i was making a regular profit i could send biela and mother their passage money and my wife could help 'the boss' behind the counter to hasten the rosy day leah sent thirty five roubles and presently sure enough srul was in possession and a photograph of the store itself came over to gladden their weary eyes and dilate those of the neighbours the photograph of srul which had come eighteen months before was not so suited for display since his peaked cap and his caftan had been replaced by a jacket and a bowler and but for the ear locks which were still in the picture he would have looked like a factory owner in return srul received a photograph of the four taken together for economy's sake leah with her arm around biela's waist and tsirrele sitting in his mother's lap v but a long wearying struggle was still before the new boss and two years crept along with their turns of luck and ill luck of bargains and bad debts ere the visionary marriage canopy that seemed to span the atlantic began to stand solidly on american soil the third year was not half over ere srul actually sent the money for biela's passage together with a handsome waist from his stock for her to wear but biela was too timid to embark alone without srul's mother whose fare srul could not yet manage to withdraw from his capital leah of course offered to advance it but biela refused this vehemently because a new hope had begun to spring up in her breast why should she be parted from her family at all since her marriage had been delayed these five and a half years a few months more or less could make no difference let leah's savings then be for leah's passage and tsirrele's and to give her a start in the new world it rains even in america and there are umbrella factories there too she urged you will make twice the living look at srul and there was a new fear too which haunted biela's aching heart but which she dared not express to leah leah's eyes were getting worse the temperature of the factory was a daily hurt and then too she had read so many vilely printed yiddish books and papers by the light of the tallow candle what if she were going blind what if while she biela was happy with srul leah should be starving with tsirrele no they must all remain together and she clung to her sister with tears to leah the prospect of witnessing her sister's happiness was so seductive that she tried to take the lowest estimate of her own chances of finding work in new york her savings almost eaten up by the journey could not last long and it would be terrible to have to come upon srul for help a man with a wife and if god were good children to say nothing of his old mother no she could not risk tsirrele's bread but the increased trouble with her eyes turned her in favour of going though curiously enough for a side reason quite unlike biela's leah too was afraid of a serious breakdown though she would not hint her fears to any one else from her miscellaneous yiddish reading she had gathered that miraculous eye doctors lived in koenigsberg now a journey to germany was not to be thought of if she went to america however it could be taken en route it would be a sort of saving and few things appealed to leah as much as economy this was why some four months later the ancient furniture of the blue washed cottage was sold off and the quartette set their faces for america by way of germany the farewell to the home of their youth took place in the cemetery among the high shouldered hebrew speaking stones leah and biela passionately invoked the spirits of their dead parents and bade them watch over their children the old woman scribbled srul and biela's interlinked names over the flat tomb of a holy scholar take their names up to the highest one she pleaded entreat that their quiver be full for the sake of thy righteousness more dead than alive the four pieces with their bundles arrived at hamburg days and nights of travelling packed like freight in hard dirty wooden carriages the endless worry of passports tickets questions hygienic inspections and processes the illegal exactions of petty officials the strange phantasmagoria of places and faces all this had left them dazed only two things kept up their spirits the image of srul waiting on the transatlantic wharf in hymeneal attire and the pooh pooh of the miraculous koenigsberg doctor reassuring leah as to her eyes there was nothing radically the matter even the inflamed eyelids though incurable because hereditary would improve with care peasant like leah craved a lotion the sea voyage and the rest will do you more good than my medicines and don't read so much not a groschen did leah have to pay for the great specialist's services it was the first time in her hard life anybody had done anything for her for nothing and her involuntary weeping over this phenomenon tended to hurt the very eyelids under attention they were still further taxed by the kindness of the jewish committee at hamburg on the look out to smooth the path of poor emigrants and overcome their dietary difficulties but it was a crowded ship and our party reverted again to freight with some of the other females they were accommodated in hammocks swung over the very dining tables so that they must needs rise at dawn and be cleared away before breakfast the hot oily whiff of the cooking engines came through the rocking doorway of the quartette only tsirrele escaped sea sickness but baby was too accustomed to be petted and nursed to be able suddenly to pet and nurse and she would spend hours on the slip of lower deck peering into the fairy saloons which were vivified by bugle instead of bell and in which beautiful people ate dishes fit for the saints in heaven by an effort of will leah soon returned to her role of factotum but the old woman and biela remained limp to the end fortunately there was only one day of heavy rolling and battened down hatches for the bulk of the voyage the great vessel brushed the pack of waves disdainfully aside and one wonderful day amid unspeakable joy new york arrived preceded by a tug and by a boat that conveyed inquiring officials the great statue of liberty on bedloe's island upheld its torch to light the new comers' path srul there he is on the wharf dear old srul god bless him despite his close cropped hair and his shaven ear locks ah heaven be praised don't you see him waving ah but we too must be content with waving for here only the tschinovniks of the gilded saloon may land the freight must be packed later into rigid gangs according to the ship's manifest transferred to a smaller steamer and discharged on ellis island a little beyond bedloe's vi and at ellis island a terrible thing happened unforeseen a shipwreck in the very harbour as the freight filed slowly along the corridor cages in the great bare hall like cattle inspected at ports by the veterinary surgeon it came into the doctor's head that leah's eye trouble was infectious granular lids contagious he diagnosed it on paper and this diagnosis was a flaming sword that turned every way guarding against leah the land of promise but it is not infectious she protested in her best german it is only in the family so i perceive dryly replied america's guardian angel who was now examining the obvious sister clinging to leah's skirts and in biela heavy eyed with sickness and want of sleep his suspicious vision easily discovered a reddish rim of eyelid that lent itself to the same fatal diagnosis and sent her to join leah in the dock of the rejected the fresh faced tsirrele and the wizen faced mother of srul passed unscrutinized and even the dread clerk at the desk who asked questions was content with their oath that the wealthy srul would support them srul was indeed sent for at once as tsirrele was too pretty to be let out under the mere protection of a polish crone when the full truth that neither she nor biela was to set foot in new york burst through the daze in leah's brain her protest grew frantic but my sister has nothing the matter with her nothing o gnaediger herr have pity the koenigsberg doctor the great doctor told me i had no disease no disease at all and even if i have my sister's eyes are pure as the sunshine look mein herr look again see and she held up biela's eyelids and passionately kissed the wet bewildered eyes she is to be married my lamb her bridegroom awaits her on the wharf send me back gnaediger herr i ought not to have come but for god's sake don't keep biela out don't she wrung her hands but the marriage card had been played too often in that hall of despairing dodges oh herr doktor and she kissed the coat tail of the ship's doctor plead for us speak a word for her the ship's doctor spoke a word on his own behalf it was he who had endorsed the two girls' health certificates at hamburg and he would be blamed by the steamship company which would have to ship the sisters back free and even defray their expenses while in quarantine at the depot he ridiculed the idea that the girls were suffering from anything contagious but the native doctor frowned immovable leah grew hysteric it was the first time in her life she had lost her sane standpoint your own eye is affected she shrieked her dark pock marked face almost black with desperate anger if you cannot see that it is only because my sister has been weeping because she is ill from the voyage but she carries no infection she is healthy as an ox and her eye is the eye of an eagle she was ordered to be silent but she shrieked angrily the german doctors know but the americans have no bildung oh don't leah moaned biela throwing her arms round the panting breast what's the use but the irrepressible leah got an si ticket of special inquiry forced a hearing in the commissioners' court let her in kind gentlemen and send back the other one tsirrele will go back with me it does not matter about the little one the kind gentlemen on the bench were really kind but america must be protected you can take the young one and the old one both back with you the interpreter told her but they are the only ones we can let in leah and biela were driven back among the damned the favoured twain stood helplessly in their happier compartment even tsirrele the squirrel was dazed presently the spruce srul arrived to find the expected raptures replaced by funereal misery he wormed his way dizzily into the cage of the rejected it was not the etiquette of the pale to kiss one's betrothed bride but srul stared dully at biela without even touching her hand as if the atlantic already rolled again between them here was a pretty climax to the dreams of years my poor srul we must go back to hamburg to be married faltered biela and give up my store srul wailed here the dollar spins round we have now what one names a boom there is no land on earth like ours the forlornness of the others stung leah to her senses listen srul she said hurriedly it is all my fault because i wanted to share in the happiness i ought not to have come if we had not been together they never would have suspected biela's eyes who would notice the little touch of inflammation which is the most she has ever suffered from she shall come again in another ship all alone for she knows now how to travel is it not so biela my lamb i will see you on board and srul will meet you here although not till you have passed the doctor so that no one will have a chance of remembering you it will cost a heap alas but i can get some work in hamburg and the jews there have hearts of gold eh biela my poor lamb yes yes leah you can always give yourself a counsel and biela put her wet face to her sister's and kissed the pock marked cheek srul acquiesced eagerly no one remembered for the moment that leah would be left alone in the old world the problem of effecting the bride's entry blocked all the horizon yes yes said srul the mother will look after tsirrele and in less than three weeks biela will slip in no three weeks is too soon said leah we must wait a little longer till the doctor forgets oh but i have already waited so long whimpered srul leah's eyes filled with sympathetic tears i ought not to have made so much fuss now she will stick in the doctor's mind forgive me dear srul i will do my best and try to make amends leah and biela were taken away to the hospital where they remained isolated from the world till the steamer sailed back to hamburg herein generously lodged they had ample leisure to review the situation biela discovered that the new plan would leave leah deserted leah remembered that she would be deserting little tsirrele both were agreed that tsirrele must go back with them till they bethought themselves that her passage would have to be paid for as she was not refused and every kopeck was precious now let the child stay till i get back said biela then i will send her to you yes it is best to let her stay awhile i myself may be able to join you after all i will go back to koenigsberg and the great doctor will write me out a certificate that my affliction is not contagious at the very worst if even biela could not get in srul should sell his store and come back to the old world it would put off the marriage again but they had waited so long so let us cheer up after all and thank the lord for his mercies we might all have been drowned on the voyage thus the sisters' pious conclusion but though srul and his mother and tsirrele got on board to see them off and tsirrele gave graphic accounts of the wonders of the store and the rooms prepared for the bride to say nothing of the great city itself and srul brought biela and leah splendid specimens of his stock for their adornment yet it was a horrible thing for them to go back again without having once trodden the sidewalks of the land of promise and when the others were tolled off as by a funeral bell and became specks in a swaying crowd when the dock receded and the cheers and good byes faded and the waving handkerchiefs became a blur and the statue of liberty dwindled and the lone waste of waters faced them once more leah's optimism gave way a chill sinister shadow fell across her new plan some ominous intuition traversed her like a shudder and she turned away lest biela should see her tears vii this despair did not last long it was not in leah's nature to despair but her wildest hopes were exceeded when she set foot again in hamburg and explained her hard case to the good committee and a member gave her an informal hint which was like a flash of light from heaven its answer to her ceaseless prayer ellis island was not the only way of approaching the land of promise you could go round about through canada where they were not so particular and you could slip in by rail from montreal without attracting much attention true there was the extra expense expense leah would have gladly parted with her last rouble to unite biela with her bridegroom there must be no delay a steamer for canada was waiting to sail what a fool she had been not to think that out for herself yes but there was biela's timidity again to consider travel by herself through this unknown canada and then if they were not so particular why could not leah slip through likewise yes but my eyes are more noticeable i might again do you an injury we will separate at the landing stage and the frontier we will pretend to be strangers biela's wits were sharpened by the crisis well i can only lose the passage money said leah and resolved to take the risk she wrote a letter to srul explaining the daring invasion of new york overland which they were to attempt and was about to post it when biela said poor srul and if i shall not get in after all leah's face fell true she pondered he will have a more heart breaking disappointment than before let us not kindle their hopes after all if we get in we shall only be a few days later than our letter and then think of the joy of the surprise you are right biela and leah's face glowed again with the anticipated joy of the surprise the journey to canada was longer than to the states and the freight was less companionable there were fewer jews and women more stalwart shepherds miners and dock labourers when after eleven days land came it was not touched at but only remained cheeringly on the horizon for the rest of the voyage at last the sisters found themselves unmolested on one of the many wharves of montreal but they would not linger a day in this unhomely city the next morning saw them dazed and worn out but happy hearted dodging the monstrous catapults of the new york motor cars while a polish porter helped them with their bundles and convoyed them toward srul's store ah what ecstasy to be unregarded units of this free chaotic crowd outside the store what a wonderful store it was larger than the largest in the weavers' colony the sisters paused a moment to roll the coming bliss under their tongues they peeped in ah there is srul behind the counter waiting for customers ah ah he little knows what customers are waiting for him they turned and kissed each other for mere joy draw your shawl over your face whispered leah merrily go in and ask him if he has a wedding veil biela slipped in brimming over with mischief and tears yes miss said srul with his smartest store manner i want a wedding veil of white lace she said in yiddish at her voice srul started biela could keep up the joke no longer srul my darling srul she cried hysterically her arms yearning to reach him across the counter he drew back pale gasping for breath ah my dear ones blubbered leah rushing in god has been good to you after all but but how did you get in he cried staring never mind how we got in said leah every pock mark glistening with smiles and tears and where is tsirrele my dear little tsirrele she she is out marketing with the mother and the mother she is well and happy thank god said leah fervently and beckoned the porter with the bundles but but i let the room he said flushing i did not know that i could not afford never mind we will find a room the day is yet high she settled with the porter meantime srul had begun playing nervously with a pair of scissors he snipped a gorgeous piece of stuff to fragments what are you doing said biela at last oh i he burst into a nervous laugh and so you ran the blockade after all but but i expect customers every minute we can't talk now go inside and rest biela you will find a sofa in the parlour leah i want i want to talk to you leah flashed a swift glance at him as biela vaguely chilled moved through the back door into the revivifying splendours of the parlour something is wrong srul leah said hoarsely tsirrele is not here you feared to tell us he hung his head i did my best she is ill dead perhaps my beautiful angel he opened his eyes dead no married what to whom he turned a sickly white to me in all that long quest of the canopy leah had never come so near fainting as now the horror of ellis island was nothing to this that scene resurged and tsirrele's fresh beauty unflecked by the voyage came up luridly before her the baby whom the unnoted years had made a young woman of fifteen while they had been aging and staling biela but but this will break biela's heart she whispered heart broken how was i to know biela would ever get in he said trying to be angry was i to remain a bachelor all my life breaking the almighty's ordinance did i not wait and wait faithfully for biela all those years you could have migrated elsewhere she said faintly and ruin my connection and starve his anger was real by now besides i have married into the family it is almost the same thing and the old mother is just as pleased oh she and all the endured bitterness of the long years was in the exclamation all she wants is grandchildren no it isn't he retorted grandchildren with good eyes god forgive you was all the lump in leah's throat allowed her to reply she steadied herself with a hand on the counter striving to repossess her soul for biela's sake a customer came in and the tragic universe dwindled to a prosaic place in which ribbons existed in unsatisfactory shades of course we must go this minute leah said as srul clanked the coins into the till biela cannot ever live here with you now yes it is better so he assented sulkily besides you may as well know at once i keep open on the sabbath and that would not have pleased biela that is another reason why it was best not to marry biela tsirrele doesn't seem to mind the very ruins of her world seemed toppling now but this new revelation of tsirrele's and his own wickedness seemed only of a piece with the first indeed went far to account for it you break the sabbath after all he shrugged his shoulders we are not in poland any longer no dead flies here everybody does it shut the store two days a week i should get left and you bring your mother's gray hairs down with sorrow to the grave my mother's gray hairs are no longer hidden by a stupid black shaitel that is all i have explained to her that america is the land of enlightenment and freedom her eyes are opened i trust to god your father's peace be upon him are still shut said leah as she walked with slow steady steps into the parlour to bear off her wounded lamb v to die in jerusalem v to die in jerusalem i the older isaac levinsky grew and the more he saw of the world after business hours the more ashamed he grew of the russian rabbi whom heaven had curiously chosen for his father at first it seemed natural enough to shout and dance prayers in the stuffy little spitalfields synagogue and to receive reflected glory as the son and heir of the illustrious maggid preacher whose four hour expositions of scripture drew even west end pietists under the spell of their celestial crookedness but early in isaac's english school life for cocksure philanthropists dragged the younger generation to anglicization he discovered that other fathers did not make themselves ridiculously noticeable by retaining the gabardine the fur cap and the ear locks of eastern europe nay that a few o enviable sons could scarcely be distinguished from the teachers themselves when the guardian angels of the ghetto apprenticed him in view of his talent for drawing to a lithographic printer he suffered agonies at the thought of his grotesque parent coming to sign the indentures you might put on a coat to morrow he begged in yiddish the maggid's long black beard lifted itself slowly from the worm eaten folio of the babylonian talmud in which he was studying the tractate anent the payment of the half shekel head tax in ancient palestine if he took the money from the second tithes or from the sabbatical year fruit he was humming in his quaint sing song he must eat the full value of the same in the city of jerusalem as he encountered his boy's querulous face his dream city vanished the glittering temple of solomon crumbled to dust and he remembered he was in exile put on a coat he repeated gently nay thou knowest 'tis against our holy religion to appear like the heathen i emigrated to england to be free to wear the jewish dress and god hath not failed to bless me isaac suppressed a precocious damn he had often heard the story of how the cruel czar nicholas had tried to make his jews dress like christians so as insidiously to assimilate them away how the police had even pulled off the unsightly cloth coverings of the shaven polls of the married women to the secret delight of the pretty ones who then let their hair grow in godless charm and mixed up with this story were vaguer legends of raw recruits forced by their sergeants to kneel on little broken stones till they perceived the superiority of christianity how the maggid would have been stricken to the heart to know that isaac now heard these legends with inverted sympathies the blind fools thought the boy with ever growing bitterness to fancy that religion can lie in clothes almost as if it was something you could carry in your pockets but that's where most of their religion does lie in their pocket and he shuddered with a vision of greasy huckstering fanatics and just imagine if i was sweet on a girl having to see all her pretty hair cut off as for those recruits it served them right for not turning christians as if judaism was any truer and the old man never thinks of how he is torturing me all the sharp little stones he makes me kneel on and looking into the future with the ambitious eye of conscious cleverness he saw the paternal gabardine over glooming his life ii one friday evening after isaac had completed his 'prentice years there was anxiety in the maggid's household in lieu of the sabbath peace isaac's seat at the board was vacant the twisted loaves seemed without salt the wine of the consecration cup without savour the mother was full of ominous explanations perturb not the sabbath reproved the gabardined saint gently and quoted the talmud 'no man has a finger maimed but 'tis decreed from above isaac has gone to supper somewhere else suggested his little sister miriam children and fools speak the truth said the maggid pinching her cheek but they had to go to bed without seeing him as though this were only a profane evening and he amusing himself with the vague friends of his lithographic life they waited till the candles flared out and there seemed something symbolic in the gloom in which they groped their way upstairs they were all shivering too for the fire had become gray ashes long since the sabbath fire woman having made her last round at nine o'clock and they themselves being forbidden to touch even a candlestick or a poker the sunrise revealed to the unclosed eyes of the mother that her boy's bed was empty it also showed what she might have discovered the night before had religion permitted her to enter his room with a light that the room was empty too empty of his scattered belongings of his books and sketches god in heaven she cried her boy had run away she began to wring her hands and wail with oriental amplitude and would have torn her hair had it not been piously replaced by a black wig neatly parted in the middle and now grotesquely placid amid her agonized agitation the maggid preserved more outward calm perhaps we shall find him in synagogue he said trembling he has gone away he will never come back woe is me he has never missed the sabbath service the maggid urged but inwardly his heart was sick with the fear that she prophesied truly this england which had seduced many of his own congregants to christian costume had often seemed to him to be stealing away his son though he had never let himself dwell upon the dread his sermon that morning was acutely exegetical with no more relation to his own trouble than to the rest of contemporary reality his soul dwelt in old jerusalem and dreamed of israel's return thither in some vague millennium when he got home he found that the postman had left a letter his wife hastened to snatch it what dost thou he cried not to day when sabbath is out i cannot wait it is from him it is from isaac wait at least till the fire woman comes to open it for answer the mother tore open the envelope it was the boldest act of her life her first breach with the traditions the rabbi stood paralyzed by it listening as without conscious will to her sobbing delivery of its contents the letter was in hebrew for neither parent could read english and commenced abruptly without date address or affectionate formality this is the last time i shall write the holy tongue my soul is wearied to death of jews a blind and ungrateful people who linger on when the world no longer hath need of them without country of their own nor will they enter into the blood of the countries that stretch out their hands to them seek not to find me for i go to a new world blot out my name even as i shall blot out yours let it be as though i was never begotten the mother dropped the letter and began to scream hysterically i who bore him i who bore him hold thy peace said the father his limbs shaking but his voice firm he is dead 'the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord' to night we will begin to sit the seven days' mourning but to day is the sabbath my sabbath is over for aye thou hast driven my boy away with thy long prayers nay god hath taken him away for thy sins thou godless sabbath breaker peace while i make the consecration my isaac my only son we shall say kaddish mourning prayer for him but who will say kaddish for us peace while i make the consecration he got through with the prayer over the wine but his breakfast remained untasted iii re reading the letter the poor parents agreed that the worst had happened the allusions to blood and the new world seemed unmistakable isaac had fallen under the spell of a beautiful heathen female he was marrying her in a church and emigrating with her to america willy nilly they must blot him out of their lives and so the years went by over brooded by this shadow of living death the only gleam of happiness came when miriam was wooed and led under the canopy by the president of the congregation who sold haberdashery true he spoke english well and dressed like a clerk but in these degenerate days one must be thankful to get a son in law who shuts his shop on the sabbath one evening some ten years after isaac's disappearance miriam sat reading the weekly paper which alone connected her with the world and the fulness thereof when she gave a sudden cry what is it said the haberdasher nothing i thought and she stared again at the rough cut of a head embedded in the reading matter but no it could not be mr ethelred p wyndhurst whose versatile talents have brought him such social popularity is rumoured to have budded out in a new direction he is said to be writing a comedy for mrs donald o'neill who it will be remembered sat to him recently for the portrait now on view at the azure art club the dashing comedienne will it is stated produce the play in the autumn season mr wyndhurst's smart sayings have often passed from mouth to mouth but it remains to be seen whether he can make them come naturally from the mouths of his characters what had these far away splendours to do with isaac levinsky with isaac and his heathen female across the atlantic and yet and yet ethelred p wyndhurst was like isaac that characteristic curve of the nose those thick eyebrows and perhaps isaac had worked himself up into a portrait painter why not did not his old sketch of herself give distinction to her parlour her heart swelled proudly at the idea but no more probably the face in print was roughly drawn was only accidentally like her brother she sighed and dropped the paper but she could not drop the thought it clung to her wistful and demanding satisfaction the name of ethelred p wyndhurst whenever it appeared in the paper and it was surprising how often she saw it now though she had never noticed it before made her heart beat with the prospect of clews she bought other papers merely in the hope of seeing it and was not unfrequently rewarded involuntarily her imagination built up a picture of a brilliant romantic career that only needed to be signed isaac she began to read theatrical and society journals on the sly and developed a hidden life of imaginative participation in fashionable gatherings and from all this mass of print the name ethelred p wyndhurst disengaged itself with lurid brilliancy the rumours of his comedy thickened it was christened the sins of society it was to be put on soon it was not written yet another manager had bid for it it was already in rehearsal it was called the bohemian boy it would not come on this season miriam followed feverishly its contradictory career and one day there was a large picture of isaac isaac to the life she soared skywards but it adorned an interview and the interview dropped her from the clouds ethelred was born in brazil of an english engineer and a spanish beauty who performed brilliantly on the violin he had shot big game in the rocky mountains and studied painting in rome the image of her mother playing the violin in her preternaturally placid wig brought a bitter smile to miriam's lips and yet it was hard to give up ethelred now it seemed like losing isaac a second time and presently she reflected shrewdly that the wig and the gabardine wouldn't have shown up well in print that indeed isaac in his farewell letter had formally renounced them and it was therefore open to him to invent new parental accessories of course fool that she was how could ethelred p wyndhurst acknowledge the same childhood as isaac levinsky yes it might still be her isaac well she would set the doubt at rest she knew from the wide reading to which ethelred had stimulated her that authors appeared before the curtain on first nights she would go to the first night of the whirligig that was the final name and win either joy or mental rest she made her expedition to the west end on the pretext of a sick friend in bow and waited many hours to gain a good point of view in the first row of the gallery being too economical to risk more than a shilling on the possibility of relationship to the dramatist as the play progressed her heart sank though she understood little of the conversational paradoxes it seemed to her now she saw with her physical eye this brilliant belgravian world in the stalls as well as on the stage that it was impossible her isaac could be of it still less that it could be isaac's spirit which marshalled so masterfully these fashionable personages through dazzling drawing rooms and an undercurrent of satire against jews who tried to get into society by bribing the fashionables contributed doubly to chill her she shared in the general laughter but her laugh was one of hysterical excitement but when at last amid tumultuous cries of author isaac levinsky really appeared isaac transformed almost to a fairy prince as noble a figure as any in his piece isaac the proved master spirit of the show the unchallenged treader of all these radiant circles then all miriam's effervescing emotion found vent in a sobbing cry of joy isaac she cried stretching out her arms across the gallery bar but her cry was lost in the applause of the house iv she wrote to him care of the theatre the first envelope she had to tear up because it was inadvertently addressed to isaac levinsky her letter was a gush of joy at finding her dear isaac of pride in his wonderful position who would have dreamed a lithographer's apprentice would arrive at leading the fashions among the nobility and gentry but she had always believed in his talents she had always treasured the water colour he had made of her and it hung in the parlour behind the haberdasher's shop into which she had married he too was married they had imagined and gone to america but perhaps he was married although in england would he not tell her of course his parents had cast him out of their hearts though she had heard mother call out his name in her sleep but she herself thought of him very often and perhaps he would let her come to see him she would come very quietly when the grand people were not there nor would she ever let out that he was a jew or not born in brazil father was still pretty strong thank god but mother was rather ailing hoping to see him soon she remained his loving miriam she waited eagerly for his answer day followed day but none came when the days passed into weeks she began to lose hope but it was not till the whirligig which she followed in the advertisement columns was taken off after a briefer run than the first night seemed to augur that she felt with curious conclusiveness that her letter would go unanswered perhaps even it had miscarried but it was now not difficult to hunt out ethelred p wyndhurst's address and she wrote him anew still the same wounding silence after the lapse of a month she understood that what he had written in hebrew was final that he had cut himself free once and forever from the swaddling coils of gabardine and would not be dragged back even within touch of its hem she wept over her second loss of him but the persistent thought of him had brought back many tender childish images and it seemed incredible that she would never really creep into his life again he had permanently enlarged her horizon and she continued to follow his career in the papers worshipping it as it loomed grandiose through her haze of ignorance gradually she began to boast of it in her more english circles and so in course of time it became known to all but the parents that the lost isaac was a shining light in high heathendom and a vast secret admiration mingled with the contempt of the ghetto for ethelred p wyndhurst v in high heathendom a vast secret contempt mingled with the admiration for ethelred p wyndhurst he had it is true a certain vogue but behind his back he was called a jew he did not deserve the stigma in so far as it might have implied financial prosperity his numerous talents had only availed to prevent one another from being seriously cultivated he had had a little success at first with flamboyant pictures badly drawn and well paragraphed he had written tender verses for music and made quiet love to ugly and unhappy society ladies he was an assiduous first nighter and was suspected of writing dramatic criticisms even of his own comedy and in that undefined social segment where kensington and bohemia intersect he was a familiar figure a too familiar figure old fogies grumbled with an unenviable reputation as a diner out for the sake of the dinner yet some of the people who called him sponge were not averse from imbibing his own liquids when he himself played the gracious host he was appearing in that role one sunday evening before a motley assembly in his dramatically furnished studio nay he was in the very act of biting into a sandwich scrupulously compounded with ham when a telegram was handed to him another of those blessed actresses crying off he said i wonder how they ever manage to take up their cues then his face changed as he hurriedly crumpled up the pinkish paper mother is dying no hope she cries to see you have told her you are in london father consents come at once miriam he put the crumpled paper to the gas and lit a new cigarette with it as i thought he said smiling when a woman is an actress as well as a woman vi after his wife died vainly calling for her isaac the old maggid was left heart broken it was as if his emotions ran in obedient harmony with the dictum of the talmud whoso sees his first wife's death is as one who in his own day saw the temple destroyed what was there for him in life now but the ruins of the literal temple he must die soon and the dream that had always haunted the background of his life began to come now into the empty foreground if he could but die in jerusalem there was nothing of consequence for him to do in england his miriam was married and had grown too english for any real communion true his congregation was dear to him but he felt his powers waning other maggidim were arising who could speak longer to see and kiss the sacred soil to fall prostrate where once the temple had stood to die in an ecstasy that was already gan iden paradise could life indeed hold such bliss for him life that had hitherto proved a cup of such bitters life was not worth living he agreed with his long vanished brother rabbis in ancient babylon it was only a burden to be borne nobly but if life was not worth living death in jerusalem was worth dying jerusalem to which he had turned three times a day in praying whose name was written on his heart as on that of the mediaeval spanish singer with whom he cried who will make to me wings that i may fly ever eastward until my ruined heart shall dwell in the ruins of thee then will i bend my face to thy sacred soil and hold precious thy very stones yea e'en to thy dust shall i tender be life of the soul is the air of thy land and myrrh of the purest each grain of thy dust thy waters sweetest honey of the comb joyous my soul would be could i even naked and barefoot amid the holy ruins of thine ancient temple roam where the ark was shrined and the cherubim in the oracle had their home to die in jerusalem that were success in life here he was lonely in jerusalem he would be surrounded by a glorious host patriarchs prophets kings priests rabbonim they all hovered lovingly over its desolation whispering heavenly words of comfort but now a curious difficulty arose the maggid knew from correspondence with jerusalem rabbis that a russian subject would have great difficulty in slipping in at jaffa or beyrout even aided by bakhshish the only safe way was to enter as a british subject grotesque irony of the fates for nigh half a century the old man had lived in england in his gabardine and now that he was departing to die in gabardine lands he was compelled to seek naturalization as a voluntary englishman he was even compelled to account mendaciously for his sudden desire to identify himself with john bull's institutions and patriotic prejudices and to live as a free born englishman by the aid of a rich but pious west end jew who had sometimes been drawn eastwards by the maggid's exegetical eloquence all difficulties were overcome armed with a passport signed floridly as with a lion's tail rampant the maggid after a quasi death bed blessing to miriam by imposition of hands from the railway carriage window upon her best bonnet was whirled away toward his holy dying place vii such disappointment as often befalls the visionary when he sees the land of his dreams was spared to the maggid who remained a visionary even in the presence of the real beholding with spiritual eye the refuse laden alleys and the rapacious schnorrers beggars he lived enswathed as with heavenly love waiting for the moment of transition to the shining world to come and his supplications at the wailing wall for the restoration of zion's glory had despite their sympathetic fervour the peaceful impersonality of one who looks forward to no worldly kingdom to outward view he lived in the rare intervals when he was not at a synagogue or a house of learning somewhere up a dusky staircase in a bleak narrow court in one tiny room supplemented by a kitchen in the shape of a stove on the landing itself a centre of pilgrimage to schnorrers innumerable for whom the rich english maggid was an unexpected windfall rich and english were synonymous in hungry jerusalem but these beggars' notion of charity was so modest and the coin of the realm so divisible that the maggid managed to gratify them at a penny a dozen at uncertain intervals he received a letter from miriam written in english the daughter had not carried on the learned tradition of the mother and so the maggid was wont to have recourse to the head of the philanthropic technical school for the translation of her news into hebrew there was however not much of interest miriam's world had grown too alien she could scrape together little to appeal to the dying man and so his last ties with the past grew frailer and frailer even as his body grew feebler and feebler until at last bent with great age and infirmity so that his white beard swept the stones he tottered about the sacred city like an incarnation of its holy ruin he seemed like one bent over the verge of eternity peering wistfully into its soundless depths surely god would send his death angel now then one day a letter from miriam wrenched him back violently from his beatific vision jerked him back to that other eternity of the dead past isaac isaac had come home had come home to find desolation had then sought his sister and was now being nursed by her through his dying hours his life had come to utter bankruptcy his possessions by a cruel coincidence had been sold up at the very moment that the doctors announced to him that he was a doomed man and his death bed was a premature hell of torture and remorse he raved incessantly for his father would he not annul the curse grant him his blessing promise to say kaddish for his soul that he might be saved from utter damnation would he not send his forgiveness by return for isaac's days were numbered and he could not linger on more than a month or so the maggid was terribly shaken he recalled bitterly the years of suffering crowned by isaac's brutal heedlessness to the cry of his dying mother but the more grievous the boy's sin the more awful the anger of god in store for him and the mother would not her own gan iden be spoilt by her boy's agonizing in hell for her sake he must forgive his froward offspring perhaps god would be more merciful then the merits of the father counted he himself was blessed beyond his deserts by the merits of the fathers of abraham isaac and jacob he had made the pilgrimage to jerusalem perhaps his prayers would be heard at the mercy seat with shaking hand the old man wrote a letter to his son granting him a full pardon for the sin against himself but begging him to entreat god day and night and therewith an anthology of consoling talmudical texts a man should pray for mercy even till the last clod is thrown upon his grave for repentance and prayer and charity avert the evil decree the charity he was himself distributing to the startled schnorrers the schoolmaster wrote out the envelope as usual but the maggid did not post the letter the image of his son's death bed was haunting him isaac called to him in the old boyish tones could he let his boy die there without giving him the comfort of his presence the visible assurance of his forgiveness the touch of his hands upon his head in farewell blessing no he must go to him but to leave jerusalem at his age who knew if he would ever get back to die there if he should miss the hope of his life but isaac kept calling to him and isaac's mother yes he had strength for the journey it seemed to come to him miraculously like a gift from heaven and a pledge of its mercy he journeyed to beyrout and after a few days took ship for marseilles viii meantime in the london ghetto the unhappy ethelred p wyndhurst found each day a year he was in a rapid consumption a disorderly life had told as ruinously upon his physique as upon his finances and with this double collapse had come a strange irresistible resurgence of early feelings and forgotten superstitions the avenging hand was heavy upon him in life what horrors yet awaited him when he should be laid in the cold grave the shadow of death and judgment over brooded him clouding his brain almost to insanity there would be no forgiveness for him his father's remoteness had killed his hope of that it was the nemesis he felt of his refusal to come to his dying mother god had removed his father from his pleadings had wrapped him in an atmosphere holy and aloof how should miriam's letter penetrate through the walls of jerusalem pierce through the stonier heart hardened by twenty years of desertion and so the day after she had sent it the spring sunshine giving him a spurt of strength and courage a desperate idea came to him if he could go to jerusalem himself if he could fall upon his father's neck and extort his blessing and then too he would die in jerusalem some half obliterated text sounded in his ears and the land shall forgive sin he managed to rise his betaking himself to bed he found as the sunshine warmed him had been mere hopelessness and self pity let him meet death standing aye journeying to the sun lands nay when miriam getting over the alarm of his up rising began to dream of the palestine climate curing him he caught a last flicker of optimism spoke artistically of the glow and colour of the east which he had never seen but which he might yet live to render on canvas winning a new reputation yes he would start that very day miriam pledged her jewellery to supply him with funds for she dared not ask her husband to do more for the stranger but long before ethelred p wyndhurst reached jaffa he knew that only the hope of his father's blessing was keeping him alive somewhere at sea the ships must have passed each other ix when the gabardined maggid reached miriam's house his remains of strength undermined by the long journey he was nigh stricken dead on the door step by the news that his journey was vain it is the will of god he said hopelessly the sinner was beyond mercy he burst into sobs and tears ran down his pallid cheeks and dripped from his sweeping white beard thou shouldst have let us know said miriam gently we never dreamed it was possible for thee to come i came as quickly as a letter could have announced me but thou shouldst have cabled cabled the process had never come within his ken but how should i dream he could travel thy letter said he was on his death bed i prayed god i might but arrive in time he was for going back at once but miriam put him to bed the bed isaac should have died in thou canst cable thy forgiveness at least she said and so without understanding this new miracle he bade her ask the schoolmaster to convey his forgiveness to his son isaac will inquire for me if he arrives alive he said the schoolmaster will hear of him it is a very small place alas for god hath taken away its glory by reason of our sins the answer came the same afternoon message just in time son died peacefully the maggid rent his bed garment thank god he cried he died in jerusalem better he than i isaac died in jerusalem god will have mercy on his soul tears of joy sprang to his bleared eyes he died in jerusalem he kept murmuring happily at intervals my isaac died in jerusalem three days later the maggid died in london vi bethulah vi bethulah i the image of her so tragically trustful in that mountain village of bukowina still haunts my mind and refuses to be exorcised as of yore by the prose of life one who is very dear to me advises driving her out at the point of the pen whether such recording of my life's strangest episode will lay these memories or not the story itself may at least instruct my fellow jews in new york how variously their religion has manifested itself upon this perplexing planet doubtless many are still as ignorant as i was respecting their mediaeval contemporaries in eastern europe true they have now opportunities in their own ghetto which is for cosmopolitanism a new york within a new york of studying strata from other epochs of judaism spread out on the same plane of time as their own even as upon the white sheet of that wonderful invention my aged eyes have lived to see sequent events may be pictured simultaneously in my youth these opportunities did not exist only in baltimore and a few of the great eastern cities was there any aggregation of jews and these were all or wanted to be good yankees while beyond the mississippi where my father farmed and hunted like a christian and where you might have scoured a thousand square miles to get minyan ten jews for worship our picturesque customs and ceremonies dwindled away from sheer absence of fellowship my father used to tell of a bronzed trapper he breakfasted with on the prairie who astonished him by asking him over their bacon if he were a jew yes said my father shake said the trapper you're the first fellow jew i've met for twenty years though in my childhood my father taught me the hebrew he had brought from europe and told me droll jewish stories in his native german it will readily be understood that the real influences i absorbed were the great american ideals of liberty and humanity emancipation and enlightenment and that therefore the strange things i witnessed among the carpathians were far more startling to me than they can be to the jews of to day upon whom the old world has poured its archaic inhabitants nevertheless i cannot but think that even those who have met strange drifts of sects in new york will be astonished by the tradition which i stumbled upon so blindly in my first european tour for so far as i can gather the zloczszol legend is unique in jewish history and confined exclusively to this out of the way corner however near other heresies may have approached to some of the underlying conceptions my landlord yarchi's view that it was a mere piece of local commercial myth making a gross artifice would have at least the merit of explaining this uniqueness it has in my eyes no other this tour of mine was to make not a circle but a half circle for landing at hamburg i was to return by the baltic after a circuit through berlin prague vienna buda pesth lemberg where my grandfather had once been a rabbi of consideration moscow and st petersburg i did not linger at hamburg purchasing a stout horse i started on my long ride of course it did not seem so long to me who had already ridden from kansas to both of our seaboards as it would to a young gentleman of to day accustomed to parlour cars though the constant change of dialects and foods was somewhat unsettling but money speaks all languages and a good western stomach digests all diets bad water however no stomach can cope with and i was laid up at prague with a fever which left me too weak to hurry on i rambled about the ghetto the judenstadt which gave me my first insight into mediaeval judaism and was fascinated by the quaint alleys and houses the jewish town hall and the cellarlike alt neu synagogue with its miraculous history of unnumbered centuries i heard the story of the great red flag on the pillar with its shield of david and the swede's hat and was shown on the walls the spatterings of the blood of the martyrs of what emotions i had in the old graveyard a ghetto of the dead where the graves were huddled together three and four deep and the very tombstones and corpses had undergone ghetto persecution a whole new world opened out to me crooked as the ghetto alleys so alien from the free life of the flowering prairies as i walked about this judengarten studying the hebrew inscriptions and the strange symbolic sculptures the priest's hands of blessing the levite's ewer the israelites' bunch of grapes the virgin with roses and trying to reconstruct the life these dead had lived strange ancestral memories seemed thrilling through me helping me to understand many stories did i hear too of the celebrated rabbi loew and of the golem he created which brought him his meals in sign whereof i was shown his grave and his house marked with a lion on a blue background i listened with american incredulity but hereditary sympathy i was astonished to find men who still believed in a certain sabbatai zevi messiah of the jews and one showed me a sabbatian prayer book with a turbaned head of this redeemer side by side with king david's and another who scoffed at this seventeenth century impostor yet told me the tradition in his own family how they had sold their business and were about to start for palestine when the news reached them that so far from deposing the sultan this redeemer of israel had become his doorkeeper and a mohammedan the year was passing toward the fall ere i got to buda pesth in those days the enchanted gateway of the orient resounding with gypsy music and not the civilized capital i found it the other day and i had not proceeded far on the northerly bend of my journey when soon after crossing the carpathians i was imprisoned in the mountain village of zloczszol by the sudden overflow of the dniester the village itself was sheltered from the floods by a mountain between it and the tributary of the dniester but all the roads northward were impassable and the water came round by clefts and soused our bordering fields and oozed very near the maize garden of yarchi's pine cottage to which i had removed from the dirty inn where a squalling baby in a cradle had shared the private sitting room it was a very straggling village which began to straggle at the mountain foot but for fear of avalanches i was told the houses did not grow companionable till some half a mile down the plain in the centre of the village was a cobble paved ring place and market place on which gave a few streets of shops the provision shops benefiting hugely by the floods which made imports difficult it was a jewish colony with the exception of a few outlying farms whose peasants brought touches of gorgeous colour into the procession of black gabardines it was strange to me to live in a place in which every door post bore a mezuzah it gave me a novel sense of being in a land of israel and sometimes i used to wonder how these people could feel such a sense of local patriotism as seemed to possess them and yet i reflected that like the giant cedar of lebanon which rose from the plain in such strange contrast with the native trees of zloczszol israel could be transplanted everywhere and was made of as enduring and undying a wood nay that even like this cedar wood it had strange properties of conserving other substances and arresting putrefaction hence its ubiquitous patriotism was universally profitable nevertheless this was one of the surprises of my journey to find jews speaking every language under the european sun regarding themselves everywhere as part of the soil and often patriotic to the point of resenting immigrant jews as foreigners i myself was popularly known as the stranger though i was not resented because the couple of dollars at which i purchased the privilege of ark opening on my first visit to the synagogue a little gothic building standing in a court yard gave me a further reputation as the rich stranger once i blushed to overhear myself called the handsome stranger and i looked into my cracked mirror with fresh interest but i told myself modestly a stalwart son of the prairies had an unfair advantage in such a world of stooping sallow students certainly i felt myself favoured both in youth and looks when i stepped into the beth hamedrash the house of study which i had at first taken for a little mosque like those i had seen on the slopes of buda and watched the curious gnarled graybeards crooning and rocking the livelong day over worm eaten folios despite such odd glimpses of the interesting i grew as tired of waiting for the waters to abate as noah himself must have felt in his zoological institute one day as i was gazing from my one story window at the melancholy marsh to which the flood had reduced the landscape i said glumly to my hunchbacked landlord who stood snuffing himself under the porch i suppose it will be another week before i can get away alas yes yarchi replied why alas i asked it's an ill wind that blows nobody any good and the longer i stay the better for you he shook his head the flood that keeps you here keeps away the pilgrims the pilgrims i echoed ay said he there will be three in that bed of yours but what pilgrims he stared at me don't you know the new year is nigh of course i said mendaciously i felt ashamed to confess my ignorant unconcern as to the proximity of the solemn season of ram's horn blasts and penitence well it is at new year the pilgrims flock to their wonder rabbi that he may hear their petitions and bear them on high likewise wrestle with satan and entreat for their forgiveness at the throne of grace there was a twinkle in yarchi's eyes not quite consistent with the gravity of his words do wonder rabbis live nowadays i asked a pinch of snuff yarchi was taking fell from between his fingers do they live he cried yes and off white bread for poverty we have none in america i only heard of one in prague i murmured apologetically fearing the genus might be of the very elements of judaism ah yes the high rabbi loew his memory for a blessing he said reverently but these new wonder rabbis can only work one miracle what is that i asked the greatest of all making their worshippers support them like princes and he laughed in admiration of his own humour then you are a heretic i said heretic yarchi's black eyes exchanged their twinkle for a flash of resentment nay they are the heretics breeding dissension in israel did they not dance on the grave of the sainted elijah wilna tired of tossing the ball of conversation up and down i left the window and joined the philosopher under his porch where i elicted from him his version of the eighteenth century movement of chassidim the pious ones which in these days of english books on judaism will not be so new to american jews as it was to me these shakers or as we should perhaps say nowadays salvationists these protestants against cut and dried judaism who arose among the carpathians under the inspiration of besht a word which yarchi explained to me was made out of the initials of baal shem tob the master of the good name had it seemed pullulated into a thousand different sects each named after the wonder rabbi whom it swore by and in whose exclusive divine right the phrase is yarchi's it believed but we have the divinest chief concluded yarchi grinning that's what they all say eh i said smiling in response yes but the zloczszol rabbi is stamped with the royal seal he professes to be of the messianic seed a direct descendant of david the son of jesse and the hunchback chuckled with malicious humour i should like to see him i said feeling as if providence had provided a new interest for my boredom yarchi pointed silently with his discoloured thumb over the plain you don't mean he is kept in that storehouse i said yarchi guffawed in high good humour that that's the klaus and what's the klaus the chassidim stubele little room is that where the miracles are done no that's their synagogue oh they just pray there pray they get as drunk as lot ii i returned to my window and gazed curiously at the klaus and now that my eye was upon it i saw it was astir with restless life men came and went continually i looked toward the synagogue and the more pretentious building seemed dead then i remembered what yarchi had told me that the chassidim had revolted against set prayer times they pray and drink at all hours was his way of putting it something must always be forward in the klaus i thought as i took my hat and stick on exploring bent instinctively i put my pistol in my hip pocket then bethought myself with a laugh that i was not likely to be molested by the pious ones but as it was unloaded i let it remain in the pocket i slipped into the building and on to a bench near the door but for the veiled ark at the end i should not have known the place for a house of worship true some men were sitting or standing about shouting and singing with odd spasmodic gestures but the bulk were lounging smoking clay pipes drinking coffee and chattering while a few looking like tramps lay snoring on the hard benches deaf to all the din my eye sought at once for the wonder rabbi himself but amid the many quaint physiognomies there was none with any apparent seal of supremacy the note of all the faces was easy going good will and even the passionate contortions of melody and body which the worshippers produced the tragic clutchings at space the clinching of fists and the beating of breasts had an air of cheery impromptu they seemed to enjoy their very tears and every now and then the inspiration would catch one of the gossipers and contort him likewise while a worshipper would as suddenly fall to gossiping very soon a frost bitten old man i remembered coming across in the cemetery on the mountain slope where he was sweeping the fallen leaves from a tomb and singing like the grave digger in hamlet sidled up to me and asked me if i needed vodka i thought it advisable to need some and was quickly supplied from a box the old fellow seemed to keep under the ark the price was so moderate that i tipped him with as much again doubtless to the enhancement of the rich stranger's reputation sipping it i was able to follow with more show of ease the bursts of rambling conversation sometimes they talked about the floods anon about politics then about sacred texts and the illuminations of the zohar but there was one topic which ran like a winding pattern through all the talk bursting in at the most unexpected places and this was the wonders wrought by their rabbi as they dilated with enkindlement upon miracle after miracle some wrought on earth and some in the higher spheres to which his soul ascended my curiosity mounted and calling for more vodka where is the rabbi i asked the sexton he may perhaps come down to lunch said he in reverent accents as if to imply that the rabbi was now in the upper spheres i waited till tables were spread with plain fare in the klaus itself at the savour the fountain of worship was sealed the snorers woke up i was invited to partake of the meal which i was astonished to find was free to all provided by the rabbi truly royal hospitality i thought but our royal host himself did not come down my neighbour of whom i kept inquiring at last told me sympathetically to have patience till friday evening when the rabbi would come to welcome in the sabbath but as it was then tuesday cannot i call upon him i asked he shook his head ben david holds his court no more this year he said he is in seclusion preparing for the exalted soul flights of the pilgrim season the sabbath is his only public day now there was nothing for it but to wait till the friday eve though in the meantime i got yarchi to show me the royal palace a plain two storied oriental looking building with a flat roof and a turret on the eastern side whose high ivy mantled slit of window turned at the first rays of the sun into a great diamond he couldn't come down couldn't he yarchi commented i daresay he wasn't sober enough somehow this jarred upon me i was beginning to conjure up romantic pictures and assuredly my one glimpse of the sect had not shown any intoxication save psychic he is very generous anyhow i said he supplies a free lunch free to him retorted the incorrigible yarchi the worshippers fancy it is free but it is they who pay for it and he snuffed himself chuckling i'll tell you what is free he added his morals but how do you know oh all those fellows go in for the adamite life what is the adamite life he winked not the pre evite i saw it was fruitless to reason with his hunchbacked view of the subject on the friday eve i repaired again to the klaus but this time it was not so easy to find a seat however by the grace of my friend the sexton i was accommodated near the ark where amid a congregation clad in unexpected white i sat a conscious black discord there was a certain palpitating fervour in the air as though the imminence of the new year and judgment day had strung all spirits to a higher tension suddenly a shiver seemed to run through the assemblage and all eyes turned to the door a tall old man escorted by several persons of evident consideration walked with erect head but tottering gait to the little platform in front of the ark and taking a praying shawl from the reverential hand of the sexton held it a moment as in abstraction before drawing it over his head and shoulders as he stood thus almost facing me yet unconscious of me his image was photographed on my excited brain he seemed very aged with abundant white locks and beard and he was clothed in a white satin robe cut low at the neck and ornamented at the breast with gold laced intersecting triangles of the shield of david on his head was a sort of white biretta i noted a curious streak of yellow in the silvered eyebrows as if youth clung on so to speak by a single hair and underneath these arrestive eyebrows green pupils alternately glowed and smouldered on his forefinger he wore a signet ring set with amethysts and with a huge persian emerald which as his hand rose and fell and his fingers clasped and unclasped themselves in the convulsion of prayer seemed to glare at me like a third green eye and as soon as he began thus praying every trace of age vanished he trembled but only from emotion and his passion mounted till at last his whole body prayed and the congregation joined in with shakings and quiverings and thunderings and ululations not even in prague had i experienced such sympathetic emotion after the well regulated frigidities of our american services it was truly warming to be among worshippers not ashamed to feel hours must have passed but i sat there as content as any when the service ended everybody crowded round the wonder rabbi to give the good sabbath handshake the scene jarred me by its incongruous suggestion of our american receptions at which the lion of the evening must extend his royal paw to every guest but i went up among the rest and murmured my salutation the glow came into his eyes as they became conscious of me for the first time and his gaunt bloodless hand closed crushingly on mine so that i almost fancied the signet ring was sealing my flesh good sabbath stranger he replied you linger long here as long as the floods i said are you as dangerous to us he flashed back i trust not i said a whit startled his jewelled forefinger drummed on the reading stand and his eyes no longer challenged mine but were lowered as in abstraction your grandfather who lies in lemberg was no friend to the followers of besht he laid the ban even on white sabbath garments and those who but wept in the synagogues he classed with us i was more taken aback by his knowledge of my grandfather than by that ancient gentleman's hostility to the emotional heresy of his day i never saw my grandfather i replied simply true the son of the prairies should know more of god than the bookworms will you accept a seat at my table with pleasure rabbi i murmured dazed by his clairvoyant air they were now arranging the two tables one with a white cloth for the master and his circle in strict order of precedence and the other of bare wood for such of the rabble as could first scramble into the seats i was placed on his right hand and became at once an object of wonder and awe the kiddush which initiated the supper was not a novel ceremony to me but what i had never seen before was the eagerness with which each guest sipped from the circulating wine cup of consecration and the disappointment of such of the mob as could find no drop to drain still fiercer was the struggle for the wonder rabbi's soup after he had taken a couple of spoonfuls even i had no chance of distinction before this sudden simultaneous swoop though of course i had my own plateful to drink as sudden was the transition from soup to song the whole company singing and swaying in victorious ecstasy i turned to speak to my host but his face awed me the eyes had now their smouldering inward fire the eyebrows seemed wholly white the features were still then as i watched him his whole body grew rigid he closed his eyes his head fell back the singing ceased as tense a silence reigned as though the followers too were in a trance my eyes were fixed on the master's blind face which had now not the dignity of death but only the indignity of lifelessness and but for the suggestion of mystery behind would have ceased to impress me for there was now revealed a coarseness of lips a narrowness of forehead an ugliness of high cheek bone which his imperial glance had transfigured and which his flowing locks still abated but as i gazed the weird stillness took possession of me i could not but feel with the rest that the master was making a soul ascension it seemed very long yet it may have been only a few minutes for in absolute silence one's sense of time is disconcerted ere waves of returning life began to traverse the cataleptic face and form at last the wonder rabbi opened his eyes and the hush grew profounder every ear was astrain for the revelations to come children said he slowly as i passed through the circles the souls cried to me 'haste haste for the evil one plotteth and the messianic day will be again delayed' so i rose into the ante chamber of grace where the fiery wheels sang 'holy holy' and there i came upon the poison god waiting to see the glory of the little face and with him was a soul very strange such as i had never seen living neither in heaven nor hell perchance created of satan himself for his instrument then with a great cry i uttered the name and the poison god fled with a great fluttering leaving the nameless naked soul helpless amid the consuming dazzling wheels so i returned through the circles to reassure the souls and they shouted with a great shout hallelujah came in a great shout from the wrought up listeners and then they burst into a lilting chant of triumph but by this time my mood had changed the spell of novelty had begun to wear off perhaps also i was fatigued by the long strain i recalled the coarser face of the comatose saint and i found nothing but gibberish in the oracular revelation which he had brought down with such elaborate pains from the circles amid which he seemed to move thanking him for his hospitality i slipped from the hot roaring room ah what a waft of fresh air and sense of starlit space the young moon floated in the star sprinkled heavens like a golden boat with a faint suggestion of the full sailed orb the true glamour and mystery of the universe were again borne in upon me as in our rich constellated prairie nights and all the artificial abracadabra of the klaus seemed akin to its heated noisy atmosphere the lights of the village were extinguished and looking at my watch i found it was close upon midnight but as i passed the saint's palace i was astonished to find a light twinkling from the turret window i wondered who kept vigil then i bethought me it was friday night when no light could be struck and this must be ben david's bed room lamp awaiting his return i thought he had taken you up in his fiery chariot grumbled yarchi sleepily as he unbarred the door the fiery chariot must not run on the sabbath i said smiling and moreover ben david takes no passengers to the circles circles he ought to have a circle of rope round his neck the soup was good i pleaded as i groped my way toward my quaint tall bed iii i cannot explain why when yarchi asked me sarcastically over the sabbath dinner whether i was going to the supper of the holy queen i knew at once that i should be found at this mysterious meal perhaps it was that i had nothing better to do perhaps my sympathy was returning to those strange good humoured musical loungers so far removed from the new york ideal of life or perhaps i was vaguely troubled by the dream i had wrestled with more or less obscurely all night long that i stood naked in a whirl of burning wheels that sang as they turned the melody of the chassidim was i this nondescript soul i wondered half smilingly fashioned of the evil one to delay the messianic era the sun was set the three stars already in the sky and my pious landlord had performed the ceremony of division ere i set out declining the bread and fish yarchi offered to make up in a package saturday nights every man must bring his own meal he said i replied that i went not to eat but to look on however i was so late in arriving that as there were no lights looking on was well nigh reduced to listening in the gray twilight the klaus seemed full of uncanny forms rocking in monotonous sing song through the gathering gloom the old wonder rabbi's face loomed half ghostlike half regal as the mystic dusk grew deeper and darkness fell the fascination of it all began to overcome me the dim tossing crooning figures divined rather than seen washed round lappingly and swayingly by their own rhythmic melody full of wistful sweetness my soul too tossed in this circumlapping tide the complex world of modern civilization fell away from me as garments fall from a bather even this primitive mountain village passed into nothingness and in a timeless spaceless universe i floated in a lulling measureless music aeons might have elapsed ere the glare of light dazzled my eyes when the week day candles were lit and the supper to escort the departing holy queen the sabbath began again i was invited to the upper table despite yarchi's warning but i had no appetite for earthly things was jarred by the prosaic gusto with which the mystics threw themselves upon the tureen of red borsch and the black pottle of brandy der rabbi hat geheissen branntwein trinken hummed the sexton joyously but little by little as their stomachs grew satiate the holy singing started afresh and presently they leaped up pulled aside the table and made a whirling ring i was caught up into the human cyclone and round and round we flew our hands upon one another's shoulders with blind ecstatic faces our legs kicking out madly to repel i understood the embryonic demons outside the magic circle and again methought i made a soul ascension or at least hovered as near to the ineffable mysteries as the demoniacles to our magic circle oh what inexpressible religious raptures were mine what no gorgeous temple nor pealing organ nor white robed minister had ever wrought for me was wrought in this barracklike room with its rude benches and wooden ark children of the palace we sang and as i strove to pick up the words i thought we were indeed sons of our father who is in heaven children of the palace children of the palace haste all who yearn the bliss to taste of the glorious little faced where within the king's house placed shines the sapphire throne enchased come in joyful dance enlaced mock the cold and primly chaste see no sullen nor straitlaced in our circle may be traced here with th' ancient one embraced inmost truth 'tis ours to taste outer husks are shred to waste children of the palace haste with the glory to be graced come behold the little faced we broke up some hours earlier than the previous evening but i hurried away from my sauntering fellow worshippers not now because i was disgusted but because i feared to be i needed solitude communion with my own soul the same crescent moon hung in the heavens the same endless stars drew on the thoughts to a material infinity but now i felt there was another and a truer universe encompassing this painted vision a spiritual universe of which i had hitherto known nothing though i had glibly prated of it and listened well satisfied to sermons about it the air was warm and pleasant and still thrilling with the sense of the over soul i had passed the outposts of the village almost unconsciously and walked in the direction of the cemetery on the other slope of the mountain for the dead feared neither floods nor avalanches on my left ran the river still turbulent and encumbered with wreckage and logs but now at low tide some feet below the level of its steep banks the road gradually narrowed till at last i was walking on a mere strip of path between the starlit water and the base of the mountain which rose ineffably solemn with its desolate rock at my side and its dark pines higher up and suddenly lifting my eyes i saw before me a mystic moonlit figure that set my heart beating with terror and surprise it was the figure of a woman or rather of a girl tall queenly shining in a strange white robe with a crown of roses and olive branches for a moment she seemed like some spirit of moonlight but though the eyes were misted with sadness and dream the face was of the most beautiful jewish oval glowing with dark creamy flesh a wild idea rose to my mind and absurdly enough stilled my beating heart this was the holy queen sabbath whose departure we had just been celebrating and in this unfrequented haunt she abode till the twilight of the next friday hail holy queen i said almost involuntarily i saw her large beautiful eyes grow larger as she woke with a start to my presence but she only inclined her head with a sovereign air as one used to adoration and floated on for so her gracious motion seemed to me and as she passed by it flashed upon me that the strange white robe was nothing but a shroud and again a great horror seized me but struggling with my failing senses i told myself that at worst it was some poor creature buried alive in the graveyard who had forced the coffin lid and now wandered half insanely homewards may i not escort you lady i cried after her the way is lonely she turned her face again upon me i saw it had fire as well as mystery who dare molest the holy queen she said again i was plunged into the wildest bewilderment was my first fancy true or had i stumbled upon some esoteric title she bore or had she but seized on my own phrase but you go far i persisted unto my father's house pardon me i am a stranger she turned round wholly now and looked at me oh are you the stranger she said the question rippled like music from her lips and was as sweet to my ear linking her to me by the suggestion that i was not new to her imagination i am the stranger i answered moving slowly toward her and therefore afraid for your sake and startled by the shroud you wear since the dawn of my thirteenth year it has been my daily robe it should be in lamentation for zion laid waste but me i fear it reminds more of my dead mother and sisters you had sisters two beautiful lives blown out one after the other like candles making our home dark when i was but a child they too wore shrouds in life and death first the elder then the younger and when i draw mine over my dress it is of them i think always i feel we are truly sisters sisters of the shroud i shivered as from some chill graveyard air despite her sweet corporeality but the crown the crown of joy i murmured regarding now with closer vision the intertangled weaving of roses and myrtle and olive branches with gold and crimson threads wound about salt stones and the pale yellow of pyrites i do not know what it signifies she said simply are you not the holy queen i asked beginning to scent some cabalistic or chassidic mystery men worship me but i know not of what i am queen and a wistful smile played about the sweet mouth peace and sweet dreams to you sir and she turned her face to the village she knew not of what she was queen there all in one sentence was the charm the wonder the pathos of her yet there was still much that she knew that would enlighten me and it was not wholly curiosity that provoked me to hold the vision i hated to see the enchantment of her presence dissolve to be robbed of the liquid notes of her voice you are queen of me at least i said following her and throwing all my republican principles into the river among the other wreckage and your majesty's liege cannot endure to see you walk unattended so late in the night i have god's company she answered quietly true he is always with us nevertheless at night and in the mountains he may be perceived more clearly my father makes soul ascensions at any hour by force of prayer but for me the divine ecstasy comes only under god's heaven and most clearly at night and among the graves by day god is invisible like the stars they may be perceived from a well i said mechanically for my brain was busy with the intuition that she was ben david's daughter that her queendom was somehow bound up with his alleged royal descent even so is god visible from the deeps of the spirit she answered but these depths are not mine and day speaks to me less surely of him the day is divine too i urged god speaks also through joy through sunshine it is but the gilding of sorrow nay that is too hard a saying how can you know that you i made a bold guess for my brain had continued to work feverishly who live cloistered in a turret who are kept sequestered from man who walk at night and only among the dead how can you know that life is so sad i feel it is not every stone in the graveyard hewn from the dead heart of the mourners all the sadness of the world was in her eyes yet somehow all the sweet solace again she bade me good night and i was so under the spell of her strange reply that i made no further effort to follow her as she was swallowed up in the gloom of the firs where the path wound back round the mountain iv the floods abated before the new year dawned as was testified by the arrival not of doves with olive leaves but of pilgrims from the north with shekels the road was therefore open for me to go yet i lingered i told myself it was the fascination of the pilgrims that curious new population which brought quite a bustle into the ring place of zloczszol and gave even the shops of the native chassidim a live air there were unpleasant camp followers in the train of the invading army cripples and consumptives both rich and poor but on the whole it was a cheery well to do company i retained my room by paying the rent of three lodgers and even then yarchi would come in and look at the big tall bed wistfully as if it were a waste of sleeping material the great episode of each day was now the royal levee crowds besieged the door of the palace in quest of health wealth and happiness and the proprietor of fields had to squeeze in with the tramp and the peasant woman and her neglected brat jostled the jewelled dame from the towns i was glad to think that the holy queen was hidden safely away in her turret and this consoled me for not meeting her again though i walked or trotted about on my bay mare at all hours and in all places in quest of her it may seem curious that i did not boldly call and ask to see her but that would bring the commonplace into our so poetic relation besides which i divined that she would not be easily on view beyond indirectly justifying my intuition that she was ben david's daughter by satisfying myself that the wonder rabbi had once had three girls two of whom had died i would not even make inquiries i feared to dissipate the mystery and sacredness of our relation by gossip perhaps yarchi would tell me she was mad or treat me to some other coarse misconception due to the callous feelers with which he apprehended the world i did not even know for certain that the light i saw in the turret was hers but when at night it was out i hastened to the river side to see only my own shadow on the hushed mountain slope or on the white tombs it seemed clear that she was being kept sacred from the pilgrims' gaze perhaps too the deserted untravelled road which was safe as her own home in normal times was less secure now when i at last ventured to say casually to yarchi that ben david's daughter seemed to be kept strictly to the house the ribald grin i had feared distorted his malicious mouth oh you have seen bethulah he said yes i murmured turning my flushed face away but glad to learn her name bethulah bethulah my heart seemed to beat to the music of it does she still stalk about in a shroud he did not wait for an answer but went off into unending laughter which doubled him up till his hunch protruded upward like a camel's she does not go about at all now i said freezingly but this set yarchi cachinnating worse than ever he daren't trust even his own disciples you see ha ha ha yarchi i cried angrily you know bethulah must be kept sacred from this rabble and i switched with my riding whip at the poppies that grew among the maize in the little front garden as if they were pilgrims and i a tarquin yes i know that's ben david's game but i wish some man would marry her and ruin his business ha ha ha it would ruin yours too i reminded him more angrily you are ready enough to let lodgings to the pilgrims yarchi shrugged his hump if fools are fools wise men are wise men he replied oracularly i strode away but he had heated my brain with a new idea or one that i now allowed myself to see clearly some man might marry her then why should i not be that man why should i not carry bethulah back to america with me the most precious curiosity of the old world a frank virginal creature with that touch of the angel which i had dreamed of but had never met among our smart girls up to then and even if it were true that ben david was a fraud and needed the girl for his cabalistic mystifications even so i was rich enough to recoup him the girl herself was no conscious accessory of that i felt certain when my brain cooled suggestions of the other aspects of the question began to find entrance what of bethulah herself why should she care to marry me or to go to the strange raw country and such a union was it not too incongruous too fantastic for practical life thus i wrestled with myself for three days all the while watching bethulah's turret or the roads she might come by on the third night i saw a wild mob of men at the turret end of the house dancing in a ring and singing with their eyes turned upward to the light that burnt on high their words i could not catch at first through the tumultuous howl but it went on and on like their circumvolutions over and over again till my brain reeled it seemed to be an appeal to bethulah to plead their cause on the coming yom hadin new year day of judgment by thy soul without sin enter heaven within this divine yom hadin holy maid undertake thou our plea let the poison god be answered stoutly by thee holy queen when i came to write this down afterward i discovered it was an acrostic on her name as is customary with festival prayers and this i have preserved in my rough translation v despite my new spiritual insight i could not bring myself to sympathize with such crude earthly visionings of the heavenly judgment bar doubtless borrowed from the book of job which our enlightened western rabbis rightly teach to be allegorical temporary absorption into the over soul seemed to me to sum up the limits of chassidic experience besides bethulah was not a being to be employed as a sort of supernatural advocate but a sad tender creature needing love and protection this mob howling outside my lady's chamber added indignation to my strange passion for this beautiful sister of the shroud i would rescue her from this grotesque environment i would go to her father and formally demand her hand as i had learnt was the custom among these people i slept upon the resolution yet in the morning it was still uncrumpled and immediately after breakfast i took my stand among the jostling crowd outside the turreted house and unfairly secured precedence by a gold piece slipped into the palm of the doorkeeper the scribe i found stationed in the ante chamber made me write my wish on a piece of paper which however i was instructed to carry in myself ben david was seated in a curious soft cushioned high backed chair with the intersecting triangles making a carved apex to it but otherwise there was no mark of what yarchi would have called charlatanism his face set between a black velvet biretta and the white masses of his beard had the dignity with which it had first impressed me and his long fur trimmed robe gave him an air of mediaeval wisdom peace be to you long lingering stranger he said though his green eyes glittered ominously peace i murmured uneasily with his left hand he put the still folded paper to his brow i watched the light playing on the persian emerald seal of the ring on the forefinger of his right hand suddenly i perceived he too was looking at the stone nay into it and that while that continued to glitter his own eyes had grown glazed strange strange he muttered again i see the fiery wheels and the strange soul fashioned of satan that dwells neither in heaven nor in hell and his eyes lit up terribly again and rolled like fiery wheels what do you want he cried harshly it is written on the paper i faltered just two words he opened the paper and read out your daughter his eyes rolled again what know you of my daughter oh i know all about her i said airily then you know that my daughter does not receive pilgrims nay 'tis i that wish to receive your daughter i ventured jocosely with a touch of levity i did not feel he raised his clinched hand as if to strike me and i had a lurid sense of three green eyes glaring at me i stood my ground as coolly as possible and said in dry formal tones i wish to make application for her hand a great blackness came over the frosted visage as if his black biretta had been suddenly drawn forward and his erst blanched eyebrows gloomed like a black lightning cloud over the baleful eyes i shrank back then i had a sudden vision of the wagons clattering down broadway in a live sunlit go ahead world and the wonder rabbi turned into an absurd old parent with a beautiful daughter and a bad temper i am a man of substance i went on dryly in my country i have fat lands the horribleness of thus bidding for bethulah flashed on me even as i spoke to mix up a creature of mist and moonlight with substance and fat lands monstrous and yet i knew that thus and thus only by honourable talk with her guardian could a zloczszol bride be won but the wonder rabbi sprang to his feet so vehemently that his high backed chair rocked as in a gale dog he shrieked blasphemer i summoned all my american sang froid dog i agreed inasmuch as i follow your daughter like a dog humbly lovingly but blasphemer say rather worshipper for i worship bethulah then worship her like the others he roared had i not heard him pray i should have expected the hoary patriarch to collapse after such an outburst thank you i said i don't want her to fly up to heaven for me i want her to come down to earth from her turret she will not come down to any earthly spouse he said more gently quite the reverse then i will make a soul ascension i said defiantly get back to hell spawn of satan he thundered again or since strange son of the new world you neither believe nor disbelieve hover eternally between hell and heaven meantime i am here i said good humouredly between you and your daughter come come be sensible you are a very old man where in zloczszol will you find a superior husband for your child the lord to whom she is consecrated forgive you your blasphemy he said in a changed voice and rang his bell so that the next applicant came in and i had to go it was plain the girl was kept as a sacred celibate a sort of vestal virgin bethulah was the very hebrew for virgin it suddenly flashed upon me but how came such practices into judaism judaism with its cheery creed increase and multiply and chassidism i had hitherto imagined was the cheeriness of judaism concentrated in yarchi's version it was even license the adamite life i raked up my memories of the bible remembered jephtha's daughter but no there could be no question of a vow this was some new chassidic mystery the crown and the shroud the shroud of renunciation the crown of victory and for some fantastic shadow myth a beautiful young life was to be immolated my respect for chassidism vanished as suddenly as it came but i was powerless i could only wait till the flood of pilgrims oozed back even as the waters had done then perhaps bethulah might walk again upon the moonlit mountain peak or in the house of life as the cemetery was mystically called the penitential season with its trumpets and terrors judgment writings and sealings was over at last and tabernacles came like a breath of air and nature yarchi hammered up a little wooden booth in the corner of his front garden and hung grapes and oranges and flowers from its loose roof of boughs through which the stars peeped at us as we ate it struck me as a very pretty custom and i wondered why american judaism had let it fall into desuetude ere the break up of these booths the pilgrims had begun to melt away the old sleepiness to fall upon zloczszol hence i was startled one morning by the passage of a joyous procession that carried torches and played on flutes and tambourines i ran out and discovered that i was part of a wedding procession escorting a bride as this was a company not of chassidim but of everyday jews bound for the little gothic synagogue i was surprised despite my experience of the tabernacles to find such picturesque goings on and i went all the way to the courtyard where the rabbi came out to meet us with the bridegroom who it seemed had already been conducted hither with parallel pomp the happy youth for he could only have been sixteen was arrayed in festival finery with white shoes on his feet and black phylacteries on his forehead which was further over gloomed by a cowl he took the bride's hand and then we all threw wheat over their heads crying three times peru urvu be fruitful and multiply but just when i expected the ceremony to begin the bride was snatched away and we all filed into the synagogue to await her return i had fallen into a mournful reverie perhaps the suggestion of my own infelicitous romance was too strong when i felt a stir of excitement animating my neighbours and looking up lo i saw a tall female figure in a white shroud with a veiled face and on her head a crown of roses and myrtles and olive branches a shiver ran through me bethulah i cried half aloud my neighbours smiled and as i continued to stare at the figure i saw it was only the bride thus transmogrified for the wedding canopy and then some startling half comprehension came to me bethulah's dress was a bride's dress then she was made to appear a perpetual bride of whom to what cabalistic mystery was this the key the friday night hymn sprang to my mind oh come my beloved to meet the bride the face of the sabbath let us welcome for a moment i thought i held the solution and that my very first conjecture had been warranted the holy queen sabbath was also typified as the sabbath bride and this dual allegory it was that bethulah incarnated or perchance it was israel the bride of god but i was still dissatisfied i felt that the truth lay deeper than a mere poetic metaphor or a poetical masquerading i discovered it at last but at the risk of my life vi i continued to walk nightly on the narrow path between the mountain and the river like the ghost of one drowned but without a glimpse of bethulah at last it grew plain that her father had warned her against me that she had changed the hour of her exercise and soul ascension or even the place i was indebted to accident for my second vision of this strange creature i had diverted myself by visiting the neighbouring village a refreshing contrast to jewish zloczszol from the rough garland hung wayside crosses which were like sign posts to its gilt towered church to the peasant women in pink aprons and top boots a marvellous sunset was well nigh over as i struck the river side that curved homewards the bank was here very steep the river running as between cliffs in the sky great drifts of gold flushed cloud hung like relics of the glory that had been and the autumn leaves that muffled my mare's footsteps seemed to have fallen from the sunset in the background the white peak of the mountain was slowly parting with its volcanic splendour and low on the horizon like a small lake of fire in the heart of a tangled bush the molten sun showed monstrous and dazzling and straight from the sunset over the red leaves bethulah came walking rapt as in prophetic thought shrouded and crowned preceded by a long shadow that seemed almost as intangible i reined in my horse and watched the apparition with a great flutter at my heart and as i gazed and thought of her grotesque worshippers it was borne in upon me how unbefittingly nature had peopled her splendid planet the pageantry of dawn and sunset of seas and mountains how incongruous a framework for our petty breed sordidly crawling under the stars bethulah alone seemed fitted to the high setting of the scene she matched this lone icy peak this fiery purity bethulah i said as she was almost upon my horse she looked up and a little cry that might have been joy or surprise came from her lips but by the smile that danced in her eyes and the blood that leapt to her cheeks i saw with both joy and surprise that this second meeting was as delightful to her as to me but the conscious bethulah hastened to efface what the unconscious had revealed it is not right of you stranger to linger here so long she said frowning i am your shadow i replied and must linger where you linger but you are indeed a shadow my father says a being fashioned of the poison god to work us woe no no i said laughing my horse bears no shadow and the poison god who fashioned me is not the absurd horned and tailed tempter you have been taught to believe in but a little rosy winged god with a bow and poisoned arrows a little rosy winged god she said i know of none such and you know not of what you are queen i retorted smiling there is but one god she insisted with sweet seriousness see he burns in the bush yet it is not consumed she pointed to where the red sinking sun seemed to eat out the heart of the bush through which we saw it thus this love god burns in our hearts i said lifted up into her poetic strain and we are not consumed only glorified i strove to touch her hand which had dropped caressingly on my horse's neck but she drew back with a cry i may not listen this is the sinful talk my father warned me of fare you well stranger and with swift step she turned homewards i sat still a minute or two half disconcerted half content to gaze at her gracious motions then i touched the mare with my heel and she bounded off in pursuit but at this instant three men in long gabardines and great round velvet hats started forward from the thicket shouting and waving lighted pine branches and my frightened animal reared and plunged and then broke into a mad gallop making straight for the river curve between the cliffs i threw myself back in the saddle tugging desperately at the creature's mouth but i might have been a child pulling at an elephant i shook my feet free of the stirrups and prepared to tumble off as best i could rather than risk the plunge into the river when a projecting bough made me duck my head instinctively but as i passed under it with another instinctive movement i threw out my hands to clasp it and despite a violent wrench that seemed to pull my arms out of their sockets and swung my feet high forward i hung safely the mare eased of my weight was at the river side the next instant and with a wild incredible leap alighted with her forefeet and the bulk of her body on the other bank up which she scraped convulsively and then stood still trembling and sweating i could not get at her so trusting she would find her way home safely i dropped to the ground and ran back with a mixed idea of finding bethulah and chastising the three scoundrels but all were become invisible i walked half a mile across the plain to get to the rough pine bridge and once on the other bank i had no difficulty in recovering the mare she cantered up to me indeed and put her soft and still perspiring nose in my palm and whinnied her apologetic congratulations on our common escape i rode slowly home reflecting on the new turn in my love affairs for it was plain that bethulah had now been provided with a body guard of which she was as unconscious as of her body itself but for the apparent necessity of her making soul ascensions under god's heaven i supposed she would not have been allowed to take the air at all with such a creature of satan hovering i stood sunning myself the next day on the same pine bridge looking down on the swift current and regretting there was no rail to lean on as one watched the fascinating flow of the beautiful river it struck me as inordinately blue perhaps i analyzed by contrast with the long sinuous weeds which here glided and tossed in the current like green water snakes these flexible greens reminded me of the wonder rabbi's eyes and his emerald seal and i turned with some sudden premonition of danger just in time to dodge the attack of the same three ruffians who must have been about to push me over in an instant i had whipped out my pistol from my hip pocket and cried stand or i fire the trio froze instantly in odd attitudes which was lucky as my pistol was unloaded they looked almost comical in their air of abject terror their narrow fanatical foreheads with ringlets of piety hanging down below the velvet fur trimmed hats showed them more accustomed to murdering texts than men had i not been still smouldering over yesterday's trick i could have pitied them for the unwelcome job thrust upon their unskilled and apparently even unweaponed hands by the machinations of the poison god and the orders of ben david one of them seemed quite elderly and one quite young the middle aged one had a goitre and perhaps that made me fancy him the most sinister and keep my eye most warily upon him sons of belial i said recalling a biblical phrase that might be expected to prick why do you seek my life two of them cowered under my gaze but the elderly chassid seeing the shooting was postponed spoke up boldly we are no sons of belial you are the begotten of satan you are the arch enemy of israel i i protested in my turn i am a plain god fearing son of abraham a precious scion of the patriarch's seed who would delay the coming of the messiah again that incomprehensible accusation you speak riddles i said how so did you not tell ben david his horn be exalted that you knew all concerning bethulah then must you know that of her immaculacy will the messiah be born one ninth of ab a flood of light burst upon me mystic yet clarifying blinding yet dissipating my darkness my pistol drooped in my hand my head swam with a whirl of strange thoughts and bethulah already divine to me took on a dazzling aureola sailed away into some strange supernatural ether have we not been in exile long enough said the youngest shall a godless stranger tamper with the hope of generations but whence this mad hope i said struggling under the mystic obsession of his intensity mad began the first his eyes spitting fire but the younger interrupted him is not our saint the sole scion of the house of david is not his daughter the last of the race and what if she is then who but she can be the destined mother of israel's redeemer the goitred chassid opened his lips and added if not now when as hillel asked in our days at last must come the crowning glory of the house of ben david the young man went on for generations now since the signs have pointed to the millennium have the daughters of the house been kept unwedded what i cried generations of bethulahs have been sacrificed to a dream again the eyes of the first chassid dilated dangerously i raised my pistol but hastened to ask in a more conciliatory tone then how has the line been carried on through the sons of course said the young chassid now for the first time there are no sons and only one daughter remains the manifest vessel of salvation i tried to call up that image of bustling broadway that had braced me in colloquy with the old wonder rabbi but it seemed shadowy now compared with this world of solid spiritualities which begirt me could it be the same planet on which such things went on simultaneously or perhaps i was dreaming and these three grotesque creatures were the product of yarchi's cookery but their hanging curls had a daylight definiteness and down in the sunlit translucent river i could see every shade of colour from the green of the sinuous reed snakes to the brown of the moss patches on the bank walked two crows and i noted for the first time with what comic pomposity they paced their bodies bent forward like two important old gentlemen with their hands in the pockets of their black coat tails they brought a smile to my face but a menacing movement of the chassidim warned me to be careful and does the girl know all this i asked hurriedly she did not yesterday said the elderly fellow now she has been told there was another long pause i meditated rapidly but disjointedly having to keep an eye against a sudden rush of my assailants and mistrusting the goitred saint yet the more because he was so silent and is bethulah content with her destiny i asked she is in the seventh heaven said the elderly saint i had a poignant shudder of incredulous protest i recalled the flush of her sweet face at the sight of me and brief as our meetings had been i dared to feel that the irrevocable thrill had passed between us that the rest would have been only a question of time let bethulah tell me so herself i cried and i will leave her in her heaven the men looked at one another then the eldest shook his head no you shall never speak to her again we have maidens more beautiful among us said the young man you shall have your choice ay even my own betrothed would i give you i flicked aside his suggestion but you cannot prevent bethulah walking under god's heaven they looked dismayed i will meet her i said pursuing my advantage and yarchi and other good jews shall be at hand she shall be removed elsewhere said the first i will track her down ah you are afraid i said mockingly you see it is not true that she is content to be immolated it is true they muttered true as the torah added the elderly man then there is no harm in her telling me so you may bear her off on your horse said he of the goitre i will go on foot let her bid me go away and i will leave zloczszol again they looked at one another and the relief in their eyes brought heart sinking into mine yes it was true bethulah was in the glow of a great surrender she was still tingling with the revelation of her supreme destiny to put her to the test now would be fatal no let her have time to meditate ay even to disbelieve to morrow you shall speak with her and no man shall know said the oldest chassid no not to morrow in a week or two ah you wish to linger among us he replied suspiciously i will go away till the appointed day i replied readily good continue your travels let us say a month or even two if you will not spirit her away in my absence it is as easy to do so in your presence so be it shall we say the eve of chanukah he suggested it was my turn to regard him suspiciously but i could see nothing to cavil at he had merely mentioned an obvious date that of the next festival landmark chanukah the feast of rededication of the temple after the grecian pollution the miracle of the unwaning oil the memorial lighting of lights there seemed nothing in these to work unduly upon the girl's soul except in so far as the inspiring tradition of judas maccabaeus might attach her more devotedly to her conceptions of duty and self dedication perhaps i thought with a flash of jealous anger they meditated a feast of rededication of her after the pollution of my presence had been removed well we should see the eve of chanukah i agreed with a nonchalant air only let the place be where i first met her the path 'twixt mountain and river as you go to the cemetery that would at least be a counter influence to chanukah as they understood none of the subtleties of love they agreed to this and i made them swear by the name when they went their way i stood pondering on the bridge my empty pistol drooping in my hand till sky and river glowed mystically as with blood and the chill evening airs reminded me that november was nigh vii i got to warsaw and back in the time at my disposal but not all the freshness and variety of my experiences could banish the thought of bethulah there were days when i could absorb myself in the passing panorama but i felt always so to speak in the ante chamber of the great moment of our third and decisive meeting and with every shortening day of december that moment approached yet i all but missed it when it came a snowfall i might easily have foreseen retarded my journey at the eleventh hour but my faithful mare ploughed her way through the white morasses as she munched her mid day corn in that quaint christian village that neighboured zloczszol and in which i had agreed to stable her it was borne in on me for the first time that the eve of chanukah was likewise christmas eve i wondered vaguely if there was any occult significance in the coincidence or in the chassidic choice of dates but it was too late now to protest and loading my pistol against foul play i hurried to the rendezvous on the dark barren base of the mountain patches of snow gleamed like winter blossoms the gargoyle like faces of the jags of rock on the river bank were white bearded with icicles down below the stream raced apparently as turbid as ever but suddenly as it made a sharp curve and came under a thick screen of snow laden boughs interarching over the cleft it grew glazed in death the sight of bethulah was as of a spirit of sunshine moving across the white desolation her tall lone shadow fell blue upon the snowy path she was swathed now in splendid silver furs from which her face shone out like a tropical flower beneath its wreathed crown dignity and sovereignty had subtly replaced the grace of her movement her very stature seemed aggrandized by the consciousness of her unique mission she turned and her virginal eyes met mine with abashing purity and in that instant of anguished rapture i knew that my quest was vain the delicate flush of joy and surprise touched her cheeks indeed as before but this time i felt it would not be succeeded by terror self conscious now self poised she stood regally where she had faltered and fled you return to spend chanukah with us she said i came i said with uneasy bravado in the hope of spending it elsewhere with you but you know that cannot be she said gently ah now she knew of what she was queen but revolt was hot in my heart then they have made you share their dream i said bitterly yes she replied with unruffled sweetness how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that bring good tidings and her eyes shone in exultation they were messengers of evil i said whisperers of untruth life is for love and joy ah no she urged tremulously surely you know the world how full it is of suffering and sin and as with an unconscious movement she threw back her splendid furs revealing the weird shroud ah what ecstasy to think that the divine day will come ere i am old when as it is written in the twenty fifth chapter of isaiah 'he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people and the vail that is spread over all nations he will swallow up death in victory and the lord god will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth for the lord hath spoken' her own eyes were full of tears which i yearned to kiss away but your own life meantime i said softly my life does it not already take on the glory of god as this mountain the coming day she seemed indeed akin to the cold white peak as i had seen it flushed with sunrise my passion seemed suddenly prosaic and selfish i was lifted up into the higher love that worships and abnegates god bless you i said and turning away with misty vision saw creeping off the three dark fanatical figures viii half a century later i was startled to find the name of zloczszol in a headline of the sunday edition of my american paper i had married and was even a grandfather for after my return to america the world of bethulah had grown fantastic stupidly superstitious and finally shadowy and almost unreal years and years of happiness had dissipated and obliterated the delicate fragrant dream of spiritual love but that strange long forgotten name stirred instantly the sleeping past to life i adjusted my spectacles and read the column eagerly it was sensational enough though not more so than a hundred columns of calamities in unknown places that one skips or reads with the mildest of thrills the long threatened avalanche had fallen and nature had once more rudely reminded man of his puny place in creation rare conditions had at last come together first a slight fall of snow covering the mountain how vividly i pictured it then a sharp frost which had frozen this deposit after that a measureless blinding snow storm and a cyclonic wind when all seemed calm again the second mass of snow had begun to slide down the frozen surface of the first quickening to a terrific pace tearing down the leafless trunks and shooting them at the village like giant arrows of the angry gods one of these arrows penetrated the trunk of a great cedar on the plain and stuck out on both sides making a sort of cross which the curious came from far and near to see but alas the avalanche had not contented itself with such freakish manifestations it had annihilated the new portion of the village which had dared crawl nearer the mountain when the railroad a railroad in zloczszol had found it cheaper to pass near the base than to make a circuit round the congested portion alas the cheapness was illusory the depot with its crowd had been wiped out as by the offended fury of the mountain though by another freakish incident illustrating the titanic forces at work yet the one redeeming detail of the appalling catastrophe a small train of three carriages that had just moved off was lifted up bodily by the terrible wind that raced ahead of the monstrous sliding snowball and was clapped down in a field out of its reach as if by a protecting hand not a creature on it was injured i had passed the years allotted to man by the psalmist and my memory of the things of yesterday had begun to be faint and elusive but the images of my zloczszol adventure returned with a vividness that grew daily more possessive what had become of bethulah was she alive was she dead and which were the sadder alternative to have felt the darkness of early death closing round the great hope or to have survived its possibility and old bent bitter and deserted by her followers to await the lesser disenchantment of the grave an irresistible instinct impelled me aged as i was myself to revisit alone these scenes of my youth to see how fate had rounded or broken off its grim ironic story i pass over the stages of the journey at the conclusion of which i found myself again in the mountain village alas the changes on the route had prepared me for the change in zloczszol railroads threw their bridges over the gorges i had climbed telegraph poles tamed the erst savage forest ways and zloczszol itself had now by the line passing through it expanded into a trading centre with vitality enough to recuperate quickly from the avalanche the hotel was clean and commodious but i could better have endured that ancient sitting room in which the squalling baby was rocked strange i could see its red wrinkled face catch the very timbre of its piping cries only the mountain was unchanged and the pines and firs that had whispered dreams to my youth whispered sleep to my age ah how frail and futile is the life of man he passes like a shadow and the green sunlit earth he trod on closes over him and takes the tread of the new generations what had i to say to these new smart people in zloczszol no the dead were my gossips and neighbours for me more than the avalanche had desolated zloczszol i repaired to the cemetery there i should find yarchi it was no use looking for him under the porch of the pine cottage and there too i should in all likelihood find bethulah but ben david's tomb was the first i found carved with the intersecting triangles the date showed he had died very soon after my departure perhaps i thought remorsefully my importunities had agitated him too much ah there at last was yarchi under a high white stone he slept as soundly as any straight corpse his sneering mouth had crumbled to dust but i would have given much to hear it once more abuse the chassidim propped on my stick and poring over the faded gilt letters i recalled the handsome stranger whom the years had marred but of bethulah i saw no sign i wandered back and found the turreted house but it had been converted into a large store and from bethulah's turret window hung a great advertising sky sign i returned cheerlessly to the hotel but as the sun began to pierce auspiciously through the bleakness of early march i was about to sally forth again in the direction of yarchi's ancient cottage when the porter directed me as if i were a mere tourist to go to see the giant cedar of lebanon with its titanic arrow however i followed his instructions and pretty soon i espied the broad girthed tree towering over its field with the foreign transpiercing trunk about fifteen feet from the ground making indeed a vast cross leaning against the sunlit cedar was a white robed figure and as i hobbled nearer i saw by the shroud and the crown of flowers that i had found bethulah at my approach she drew herself up in statuesque dignity upright as ben david of yore and looked at me with keen unclouded eyes there was a wondrous beauty of old age in her face and bearing the silver hair banded on the temples glistened picturesquely against the reds and greens and golds of her crown ah stranger she said with a gracious smile you return to us you recognize me i mumbled in amaze it is the face i loved in youth she said simply strange happy wistful tears sprang to my old eyes some blurred sense of youth and love and god your youth seems with you still i said your face is as sweet your voice as full of music the old ecstatic look lit up her eyes it is god who keeps me ever young till the great day dawns i was taken aback what she believed still that alternative had not figured in my prevision of pathetic closes i was silent but the old tumult of thought raged within me but is not the day passed forever i murmured at last the light in her eyes became queenly fire while there is life she cried in the veins of the house of ben david and as she spoke my eye caught the gleam of the persian emerald on her forefinger and your worshippers what of them i asked her eyes grew sad after my father's death his memory for a blessing the pilgrims fell off and when the years passed without the miracle his followers even here in zloczszol began to weaken and slowly a new generation arose impatient and lax which believed not in the faith of their forefathers and mocked my footsteps saying 'behold the dreamer cometh' and then the black fire monster came whizzing daily to and fro on the steel lines and breathing out fumes of unfaith and the young men said lo there is our true redeemer wherefore as the years waxed and waned until at last advancing death threw his silver shadow on my hair even the faithful grew to doubt and they said 'but a few short years more and death must claim her her mission unfulfilled and the lamp of israel's hope shattered forever perchance it is we that have misunderstood the prophecies not here not here shall god's great miracle be wrought this is not holy ground for the lord dwelleth in zion' they cried with the prophets only on the sacred soil outside of which god has never revealed himself only in palestine they said can israel's redeemer be born as it is written 'but upon mount zion shall be deliverance and there shall be holiness' then these and the scoffers persuaded me seeing that i waxed very old and i sold my father's house now grown of high value to obtain the money for the journey and i made ready to start for jerusalem there had been a whirlwind and a great snow the day before and i would have tarried but they said i must arrive in the holy city ere the eve of chanukah and putting off my shroud and my crown seeing that only in jerusalem i might be a bride i trusted myself to the fire monster and a vast company went with me to the starting place both of those who believed that salvation was of zion and those who scoffed but the monster had scarcely crawled out under god's free heaven than god's hand lifted me up and those with me for my blessedness covered them and put us down very far off while a great white thunder bolt fell upon the building and upon the scoffers and upon those who had prated of zion and behold they were not the multitude of moab was as straw trodden down for the dunghill and the high fort of the fire monster was brought down and laid low and brought to the ground even to the dust then arose a great cry from all the town and the mountain and a rending of garments and a weeping in sackcloth and many returned to the faith in me for god's hand has shown that here and not elsewhere is the miracle to be wrought as it is written word for word in the twenty fifth chapter of isaiah 'and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people and the vail that is spread over all nations he will swallow up death in victory and the lord god shall wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth for the lord hath spoken it and it shall be said in that day lo this is our god we have waited for him and he will save us this is the lord we have waited for him we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation for in this mountain shall the hand of the lord rest and moab shall be trodden down under him even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth to swim and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands and the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down lay low and bring to the ground even to the dust' and here in this cedar of lebanon transplanted like israel under the shadow of this alien mountain the lord has shot a bolt for a sign to all that can read and here i come daily to pray and to await the divine moment she ceased and her eyes turned to the now stainless heaven and as i gazed upon her shining face it seemed to me that the fresh flowers and leaves of her crown still wet with the dew seen against that garment of death and the silver of decaying life were symbolic of an undying ever rejuvenescent hope ix a last surprise awaited me bethulah now lived all alone in yarchi's pine cottage which the years had left untouched whether accident or purpose settled her there i do not know but my heart was overcharged with mingled emotion as i went up the garden the next day to pay her a farewell visit the poppies flaunted riotously amid the neglected maize but the cottage itself seemed tidy it was the season when the cold wrinkled lips of winter meet the first kiss of spring and death is passing into resurrection it was the hour when the chill shadows steal upon the sunlit day in the sky was the shot purple of a rolling moor merging into a glow of lovely green i stood under the porch where yarchi had been wont to sun and snuff himself and knocked at the door but receiving no answer i lifted the latch softly and looked in bethulah was at her little table her head lying on a great old bible which her arms embraced one long finger of departing sunlight pointed through the window and touched the flowers on the gray hair i stole in with a cold fear that she was dead but she seemed only asleep with that sleep of old age which is so near to death and is yet the renewal of life i was curious to see what she had been reading it was the eighteenth chapter of genesis and in the shadow of her crown ran the verses and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shalt i of a surety bear a child which am old is anything too hard for the lord vii the keeper of conscience vii the keeper of conscience i salvina brill walked to and fro in the dingy hackney terrace waiting till her mother should return with the house key so far as change of scene was concerned the little pupil teacher might as well have stood still everywhere bow windows venetian blinds little front gardens all that had represented domestic grandeur to her after a childhood of apartments in spitalfields though her subsequent glimpse of the west end home in which her sister kitty was governess had made her dazedly aware of alps beyond alps though only seventeen salvina was not superficially sweet and could win no consideration from the seated males in the homeward train and the heat of the weather and the crush of humanity high hats sandwiched between workmen's tool baskets had made her head ache her day at the whitechapel school had already been trying and thursday was always heavy with the accumulated fatigues of the week it was unfortunate that her mother should be late but she remembered how at breakfast the good creature had promised father to make a little excursion to the borough and take a packet of tea to the house of some distant relatives of his who were sitting shivah seven days' mourning the non possession of a servant made it necessary to lock up the house and pull down the blinds when its sole occupant went visiting after a few minutes of vain expectation salvina mechanically returned to her greek grammar which opened as automatically at the irregular verbs she had just achieved the greatest distinction of her life and one not often paralleled in board school girl circles by matriculating at the london university hers was only a second class pass but gained by private night study supplemented by some evening lessons at the people's palace it was sufficiently remarkable especially when one considered she had still other subjects to prepare for the centres salvina was now audaciously aiming at the bachelorhood of arts for which the greek verbs were far more irregular it was not only the love of knowledge that animated her as a bachelor she might become a head mistress nay might even aspire to follow the lead of her dashing elder sister and teach in a wealthy family that treated you as one of itself not that kitty had ever matriculated but an ugly duckling needs many plumes of learning ere it can ruffle itself like a beautiful swan who should now come upon the promenading student but sugarman the shadchan his hand full of papers and his blue bandanna trailing from his left coat tail ah you are the very person i was coming to see he cried gleefully in his corrupt german accent what is your sister's address now why said salvina distrustfully i have a fine young man for her salvina's pallid cheek coloured with modesty and resentment my sister doesn't need your services maybe not said sugarman unruffled but the young man does he saw your sister once years ago before he went to the cape now he is a takif rich man and wants a wife he's not rich enough to buy kitty salvina's romantic soul was outraged and she spoke with unwonted asperity he is rich enough to buy kitty all she wants he is quite in love with her she can ask for anything then let him go and tell her so himself what does he come to you for he must be a very poor lover poor i tell you he is rolling in gold it's the luckiest thing that could have happened to your family you will all ride in your carriage you ought to fall on your knees and bless me your sister is not so young any more at nineteen a girl can't afford to sniff believe me there are thousands of girls who would jump at the chance yes girls with dowries too and your sister hasn't a penny my sister has a heart and a soul retorted salvina witheringly and she wants a heart and a soul to sympathize with hers not a money bag then won't you take a ticket for the lotteree rejoined sugarman pleasantly then you get a money bag of your own no thank you not even half a ticket only thirty six shillings you needn't pay me now i trust you she shook her head but think i may win you the great prize a hundred thousand marks the sum fascinated salvina and for an instant her imagination played with its marvellous potentialities they could all move to the country and there among the birds and the flowers she could study all day long and even try for a degree with honours her father would be saved from the cigar factory her sister from exile amid strangers her mother should have a servant her brother the wife he coveted all her spitalfields circle had speculated through sugarman not without encouraging hits she smiled as she remembered the vendor of slippers who had won sixty pounds and was so puffed up that when his wife stopped in the street to speak to a shabby acquaintance he cried vehemently betsey betsey do learn to behave according to your station you don't believe me said sugarman misapprehending her smile you can read it all for yourself a hundred thousand marks so sure my little nehemiah shall see rejoicings look but salvina waved back the thin rustling papers with their exotic continental flavour gambling is wicked she said sugarman was incensed me in a wicked business why i know more talmud than anybody in london and can be called up the law as morenu you'll say marrying is wicked next but they are both state institutions england is the only country in the world without a lotteree salvina wavered but her instinct was repugnant to money that did not accumulate itself by slow painful economies and her multifarious reading had made the word speculation a prism of glittering vice i daresay you think it's not wrong she said and i apologize if i hurt your feelings but don't you see how you go about unsettling people me why i settle them and if you'd only give me your sister's address his persistency played upon salvina's delicate conscience made her feel she must not refuse the poor man everything besides the grand address would choke him off she's at bedford square with the samuelsons ah i know two daughters lily and mabel and sugarman instead of being impressed nodded his head as if even the samuelsons were mortal and marriageable yes my sister is their governess and companion but you'll only waste your time you think so he said triumphantly look at this likeness and he drew out the photograph of a coarse faced middle aged man with a jaunty flower in his frock coat and a prosperous abdomen supporting a heavily trinketed watch chain underneath swaggered the signature yours truly moss m rosenstein salvina shuddered he was wise to send you she said slyly is it not so ah and your brother too would have done better to come to me instead of falling in love with a girl with a hundred pounds but i bear your family no grudge you see perhaps it is not too late yet tell lazarus that if he should come to break with the jonases there are better fish in the sea gold fish too good bye we shall both dance at your sister's wedding and he tripped off salvina resumed her greek but the grotesque aorists could not hold her attention she was hungry and worn out and even when her mother came it would be some time before her evening meal could be prepared she felt she must sit down if only on her doorsteps but their whiteness was inordinately marred as by many dirty boots she wondered whose and why and she had to content herself with leaning against the stucco balustrade and gradually as the summer twilight faded the grammar dropped in her hand and salvina fell a dreaming what did she dream of this board school drudge whose pasty face was craned curiously forward on sloping shoulders was it of the enchanted land of love of which sugarman had reminded her but over whose roses he had tramped so grossly alas sugarman himself had never thought of her as a client for any but the lottery section of his business within she was one glow of eager romance of honour of quixotic duty but no ray of this pierced without to give a sparkle to the eye a colour to the cheek no faintest dash of coquetry betrayed the yearning of the soul or gave grace to walk or gesture her dress was merely a tidy covering her exquisite sensibility found bodily expression only as a clumsy shyness poor salvina ii at last the welcome jar and creak of the gate awoke her why i thought you knew i had to go to the borough began a fretful voice forestalling reproach and a buxom woman resplendent with black satin and much jewellery came up the tiny garden path it doesn't matter mother i haven't been waiting long well you know how difficult it is to get a 'bus in this weather at least if you want to sit outside and it always makes my head ache frightfully to go inside i'm not strong and young like you and such a long way i had to change at the bank and i made sure you'd get something to eat at one of the girls' and go straight to the people's palace still muttering mrs brill produced a key and after some fumbling threw open the door both made a step within then both stopped aghast it's the wrong house thought salvina confusedly conscious of her power of making such mistakes kisshuf witchcraft whispered her mother terrified into her native idiom the passage lay before them entirely bare of all its familiar colour and furniture the framed engravings depicting the trials of william lord russell in the old bailey and earl stafford in westminster hall the flower pots on the hall table the proudly purchased hat rack the metal umbrella stand all gone and beyond facing them lay the parlour an equally forlorn vacancy striking like a blast of chilly wind through its wide open door thieves cried mrs brill reverting from the supernatural and the yiddish murder i'm ruined they've stolen my house hush hush said salvina strung to calm by her mother's incoherence let us see first what has really happened happened haven't you got eyes in your head all the fruit of my years of toil and mrs brill wrung her jewelled hands your father would have me call on those sperlings though i told him they'd be glad to dance on my tomb and why didn't lazarus stay at home you know he has to be out looking for work and my gilt clock that i trembled even to wind up and the big vase with the picture on it and my antimacassars and my beautiful couch that nobody had ever sat upon oh my god oh my god leaving her mother moaning out a complete inventory in the passage salvina advanced into the violated parlour it was an aching void on the bare mantelpiece just where the gilt clock had announced a perpetual half past two gleamed an unstamped letter she took it up wonderingly it was in her father's schoolboyish hand addressed to her mother she opened it as usual for mrs brill did not even know the alphabet and refused steadily to make its acquaintance to the ironic humiliation of the board school teacher you would not let me give you get ran the letter abruptly so you have only yourself to blame i have left the clothes in the bed rooms but what is mine is mine good bye michael brill ps don't try to find me at the factory i have left salvina steadied herself against the mantelpiece till the room should have finished reeling round get her father had wanted to put away her mother divorce departure devastation what strange things were these come to wreck a prosperity so slowly built up quick salvina there goes a policeman came her mother's cry the room stood still suddenly hush hush mother salvina said imperiously there's no thief she ran back into the passage the letter in her hand a fierce flame of intelligence leapt into the woman's face ah it's your father she cried i knew it i knew he'd go after that painted widow just because she has a little money a black curse on her bones oh oh god in heaven to bring such shame on me for the sake of a saucy nosed slut whose sister sold ironmongery in petticoat lane a low lot one and all and not fit to wipe my shoes on even when she was respectable and this is what you call a father salvina oh my god my god salvina was by this time dazed yet she had a gleam of consciousness left with which to register this culminating destruction of all her social landmarks what that monstrous wickedness of marquises and epauletted officers which hovered vaguely in the shadow land of novels and plays had tumbled with a bang into real life had fallen not even into its natural gilded atmosphere but through the amulet guarded doors of a respectable jewish family in the heart of a hackney terrace amid the horsehair couches and deal tables of homely reality nay more sordid than the romantic wickedness of shadowland it had even removed those couches and tables and oddly blent with this tossing chaos of new thought in salvina's romantic brain surged up another thought no less new and startling her father and mother had once loved each other they too had dawned upon each other fairy prince and fairy princess had laid in each other's hand that warm touch of trust and readiness to live and die for each other it was very wonderful and she almost forgot their hostile relationship in a rapid back glance upon the years in which they had lived in mutual love before her unsuspecting eyes their prosaic bickering selves were transfigured her vivid imagination threw off the damage of the years saw her coarse red cheeked father and her too plump mother as the idyllic figures on the lamented parlour vase and when her thought struggled painfully back to the actual moment it was with a new concrete sense of its tragic intensity o mother mother she cried as she threw her arms round her the greek grammar and the letter fell unregarded to the floor the fountain of mrs brill's wrongs leapt higher at the sympathy and i could have had half a dozen young men the boils of egypt be upon him time after time i said 'no' though the shadchan bewitched my parents into believing that michael was an angel without wings but you also thought father an angel salvina pleaded yes and now he has got wings said mrs brill savagely salvina's tears began to ooze out poor swain and shepherdess on the parlour vase was this then how idylls ended perhaps he'll come back she murmured the wife snorted viciously and my furniture the beautiful furniture i toiled and scraped for that he always grumbled at though i saved it out of the housekeeping money without its costing him a penny and no man in london had better meals hot meat every day and fish for sabbath even when plaice were eightpence a pound and no servant every scrap of work done with my own two hands now he carts everything away as if it were his i suppose it is by law salvina said mildly law i'll have the law on him oh no mother and salvina shuddered besides he has left our clothes mrs brill's eye lit up i see no clothes in our rooms the letter says so and you still believe what he says she began to mount the stairs i am sure he packed in my paisley shawl while he was about it it is fortunate i wore all my jewellery and you always say i put on too much sustained by this unanswerable vindication of her past policy mrs brill ascended the stairs without further wailing salvina whose sense of romance never exalted her above the practical remembered now that her brother lazarus might come back at any moment clamorously hungry this pinned her to the concrete moment how to get him some supper and her mother too must be faint and tired she ran into the kitchen and found enough odds and ends left to make a meal and even a cracked teapot and a few coarse cups not worth carrying away and with a sense of robinson crusoe adventure she extracted light heat and cheerfulness from the obedient gas branch which took on the air of a case of precious goods not washed away in the household wreck when her mother at last came down cataloguing the wardrobe salvage in picturesque yiddish salvina stopped her curses with hot tea they both drank leaning against the kitchen dresser which served for a table for the cups salvina's crusoe excitement increased when her mother asked her where they were to sleep seeing that even the beds had been spirited away i have five shillings in my purse i'll go out and buy a cheap mattress but then there's lazarus oh dear lazarus has his own bed yes yes thank god we'll be able to borrow his wedding furniture but it's all stored away in the jonas's attic a smart rat tat at the door denoted the inopportune return of lazarus himself salvina darted upstairs to let him in and break the shock he was a slimmer and more elegant edition of his father a year older than kitty and taller than salvina by a jaunty head and shoulders and why isn't the hall lamp alight he queried as her white face showed itself in the dusky door slit it looks so beastly shabby the only light's in the kitchen i daresay you and the mater are pigging there again why can't you live up to your position the unexpected reproach broke her down we have no position any more she sobbed out and all the long years of paralyzing economies swept back to her memory all the painful progress accelerated by her growing salary from the hounsditch apartments to the bow windows and gas chandeliers of hackney what do you mean what is the matter speak you little fool don't cry he came across the threshold and shook her roughly father's run away with the furniture and some woman she explained chokingly the devil the smart cane slipped from his fingers and he maintained his cigar in his mouth with difficulty do you mean to say the old man has gone and the beastly brute the selfish hypocrite but how could he get the furniture he made mother go on a visit to the borough the old fox that's your religious chaps i'll go and give 'em both brimstone where are they i don't know where but you must not it is all too horrible there's nothing even to sleep on we thought of borrowing your furniture what and give the whole thing away to the jonases and lose rhoda perhaps good heavens sally don't be so beastly selfish think of the disgrace if we can't cover it up the disgrace is for father not for you don't be an idiot old jonas looked down on us enough already and if it hadn't been for kitty's calling on him in the samuelsons' carriage he might never have consented to the engagement oh dear said salvina melted afresh by this new aspect my poor lazarus and she gazed dolefully at the handsome youth who had divided with kitty the good looks of the family but still she added consolingly you couldn't have married for a long time anyhow i don't know so much i had a very promising interview this afternoon with the manager of granders brothers the big sponge people but you don't understand travelling in sponge pooh travelling's travelling there's nothing to understand whatever the article is you just tell lies about it oh lazarus don't make eyes you ain't pretty enough what do you know of the world you who live mewed up in a board school i daresay you believe all the rot you have to tell the little girls her brother's shot made a wound he had not intended salvina was at last reminded of her own relation to the sordid tragedy of what the other teachers would think ay even the little girls so sharp in all that did not concern school learning would her pupils have any inkling of the cloud on teacher's home ah her brother was right this disgrace besplashed them all and she saw herself confusedly as a tainted figure holding forth on honour and duty to rows of white pinafores iii meantime her mother had toiled up her jewels glittering curiously in the dusk and now poured herself out to the fresh auditor in a breathless wail recapitulated her long years of devotion and the abstracted contents of the house but lazarus soon wearied of the inventory of her virtues and furniture what's the use of crying over spilt milk he said you must get a new jug a new jug and what about the basin and the coffee pot and the saucepans and the plates and my new blue dish with the willow pattern oh my god don't be so stupid she's a little dazed lazarus dear have patience with her lazarus says it's no use crying and letting the neighbours hear you we must make the best of a bad job and cover it up you'll soon cover me up i won't need my clothes then only a clean shroud after twenty years he wipes his mouth and he goes away tear the rent in your garments children mine your mother is dead how can any one have patience with her cried lazarus one would think it was such a treat for her to live with father judging by the rows you've had mother you ought to be thankful to be rid of him i am thankful she retorted hysterically who said i wasn't a grumbling grunting pig who grudged me my horsehair couch because he couldn't sit on it well let him squat on it now with his lady i don't care all my enemies will pity me will they if they only knew how glad i was and she broke into more sobs come mother come downstairs lazarus don't let us stay up in the dark not me said lazarus i'm not going down to hear this all over again besides where am i to sit or to sleep i must go to an hotel he struck a match to relight his cigar and it flared weirdly upon the tear smudged female faces got any money salvina he said more gently only five shillings well i daresay i can manage on that good night mother don't take on so it'll be all the same a hundred years hence he opened the door then paused with his hand on the knob and said awkwardly i suppose you'll manage to find something to sleep on just for to night oh yes said salvina reassuringly we'll manage don't worry dear i'll be in the first thing in the morning we'll have a council of war good night it is a beastly mean trick and he went out meditatively when he was gone salvina remembered that the five shillings were for the mattress but she further bethought herself that the sum would scarcely have sufficed even for a straw mattress and that the little gold ring kitty had given her when she matriculated would fetch more her mother's jewellery must be left sacred the poor creature was smarting enough from the sense of loss bidding her sit on the stairs till she returned she hastened into mare street the great hackney highway christened the devil's mile by the salvation army early experience had familiarized her with the process of pawning but now she slipped furtively into the first pawn shop and did not stay to make a good bargain she spent on a telegram to the central post office sixpence of the proceeds so that she might be able to draw out without delay the few pounds she had laid by for her summer holiday while she was purchasing the mattress at the garishly illuminated furniture store the words hire system caught her eye and seemed a providential solution of the position she broached negotiations for the furnishing of a bed room and a kitchen minus carpet and oilcloth for these would not fit the cheaper apartments into which they would now have to revert but she found there were tedious formalities to be gone through and that her own signature would be invalid as she was legally a child however she was able to secure the porterage of the mattress at once and followed by a bending atlas she hurried back to her mother who sat on her stair moaning and diverted her from her griefs by teaching her to sign her name in view of the legal exigencies of the morrow it was a curious wind up to her day's teaching poor mrs brill's obstinate objection to education had to give way at last under such unexpected conditions but she insisted on the shortest possible spelling and so the uncouth esther brills pencilled at the top of the sheet were exchanged for more flowing e brills lower down even then the good woman took the thing as a pictorial flourish or a section of a map and disdained acquaintance with the constituent letters so that her progress in learning remained only nominal then the infant at law put her mother to bed and lay down beside her on the mattress both in their clothes for lack of blankets the mother soon dozed off but the child lay turning from side to side the pressure of her little tasks had dulled the edge of emotion but now in the silence of the night the whole tragic position came back with all its sordid romanticism its pathetic meanness and when at last she slept its obsession lay heavy upon her dreams and she sat at her examination desk in the london university striving horridly to recall the irregularities of greek verbs and to set them down with a pen that could never dip up any ink while the inexorable hands of the clock went round and her father in the coveted bachelor's gown waited to spirit away her desk and seat as soon as the hour should strike iv the next morning salvina should have awakened with a sense through all her bones that it was friday the last day of the school week harbinger of such blessed rest that the mere expectation of it was also a rest alas she woke from the nightmare of sleep to the nightmare of reality and the week end meant only time to sound the horror of the new situation in one point alone friday remained a consolation only one day to face her fellow teachers and her children and then two days for hiding from the world with her pain for preparing to face it again to say nothing of the leisure for practical recuperation of the home lazarus turned up so late that the council of war was of the briefest and held almost on the door step for salvina must be in school by nine the thought of staying away even in this crisis simply did not occur to her she arranged that lazarus was to meet her in the city after morning school when she would have drawn her savings from the post office more than enough for the advance on the furniture which must be delivered that very afternoon lazarus had been for telegraphing at once to kitty for assistance but salvina put her foot down let us not frighten her i will go and break it to her on sunday afternoon you know she can't spare any money it is as much as she can do to dress up to the position i do hope the scandal won't spread said lazarus gloomily it would be a nice thing if she lost the position and fell back on our hands yes he has ruined all my children sobbed mrs brill breaking out afresh but what did he care ah if it wasn't for me you would have been in the workhouse long ago well then go and do your sabbath marketing or else we'll have to go there now said lazarus not unkindly the tradespeople will give you credit rather they know i never ran away and mind mother said salvina as she snatched up her greek grammar mind the fried fish is as good as usual we're a long way from the workhouse yet and if you're not in to night lazarus she whispered as she ran off i'll never forgive you well i'm blowed said lazarus looking after the awkward little figure flying to catch the yes but i've no frying pan mrs brill called after her you'll have it by this afternoon salvina called back reassuringly the sun was already strong the train packed and salvina stood so jammed in that she could scarcely hold her grammar open and the irregular verbs danced before her eyes even more than their strange moods and tenses warranted at the school her thrilling consciousness of her domestic tragedy interposed some strange veil between her and her fellow teachers and they seemed to stand away from her enveloped in another atmosphere she heard herself teaching five elevens are fifty five and her own self seemed to stand away from her too she noted without protest two of the girls pulling each other's hair in some far off hazy world and the answering drone of the class five elevens are fifty five seemed like the peaceful buzzing of a gigantic blue bottle on a drowsy afternoon it occurred to her suddenly that she was fifty five years old and when miss rolver the christian head mistress came into her room salvina had an unexpected feeling of advantage in life experience over this desiccated specimen of femininity redolent of time tables record parchments foolscap and clean blotting paper outside all this scheduled world pulsed a large irregular life of flesh and blood all the primitive verbs in every language were irregular it suddenly flashed upon her and she had an instant of vivifying insight into the greek language she had unquestioningly accepted as dead saw grecian men and women breathing their thoughts and passions even expressing the shape of their throats and lips through these erratic aorists you look tired dear said the head mistress it's the heat salvina murmured never mind the summer holidays will soon be here it sounded a mockery summer holidays would no longer mean ramsgate and delicious days of study on sunny cliffs with the relaxation of novels and poems these slowly achieved luxuries of the last two years were impossible for this year at least and this thought of being penned up in london during the dog days oppressed her she felt choking her next sensation was of water sprinkling on her face and of miss rolver's kind anxious voice asking her if she felt better instead of replying salvina wondered in a clouded way where the school managers were even her naive mind had been struck at last by the coincidence that whenever after a managers' meeting these omnipotent ladies and gentlemen from a higher world strolled through the school miss rolver happened to be discovered in an interesting attitude if it was the play hour she would be for this occasion only in the playground leading the games surrounded by clamorously affectionate little ones if it was working time she was found as a human island amid a sea of sewing billows of pinafores and aprons heaved tumultuously around her or with a large air of angelic motherhood she would be tying up some child's bruised finger her greatest invention so it had appeared to the scrupulous salvina was the stray starved half frozen sweet little kitten lapping up milk from a saucer before a ruddy blazing fire at the very instant of the great personages' passage how they had beamed one and all at the touching sight hence it was that salvina's dazed vision now sought vaguely for the school managers but in another instant she realized that this present solicitude was not for another but for herself and that it had nothing of the theatrical a remorseful pang of conscience added to her pains she said tremulously that she felt better and was gently chided for over study and admonished to go home and rest oh no i am all right now she responded instinctively but i'll take your class miss rolver insisted and salvina found herself wandering outside in the free sunshine with a sense of the forbidden an acute consciousness of board school classes droning dutifully all over london made the streets at that hour strange and almost sinful she went to the post office and drew out as much of her money as red tape allowed and while wandering about in whitechapel waiting for the hour of her rendezvous with lazarus she had time to purchase a coarse but white table cloth a plush cover embroidered with jerusalem in hebrew and a gilt goblet these were for the friday night table v but the sabbath brought no peace though miracles were wrought in that afternoon and except that it was laid in the kitchen the sabbath table had all its immemorial air with the consecration cup the long plaited loaves under the jerusalem cover and the dish of fried fish that had grown to seem no less religious yet there could be no glossing over the absence of the gross paunched paternal figure that had so unctuously presided over the ceremony his vacant place held all the emptiness of death and all the fulness of retrospective profanation how like he was to moss m rosenstein salvina thought suddenly lazarus had ignored the gilt goblet and the shilling bottle of claret and was helping himself from the coffee pot when his mother cried bitterly what are we to eat like the animals oh bother lazarus exclaimed you know i hate all these mummeries i wouldn't say if they really made people good but you see for yourself oh but you must say kiddush lazarus said salvina half pleadingly half peremptorily she fetched the prayer book and lazarus grumbling inarticulately took the head of the table and stumbled through the prayer thanking god for having chosen and sanctified israel above all nations and in love and favour given it the holy sabbath as an inheritance but oh how tamely the words sounded how void of that melodious devotion thrilling through the joyous roulades of the father it was a sort of symbol of the mutilated home and thus salvina felt it and she remembered the last ceremony at which her father had presided that of the separation when the sabbath faded into work day the ceremony of division between the holy and the profane and she shivered to think it had indeed marked for the unhappy man the line of demarcation blessed art thou o lord our god who hallowest the sabbath lazarus was mumbling and in another instant he was awkwardly distributing the ritual morsels of bread but the mother could not swallow hers for indignant imaginings of the rival sabbath board may her morsel choke her she cried and nearly was choked by her own oh mother do not mention her neither her nor him never any more said salvina and again the new note of peremptoriness rang in her voice and her mother stopped suddenly short like a scolded child will you have plaice or sole mother salvina went on her voice changing to a caress i can't eat salvina don't ask me but you must eat and salvina calmly helped her to fish and to coffee and put in the lumps of sugar and the mother ate and drank with equal calm as if hypnotized all through the meal salvina's mind kept swinging betwixt the past and the future strange odds and ends of scenes came up in which her father figured and her old and new conceptions of him interplayed bewilderingly her sudden vision of him as moss m rosenstein persisted and could only be laid by concentrating her thoughts on the early days when he used to take herself and kitty to victoria park carrying her in his arms when she was tired but it made her cry to see that little tired happy figure cuddling the trusted giant and she had to jump for refuge into the future they must move back to hounsditch she must give up the idea of becoming a bachelor the hours of evening study must now be devoted to teaching others her university distinction was already great enough to give her an unusual chance of pupils while her yiddish sucked in with her mother's milk had become exceptionally good german under study she might hope for as much as two shillings an hour and thus earn a whole sovereign extra per week and over this poor helpless blighted mother she would watch as over a child all the maternal instinct in her awoke under the stress of this curiously inverted position her remorseful memory summoned a penitential procession of bygone petulances never again would she be cross or hasty with this ill starred heroine yes her mother was become a figure of romance to her as well as a nursling this woman whose prosaic humours she had so often fretted under was in truth a woman who had lived and loved she had ceased to be a mere mother a large being who presided over one's childhood and this imaginative insight she noted with surprise would never have been hers but for her father's desertion like one who realizes the virtues of a corpse she had waited till love was slain to perceive its fragrance a postman's knock as the meal was finished made her heart give a corresponding pit a pat and she turned quite faint all her nerves seemed to be on the rack expecting new sensational developments the letter was for lazarus ah you abomination cried his mother as he tore open the envelope he did not pause to defend his sabbath breaking but cried joyfully what did i tell you granders brothers offer me travelling expenses and a commission oh thank god thank god ejaculated his mother her eyes raised piously he took up his hat where are you going said mrs brill to see rhoda of course don't you think she's as anxious about it as you salvina's eyes were full of sympathetic tears yes yes let him go mother vi on the sunday afternoon feeling much better for the saturday rest and scrupulously gloved shod and robed in deference to the grandeur of her destination salvina boarded an omnibus and after a tedious journey involving a walk at the end she arrived at the west end square in which her sister bloomed as governess and companion in a newly enriched jewish family she stood an instant in the porch to compose herself for the tragic task before her and felt in her pocket to be sure she had not lost the little bottle of smelling salts with which she had considerately armed herself in anticipation of a failure of kitty's nerves then she knocked timidly at the door which was opened by a speckless boy in buttons who also opened up to her imagination endless vistas of aristocratic association his impressive formality as of the priest of a shrine seemed untinged by any remembrance that on her one previous visit she had been made free of the holy of holies but perhaps it was not the same boy he was indeed less a boy to her than a row of buttons and less a row of buttons than a symbol of all the elegances and opulences in which kitty moved as to the manner born the elaborate ritual of the toilette the sacramental shaving of poodles the mysterious panoramic dinners in which one had to be constantly aware of the appropriate fork salvina had not waited a minute in the imposing hall ere a radiant belle flew down the stairs with a vivacity that troubled the sacro sanct atmosphere and caught salvina in her arms oh you dear sally i am so glad to see you and a fusillade of kisses accompanied the hug whatever brings you here oh and such a dowdy frock you needn't flush up so silly little child nobody expects you to know how to dress like us ignoramuses and it doesn't matter to day there's no one to see you for they're all out driving and i'm lying down with a headache poor kitty but then you ought to be out driving she was divided between sympathy for the sufferer and admiration of the finished fine ladyhood implied in indifference to the chance of a carriage drive yes but i've so many letters to write and they don't really drive on sundays just stop at house after house and not good houses either it is such a bore they've never shaken off the society they had before they made their money well but that's rather nice of them perhaps but not nice for me but come upstairs and you shall have some tea salvina mounted the broad staircase with a reverence attuned to her own hushed footfalls but her task of breaking the news to her sister weighed the heavier upon her for all this subdued magnificence it seemed almost profane to bring the squalid episodes of hackney into this atmosphere appropriate indeed to the sinful romances of marquises and epauletted officers but wholly out of accord with surreptitious furniture vans what a blow to poor kitty the news would be she dallied weakly till the tea was brought by a powdered footman then she had an ingenious idea for a little shock to lead up to a greater she would say they were going to move but as she took off her white glove not to sully it with the tea and cake kitty cried why what have you done with my ring here was an excellent natural opening but salvina was taken too much aback to avail herself of it especially as the artificial opening preoccupied her mind oh your ring's all right she said hastily i came to tell you we are going to move kitty clapped her hands ah so you've taken my advice at last i'm so glad it wasn't nice for me to stay with you at that dingy hole even for a day or two a year mustn't mother be pleased salvina bit her lip her task was now heavier than ever no mother isn't pleased she is crying about it crying disgusting how she still hankers after spitalfields and the lane she isn't crying for that but because father won't go with us oh i have no patience with father he hasn't a soul above red herrings and potatoes oh yes he has he has left us what left you kitty's pretty eyes opened wide because he won't move to a better house no we are moving to a worse house because he has moved to a better what are you talking about is it a joke a riddle i give it up father can't you guess kitty father has gone away there is some other woman no gasped kitty ha ha ha ha and she shook with long peals of silvery laughter well of all the funny things ha ha ha funny and salvina looked at her sternly what don't you see the humour of it father turning into the hero of a novelette romance and red herrings passion and potatoes ha ha ha if you had seen the havoc it wrought you wouldn't have had the heart to laugh oh well mother was crying that i understand but that's nothing new for her she'd cry just as much if he were there the average rainfall is how many inches salvina's face was stern and white a mother's tears are sacred she said in low but firm protest oh dear me sally i always forget you have no sense of humour well what are you going to do about it and her own sense of humour continued to twitch and dimple the corners of her pretty mouth i told you we cannot afford to keep up the house we must go back to apartments in spitalfields instantly kitty's face grew as serious as salvina's oh nonsense she said instinctively the thought of her family returning to the discarded shell of apartments was humiliating her own personality seemed being dragged back we can't pay the rent we must give a quarter's notice at once absurd you'll only save a few shillings a week why can't you let apartments yourselves at least you would preserve a decent appearance is it worth while having the responsibility of the rent there's only mother and i we shan't need a house but there's lazarus he'll have a place of his own he'll marry before our notice expires that same jonas girl yes ridiculous small tradespeople and dreadfully common all the lot i thought he'd got over his passion for that bold black creature who's been seen licking ice cream out of a street glass to connect us with that family men are so selfish but i still don't see why you can't remain as you are let your drawing room say furnished but it isn't furnished not furnished why i've sat on the couch myself yes said salvina a faint smile tempering her deadly gravity you are the only person who has ever done that but there's no couch now father smuggled all the furniture away in a van again kitty's silver laughter rang out unquenchably and you don't call that funny eloped with the chairs i call it killing yes for mother said salvina pooh she'll outlive all of us i wish you were as sure of getting the furniture back she's not a bad mother as mothers go but you take her too seriously but kitty consider the disgrace the disgrace of having a wicked parent i've endured for years the disgrace of having a poor one and that's worse my people the samuelsons i mean will never even hear of the pater's escapade gossip keeps strictly to its station and even if they do they know already my family's under a cloud and they have learned to accept me for myself well i am glad you don't mind said salvina half relieved half shocked i mind if it makes you uncomfortable you dear silly sally oh don't worry about me i think i'll go back to mother now nonsense why we haven't begun to talk yet have another cup of tea no how's old miss what's a name your head mistress any more frozen little kittens she's very kind really i'm sorry i told you about the kitten she let me go home early on friday why to track the van no i wasn't very well poor sally and kitty hugged her again i daresay you were more upset than mother tears came into salvina's eyes at her sister's affectionateness oh no but please don't talk about it any more father is dead to us now then we must speak well of him salvina shuddered he is a wicked heartless man and mother and i never wish to see his face again a cloud darkened kitty's blonde brow yes but she isn't going to marry another man i hope how can she said salvina i wouldn't let her make any public scandal but aren't there funny laws in our religion get and things like that which dispense with the english courts i believe there are i read about something of the kind in a novel oh yes and father did offer mother get before he went off so i suppose he considers his conscience clear well i rely upon you sally to see that she doesn't marry or complicate things more we don't want two wicked parents of course not but i am sure she doesn't dream of any new complications you don't do her justice kitty she's just broken hearted a perpetual widow with worse than her husband's death to lament yes her lost furniture oh kitty do realize what it means i do my dear i do realize it it's too killing passion in a pantechnicon or elopements economically conducted by the day or hour oh dear oh dear but do promise me salvina that you won't go back to spitalfields i must be somewhere near the school dearest it will save train fares kitty pouted well you know i couldn't drive up to see you any more hackney was all but outside the radius the radius of respectability i couldn't ask coachman to go to spitalfields unless i pretended to be slumming well pretend oh salvina i thought you were so conscientious no i'll have to come in a cab you're quite sure you won't have some more tea oh do i insist one piece of sugar yes thank you dear by the way has sugarman the shadchan been here you mean has he gone oh poor kitty it was my fault i let him know your address i do hope the horrid man hasn't worried you sugarman no moss m rosenstein how pat you have his name but why do you call him horrid salvina stared but have you seen his photograph oh you can't go by photographs he has been here what sugarman had the impudence to bring him kitty flushed slightly no he called alone this afternoon just before you what impertinence a brazen commercial courtship you wouldn't receive him of course oh well i thought it would be fun just to look at him said kitty uneasily a commercial courtship as you express it is not unamusing i don't see anything amusing in it it's an outrage i told you you had no sense of humour i find it comic to be loved before first sight by a man who has no h's but only l's s's and d's sugarman says he did see you before loving you noticed you before he went to the cape but you must have been a little girl then he didn't tell me that that would have been even more romantic he only said he fell in love with my photograph as paraded by sugarman why where should sugarman get you never know what mother's been up to interrupted kitty dryly much more likely father what's the odds do have another piece of cake no thank you but what did you say to the man the same as you don't stare so you stupid dear i said no thank you that i knew of course you couldn't possibly marry a bloated creature from the cape i meant in what terms did you put him in his place oh really said kitty laughing but without her recent merriment this is too prejudiced i can't admit that mere residence in the cape is a disqualification oh yes it is why do they go there only to make money a person whose one idea in life is money can't be a nice person but money isn't his one idea now his one idea is matrimony that is a joke you ought to laugh it makes me cry to think that some nice girl may be driven into marrying him just for his money poor man so because of his money he is to be prevented from having a nice wife salvina was taken aback by this obverse view how is he ever to improve asked kitty pursuing her advantage yes that's true salvina admitted the best thing would be if some nice girl could fall in love with him but that doesn't make his methods less insulting i wish all these shadchans could be slaughtered off what a savage little chit they often make as good marriages as are made in heaven don't tease you know you think as i do salvina took an affectionate leave of her sister and walked down the soft staircase confused but cheerful the boy in buttons let her out to do so he hurriedly put down the infant of the house who was riding on his shoulders such a touch of humanity in a row of buttons gave salvina a new insight and a suspicion that even the powdered footman who brought the tea might have an emotion behind his gorgeous waistcoat but the crowds fighting for the omnibuses that fine sunday afternoon depressed her again all the seats outside were packed and it was only after standing a long time on the pavement that she squeezed her way into an inside seat the stuffiness and jolting made her feel sick and dizzy by a happy accident her fingers encountered the bottle of smelling salts in her pocket and as she pulled it out eagerly she remembered it had been intended for kitty vii lazarus remained out late that evening and as he had forgotten to borrow the key salvina was sitting up for him she utilized the time in preparing her sewing she was making a night dress with dozens and dozens of tiny tucks at the breast all run by hand and she was putting into the fine calico an artistic needlework absolutely futile and with its perpetual count two miss two infinitely trying to the eyes especially by gas light the insane competition of the teachers refining upon a code in itself stupidly exacting made the needlework the most distressing of all the tasks of the girl teachers of that day salvina herself with her morbid conscientiousness and desire to excel underwent nightmares from the vexatiousness of learning how to cut holes so that they could not possibly be darned and then darning them when at the head centre the lady demonstrator armed with a brobdingnagian whalebone needle threaded with a bright red cord executed herringboned fantasias on a canvas frame resembling a violin stand it all looked easy enough but when salvina herself had to unravel a little piece of stockinette with a real needle and then fill in the hole so as to leave no trace of the crime she was reduced to hysteria even the coloured threads with which she worked were a scant relief to the eye and all this elaborate fancywork was entirely useless at home salvina was always at work darning and mending never was there a defter needle even the hedge tear down was neatly and expeditiously repaired so long as she avoided the scholastic methods what's all this madness her mother had asked once when she had tried the orthodox swiss darning on a real article and mrs brill surveyed in amazement the back of the darn which looked like turkish towelling to night salvina could not long continue her taxing work her eyes ached and she at last resolved to rise early in the morning and proceed with the night dress then she turned the gas low so as to reduce the bill and it was as if she had turned down her own spirits for a strange melancholy now took possession of her in the silent fuscous kitchen in the denuded house and the emptiness of the other rooms seemed to strike a chill upon her senses there were strange creaks and ghostly noises from all parts she fixed her thought on the one furnished bed room now occupied by her mother as on a symbol of life and recuperation but the uncanny noises went on rustlings and patterings and salvina felt that she might shriek and frighten her mother she had almost resolved to turn up the gas when the sound of a harmonium came muffled through the wall and the softened voices of her christian neighbours sang a sunday hymn salvina ceased to be alone and tears bathed her cheeks as the crude melody lilted on she felt absorbed in some great light and love which was somehow both a present possession and a beckoning future that awaited her soul and it was all mysteriously mixed with the blue skies of victoria park in those far off happy days when she had gone home on her father's shoulder and with the blue skies of those enchanted sunlit lands of art and beauty in which she would wander in the glorious future when she should be making a hundred and fifty a year paris venice athens madrid how the mellifluous syllables thrilled her one by one in her annual summer holiday she and her mother might see them all meantime she saw them all in her imagination bathed in the light that never was on sea or land and it was not her mother with whom she journeyed but a noble young bayard handsome and tender hearted who had imperceptibly slipped into her mother's place poor salvina with all her modesty never saw herself as others saw her never lost the dream of a romantic love lazarus's rat tat recalled her to reality i know i'm late he said with apologetic defiance but it's no pleasure to sit in an empty house you may like it but your tastes were always peculiar and that straw mattress on the floor isn't inviting i am so sorry dear but then mother must have the bed well it won't last long thank heaven i made the jonases consent to the marriage before the scandal gets to them so soon said salvina with unconscious social satire yes and we'll have our honeymoon travelling for granders brothers she's a good sort is rhoda she doesn't mind gypsying and that saves us from the expense of completing the furniture he paused and added awkwardly i'd lend it to you only that might give us away but we don't need the furniture dear and don't you think they ought to know it is the rest of the world that it doesn't concern they are bound to know after the marriage we've kept it dark so far thanks to being in hackney away from our old acquaintances and to mother's stinginess in not having encouraged new people to drop in i've told the jonases father was ill and might have to go away for his health that'll pave the way to his absence from the wedding it sounds quite grand we'll send him to a german spa salvina did not share her brother's respect for old jonas who bored her with trite quotations from english literature or the hebrew bible he was in sooth a pompous ignoramus acutely conscious of being an intellectual light in an ignorant society a green shade he wore over his left eye added to his air of dignified distinction foreign jews in especial were his scorn and he seriously imagined that his own stereotyped phrases uttered with a good english pronunciation gave his conversation an immeasurable superiority over the most original thinking tainted by a german or yiddish accent salvina's timid corrections of his english quotations made him angry and imperilled lazarus's wooing the young man was indeed the only member of the family who cultivated relations with the jonases though now it would be necessary to exchange perfunctory visits lazarus presided over these visits in fear and trembling glossing over any slips as to the father who was gone to the seaside for his health on second thoughts lazarus had not ventured on a german spa viii ere the wedding day arrived salvina had to go to the seaside clacton on sea was the somewhat plebeian place and the school fete the occasion salvina looked forward to it without much personal pleasure because of the responsibilities involved but it was a break in the pupil teacher's monotonous round of teaching at the school and being taught at the centres and in the actual expedition the children's joy was contagious and made salvina shed secret tears of sympathy arrived at the beach of the stony treeless popular watering place most of the happy little girls were instantly paddling in the surf with yells of delight while the tamer sort dug sand pits and erected castles salvina whose office on this occasion was to assist an assistant teacher had to keep her eye on a particular contingent she sat down on the noisy sunlit sands with her back to the sea wall so as to sweep the field of vision her nervous conscientiousness made her count her sheep at frequent intervals and be worried over missing now this one now that one how her heart beat furiously and then almost stopped when she saw a child wading out too far no decidedly it was a trying form of pleasure for the teacher one bright little girl who had never beheld the sea before picked up a wonderfully smooth white pebble and bringing it to salvina asked if it was worth any money salvina held it up extemporizing an object lesson for the benefit of the little bystanders no she said this is not worth any money because you can get plenty of them without trouble and even beautiful things are not considered valuable if anybody can have them this stone was polished without charge by the action of the waves washing against it for millions and millions of years and if it the sudden blare of a brass band on the other side of the sea wall made her turn her head and there in a brand new room of a brand new house on the glaring promenade a room radiating blatant prosperity from its stony balcony she perceived her father in holiday attire and by his side a woman buxom and yellow haired a hot wave of blood seemed to flood salvina up to the eyes so there he was luxuriating in the sun rich and careless all her homely instincts of work and duty rose in burning contempt and poor mrs brill had to remain cooped at home drudging and wailing for a second she felt she would like to throw the stone at him but her next feeling was pain lest the sight of her should painfully embarrass him and turning her face swiftly seawards she went on with scarce a pause perceptible to the little girls if it gets worn away some more millions of years it will be ground down to sand like all the other stones that were once here and as she spoke she began to realize her own words and a tragic sense of her own insignificance in this eternal wash of space and time seemed to reduce her to a grain of sand and blow her about the great spaces but the mood passed away before a fresh upwelling of concrete resentment against the self pampered pair at the promenade window nevertheless her feeling of how their seeming satisfaction would be upset at the sight of her made her carefully minimize the contingency and the dread of it hovered over the day adding to the worries over the children but she vowed that her mother should be revenged she too poor wronged one should wallow in promenade luxury in her future holidays no more should she be housed in back streets without sea views at night after mrs brill was in bed salvina could not resist saying to lazarus whose supper she had been keeping hot for him how strange father is at the seaside the dickens he paused fork in hand you saw him at clacton on sea yes but don't tell mother so we didn't tell a lie after all i'm so glad oh go to blazes you and your conscience where was he staying in a house in the very centre of the promenade it's simply shocking make me some fresh mustard and don't moralize did you have a good time not very a little cripple girl in my class went paddling and joking and dropped her crutch and it floated away bother your little cripple girls they always seem to be in your class because my class is on the ground floor ha ha ha just your luck by the way he became grave look what a beastly letter from kitty not coming to the wedding i call it awfully selfish of her kitty wrote her deep regrets but her people had suddenly determined to go abroad and she could not lose this chance of seeing the world the governess's honeymoon she christened it paris switzerland rome all the magic places were to be hers and salvina reading the letter gasped with sympathy and longing but the happy traveller was represented at the wedding by a large bronze looking knight on horseback which towered in shining green over the insignificant gifts of the jonas's circle the utilitarian salad bowls and fish slices and dessert sets one other present stood out luridly but only to salvina it was a glossy arm chair and on the seat lay a card from rhoda's loving father in law when salvina first saw this at a family card party the sunday evening before the wedding she started and flushed so furiously that lazarus had to give her a warning nudge and to whisper only for appearance at the supper table old jonas who carved and jested with much appreciation of his own skill in both departments referred facetiously to the absent father who might nevertheless be said to be in the chair on that occasion salvina dressed her mother as carefully for the ceremony as though kitty's fears were being realized and mrs brill was the bride of the occasion and so debonair a figure emerged from the ordeal that you could recognize kitty's mother instead of salvina's lazarus had spent his farewell evening of bachelorhood at an hotel justly complaining that a mirrorless bed room with a straw mattress was no place for a bridegroom to issue from never had bridegroom been so ill treated he grumbled and he shook his fist imaginatively at the father who had despoiled him but he joined his mother and sister in the cab and as it approached the synagogue he said suddenly don't be shocked but i rather expect father will be at the shool synagogue what and mrs brill appeared like to faint he wouldn't have the cheek salvina said reassuringly as she pulled out the smelling salts which kitty had not needed he wouldn't have the cheek not to come said lazarus i asked him you they glared at him in horror yes i wasn't going to have things look funny i hate explanations the jonases thought there was something queer the other night when you both bungled the explanation of the rheumatism spite all my coaching but where did you find him said the mother excitedly at clacton on sea salvina bit her lip i sent in my card 'laurence beryl of granders brothers' when he saw me i thought he would have had a fit i told him if he didn't come up to the wedding and play heavy father i'd summons him summons him echoed mrs brill for stealing my old arm chair i remembered ha ha ha it was i that had bought the easy chair for myself when we lived in spitalfields and had only wooden chairs so he did send that easy chair said salvina yes that was rather clever of him and don't you think it's clever of me to save appearances it'll be terrible for mother said salvina hotly didn't you think of that she won't have to talk to him he'll only hang round nobody will notice it would have been better to tell the truth cried salvina or even a lie this is only acting a lie and it must be as painful for him as for us serve him right the old furniture sneak it was a mistake salvina persisted hush hush salvina said mrs brill don't disturb your brother's festival he has disturbed it himself said salvina bursting into tears i wish mother we had not come here here this is a pretty wedding said lazarus hush salvina hush said mrs brill what does it matter to us if a dog creeps into synagogue at this point the cab stopped we're not there cried mrs brill no lazarus explained but we pick up father here we must appear to arrive together ere the horrified pair could protest he opened the door sprang out and pushed inside a stout rubicund man with a festal rose in his holiday coat but a miserable shamefaced look in his eyes lazarus took his seat ere a word could be spoken the cab rolled on good morning esther he muttered i offered you get silence cried salvina as if she had been talking to the little girls how dare you speak to her she held her mother's hand and felt the pulse beating madly you old serpent began mrs brill hotly mother pleaded salvina not a word he doesn't deserve it in jerusalem i could have two wives he muttered but no one replied the four human beings sat in painful silence their knees touching the culprit shot uneasy surreptitious glances at his wife so radiant in jewels and finery and with so kitty like a complexion it was as if he saw her freshly or as if he were shocked even startled by her retaining so much joy of life despite his desertion of her fortunately the strange drive only lasted a few minutes the bridegroom's wedding party passed into the synagogue through an avenue of sympathetic observers mr brill had no part to play in the ceremony the honours were carried off by mr jonas who stalked in slowly with the bride on his arm and a new green shade over his left eye the rival father hovered meekly on the outskirts of the marriage canopy amid a crowd of jonases salvina stationed herself and her mother on the opposite border of the canopy and throughout bristled apprehensive prohibitive fiery like a spaniel guarding its mistress against a bull dog on the pounce the bull dog indeed was docile enough avoiding the spaniel's eye and trailing a spiritless tail but the creature revived at the great wedding feast in the hall of a hundred covers and under the congratulations and the convivial influences tended to forget he was in disgrace the bridegroom's parents were placed together but salvina changed seats with her mother and became a buffer between the twain a non conducting medium through which the father could not communicate with the mother with the latter she herself maintained a continuous conversation and mr brill soon found it more pleasant to forget his troubles in the charms of mrs jonas his other neighbour after the almond pudding a succession of speakers ranging from relatives to old friends and even the officiating minister gave certificates of character to the bride and the bridegroom amid the tears of the ladies father jonas made an elaborate speech beginning unaccustomed as i am to public speaking and interlarded with hebrew quotations father brill expressed the pleasure it gave him to acknowledge on behalf of himself and his dear wife the kind things which had been said and the delight they felt in seeing their son settled in the paths of domestic happiness especially in connection with a scion of the house of jonas of whose virtues much had been said so deservedly that night lazarus declared amid roars of laughter that on this occasion only he would respond for his dear wife but he felt sure that for the rest of their lives she would have the last word then the tables were cleared away and dancing began which grew livelier as the dawn grew nearer but long before that salvina had borne her mother away from the hovering bull dog not however without a terrible scene in the homeward cab all the volcanic flames salvina and etiquette had suppressed during the day shot forth luridly burning lava was hurled against her husband against her son against salvina an impassioned inventory of the lost furniture followed and the refrain of the whole was that she had been taken to a wedding when all she wanted was a funeral ix salvina did not count this break down against her mother it was the natural revolt of nerves tried beyond endurance by lazarus's trick the whole episode intensified her sense of the romantic situation of her mother and of the noble courage and dignity with which she confronted it she wondered whether she herself would have emerged so stanchly from the ordeal of meeting a loved but faithless one and her protective pity was tempered by a new admiration her admiration increased when as the secret gradually leaked out her mother maintained an attitude of defiance against the world's sympathy refused to hear stigmatizations of her husband even from old jonas reserving the privilege of denunciation for her own mouth and salvina's ear and now began the new life of mother and daughter with kitty on the continent lazarus married and the father blotted out they had only each other they moved back to the skirts of the ghetto and mrs brill resumed with secret joy her old place among her old cronies inwardly she had fretted at the loss of them for which the dignity of hackney had been but a shadowy compensation but to salvina she only expressed her outraged pride the humiliation of it all and the poor girl unconscious of how happy her mother really was among the ghetto gossips tortured her brain during school hours with the thought of her mother's lonely misery and even if salvina had not been compelled to give private lessons in the evenings to supplement their income she would in any case have relinquished her bachelorhood aspirations in order to give her time to her mother for mrs brill had no resources within herself so far as salvina knew even the great artificial universe of books and newspapers was closed to her salvina resolved to overcome her obstinate reluctance to learn to read as soon as the pressure of the other private lessons relaxed meantime she lived for her mother and her mother on her oh the bitterness of those private lessons after the fag of the day the toiling to distant places on tired feet the grinding bargains imposed by the well to do one of these fiends was a beautiful lady haughty with fair complexion and frosted hair and somehow suggested to salvina a steel engraving she arranged graciously that salvina should teach her little girl conversational german at half a crown an hour but when salvina started on the first lesson in the luxurious sanctum she found two sweetly dressed sisters who she was informed could not bear to be separated and might therefore be considered one the steel engraving herself sat there as if to superintend occasionally asking for the elucidation of a point at the second lesson there were two other little girls neighbours the lady informed her who had thought it would be a good opportunity for them to learn too salvina expressed her pleasure and her gratitude to her patroness at the third lesson the aunt of the two little girls was also present with a suspicious air of discipleship when at end of the month salvina presented her bill at five shillings an hour the patroness flew into a towering rage what did it matter to her how many children partook of the hour an hour was an hour and a bargain a bargain salvina had not the courage or the capital to resist and this life of ever teaching and never learning went on week after week year after year for when her salary at the school increased the additional burden of lazarus and his wife and children fell upon her for her feckless brother had soon exhausted the patience of granders brothers he had passed shiftlessly from employment to employment frequently dependent on salvina and his father in law till old jonas had declared with all the dignity of his green shade that his son in law graceless offspring of a graceless sire must never darken his door step again but the joy mrs brill found in her grandchildren the filling out of her life repaid salvina amply for all the pinching necessary to subsidize her brother's household she winced though to see her mother drop thoughtlessly into the glossy arm chair presented by her absentee husband and therein ensconced dandle lazarus's children salvina was too sensitive to remind her mother and shrank also from appearing fantastic but that chair inspired a morbid repugnance and one day taking advantage of the fact that the stuffing began to extrude she bought lazarus a new and better easy chair without saying why and had the satisfaction of noting the relegation of the old one to a bed room two bright spots of colour dappled those long monotonous years one was kitty the other was the summer holiday kitty's mere letters from the continent she wrote twice during the tour were a source of exhilaration as well as of instruction she brought nearer all those wonderful places which salvina still promised herself to behold one day though year after year she went steadily to ramsgate for her mother shrank from sea voyages and strange places as much as she loved the familiar beach swarming with jewish faces and nigger minstrels even salvina's little scheme of enthroning her mother expensively on the parade at clacton on sea that mother unconsciously thwarted though she endured equivalent splendour at ramsgate at three guineas a week with much grumbling over her daughter's extravagance once indeed when salvina had seriously projected paris in the interest of her french there had been a quarrel on the subject there were many quarrels on many subjects but it was always one quarrel and had always the same groundwork of dialogue on mrs brill's part whatever the temporal variations a nice daughter to trample under foot her own flesh and blood because she thinks i'm dependent on her well well do your own marketing you little ignoramus who don't know a skirt steak from a loin chop you'll soon see if i don't earn my keep i earned my living before you were born and i can do so still i'd rather live in one room than have my blood shed a day longer i'll send for kitty she never stamps on the little mother she shan't slave her heart out any more among strangers my poor fatherless kitty no we'll live together kitty and i lazarus would jump at us my own dear handsome lazarus i never see him but he tells me how the children are crying day and night for their granny and why don't i go and live with him he wouldn't spit upon the mother who suckled him and even rhoda has more respect for me than my own real daughter such was the basal theme the particular variation when the holiday was concerned took the shape of religious remonstrance and where am i to get kosher food in paris in ramsgate i enjoy myself there's a kosher butcher and all the people i know it's as good as london tears always conquered salvina she had an infinite patience with her mother on these occasions not resenting the basal theme but regarding it as a mere mechanic explosion of nervous irritation generated by her lonely life sometimes she forgot this and argued but was always the more sorry afterward not that she did not enjoy ramsgate her nature that craved for so much and was content with so little found even ramsgate a paradise after a year of the slum school to which she always returned looking almost healthy but this constant absorption in her mother's personality narrowed her almost to the same mental bookless horizon all the red blood of ambition was sucked away as by a vampire her energy was sapped and the unchanging rut of school existence combined to fray away her individuality she never went into any society the rare invitation to a social event was always refused with heart shrinking every year made her more shy and ungainly more bent in on herself and on the little round of school and home life which left her indeed too weary in brain and body for aught beside she sank into the scholastic old maid unconsciously taking on the very gait and accent of miss rolver into the limitations of whose life she had once had a flash of insight yet she was unaware of her decay her automatic brain was still alive in one corner where the dreams hived and nested paris and rome and the wonder places still shone on the horizon together with the noble young bayard handsome and tender hearted and twice or thrice a year kitty would flash upon the scene to remind her that there was truly a world of elegance and adventure her mother had begun to worry over the beautiful kitty's failure to marry she had imagined that in those gilded regions she would have snapped up a south african millionaire or other ingenuous person how nearly kitty had actually come to doing so even without the spring board of bedford square salvina never told her she had kept both sugarman and moss m rosenstein from pestering her mother by telling the shadchan that kitty's voice and kitty's alone weighed with kitty in such a matter when the swarthy capitalist returned to the cape despairing salvina had written to congratulate her sister on her high mindedness in the years that followed she had to endure many a bad quarter of an hour of maternal reproach because kitty did not marry but mrs brill's vengeance was unconscious kitty herself never heard a word of these complaints to her the mother was all wreathed smiles for she never came without bringing a trinket and every one of these trinkets meant days of happiness the little lockets and brooches were shown about to all the neighbours and hitched them on to the bright spheres which kitty adorned carriages and footmen soft carpets and gilded mirrors gleamed in the air my kitty rolled under mrs brill's tongue like a honeyed sweet kitty's little gifts flashing splendidly on the everyday dulness made more impression than all the steady monotonous services of salvina for the rest salvina conscientiously repaid these gifts in kind on kitty's birthdays and other high days x when salvina was twenty three years old a change came lazarus ceased to demand assistance he was cheery and self confident and inclined to chaff salvina on her prim ways he removed to a larger house and her easy chair disappeared before a more elegant and the apparent brightness of her brother's prospects brightened salvina's her savings increased and under the continuous profit of his self support she was soon able to meditate changes on her own account either she would give up her night teaching which had been more and more undermining her system or she would procure her mother and kitty a delightful surprise by migrating back to hackney her mind hesitated between the joyous alternatives lingering voluptuously now on one now on the other but somehow aware that it would ultimately choose the latter for kitty on her rare visits never failed to grumble at the lowness of the neighbourhood and the expense of cabs and mrs brill still yearned to see horses pawing outside her door step but an unexpected visit from kitty not six weeks after her last and equally unexpected in place for it was at salvina's school decided the matter suddenly it was about half past twelve and salvina long since a full assistant teacher was seated at her desk correcting the german exercises of a private pupil sparsely dotted about the symmetric benches were a few demure criminals undergoing the punishment of being kept in and the air was still heavy with the breaths and odours of the blissful departed a severe museum case with neatly ticketed specimens backed salvina's chair and around the spacious room hung coloured diagrams of animals and plants kitty seemed a specimen from another world as her coquettish leghorn hat flowering with poppies burst upon the scholastic scene oh dear i thought you'd be alone she said pettishly is it anything important the children don't matter said salvina you can tell me in german i do hope nothing is the matter no nothing so alarming as that kitty replied in german but i thought i'd find you alone and have a chat i had to stay here with the children they must be punished seems more like punishing yourself but have you lunched then no salvina flushed slightly no what's up a jewish fast ninth day of ab fall of temple and funny things like that one always seems to stumble upon them in the east end how you do rattle on kitty and salvina smiled no i shall lunch as soon as these children are released but why wait for that salvina's blush deepened well one doesn't want to eat a good dinner before hungry girls a good dinner why what in heaven's name do you get truffles and plovers' eggs no but i get a very good meal sent in from the cooking centre opposite and compared with what these girls get at home steak and potatoes are the luxuries of lucullus oh i don't believe it they all look fatter than you then this is double punishment for you extra work and hunger do send them away they get on my nerves and have your lunch like a sensible being and without waiting for salvina's assent go along girls she said airily the girls hesitated and looked at salvina who coloured afresh but said yes this lady pleads for you and i said that if you all promised to oh yes teacher they interrupted enthusiastically and were off well what i came to tell you sally is that i'm not sure of my place much longer salvina turned pale and that much tried heart of hers thumped like a hammer she waited in silence for the facts lily is going to be married well all the more reason for mabel to have a companion kitty shook her head it's the beginning of the end marriage is a contagious complaint in a family first one member is taken off then another but that's not the worst no poor salvina held her breath who do you think is the happy man you'll never guess how should i i don't know their circle yes you do i mean you know him salvina wrinkled her forehead vainly no you'll never guess after all these years moss m rosenstein is it possible salvina gasped lily samuelson yes lily samuelson but he must be an old man by now well she isn't a chicken and you thought it was such an outrage of him to ask for me i suppose having once got inside the door to see me he had the idea of aspiring higher oh don't say higher kitty richer that's all and now i should say lower inasmuch as lily samuelson stoops to pick up what you passed by with scorn and picks him up out of sugarman's hand probably yes it's all very well and it's revenge enough in a way to think to myself what i do think to myself when i see the young couple going on and moss is mortally scared of me as i shoot him a glare now and again i shouldn't be surprised if he eggs them on to get rid of me it would be too bad to be done out of everything well we must hope for the best said salvina kissing her after all you can always get another place i'm getting old kitty said glumly you old and the anaemic little school mistress looked with laughing admiration at her sister's untarnished radiance but when kitty went and lunch came salvina could not eat it xi it was clear however that of the alternatives giving up the night work or returning to hackney the latter was the one favoured by providence kitty might at any moment return to the parental roof and there must be something that kitty would consider a roof to shelter her on saturday salvina went house hunting alone in hackney and there as if further pointed out by providence stood their old house to let it had a dilapidated air as if it had stood empty for many moons and had lost hope it seemed to her symbolic of her mother's fortunes and her imagination leapt at the idea of recuperating both very soon she had re rented the house though from another landlord and the workmen were in possession making everything bright and beautiful salvina chose wall papers of the exact pattern of aforetime and ordered the painting and decorations to repeat the old effects they were to move in a few days before the quarter her happy secret shone in her cheeks and she felt all bright and refreshed as if she too were being painted and cleaned and redecorated the task of keeping it all from her mother was a great daily strain and the secret had to overbrim for the edification of lazarus lazarus hailed the change with expressions of unselfish joy that brought tears into salvina's eyes he even went with her to see how the repairs were getting on chatted with the workmen disapproved of the landlord's stinginess in not putting down new drain pipes and made a special call upon that gentleman one day on her return from school salvina found a postcard to the effect that the house was ready for occupation salvina was for once glad that she had never yet found time to persuade her mother to learn to read she went to feast her eyes on the new old house and came home with the key which she hid carefully till the sunday afternoon when she induced her mother to make an excursion to victoria park the weather was dull and the old woman needed a deal of coaxing especially as the coaxing must be so subtle as not to arouse suspicion on the way back in the evening from the park which as there was an unexpected band playing popular airs her mother enjoyed salvina led her by the old familiar highways and byways back to the old home keeping her engrossed in conversation lest it should suddenly befall her to ask why they were going that way the expedient was even more successful than she had bargained for mrs brill's sub consciousness calmly accepting all the old unchanged streets and sights and sounds while her central consciousness was absorbed by the talk her legs trod automatically the dingy hackney terrace to which she had so often returned from her park outing her hand pushed open mechanically the old garden gate and as salvina breathlessly wondering if the spell could be kept up till the very last opened the door with the latch key her mother sank wearily and with a sigh of satisfaction upon the accustomed hall chair in that instant of maternal apathy the astonishment was wholly salvina's that hall chair on which her mother sat was the very one which had stood there in the bygone happy years the hat rack was the one with which her father had eloped on it stood the little flower pots and on the wall hung the two engravings of the trials of lord william russell and earl stafford exactly in the same place and facing her stood the open parlour with all the old furniture and colour in that uncanny instant salvina wondered if she had passed through years of hallucination there was her mother natural and unconcerned bonneted and jewelled exactly as she had come from camberwell years ago when they had entered the house together perhaps they were still at that moment she knew from her studies as well as from experience that you can dream years of harassing and multiplex experience in a single second perhaps there had been no waking hallucination perhaps the long waiting for her mother to appear with the house key had made her sleepy and in that instant of doze she had dreamed all those horrible things the empty house her father's flight his reappearance at her brother's marriage the long years of evening lessons perhaps she was still seventeen studying the greek verbs for the bachelorhood of arts perhaps her mother was still a happy wife her eyes filled with tears and she let herself dwell upon the wondrous possibility a second or so longer than she believed in it for the smell of new paint was too potent it routed the persuasions of the old furniture and in another instant it had penetrated through mrs brill's fatigue she started up aware of something subtly wrong ere clearer consciousness dawned michael she shrieked groping hush hush mother said salvina with a pain as of swords at her heart she felt her mother had stumbled with whatever significance upon the word of the enigma another trick has been played on us a trick mrs brill groped further but you brought me how comes this house here what has happened i wanted to surprise you i have rented the old house and some one else has put in the old furniture michael is coming back you and your father have plotted oh mother how can you accuse me of such a thing all the expected joy of the surprise had been changed to anguish she felt both for her and for her mother oh what a fatal mistake i won't have the furniture we'll pitch it into the street we are going to live here together mammy you and i in the old home we can afford it now she laid her cheek to her mother's but mrs brill broke away petulantly and ran toward the parlour and does he think i'll have anything to do with him after all these years she cried dear mother he doesn't know you if he thinks that said salvina following her no indeed and a chip out of my best vase just as i thought and that isn't my chair he's shoved me in one of a worse set the horsehair may seem the same but look at the legs no carving at all and where's the extra leaf of the table gone too i daresay and my little gilt shovel that used to stand in the fender here what's become of that and do you call this a sofa with the castors all off oh my god she has ruined all my furniture and she burst into hysteric tears salvina could do nothing till the torrent had spent itself but she was busy thinking she saw that again her brother and her father had conspired together hence lazarus's officiousness toward the landlord and the workmen that he might easily get the entry to the house but perhaps the conspiracy had not the significance her mother put upon it perhaps lazarus was principal not agent in the flush of his new prosperity he had really projected a generous act perhaps he had resolved to put the coping stone on the surprise salvina was preparing for her mother and had hence negotiated with the father for the old things if so she felt she had not the right to make her mother refuse them the rather she must hasten at once to lazarus to pour out her appreciation of his thoughtfulness come along mother she said at last don't sit there crying i think lazarus must have bought back the things for you you see mammy i wanted to give you a little surprise and dear lazarus has given me a little surprise do you really think it's only lazarus asked mrs brill and to salvina's anxious ear there seemed a shade of disappointment in the tone i'm sure it is father couldn't possibly have the impudence after all these years too but when she at last got her mother to lazarus that gentleman confessed aggressively that he had been only the agent i don't see why you shouldn't let the poor old man come back he said the other person died a year ago only nobody liked to tell mother she was so bristly and snappy ah interrupted mrs brill exultantly then heaven has heard my curses may she burn in the lowest gehenna may her body become one yellow flame like her dyed hair hush said salvina sternly god shall judge the dead oh of course you always take everybody's part against your mother and mrs brill burst into tears again and sank into the new easy chair i do think mother's right said lazarus sullenly why do you stand in her way i salvina was paralyzed yes if it wasn't for you mother do you hear what lazarus is saying that i keep you from father father a pretty father to you he waits till she's dead and then he wants to creep back to us but let him lie on her grave he'll swell to bursting before he crosses my door step there lazarus do you hear yes i hear he said incredulously but does she know what father offers her every comfort every luxury he is rich now rich said mrs brill the old swindler he didn't swindle he's very sorry for the past now and awfully kind and generous salvina had a flash of insight ho so this is why she checked herself and looked round the handsome room and the new easy chair in which her mother sat became suddenly as hateful as the old well suppose it is said lazarus defiantly i don't see why we shouldn't share in his luck and where does the luck come from salvina demanded what's that to do with us from the stock exchange i believe and where did he get the money to gamble with oh they always had money salvina's eyes blazed the nerveless creature of the school became a fury and you'd touch that hang it all he owes us reparation you too salvina he is anxious to do everything for you he says you must chuck up school it's simply wearing you away he says he wants to take you abroad to paris oh and so he thinks he'll get round mother by getting round me does he but let him take his furniture away at once or we'll pitch it into the street at once do you hear he won't mind lazarus smiled irritatingly he wants to put better furniture in and his real desire is to move to a big house in highbury new park but i persuaded him to put back the old furniture i thought it would touch you a token you know that he wanted 'auld lang syne' yes yes i understood said salvina and then she thought suddenly of kitty and a burst of hysteric laughter caught her elopements economically conducted went through her mind by the day or hour and she imagined the new phrases kitty would coin the prodigal father and the pantechnicon the old love and the old furniture and the wild laughter rang on till lazarus was quite disconcerted i don't see where the fun comes in he said wrathfully father is very sorry indeed he is he quite cried to me on that very chair where mother is sitting i swear to you he did and you have the heart to laugh would you have me cry too no no i am glad he is punished yes a nice miserable lonely old age he has before him he has plenty of money you're a cold unfeeling minx i don't envy the man who marries you salvina salvina flushed i don't either if he were to treat me as mother has been treated yes no one has had a life like mine since the world began moaned mrs brill and her waning tears returned in full flood my poor mammy and salvina put a handkerchief to the flooded cheeks come home we have had enough of this mrs brill rose obediently oh yes take her home said lazarus savagely take her to your shabby stinking lodging when she might have a house in highbury new park and three servants she has a house at hackney and i'll give her a servant too come mother salvina mopped up her mother's remaining tears and with an inspiration of arrogant independence she rang for lazarus's servant and bade her hail a hansom cab if you don't want all hackney to come and gaze at a furnished road she said in parting you'll take away that furniture yourself mrs brill bowled homeward half consoled for everything by this charioted magnificence some neighbours stood by gossiping as she alighted and then her unspoken satisfaction was complete xii they moved into the new old house after salvina had carefully ascertained that the furniture had returned to the cloud under which it had so long lived in her resentment against its reappearance she spent more than she could afford on the rival furniture that succeeded it and which she now studied to make unlike it so that quite without any touch of conscious taste it became light elegant and even artistic in comparison with the old horsehair massiveness then began a very bad year for salvina even though the damocles sword of kitty's dismissal never fell and lily's migration to the cape with moss m rosenstein left kitty still in power as companion to mabel to judge at least by kitty's not seeking the parental roof even as visitor mrs brill's happiness did not keep pace with the restored grandeurs and salvina's own spurt of hope died down she grew wanner than ever going listlessly to her work and returning limp and fagged out you mew me up here with not a soul to speak to from morning till night her mother burst forth one day salvina was not sorry to have her mother's silent lachrymosity thus interpreted but she regretted that her helpless parent had not expressed her satisfaction with gossip when the ghetto provided it instead of yearning for higher scenes she tried again to persuade mrs brill to learn to read by way of mental resource and mrs brill indeed made some spasmodic efforts to master the alphabet and the vagaries of pronunciation from an infant's primer but her brain was too set and she forgot from word to word and made bold bad guesses so that even when a fat cat sat on a mat she was capable of making a fat cow eat in a mug she struggled loyally though except when salvina's attention relaxed for an instant and then she would proceed by leaps and bounds like a cheating child with the teacher's eye off it getting over five lines in the time she usually took to spell out one and paradoxically pleased with herself at her rapid progress salvina was in despair there is no creche for mothers or she might have sent mrs brill to one she bethought herself of at last laying on a servant as providing the desired combination of grandeur and gossip to pay for the servant she undertook two hours of extra night teaching but the maid of all work proved only an exhaustless ground for grumbling mrs brill had never owned a servant and the girl's deviation from angelhood of character and unerring perfection of action in every domestic department were a constant disappointment and grief to the new mistress a nice thing you have done for me she wept to salvina having carefully ascertained the servant was out of ear shot to seat a mistress on my head and for that i must pay her into the bargain aren't you glad you haven't got three servants said salvina with a touch of irresistible irony don't throw up to me that you're saving me from falling on your father i can be my own bread winner i don't want your doll's house furniture that one is scared to touch like walking among eggshells i'd rather live in one room and scrub floors than be beholden to anybody then i should be my own mistress and not under a daughter's thumb if only kitty would marry then i could go to her why doesn't she marry it isn't as if she were like you is there a prettier girl in the whole congregation it's because she's got no money my poor hardworking little kitty her father would give her a dowry if he were a man not a pig mother salvina was white and trembling how can you dream of that not for myself i'd see him rot before i'd take a farthing of his money but i'm not domineering and spiteful like you i don't stand in the way of other people benefiting the money will only go to some other vermin kitty may as well have some lazarus has some that's enough and more than enough lazarus deserves it he is a better son to me than you are a daughter and the tears fell again salvina cast about for what to do her mother's nerves were no doubt entirely disorganized by her sufferings and by the shock of lazarus's trick some radical medicine must be applied but every day duty took salvina to school and harassed her there and drove her to private lessons afterward and left her neither the energy nor the brain for further innovations and whenever she met lazarus by accident for she was too outraged to visit a house practically kept up by dishonourable money apart from her objection to its perpetually festive atmosphere of solo whist supper parties he would sneer at her high and mighty airs in casting out the furniture oh we're very grand now we keep a servant we have cut our father off with a shilling she wished her mother would not go to see lazarus but she felt she had not the right to interfere with these visits though mrs brill returned from them fretful and restive evidently lazarus must be still insinuating reconciliation lazarus worries you mother i feel sure she ventured to say once oh no he is a good son he wants me to live with him what on her money it isn't her money your father made it on the stock exchange who told you so didn't you hear lazarus say so yourself then a horrible suspicion came to salvina he doesn't set father at you when you go there she cried mrs brill flushed furiously i'd like to see him try it on she murmured salvina stooped to kiss her but he tells you tales of father's riches i suppose who wants his riches if he offered me my own horse and carriage i wouldn't be seen with him after the disgrace he's put upon me i wish mother lazarus had inherited your sense of honour mrs brill was pleased there isn't a woman in the world with more pride your father made a mistake when he began with me xiii a horse and carriage did come one flamboyant afternoon but it was the samuelsons' and brought the long absent kitty and kitty as usual brought a present this time it was a bracelet and mrs brill clasped and unclasped it ecstatically feeling that she had at least one daughter who loved her and did not domineer salvina was at school and mrs brill took kitty all over the house enjoying her approval and accepting all the praise for the lighter and more artistic furniture she told her of the episode of the return of the old furniture and didn't have the decency to put new castors on the sofa she had sprawled on kitty's laughter was as loud and ringing as salvina had anticipated mrs brill coloured under it as though she were found food for laughter what a ridiculous person he is kitty added hastily yes said mrs brill with eager pride and relief he thought he could coax me back like a dog with a bit of sugar it would be too funny to live with him again and kitty's eyes danced do you think so said mrs brill anxiously and under the sunshine of her daughter's approval she confided to her that he had really turned up twice at lazarus's beautifully costumed with diamonds on his fingers and a white flower in his button hole but that she had repulsed him as she would repulse a drunken heathen he had put his arms round her but she had shaken him off as one shakes off a black beetle kitty turned away and stuffed her handkerchief into her mouth she knew there was a tragic side but the comic aspect affected her more then you think i was right mrs brill wound up of course kitty said soothingly what do you want of him but don't tell salvina or she'd eat my head off and then the eager upleaping fountain of her mother's egoistic babblings beginning at last to trickle thinly kitty found a breathing space in which to inform her of the great news that throbbed in her own breast lily samuelson's dead mrs rosenstein you know oh my god ejaculated mrs brill trembling like a leaf nothing upset her more than to find that persons within her ken could actually die yes we had a cable from the cape yesterday hear o israel let me see yes she must have died in child birth she did the house is all in hysterics i couldn't stand it any longer i ordered the carriage and came here my poor kitty that lily was too old to have a baby and now he will marry mabel oh no mother oh yes he will mabel will jump at him you'll see but it isn't legal you can't marry your deceased wife's sister i know you can't in england what foolishness but they'll go to holland to be married don't be so absurd mother absurd mrs brill glared you mark my words they'll be in holland before the year's out like hyam emanuel's eldest brother in law and the red haired sister of samuel the pawnbroker well i don't care if they are said kitty yawning don't care why you'll lose your place they kept you on for mabel but now kitty cut her short don't worry mother i'll be all right he's not married mabel yet this reminder seemed to come to mrs brill like a revelation so fast had her imagination worked she calmed down and kitty took the opportunity to seek to escape tell salvina the news she said she'll be specially interested in it in fact judging by the last time she'll be more excited than i am and she smiled somewhat mysteriously tell her i'm sorry i missed her i was hoping to find her having a holiday but apparently i haven't been lucky enough to strike some jewish fast but partly because mrs brill was enraptured by her beautiful daughter partly to keep the pompous equipage outside her door as long as possible she detained kitty so unconscionably that salvina arrived from school kitty flew to embrace her as usual but arrested herself shocked why sally she cried you look like a ghost what's the matter nothing said salvina with a wan smile just the excitement of seeing you i suppose kitty performed the postponed embrace but remained dubious and shaken was it that her mind was morbidly filled with funereal images or was it that her fresh eye had seen what her mother's custom blinded vision had missed that there was death in salvina's face this face of death in life stirred up unwonted emotions in kitty and made her refrain apprehensively from speaking again of lily's death and some days later when the first bustle of grief had subsided in bedford square kitty still haunted by that grewsome vision wrote salvina a letter my dear old sally you must really draw in your horns you were not looking at all well the other day you are burning the candle at both ends i am sure that horrid board school is killing you i am going to beg a fortnight's holiday for you and i am going to take you to boulogne for a week and then when you are all braced up again we can have the second week at paris my dearest and best of sisters salvina replied how shocking the news mother has told me of the death of poor lily if she did wrong she was speedily punished but let us hope she really loved him i am sure that your brooding on her sad fate and your sympathy with the family in this terrible affliction has made you fancy all sorts of things about me just as mother is morbidly apprehensive of that horrible creature marrying mabel and thus robbing you of your place but your sweet letter did me more good than if i had really gone to paris how did you know it was the dream of my life but it cannot be realized just yet for it would be impossible for me to be spared from school just now miss green is away with diphtheria and as this is examination time miss rolver has her hands full besides mother would be left alone don't worry about me darling i always feel like this about this time of year but the summer holiday is not many weeks off and ramsgate always sets me up again your loving sister salvina ps mother told me you advised her not to go to lazarus's any more and she isn't going i am so glad dear these visits have worried her as lazarus is so persistent i am only sorry i didn't think of enlisting your influence before it is naturally greater than mine good bye dear pps i find i have actually forgotten to thank you for your generous offer but you know all that is in my heart don't you darling all the same kitty's alarm began to communicate itself to salvina especially after repeated if transient premonitions of fainting in her class room for what would happen if she really fell ill she could get sick leave of course for a time though that would bring her under the eagle eye of the board doctor before which every teacher quailed he might brutally pronounce her unfit for service and how if she did break down permanently or if she died her savings were practically nil her salary ceased with her breath who would support her mother kitty of course would nobly take up the burden but it would be terribly hard on her especially when mabel samuelson should come to marry not that she was going to die of course she was too used to being sickly death was only a shadow hovering far off xiv what was to be done an inspiration came to her in the shape of a pamphlet life assurance ah that was it scottish widows' fund how peculiarly apposite the title if her mother could be guaranteed a couple of thousand pounds death would lose its sting salvina carefully worked out all the arithmetical points involved and discovered to her surprise that life assurance was a form of gambling the company wagered her that she would live to a certain age and she wagered that she would not but after a world of trouble in filling up documents and getting endorsers when she went before the company's doctor she was refused the bet was not good enough heart weak was the ruthless indictment you ought not to teach the doctor even told her privately and amid all her consternation salvina was afraid lest by some mysterious brotherhood he should communicate with the board doctor and rob her of her situation she began praying to god extemporaneously in english that was for her an index of impotence she was at the end of her resources she could see only a blank wall and the wall was a great gravestone on which was chiselled hic jacet salvina brill school board teacher undergraduate of london university unloved and unhappy she wept over the inscription being still romantic poor mother poor kitty what a blow her death would be to them even lazarus would be sorry and in the thought of them she drifted away from the rare mood of self pity and wondered again how she could get together enough money before she died to secure her mother's future but no suggestion came even in answer to prayer once she thought of the stock exchange but it seemed to her vaguely wicked to conjure with stocks and shares she had read articles against it besides what did she understand true she understood as much as her father but who knew whether his money really came from this source she dismissed the stock exchange despairingly and meanwhile mrs brill continued peevish and lachrymose and salvina found it more and more difficult to hide her own melancholy one day as she was leaving the school premises sugarman the shadchan accosted her do make a beginning he said winningly only a sixteenth of a ticket you can't lose sugarman still never thought of her even as a refuge for impecunious bachelors but with that shameless pertinacity which was the secret of his success both as british marriage maker and continental lottery agent he had never ceased cajoling her toward his other net he was now destined to a success which surprised even himself her scrupulous conscientiousness undermined by her analysis of the assurance system salvina inquired eagerly as to the prizes and bought three whole tickets at a quarter of the price of one assurance instalment sugarman made a careful note of the numbers and so did salvina but it was unnecessary in her case they were printed on her brain graven on her heart repeated in her prayers they hovered luminous across her day dreams and if they distracted feverishly her dreams of the night yet they tinged the school routine pleasantly and made her mother's fretfulness endurable they actually improved her health and as the may sunshine warmed the earth salvina felt herself bourgeoning afresh and she told herself her fears were morbid nevertheless there was one thing she was resolved to complete in case she were truly doomed and that was her mother's education in reading so often begun so often foiled by her mother's pertinacious subsidence into contented ignorance of what use even to assure mrs brill's physical future if her mind were to be left a pauper dependent on others how without the magic resource of books could she get through the long years of age when decrepitude might confine her to the chimney corner already her talk groaned with aches and pains since the servant had been installed the reading lessons had dropped off and finally been discontinued now that salvina persisted in continuing she found that her mother's brain had retained nothing mrs brill had to begin again at the alphabet and all the old routine of audacious guessing recommenced again a fat cow ate in a mug for though mrs brill had no head at all for corrections she had a wonderful memory for her own mistakes and took the whole sentence at a confident jump it was an old friend one evening in the kitchen to which mrs brill always gravitated when the servant was away she paused between her misreadings to dilate on the inconsiderateness of the servant in having this day out though she was paid for the full week and though the mistress had to stick at home and do all the work as salvina seemed to be spiritless this evening and allowed the domestic to go undefended this topic was worn out more quickly than usual but the never failing subject of mrs brill's aches and pains provided more pretexts for dodging the hard words and meantime in a chair beside hers poor salvina silent as to her own aches and pains and the faintness which was coming over her strained her attention to follow in correction on the heels of her mother's reading but do what she would she could not keep her eyes continuously on the little primer and whenever mrs brill became aware that salvina's attention had relaxed she scampered along at a breakneck speed taking trisyllables as unhesitatingly as a hunter a three barred gate but every now and again salvina would struggle back into concentration and mrs brill would tumble at the first ditch at last mrs brill to her content found herself cantering along unimpeded for a great stretch salvina lay back in her chair dead the broken dancer only merry danger read mrs brill at a joyous gallop suddenly the knocker beat a frantic tattoo on the street door up jumped mrs brill in sheer nervousness salvina lay rigid undisturbed she's fallen asleep thought her mother guiltily conscious of having taken advantage of her slumbers all the same she might spare my aged bones the trouble of dragging upstairs but being already on her feet she mounted the stairs and opened the door on sugarman's beaming breathless face your daughter number he gasped mrs brill who knew nothing of salvina's speculations took some seconds to catch his drift what what she cried trembling i have won her a hundred thousand marks the great prize the great prize screamed mrs brill salvina salvina come up and not waiting for her reply and overturning the flower pots on the hall table she flew downstairs helter skelter salvina she shook her roughly wake up you have won the great prize but salvina did not wake up though she had won the great prize xv one sunday afternoon nearly five months later a nondescript series of vehicles erratically and unpunctually succeeding one another drew up near the mortuary of the jewish cemetery but from the presence of women it was obvious that something else than a funeral was in progress in fact the two four wheelers three hansom cabs several dog carts and one open landau suggested rather a picnic amid the tombs but it was only the ceremony of the setting of salvina's tombstone which was attracting all these relatives and well wishers in the landau which gave ample space for their knees sat the same quartette that had shared a cab to lazarus's wedding except that salvina was replaced by kitty that ever young and beautiful person was the only member of the family who had the air of having fallen in the world for despite that salvina's great prize was now added to mr brill's capital he being the legal heir he had refused to set up a groom in addition to a carriage a coachman he insisted was all that was necessary it was the same tone that he had taken about the horsehair sofa and it helped mrs brill to feel that her husband was unchanged after all arrived on the ground the brills found a gathering of the jonases reconciled by death and riches others were to arrive and the party distributed itself about the cemetery with an air of conscious incompleteness old jonas shook hands cordially with lazarus and wiped away a tear from under his green shade a few of salvina's fellow teachers had obeyed the notification of the advertisement in the jewish papers and were come to pay the last tribute of respect the men wore black hat bands the women crape which on all the nearer relatives already showed signs of wear and among all these groups conversing amiably of this or that in the pleasant october sunshine the genteel stone mason insinuated himself pervading the gathering his breast was divided between anxiety as to whether the parents would like the tombstone and uncertainty as to whether they would pay on the spot have you seen the stone what do you think of it he kept saying to everybody with a deferential assumption of artistic responsibility though as it was a handsome granite stone the bulk of the chiselling had been done in aberdeen for the sake of economy whilst the stone was green and his own contribution had been merely the hebrew lettering one by one under the guidance of the artist the groups wandered toward the tombstone and a spectator or two admiringly opened negotiations for future contingencies an old lady who knew the stonemason's sister in law strove to make a bargain for her own tombstone quite forgetting that the money she was saving on it would not be enjoyed by herself what will you charge me she asked with grotesque coquetry i think you ought to do it cheaper for me and in the house of the priests the minister in charge of the ceremonial impatiently awaited the late comers that he might intone the beautiful immemorial psalms he had made a close bargain with the cabman and was anxious not to set him grumbling over the delay apart from his desire to get back to his pretty wife who was at home that afternoon at last the genteel stone mason found an opportunity of piercing through the throng of friends that surrounded mr brill and of obsequiously inviting the generous orderer of this especially handsome and profitable tombstone to inspect it kitty followed in the wake of her parents almost at the tomb a corpulent man with graying hair issuing suddenly from an avenue of headstones accosted her she frowned you oughtn't to have come she said since i belong to the family kitty he remonstrated playing nervously with his massive watch seals no you don't she retorted then relentingly i told you moss that i could not give you my formal consent till after my sister's tombstone was set that is the least respect i can pay her and she turned away from the somewhat disconcerted rosenstein feeling very right minded and very forgiving toward salvina for delaying by so many years her marriage with the south african magnate meantime mr brill in his heavily draped high hat stood beside the pompous granite memorial surveying it approvingly his wife's hand lay tenderly in his own underneath their feet lay the wormy dust that had once palpitated with truth and honour that had kept the conscience of the household that bit of scroll work said the stone mason admiringly and with an air of having thrown it in at a loss you don't often see a bit like that everybody's been saying so very fine replied mr brill obediently i paid the synagogue bill for you to save you trouble added the stone mason insinuatingly but mr brill was abstractedly studying the stone and the mason moved off delicately mrs brill tried to spell out a few of the words but as there was no one to reprimand her admitted her break down read it to me dear heart she whispered to mr brill i did read it you my precious one he said when kitty sent it us it says 'salvina brill whom god took suddenly on may th aged twenty five loved and lamented by all for her perfect goodness' then come the hebrew letters poor salvina sighed mrs brill she deserves it though she did spoil our lives for years he pressed her hand i can't tell you how frightened i was of her she went on she almost made me think i ought not to forgive you even on the day of atonement but i don't bear her malice and i don't grudge her what the stone says no you mustn't he said piously besides everybody knows one never puts the whole truth on tombstones viii satan mekatrig viii satan mekatrig suffer not the evil imagination to have dominion over us deliver me from the destructive satan morning prayer without the air was hot heavy and oppressive squadrons of dark clouds had rolled up rapidly from the rim of the horizon and threatened each instant to shake heaven and earth with their artillery but within the little synagogue of the congregation of love and mercy though it was crowded to suffocation not a window was open the worshippers arrayed in their sabbath finery were too intent on following the quaint monotonous sing song of the cantor reading the law to have much attention left for physical discomfort they thought of their perspiring brows and their moist undergarments just about as little as they thought of the meaning of the hebrew words the reader was droning though the language was perfectly intelligible to them yet their consciousness was chiefly and agreeably occupied with its musical accentuation their piety being so interwoven with these beloved and familiar material elements as hardly to be separable therefrom perspiration too had come to seem almost an ingredient of piety on great synagogal occasions frequent experience had linked the two as the poor opera goer associates patti with crushes and the present was a great occasion it was only an ordinary sabbath afternoon service but there was a feast of intellectual good things to follow the great rav rotchinsky from brody was to deliver a sermon and so the swarthy eager eyed curly haired shrewd visaged cobblers tailors cigar makers peddlers and beggars who made up the congregation had assembled in their fifties to enjoy the dialectical subtleties the theological witticisms and the talmudical anecdotes which the reputation of the galician maggid foreshadowed and not only did they come themselves many brought their wives who sat in their wigs and earrings behind a curtain which cut them off from the view of the men the general ungainliness of their figures and the unattractiveness of their low browed high cheekboned and heavy jawed faces would have made this pious precaution appear somewhat superfluous to an outsider the women whose section of the large room thus converted into a place of worship was much smaller than the men's were even more closely packed on their narrow benches little wonder therefore that just as a member of the congregation was intoning from the central platform the blessing which closes the reading of the law a woman disturbed her neighbours by fainting she was carried out into the open air though not without a good deal of bustle which invoked indignant remonstrances in the juedisch deutsch jargon of hush little women from the male worshippers unconscious of the cause the beadle went behind the curtain and fearing new disturbances tried to open the window at the back of the little room to let in some air from the back yard on which it abutted the sash was however too inert from a long season of sloth to move even in its own groove and so the beadle elbowed his way back into the masculine department and by much tugging at a cord effected a small slit between a dusty skylight and the ceiling neglecting the grumblings of the men immediately beneath hardly had he done so when all the heavy shadows that lay in the corners of the synagogue all the glooms that the storm clouds cast upon the day and that the grimy cobwebbed windows multiplied were sent flying off by a fierce flash of lightning that bathed in a sea of fire the dingy benches the smeared walls the dingily curtained ark the serried rows of swarthy faces almost on the heels of the lightning came the thunder that vast instantaneous crash which denotes that the electric cloud is low the service was momentarily interrupted the congregation was on its feet and from all parts rose the hebrew blessing blessed art thou o lord performing the work of the creation followed as the thunder followed the lightning by the sonorous blessed art thou o lord whose power and might fill the universe then the congregation led by the great rav rotchinsky to whose venerable thought lined face surmounted by its black cap all eyes had instinctively turned sat down again feeling safe the blessing was intended to mean and meant no more than a reverential acknowledgment of the majesty of the creator revealed in elemental phenomena but human nature struggling amid the terrors and awfulness of the universe is always below its creed and scarce one but felt the prayer a talisman a moment afterward all rose again as moshe grinwitz wrapped in his talith or praying shawl prepared to descend from the al memor or central platform bearing in his arms the scroll of the law which had just been reverentially wrapped in its bandages and devoutly covered with its embroidered mantle and lovingly decorated with its ornamental bells and pointer now as moshe grinwitz stood on the al memor with his sacred burden another terrible flash of lightning and appalling crash of thunder startled the worshippers and moshe's arms were nervously agitated and a frightful thought came into his head suppose he should drop the holy scroll as this dreadful possibility occurred to him he trembled still more the sepher torah is to the jew at once the most precious and the most sacred of possessions and in the eyes of the congregation of love and mercy their sepher torah was if possible invested with a still higher preciousness and sanctity because they had only one they were too poor to afford luxuries and so this single scroll was the very symbol and seal of their brotherhood in it lay the very possibility of their existence as a congregation not that it would be rendered pasul imperfect and invalid by being dropped the fall could not erase any of the letters so carefully written on the parchment but the calamity would be none the less awful and ominous every person present would have to abstain for a day from all food and drink in sign of solemn grief moshe felt that if the idea that had flitted across his brain were to be realized he would never have the courage to look his pious wife in the face after such passive profanity the congregation too which honoured him and which now waited to press devout kisses on the mantle of the scroll on its passage to the ark he could not but be degraded in its eyes by so negligent a performance of a duty which was a coveted privilege all these thoughts which were instinctively felt rather than clearly conceived caused moshe grinwitz to clasp the sacred scroll which reached a little above his head tightly to his breast feeling secure from the peril of dropping it he made a step forward but the bells jangled weirdly to his ears and when he came to the two steps which led down from the platform a horrible foreboding overcame him that he would stumble and fall in the descent he stepped down one of the steps with morbid care but lo the feeling that no power on earth could prevent his falling gained tenfold in intensity an indefinable presentiment of evil was upon him the air was charged with some awful and maleficent influence of which the convulsion of nature seemed a fit harbinger and now his sensations became more horrible the conviction of the impending catastrophe changed into a desire to take an active part in it to have it done with and over his arms itched to loose their hold of the sepher torah oh if he could only dash the thing to the ground nay stamp upon it uttering fearful blasphemies and shake off this dark cloud that seemed to close round and suffocate him a last shred of will of sanity wrestled with his wild wishes the perspiration poured in streams down his forehead it was but a moment since he had taken the holy scroll into his arms but it seemed ages ago his foot hovered between the first and second step when a strange thing happened straight through the narrow slit opened in the skylight came a swift white arrow of flame so dazzling that the awed worshippers closed their eyes then a long succession of terrific peals shook the room as with demoniac laughter and when the congregants came to their senses and opened their eyes they saw moshe grinwitz sitting dazed upon the steps of the al memor his hands tightly grasping the ends of his praying shawl while the sepher torah lay in the dust of the floor for a moment the shock was such that no one could speak or move there was an awful breathless silence broken only by the mad patter of the rain on the roof and the windows the floodgates of heaven were opened at last and through the fatal slit a very cascade of water seemed to descend automatically the beadle rushed to the cord and pulled the window to his action broke the spell and a dozen men their swarthy faces darker with concern rushed to raise up the prostrate scroll while a hubbub of broken ejaculations rose from every side but ere a hand could reach it moshe grinwitz had darted forward and seized the precious object no no he cried in the jargon which was the common language of all present what do you want the mitzvah good deed is mine i alone must carry it he shouldered it anew kiss it at least cried the great rav rotchinsky in a hoarse shocked whisper kiss it cried moshe grinwitz with a sneering laugh what with my wife in synagogue isn't it enough that i embrace it then without giving his hearers time to grasp the profanity of his words he went on ah now i can carry thee easily i can hold thee and yet breathe freely see and he held out the scroll lengthwise showing the gilded metal chain and the pointer and the bells contorted by the lightning i didn't hurt thee god hurt thee he said addressing the scroll with a quick jerk of the hand he drew off the mantle and showed the parchment blackened and disfigured a groan burst from some others looked on in dazed silence the pecuniary loss added to the manifestation of divine wrath overwhelmed them thou hast no soul now to struggle out of my hands went on moshe grinwitz contemptuously look he added suddenly the lightning has gone back to hell again the men nearest him shuddered and gazed down at the point on the floor toward which he was inclining the extremity of the scroll the wood was charred and a small hole revealed the path the electric current had taken as they looked in awestruck silence a loud wailing burst forth from behind the curtain the ill omened news of the destruction of the sepher torah had reached the women and their oriental natures found relief in profuse lamentation smell smell cried moshe grinwitz sniffing the sulphurous air with open delight woe woe wailed the women woe has befallen us be silent all thundered the maggid suddenly recovering himself be silent women listen to my words this is the vengeance of heaven for the wickedness ye have committed in england since ye left your native country ye have forgotten your judaism there are men in this synagogue that have shaved the corners of their beard there are women who have not separated the sabbath dough hear ye to morrow shall be a fast day for you all and you moshe grinwitz bench gomel thank the holy one blessed be he for saving your life not i said moshe grinwitz you talk nonsense if the holy one blessed be he saved my life it was he that threatened it my life was in no danger if he hadn't interfered to hear blasphemies like this from the hitherto respectable and devout moshe grinwitz overwhelmed his hearers but only for a moment from a hundred throats there rose the angry cry epikouros epikouros and mingled with this accusation of graceless scepticism there swelled a gathering tumult of his is the sin cast him out he is the jonah he is the sinner the congregants had all risen long ago and menacing faces glared behind menacing faces some of more heady temperament were starting from their places moshe grinwitz cried the great rav his voice dominating the din are you mad now for the first time am i sane replied the man his brow dark with defiance his tall but usually stooping frame rigid his narrow chest dilated his head thrown back so that the somewhat rusty high hat he wore sloped backward half off his skull it was always a strange arrestive face was moshe grinwitz's with its sallow skin its melancholy dark eyes its aquiline nose its hanging side curls and its full fleshy mouth embowered in a forest of black beard and mustache and now there was an uncanny light about it which made it almost weird now i see that the socialists and atheists are right and that we trouble ourselves and tear out our very gall to read a torah which the overseer himself if there is one scornfully shrivels up and casts beneath our feet know ye what brethren let us all go to the socialist club and smoke our cigarettes otherwise are you mad as he uttered these impious words another flash of flame lit up the crowded dusk with unearthly light the building seemed to rock and crash the fingers of the storm beat heavily upon the windows from the women's compartment came low wails of fear lord have mercy forgive us for our sins it is the end of the world but from the men's benches there arose an incoherent cry like the growl of a tiger and from all sides excited figures precipitated themselves upon the blasphemer but moshe grinwitz laughed a wild maniacal laugh and whirled the sacred scroll round and dashed the first comers against one another but a muscular lithuanian seized the extremity of the scroll and others hung on and between them they wrested it from his grasp still he fought furiously as if endowed with sinews of steel and his irritated opponents their faces bleeding and swollen closed round him forgetting that their object was but to expel him and bent on doing him a mischief another moment and it would have fared ill with the man when a voice whose tones startled all but moshe grinwitz though they were spoken close to his ear hissed in yiddish well if this is the way the members of the congregation of love and mercy spend their sabbath methinks they had done as well to smoke cigarettes at the socialist club what say ye brethren these words pregnant and deserved enough in themselves were underlined by an accent of indescribable mockery not bitter but as gloating over the enjoyment of their folly involuntarily all turned their eyes to the speaker who was he where did he spring from this black coated fur capped red haired hunchback with the gigantic marble brow the cold keen steely eyes that drew and enthralled the gazer the handsome clean shaven lips contorted with a sneer none remembered seeing him enter none had seen him sitting at their side or near them he was not of their congregation nor of their brotherhood nor of any of their crafts yet as they looked at him the exclamations died away on their lips their menacing hands fell to their sides and a wave of vague uneasy remembrance passed over all the men in the synagogue there was not one that did not seem to know him there was not one who could have told who he was or when or where he had seen him before even the great rav rotchinsky who had set foot on english soil but a fortnight ago felt a stir of shadowy recollection within him and his corrugated brow wrinkled itself still more in the search after definiteness a deep and sudden silence possessed the synagogue the very sobs of the unseeing women were checked only the sough of the storm the ceaseless plash of the torrent went on as before without the busy life of london pulsed unchecked by the tempest within the little synagogue was given over to mystery and nameless awe the sneering hunchback took the holy scroll from the nerveless hands of the lithuanian and waved it as in derision blasted harmless he cried the great name itself mocked by the elements so this is what ye toil and sweat for to store up gold that his words may be inscribed finely on choice parchment and then this is how he laughs at your toil and your self sacrifice listen to him no more give not up the seventh day to idleness when your lord worketh his lightnings thereon blind yourselves no longer over old fashioned pages dusty and dreary rise up against him and his law for he is moved with mirth at your mummeries he and his angels laugh at you heaven is merry with your folly what hath he done for his chosen people for their centuries of anguish and martyrdom it is for his plaything that he hath chosen you he hath given you over into the hand of the spoiler ye are a byword among nations the followers of the victorious christ spit in your faces here in england your lot is least hard but even here ye eat your scanty bread with sorrow and travail sleep may rarely visit your eyes your homes are noisome styes your children perish around you ye go down in sorrow to the grave rouse yourselves and be free men waste your lives neither for god nor man or if you will worship worship the christ whose ministers will pour gold upon you eat drink and be merry for to morrow ye die a charmed silence still hung over his auditors their resentment their horror was dead a waft of fiery air seemed to blow over their souls an intoxicating flush of evil thoughts held riot in their hearts they felt their whole spirit move under the sway of the daring speaker who now seemed to them merely to put into words thoughts long suppressed in their own hearts but now rising into active consciousness yes they had been fools they would free themselves and quaff the wine of life before the angel of death azrael spilled the goblet moshe grinwitz's melancholy eyes blazed with sympathetic ardour hush miserable blasphemer faltered the great rav rotchinsky who alone could find his tongue the guardian of israel neither slumbereth nor sleepeth the hunchback wheeled round and cast a chilling glance at the venerable man then smiling the maidens of england are beautiful he said they are even fairer than the women of brody the great rav turned pale but his eyes shone he struck out feebly with his arms as though beating back some tempting vision you and i have spoken together before rabbi said the hunchback we shall speak again about women wine and other things your beard is long and white but many days of sunshine are still before you and the darkness of the grave is afar the rabbi tried to mutter a prayer but his lips only beat tremulously together profane mocker he muttered at length go to thy work and thy wine and thy pleasure if thou wouldst desecrate the sacred sabbath day but tempt not others to sin with thee begone and may the holy one blessed be he blast thee with his lightnings the holy one blasteth only that which is holy grimly rejoined the dwarfish stranger exhibiting the scroll while a low sound of applause went up from the audience said i not ye were a sport and a mockery unto him ye assemble in your multitude for prayer and the vapour of your piety but prepares the air for the passage of his arrows ye adorn his scroll with bells and chains and the gilded metal but draws his lightnings he looked around the room and a cat like gleam of triumph stole into his wonderful eyes as he noted the effect of his words he paused and again for a moment the tense awful silence reigned emphasized by the loud but decreasing patter of the rain this time it was broken in a strange unexpected fashion yisgadal veyiskadash sheme rabbo rang out a clear childish voice from the rear of the synagogue a little orphan child who had come to repeat the kaddish the hebrew mourners' unquestioning acknowledgment of the supreme goodness had fallen into a sleep overcome by the heat and had slept all through the storm awakening now amid a universal silence the poor little fellow instinctively felt that the congregation was waiting for him to pronounce the prayer alone of the male worshippers he had neither seen the blaspheming hunchback nor listened to his words the hunchback's handsome face was distorted with a scowl he stamped his broad splay foot but hearing no verbal interruption the child its eyes piously closed continued its prayer in the world which he hath created the rain has ceased brethren huskily whispered the hunchback for his words seemed to stick in his throat come outside and i will tell you how to enjoy this world for world to come there is none not a figure stirred the child's treble went unfalteringly on the stranger hurried toward the door arrived there he looked back moshe grinwitz alone followed him he hurled the scroll at the child's head but the lad just then took the three backward steps which accompany the conclusion of the prayer the scroll dashed itself against the wall the stranger was gone and with him moshe grinwitz a great wave of trembling passed through the length and breadth of the synagogue the men drew long breaths as if some heavy and sulphurous vapour had been dissipated from the atmosphere the child lifted up with difficulty the battered scroll kissed it and handed it to his neighbour who deposited it reverently in the ark a dazzling burst of sunshine flooded the room from above and transmuted the floating dust into the golden shafts of some celestial structure the cantor and the congregation continued the words of the service at the point interrupted as though all the strange episode had been a dream they did not speak or wonder among themselves at it nor did the rabbi allude to it in the marvellous exhortation that succeeded the service save at its close when he reminded them that on the morrow they must observe a solemn fast but ever afterward they shunned moshe grinwitz as a leper for the sight of him recalled his companion in blasphemy the atheist and socialist propagandist who had insidiously crept into their midst after perverting and crazing their fellow as a preliminary and the thought of the strange hunchback set their blood tingling and their brain surging with wild fancies and audacious thoughts the tidings of their misfortune induced a few benevolent men to join in purchasing a new scroll of the law for them and before the feast of consecration of this precious possession was well over the once vivid images of that stormy and disgraceful scene were as shadows in the minds of men not unaccustomed to heated synagogal discussions and not altogether strangers to synagogal affrays she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life prov xxxi as moshe grinwitz followed his new found friend down the narrow windings that led to his own home his whole being surrendered itself to the new delicious freedom the burst of sunshine that greeted him almost as soon as he crossed the threshold of the synagogue seemed to him to typify the new life that was to be his he drew up his gaunt form to his full height stiffened his curved shoulders bent by much stooping over his machine and adjusted his high hat firmly on his head it was not a restful placid feeling that now possessed him rather a busy ferment of ideas a stirring of nerve currents an accumulation of energy striving to discharge itself a mercurial flowing of the blood the weight of old life long conceptions nay the burden of old learning of which his store had been vast was cast off he did not know what he should do with the new life that tingled in his veins he only felt alive in every pore ha brother he shouted to the hunchback who was hurrying on before these fools in the synagogue would do better to come out and enjoy the fine weather they breathe the musty air to offer it up as a sweet incense responded the dwarf slackening his steps to allow his companion to come up with him their short walk was diversified by quite a number of incidents a driver lashed his horse so savagely that the animal bolted two children walking hand in hand suddenly began to fight a foreign looking richly dressed gentleman half drunk staggered along moshe felt it a shame that one wealthy man should wear a heavy gold chain which would support a poor family for a month but ere his own temptation had gathered to a head the poor gentleman was felled by a sudden blow and a respectably clad figure vanished down an alley with the coveted spoil moshe felt glad and made no attempt to assist the victim and his attention was immediately attracted by some boys who commenced to tie a cracker to a cat's tail occupied by all these observations moshe suddenly noted with a start that they had reached the house in which he lived his companion had already entered the passage for the door was always ajar and moshe had the impression that it was very kind of his new friend to accept his invitation to visit him he felt very pleased and followed him into the passage but no sooner had he done so than an impalpable cloud of distrust seemed to settle upon him the house was a tall old fashioned and grimy structure which had been fine and even stately a century before but which now sheltered a dozen families mainly jewish moshe grinwitz's one room was situated at the very top its walls forming part of the roof every flight of stairs moshe went up his spirit grew darker and darker as if absorbing the darkness that hung around the cobwebbed massive balustrades upon which no direct ray of sunlight ever fell and by the time he had reached the dusky landing outside his own door the vague uneasiness had changed into a horrible definite conception a memory had come back upon him which set his heart thumping guiltily and anxiously in his bosom his wife his pure virtuous god fearing wife how was he to make her understand but immediately a thought came by which the burden of shame and anxiety was half lifted his wife was not at home she would still be in the synagogue of love and mercy where mercifully blinded by the curtain she perhaps was still ignorant of the part he had played he turned suddenly to his companion and caught the vanishing traces of an ugly scowl wrinkling the high white forehead under the fur cap the hunchback's hair burnt like fire on the background of the gloom his eyes flashed lightning probably my wife is in the synagogue said moshe if so she has the key and we can't get in the key matters little hissed the hunchback but you must first tear down this thing moshe's eyes followed in wonder the direction of his companion's long white forefinger and rested on the mezuzah where in a tin case the holy verses and the name hung upon the door post tear it down repeated moshe tear it down replied the hunchback never will i enter a home where this superstitious gew gaw is allowed to decorate the door moshe hesitated the thought of what his wife would say again welled up strongly within him all his new impious daring seemed to be melting away but a mocking glance from the cruel eyes thrilled through him he put his hand on the mezuzah then the unbroken habit of years asserted its sway and he removed the finger which had lain on the name and kissed it instantly another semi transformation of his thoughts took place he longed to take the hunchback by the throat but it was an impotent longing for when a low hiss of intense scorn and wrath was breathed from the clenched lips of his companion he made a violent tug at the firmly fastened mezuzah it was half loosed from the woodwork when from behind the door there issued in clear womanly tones the solemn hebrew words blessed is the man that walketh not in the council of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful it was rebecca grinwitz commencing the book of psalms which she read through every sabbath afternoon a violent shudder agitated moshe grinwitz's frame he paused with his hand on the mezuzah struggled with himself awhile then kissed his finger again and turning to defy the scorn of his companion saw that he had slipped noiselessly downstairs a sob of intense relief burst from moshe's lips rivkoly rivkoly he cried hysterically beating at the door and in another moment he was folded in the quiet haven of his wife's arms who told thee it was i said rebecca after a moment of delicious happiness for both i told them not to alarm thee nor to spoil thy enjoyment of the sermon because i knew thou wouldst be uneasy and be wanting to leave the synagogue if thou knewest i had fainted no one told me thou hadst fainted moshe exclaimed instantly forgetting his own perturbation and yet thou didst guess it said rebecca a happy little smile dimpling her pale cheek and came away after me then her face clouding the satan mekatrig has tempted us both away from synagogue she said and even when i commence to say tehillim psalms at home he interrupts me by sending me my darling husband moshe kissed her in acknowledgment of the complimentary termination of a sentence begun with unquestionable gloom but what made my rivkoly faint he asked glad on reflection that his wife's misconception obviated the necessity of explanations they ought to have opened the window at the back of the women's room rebecca shuddered god forbid she cried it wasn't the heat it was that her eyes stared a moment at some unseen vision what cried moshe catching the contagion of horror he would have come in she said who would have come in he gasped the satan mekatrig replied his wife he was outside and he glared at me as if i prevented his coming in a nervous silence followed moshe's heart beat painfully then he laughed with ghastly merriment thou didst fall asleep from the heat he said and hadst an evil dream no no protested his wife earnestly as sure as i stand here no i was looking into my chumosh pentateuch following the reading of the torah and all at once i felt something plucking my eyes off my book and turning my head to look through the window immediately behind me i wondered what satan mekatrig was distracting my thoughts from the service for a long time i resisted but when the reading ceased for a moment the temptation overcame me and i turned and saw him how looked he moshe asked in a whisper that strove in vain not to be one do not ask me rebecca replied with another shudder a little crooked demon with red hair and a fur cap and a white forehead and baleful eyes and a cock's talons for toes again moshe laughed a strange hollow laugh little fool he said i know the man he is only a brother jew a poor cutter or cigar maker who laughs at yiddishkeit judaism because he has no wife like mine to show him the heavenly light why didst thou not see him afterward but no thou must have been gone by the time he came inside what i saw was no man returned rebecca looking at him sternly no earthly being could have stopped my heart with his glances it was the satan mekatrig himself who goeth to and fro on the earth and walketh up and down in it i must have been having wicked thoughts indeed this sabbath thinking of my new dress for my sabbath angel to have deserted me and to let the disturber and the tempter assail me unchecked the poor conscience stricken woman burst into tears my rivkoly have wicked thoughts said moshe incredulously as he smoothed her cheek if my rivkoly puts on a new dress in honour of the sabbath is not the dear god pleased why where is thy new dress i have changed it for an old one she sobbed i do not want to see the demon again the satan mekatrig has no real existence i tell thee said moshe irritated he only means our own inward thoughts that distract us in the performance of the precepts our own inward temptations to go astray after our eyes and after our hearts moshe rebecca exclaimed in a shocked tone have i married an epikouros after all my father the rav peace be unto him always said thou hadst the makings of one that thou didst ask too many questions well whether there is a satan or not retorted her husband thou couldst not have seen him for the person thou describest is the man i tell thee of and thou keepest company with such a man she answered a man who scoffs at yiddishkeit may the holy one blessed be he forgive thee now i know why we have no children no son to say kaddish after us and rebecca wept bitterly for the children she did not possess their common cause of grief coming thus unexpectedly into their consciousness softened them toward one another and dispelled the gathering irritation both had a melancholy vision of themselves stretched out stiff and stark in their shrouds with no filial kaddish breaking in upon and gladdening their ears o if their souls should be doomed to purgatory with no son's prayers to release them very soon they were sitting hand in hand reading together the interrupted psalms and a deep peace fell upon moshe grinwitz so the immortal allegorist john bunyan must have felt when the mad longing to utter blasphemies and obscenities from the pulpit was stifled and when he felt his soul once more in harmony with the spirit of good so feel all men who have wrestled with a being in the darkness and prevailed they were a curious contrast the tall sallow stooping black bearded man and the small keen eyed plump pleasant looking if not pretty woman in her dark wig and striped cotton dress and as they sat steadily going through the whole collection of psalms to a strange melancholy tune fraught with a haunting and indescribable pathos the shadows of twilight gathered unnoticed about the attic which was their all in all of home the iron bed the wooden chairs the gilt framed mizrach began to lose their outlines in the dimness the psalms were finished at last and then the husband and wife sat still hand in hand talking of their plans for the coming week for once neither spoke of going to evening service at the synagogue of love and mercy and when a silver ray of moonlight lay broad across the counterpane and rebecca grinwitz peering into the quiet sky that overhung the turbid alley announced that three stars were visible the devout couple turned their faces to the east and sang the hymns that usher out the sabbath and when the evening prayer was over rebecca produced from the cupboard the plainly cut goblet of raisin wine and the metal wine cup the green twisted waxlight and the spice box wherewith to perform the beautiful symbolical ceremony of the havdalah welcoming in the days of work the six long days of dreary drudgery with cheerful resignation to the will of the maker of all things of the sabbath and the day of work the light and the shadow the good and the evil blent into one divine harmony by his inscrutable wisdom and love moshe filled the cup with raisin wine and holding it with his right hand chanted a short majestic hebrew poem whereof the burden was lo god is my salvation i will trust and i will not be afraid be with us light and joy gladness and honour then blessing the king of the universe who had created the fruit of the vine he placed the cup on the table and took up the spices uttering a blessing over them as he did so then having smelled the spice box he passed it on to his wife and spread out his hands toward the light of the spiral wax taper reciting solemnly blessed be thou o lord our god king of the universe who createst the light of the fire and then looking down at the shade made by his bent fingers he took up the wine cup again and chanted with especial fervour and with a renewed sense of the sanctities and sweet tranquillities of religion blessed be thou o lord our god king of the universe who makest a distinction between the holy and the non holy between light and darkness as for that night let darkness seize upon it job iii it was kol nidre night the commencement of the great white fast the day of atonement throughout the jewish quarter there was an air of subdued excitement the synagogues had just emptied themselves and everywhere men and women yet under the solemn shadow of passionate prayer were meeting and exchanging the wish that they might weather the fast safely the night was dark and starless as if nature partook of the universal mournfulness solitary though amidst a crowd a slight painfully thin woman shuffled wearily along her feet clad in the slippers which befitted the occasion her head bent her worn cheek furrowed with still falling tears they were not the last dribblets of an exhausted emotion not the meaningless watery expression of over excited sensibility they were real salt bitter tears born of an intense sorrow the long harassing service with its untiring demands upon the most exalted and the most poignant emotions would have been a blessing if it had dulled her capacity for anguish but it had not poor rebecca grinwitz was still thinking of her husband it was of him she thought even when the ministers in their long white cerements were pouring forth their souls in passionate vocalization now rising to a wail now breaking to a sob now sinking to a dread whisper it was of him she thought when the weeping worshippers covered from head to foot in their praying shawls rocked to and fro in a frenzy of grief and battered the gates of heaven with fiery lyrics it was of him she thought when she beat her breast with her clenched fist as she made the confession of sin and clamoured for forgiveness sins enough she knew she had but his sin ah god his sin for moshe had gone from bad to worse he refused to reenter the synagogue where he had been so roughly handled his speech became more and more profane he said no more prayers wore no more phylacteries her peaceful home life wrecked her reliance on her husband gone the poor wife clung to him still hoping on at times she did not believe him sane gradually rumours of his mad behaviour on the sabbath on which she had fainted reached her ears and remembering that his strangeness had begun from the sunday morning following that delicious afternoon of common psalm saying she was often inclined to put it all down to mental aberration but then his talk so clever if so blasphemous bristling with little pointed epigrams and maxims such as she had never before heard from him or any one else he was full of new ideas too on politics and the social system and other unpractical topics picturing endless potentialities of wealth and happiness for the labourer meantime his wages had fallen by a third owing to the loss of his former place his master having been the president of the congregation of love and mercy what wonder therefore if moshe grinwitz intruded upon all his wife's thoughts devotional or worldly in a very real sense he had become her satan mekatrig up till to night she had gone on hoping for when the great white fast comes round a mighty wave as of some subtle magnetism passes through the world of jews men and women who have not obeyed one precept of judaism for a whole year suddenly awake to a remembrance of the faith in which they were born and hasten to fast and pray and abase themselves before the throne of mercy the long drawn tremulous stirring notes of the trumpet that ushers in the new year seem to rally and gather together the dispersed of israel from every region of the underworld of unfaith and to mass them beneath the cope of heaven and to night surely the newly rooted nightshade of doubt would wither away in her husband's bosom surely this one link still held him to the religion of his fathers and this one link would redeem him and yet save his soul from the everlasting tortures of the damned but this last hope had been doomed to disappointment utterly unmoved by all the olden sanctities of the days of judgment that initiate the new year the miserable man showed no signs of remorse when the more awful terrors of the day of atonement drew near the last day of grace for the sinner the day on which the divine sentence is sealed irrevocably and so the wretched woman had gone to the synagogue alone reaching home she toiled up the black staircase and turned the handle of the door as she threw open the door she uttered a cry she saw nothing before her but a gigantic shadow flickering grotesquely on the sloping walls and the slip of ceiling it must be her own shadow for other living occupant of the room she could see none where was her husband whither had he gone why had he recklessly left the door unlocked she looked toward the table gleaming weirdly with its white tablecloth the tall wax yom kippur candle specially lit on the eve of the solemn fast and intended to burn far on into the next day had all but guttered away and the flame was quivering unsteadily under the influence of a draught coming from the carelessly opened window rebecca shivered from head to foot a dread presentiment of evil shook her soul for years the candle had burnt steadily and her life also had been steady and undisturbed alas it needed not the omen of the yom kippur candle to presage woe may the dear god have mercy on me she exclaimed bursting into fresh tears hardly had she uttered the words when a monstrous black cat with baleful green eyes dashed from under the table sprang upon the window sill and disappeared into the darkness uttering a melancholy howl almost frantic with terror the poor woman dragged herself to the window and closed it with a bang but ere the sash had touched the sill something narrow and white had flashed from the room through the gap and the reverberations made in the silent garret by the shock of the violently closed window were prolonged in mocking laughter well thrown rav moshe said a grating voice now that you have at last conquered your reverence for a bit of tin and a morsel of parchment i will honour your mansion with my presence instantly rebecca felt a wild longing to join in the merriment and to laugh away her fears but muttering a potent talismanic verse she turned and faced her husband and his guest instinct had not deceived her the new comer was the hunchback of that fatal sabbath this time she did not faint a strange hour and occasion to bring a visitor moshe she said sternly her face growing even more rigid and white as she caught the nicotian and alcoholic reek of the two men's breaths your good frau is not over polite said the visitor but it's yom kippur and so i suppose she feels she must tell the truth i brought him rivkoly to convince thee what a fool thou wast to assert that thou hadst seen but i mustn't be impolite he broke off with a coarse laugh there's no call for me to tell the truth because it's yom kippur down at the club we celebrated the occasion by something better than truth a jolly spread and our good friend here actually stood a bottle of champagne champagne rivkoly think of it real live champagne like that which fizzes and sparkles on the table of the lord mayor oh he's a jolly good fellow and so said all of us too and yet thou sayest he isn't a fellow at all a drunken leer overspread his sallow face and was rendered more ghastly by the flame leaping up from the expiring candle roshah sinner thundered the woman then looking straight into the cruel eyes of the hunchback her wan face shining with the stress of a great emotion her meagre form convulsed with fury avaunt satan mekatrig she screamed get thee down from my house get thee down in god's name get thee down to hell even the brazen faced hunchback trembled before her passion but he grasped his friend's hot hand in his long nervous fingers and seemed to draw courage from the contact if i go i take your husband he hissed his great eyes blazing in turn he will leave me no more send me away if you will yes thou must not send my friend away like this hiccoughed moshe grinwitz come make him welcome like the good wife thou wast wont to be rebecca uttered a terrible cry and cowering down on the ground rocked herself to and fro the drunkard appeared moved get up rivkoly he said with a tremour in his tones to see thee one would think thou wast sitting shivah over my corpse he put out his hand as if to raise her up back she screamed writhing from his grasp touch me not no longer am i wife of thine hear you that man said the hunchback eagerly you are free i am here as a witness think of it you are free yes i am free repeated moshe with a horrible joyous exultation on his sickly visage the gigantic shadow of himself that bent over him cast by the dying flame of the yom kippur candle seemed to dance in grim triumph his long side curls dangling in the spectral image like barbaric ornaments in the ears of a savage while the unshapely fantastic shadow of the hunchback seemed to nod its head in applause then as the flame leaped up in an irregular jet the distorted shadow of the tempter intertwined itself in a ghastly embrace with her own with frozen blood and stifled breath the tortured woman turned away and as her eyes fell upon the many cracked looking glass which adorned the mantelpiece she saw or her overwrought fancy seemed to see her husband's dead face wreathed with a slavering serpent in the place of the phylacteries he had ceased to wear and surrounded by endless perspectives of mocking marble browed visages with fiery snakes for hair and live coals for eyes she felt her senses slipping away from her grasp but she struggled wildly against the heavy vapour that seemed to choke her moshe she shrieked in mad involuntary appeal for help as she clutched the mantel and closed her eyes to shut out the hideous vision i am no longer thy husband tauntingly replied the man i may not touch thee hear you that woman came the sardonic voice of the hunchback you are free i am here as a witness i am here as a witness a thousand mocking voices seemed to hiss in echoed sibilance a terrible silence followed at last she turned her white shrunken face which the contrast of the jet black wig rendered weird and death like toward the man who had been her husband and looked long and slowly yearningly yet reproachfully into his bloodshot eyes again a great wave of agitation shook the man from head to foot don't look at me like that rivkoly he almost screamed i won't have it i won't see thee curse that candle why does it flicker on eternally and not blot thee from my sight he puffed violently at the tenacious flame and a pall fell over the room but the next instant the light leaped up higher than ever moshe rebecca shrieked in wild dismay dost thou forget it is kol nidre night how canst thou dare to blow out a light besides it is the yom kippur candle it is our life and happiness for the new year if you blow it out i swear by my soul and the great name that you shall never look upon my face again it is because i do not wish to see thy face that i will blow it out he replied laughing hysterically no no she pleaded i will go away rather it is nearly dead of itself let it die no it takes too long dying 'tis like thy father the rav who had the corpse watchers so long in attendance that one died himself said moshe grinwitz with horrible laughter i will kill it and bending down low over the broad socket of the candlestick so that his head loomed gigantic on the ceiling he silenced forever the restless tongue of fire immediately a thick blackness as of the grave settled upon the chamber hollow echoes of the blasphemer's laughter rang and resounded on every side myriads of dreadful faces shaped themselves out of the gloom and mowed and gibbered at the woman at the window the green baleful eyes of the black cat glared with phosphorescent light a wreath of fiery serpents twisted themselves in fiendish contortions shedding lurid radiance upon the cruel marble brow they garlanded an unspeakable eeriness an unnameable unholiness floated with far sweeping rustling pinions through the darkness with stifling throat that strove in vain to shriek the woman dashed out through the well known door fled wildly down the stairs pursued at every step by the sardonic merriment met at every corner by the gibbering shapes fled on dashing through the heavy ever open street door into the fresher air of the night on instinctively on through the almost deserted streets and alleys where only the vile gin houses gleamed with life on without pause or rest till she fell exhausted upon the dusty door step of the synagogue of love and mercy all israel have a portion in the world to come ethics of the fathers the aged keeper of the synagogue rushed out at the noise save me for god's sake save me reb yitzchok cried the fallen figure save me from the satan mekatrig i have no home no husband any more take me in take you in said reb yitzchok pityingly for he dimly guessed something of her story where can i take you in you know my wife and i are allowed but one tiny room here take me in repeated the woman i will pass the night in the synagogue i must pray for my husband's soul for he has no son to pray for him let me come in save me from the satan mekatrig you would certainly meet many a satan mekatrig in the streets during the night said the old man musingly but have you no friends to go to none none but god let me in that i may go to him give me shelter and he will have mercy on you when the great tekiah sounds to morrow night without another word reb yitzchok went into his room returned with the key and threw open the door of the women's synagogue revealing a dazzling flood of light from the numerous candles big and little which had been left burning in their sconces the low curtain that served as a partition had been half rolled back by devoted husbands who had come to inquire after their wives at the end of the service and the synagogue looked unusually large and bright though it was hot and close with lingering odours of breaths and snuff and tallow and smelling salts with a sob of infinite thankfulness rebecca dropped upon a wooden bench would you like a blanket said the old man no no god bless you she replied i must watch and weep not sleep for the scroll of judgment is written and the book of life is all but closed with a pitying sigh the old man turned and left her alone for the night in the synagogue of love and mercy for a few moments rebecca sat prayerless her soul full of a strange peace then she found herself counting the chimes as they rolled out sonorously from a neighbouring steeple one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve starting up suddenly when the last stroke ceased to vibrate on the air rebecca grinwitz found to her surprise that a merciful sleep must have overtaken her eyelids that hours must have passed since midnight had struck and that the great day of atonement must have dawned both compartments of the synagogue were full of the restless stir of a praying multitude with a sense of something vaguely strange she bent her eyes downward on her neighbour's machzor the woman immediately pushed the prayer book more toward rebecca with a wonderful smile of love and tenderness which seemed to go right through rebecca's heart though she could not clearly remember ever having seen her neighbour before nor wonderingly stealing a first glance around could she help feeling that the entire congregation was somewhat strange and unfamiliar though she could not quite think why or how the male worshippers too why did they all wear the shroud like garments usually confined on this solemn occasion to the ministers and a few extra devout personages and had not some transformation come over the synagogue was it only the haze before her tear worn eyes or did dim perspectives of worshippers stretch away boundlessly on all sides of the clearly seen area which still retained the form of the room she knew so well but the curious undercurrent of undefined wonder lasted but a moment in another instant she was reconciled to the scene all was familiar and expected once more she was taking part in divine service with no sorrowful thoughts of her husband coming to distract her her whole soul bathing in and absorbing the peace of god which passeth all understanding then suddenly she felt a stir of recollection coming over her and a stream of love warming her heart and looking up at her neighbour's face she saw with joyous content that it was that of her mother the service went on mother and daughter following it in the book they had in common after several hours during which the huge far spreading congregation alternated with the cantor in intoning the beautiful poems of the liturgy of the day the white curtain with its mystic cabalistic insignia was rolled back from the ark of the covenant and two scrolls were withdrawn therefrom rebecca noted with joy that the ark was filled with scrolls big and little in rich mantles and that those taken out were swathed in satin beautifully embroidered and that the ornaments and the musically tinkling bells were of pure gold then some of the worshippers were called up in turn to the al memor to be present at the reading of a section of the law they were all well known to rebecca first came moses ben amram he walked humbly up to the al memor with bowed head his long talith enveloping him from crown to foot rebecca saw his face well for though it was covered with a thick veil it shone luminously through its draping bless ye the lord who is blessed said moses ben amram the words seeming all the sweeter from his lips for the slight stammering with which they were uttered blessed be the lord who is blessed to all eternity and beyond responded the endless congregation in a low murmur that seemed to be taken up and vibrated away and away into the infinite distances for ever and ever blessed be the lord who is blessed to all eternity and beyond echoed the melodious voice then in words that seemed to roll and fill the great gulfs of space with a choral music of sacred joy moses continued blessed be thou o lord our god the king of the universe who hath chosen us from all peoples and given unto us his law blessed art thou o lord who givest the law after him came aaron ben amram whose white beard reached to his knees abraham ben terah isaac ben abraham and jacob ben isaac all venerable figures with faces which rebecca felt were radiant with infinite tenderness and compassion for such poor helpless children as herself were also called up and after the patriarchs elijah the prophet lastly came a white haired stooping figure whose gait and whose every gesture told rebecca that it was her father how glad she felt to see him thus honoured as she listened to his quavering tones the dusty tombstones of dead years seemed rolled away and all their simple joys and griefs to live again not quite as of yore but transfigured by some solemn pathos when the reading of the law was at an end david ben jesse a royal looking graybeard held up the scroll to the four corners of space and it was rolled up by his son solomon the preacher the carrying of it to the ark being given to rabbi akiba whose features wore a strange ecstatic look as though ennobled by suffering the vast multitude rose with a great rustling the sound whereof reached afar and sang a hymn of rejoicing so that the whole universe was filled with melody rebecca alone could not sing for the first time she missed her husband moshe why was he not here like all the other friends of her life whose beloved faces surrounded her on every side and made a sweet atmosphere of security for her soul what was he doing outside of this mighty assembly why was he not there to have the sacred duty of carrying the scroll entrusted to him she felt the tears pouring down her cheeks she was ready to sink to the earth with sudden lassitude mother dear mother she cried i feel so faint you must have some air my child my rivkoly said the mother the dearly remembered voice falling for the first time with ineffable sweetness on rebecca's ears and she put out her hand and lo it grew longer and longer till it reached up to the skylight and then suddenly the whole roof vanished and the free air of heaven blew in like celestial balm upon rebecca's hot forehead yet she noted with wonder that the holy candles burnt on steadily unfluttered by the refreshing breeze and then lo the starless heavens above her opened out in indescribable glory the dark budded into ineffable beauty a supernally pure luminous splendour transcendently dazzling filled the infinite depths of the firmament with melodious coruscations of infinite love made visible and white winged hosts of radiant cherubim sang holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and all the vast congregation fell upon their faces and cried holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and moses ben amram arose and he lifted his hands toward the splendour and he cried lord lord god merciful and gracious long suffering and full of kindness and truth lo thou sealest the seals before the twilight seal thy people i pray thee in the book of life though thou blot me out forgive them and pardon their transgressions for the sake of the merits of the patriarchs and for the sake of the merits of the martyrs who have shed their blood like water and offered their flesh to the flames for the sanctification of the name forgive them and blot out their transgressions and all the congregation said amen then a surging wave of hope rose within rebecca's breast and it lifted her to her feet and stretched out her arms toward the splendour and she said lord god forgive thou my husband for he is in the hand of the tempter save him from the power of the evil one by thine outstretched arm and thy mighty hand save him and pardon him lord in thine infinite mercy then a strange dread anxious silence fell upon the vast spaces of the firmament till from the heart of the celestial splendour there fell a word that floated through the universe like the sweet blended strains of all sweet instruments a word that mingled all the harmonies of winds and waters and mortal and angelic voices into one divine cadence salachti and with the sweet word of forgiveness lingering musically in her charmed ears and the sweet assurance at her heart that she the poor miserable tailor's wife despised and trodden under foot by the rich and by the heathen around could lean upon the breast of an almighty father who had prepared for her immortal glories and raptures amid all her loved ones in a world where he would wipe the tears from off all eyes rebecca grinwitz awoke to find the bright morning sunshine streaming in upon her and the fresh morning air blowing in upon her fevered brow from the skylight which reb yitzchok had just opened surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler psalm xci a shroud of newly fallen snow enveloped the dead earth over which the dull murky sky looked drearily down within his fireless garret which was almost empty of furniture moshe grinwitz lay wasted away to a shadow his beard was unkempt his cheek bones were almost fleshless his feverish eyes large and staring his side curls tangled and untended there did not seem enough strength left in the frame to resist a babe yet when he coughed the whole skeleton was agitated as though with galvanic energy will he never come back he murmured uneasily fear not so far as lies in my power i shall be with you always replied the voice of the hunchback as he entered the room but alas i have little comfort to bring you one pawnbroker after another refused to advance anything on my waistcoat and at last i sold it right out for a few pence see here is some milk it is warm moshe tried to clutch the jug but fell back helpless a shade of anxiety passed over his companion's face have i miscalculated he muttered he held the jug to the sick man's lips supporting his head with the other moshe drank then fell back and pressed his friend's hand gratefully poor moshe said the hunchback what a shame i tossed into the gutter the gold my father left me seven months ago how could i foresee you would be struck down with this long sickness no no don't regret it quavered moshe his white face lighting up we had jolly old times jolly old times while the money lasted oh you've been a good friend to me a good friend if i had never known you i should have passed away into nothingness without ever having known the mad joys of wine and riot i have had wild voluptuous moments of revelry and mirth no power in heaven or hell can take away the past and then the sweet freedom of doing as you will thinking as you will flying with wings unclogged by superstition to you i owe it all and since i have been ill you have watched over me like like a woman his words died away in a sob and then there was silence except when his cough sounded strange and hollow in the bare room presently he went on how unjust rivkoly was to you she once said here the speaker laughed a little melancholy laugh that you were the satan mekatrig in person poor afflicted woman said his friend with pitying scorn in this nineteenth century when among the wise the belief in the gods has died out there are yet fools alive who believe in the devil but she could only have meant it metaphorically the sick man shook his head she said the evil influence of course it seemed evil to her you wielded over her thoughts and i suppose mine too was more than human was supernatural oh i don't say i'm not more strong minded than most people of course i am or i should be howling hymns at the present moment but why does a soldier catch fire under the eye of his captain what magnetism enables one man to bewitch a nation why does one friend's unspoken thought find unuttered echo in another's go to science study mesmerism hypnotism thought transference and you will learn all about me and my influence yes rivkoly never had any idea of anything outside her prayer book rivkoly mention not her name to me interrupted the hunchback harshly a woman who deserts her husband she swore to go if i blew out the yom kippur light and i did a woman who goes out of her wits because her husband gets into his sneered the other doubtless her superstitious fancy conjured up all sorts of sights in the dark ho ho ho and he laughed a ghastly laugh happily she will never come back she's evidently able to get along without you probably she has another husband more to her pious taste moshe raised himself convulsively don't say that again he screamed my rivkoly then a violent cough shook him and his white lips were reddened with blood the cold eyes of the hunchback glittered strangely as he saw the blood at any rate he said more gently she cannot break the mighty oath she sware she will never come back no she will never come back the sick man groaned hopelessly but it was cruel of me to drive her away would to g the hunchback hastily put his hand on the speaker's mouth and tenderly wiped away the blood when i am better said moshe with sudden resolution i will seek her out perhaps she is starving as you will you know she can always earn her bread and water at the cap making but you are your own master when you are rid of this sickness which will be soon you shall go and seek her out and bring her to abide with you the words rang sardonically through the chamber how good you are moshe murmured as he sank back relieved the hunchback leaned over the bed till his gigantic brow almost touched the sick man's till his wonderful eyes lay almost on his and yet you will not let me hasten on your recovery in the way i proposed to you no no moshe said trembling all over what matters if i lie here a week more or less lie here hissed his friend in a week you will lie rotting a wild cry broke from the blood bespattered lips i am not dying i am not dying you said just now i should be better soon so you will so you will but only if we have money our last farthing our last means of raising a farthing is gone without proper food without a spark of fire how can you hold out a week in this bitter weather no unless you would pass from the light and the gladness of life to the gloom and the shadow of the tomb you must be instantly baptized shmad myself never said the sick man the very word conjuring up an intolerable loathing deeper than reason and then another violent fit of coughing shook him see how this freezing atmosphere tells on you you must take christian gold i tell you thus only shall i be able to get you fire to get you fire repeated the hunchback with horrible emphasis you call yourself a disbeliever if so what matters why should you die for a miserable prejudice but you are no true infidel so long as you shrink from professing any religion under the sun you still possess a religion your unfaith is but foam drift on the deep sea of faith but lip babble while your heart is still infected with superstition come bid me fetch the priest with his crucifix and holy water let us fool him to the top of his bent rouse yourself be a man and live no no brother i will be a man and die fool hissed the hunchback it fits not one who has lived for months by christian gold to be so nice you lie moshe gasped the seven months that you and i have known each other it is christian gold that has warmed you and fed you and rejoiced you and that melted down has flowed in your veins as wine whence then took i the money for our riotings from your father you said yes from my spiritual father was the grim reply no having that belief which you still lack in the hollowness and mockery of all save pleasure i became a christian for a time they paid me well but as soon as i had been put on the annual report i had served my purpose and the supplies fell off i could be converted again in another town or country but i dare not leave you but you are a new man and should i drag you into the fold they will reward us both well instead of subsisting on dry bread and milk you will fare on champagne and turtle soup once more moshe sat up and gazed wildly one long second at the tempter he looked at his own fleshless arms and shuddered he felt the icy hand of death upon him he knew himself a young man still must he go down into the eternal darkness and be folded in the freezing clasp of the king of terrors while the warm bosom of life offered itself to his embrace no give him life life life polluted and stained with hypocrisy but still life delicious life the steely eyes of the hunchback watched the contest anxiously suddenly a change came over the wildly working face it fell back chill and rigid on the pillow the eyes closed the room seemed to fill with an impalpable brooding vapour as if a thick fog were falling outside the watcher caught madly at his friend's wrist and sought to detect a pulsation his eyes glowed with horrible exultant relief not yet not yet brother azrael he said mockingly as if addressing the impalpable vapour thou who art wholly woven of eyes canst thou not see that it is not yet time to throw the fatal pellet into his throat back back the vapour thickened the minutes passed the hunchback peered expectant at the corpse like face on the dingy pillow at last the eyes opened but in them shone a strange rapt expression thank god rivkoly the dying lips muttered i knew thou wouldst come as he spoke there was a frantic beating at the door the hunchback's face was convulsed hasten hasten brother azrael he cried the vapour lightened a little moshe grinwitz seemed to rally his face glowed with eagerness open the door open the door he cried it's rivkoly my rivkoly the vain battering at the door grew fiercer but none noted it in the house since the shadow of the hunchback had first fallen within that thickly crowded human nest the doves had become hawks the hawks vultures all was discord and bickering lie still said the hunchback 'tis but your fevered imagination drink he put the jug to the dying man's lips but it was dashed violently from his hand and shattered into a hundred pieces give me nothing bought with christian money gasped moshe hoarsely his breath rattling painfully in his throat never will i knowingly gain by the denial of the unity of god then die like a dog roared the hunchback hasten brother azrael the vapour folded itself thickly about the room the rickety door was shaken frantically as by a great gale moshe moshe shrieked a voice let me in me thy rivkoly in god's name let me in i bring thee a precious gift or art thou dead dead dead my god why didst thou not cause me to know he was ill before your husband is dying said the hunchback when he is dead you shall look upon his face but he may not look upon your face again you have sworn it devil cried the fierce voice of the woman i swore it on kol nidre night when i had just asked the almighty to absolve me from all rash oaths let me in i tell you i will not have a sacred oath treated thus lightly said the hunchback savagely i will keep your soul from sin cursed be thou to eternity of eternities replied the woman pray moshe pray for thy soul pray for thou art dying hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one rose the sonorous hebrew hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one wailed the woman the very vapour seemed to cling round and prolong the vibrations of the sacred words only the hunchback was silent the mocking words died on his lips and as the woman with one last mighty blow dashed in through the flying door he seemed to glide past her and melt into the darkness of the staircase rivkoly heeded not his contorted malignant visage crowned with its serpentine wreath of fiery hair she flew straight through the heavy vapour stooped and kissed the livid mouth read in a moment the decree of death in the eyes and then put something small and warm into her husband's fast chilling arms take it moshe she cried and comfort thy soul in death 'tis thy child for god has at last sent us a son yom kippur night now six long months ago i had a dream that god would forgive thee and i was glad but when i thought to go home to thee in the evening i learnt that thou hadst been feasting all that dread day of atonement with the satan mekatrig and my heart fell for i knew that my dream was but the vain longing of my breast and that through thine own misguided soul thou couldst never be saved from the eternal vengeance then i went away far from here and toiled and lived hard and lone and i believed not in my dream but i prayed and prayed for thy soul and lo very soon i was answered for i knew we should have a child and then i entreated that it should be a son to pray for thee and perhaps win thee back to god and to say the kaddish after thee when thou shouldst come to die though i knew not that thy death was at hand and a few weeks back the almighty was gracious and merciful to me and i had my wish she ceased her wan face radiant the shadow of death could not chill her sublime faith her simple trustful hope the husband was clasping the feebly whimpering babe to his frozen breast and showering passionate kisses on its unconscious form rivkoly he whispered as the tears rolled down his cheeks how pale and thin thou art grown o god my sin has been heavy no no she cried her loving hand in his it was the satan mekatrig that led thee astray i am well and strong i will work for our child and train it up to pray for thee and to love thee i have named it jacob for it shall wrestle with the recording angel and shall prevail the hue of death deepened on moshe grinwitz's face but it was overspread by a divine calm ah the good old times we had at the cheder in poland he said the rabbi was sometimes cross but we children were always in good spirits and when the rejoicing of the law came round it was such fun carrying the candles stuck in hollowed apples and gnawing at your candlestick as you walked i always loved simchath torah rivkoly how long is it to the rejoicing it will soon be here again now passover is over she said pressing his hand is pesach over he said mournfully i don't remember giving seder why didst thou not remind me rivkoly it was so wrong of thee thou knowest how i loved the sight of the table the angels always seemed to hover about it chad gadyah chad gadyah he commenced to sing in a cracked hoarse whisper the child burst into a wail hush hush yaankely said the mother taking it to her breast a a ah a wild scream rose from moshe grinwitz's lips my kaddish take not away my kaddish he sat up with clammy ghastly brow and glared with sightless eyes his arms groping a thin stream of blood oozed from his mouth hear o israel screamed the woman as she put her hand to his mouth to stanch the blood he beat her back wildly not thee i want not thee my kaddish came the mad hoarse whisper i have blasphemed god give me my kaddish give me my kaddish she put the child into his arms and he clutched it in his dying frenzy as he felt its feeble form the old divine peace came over his face the babe's cries were hushed in fear the mother was dumb and stony and silently the vapour crawled in sluggish folds through the heavy air but in a moment the silence was broken by a deep stertorous rattle moshe grinwitz's head fell back his arms relaxed their hold of his child which was caught with a wild cry to its mother's bosom and the dark vapour lifted and showed the three figures to the baleful agonized eyes of the hunchback at the open door ix diary of a meshumad ix diary of a meshumad tchemnovosk saturday midnight so the first words have been written for the first time in my life i have commenced a diary will it prove the solace i have heard it is shall i find these now cold blank pages growing more and more familiar till i shall turn to them as to a sympathetic friend till this little book shall become that loved and trusted confidant for whom my lonely soul longs instead of either black or white clergy this record in black and white shall be my father confessor our village pope to whom i have so often confessed everything but the truth would be indeed shocked if he could gossip with this his new created brother what a heap of roubles it would take to tranquillize him ah god ach god of israel how is it possible that a man who has known the tenderest human ties should be so friendless so solitary in his closing years that not even in memory can he commune with a fellow soul verily the old curse has wrought itself out that penalty of apostasy which came to my mind the other day after nearly forty years of forgetfulness that curse which has filled my spirit with shuddering awe and driven me to seek daily communion through thee little book even with my own self of yesterday and that soul shall be cut off from among its people yea and from all others too for so many days and years caterina was my constant companion i loved her as my own soul yet was she but a sun that dazzled my eyes so that i could not gaze upon my own soul but a veil between me and my dead youth the sun has sunk forever below the horizon the veil is rent no phantom from the other world hovers to remind me of our happiness those years with all their raptures and successes are a dull blank it is the years of boyhood and youth which resurge in my consciousness their tints are vivid their tones are clear why is this is it caterina's death is it old age is it returning to these village scenes after half a lifetime spent in towns is it the sight of the izbas and their torpid tow haired sheepskin clad inhabitants and the great slushy cabbage gardens that has rekindled the ashen past into colours of flame and yet except our vodka seller there isn't a jew in the place however it be caterina's face is filmy phantasmal compared with my mother's and mother died forty years ago the grass of two short years grows over my wife's grave and paul he is living he kissed me but a few moments back yet his face is far away elusive the hues of life are on my father's poor ignorant narrow minded warm hearted father whose heart i broke happily i have not to bear the remembrance of his dying look but can picture him as i saw him in those miserable happy days my father's kiss is warm upon the lips which my son's has just left cold poor st paul living up there with your ideals and your theories like a dove in a balloon and yet golubtchik how i love you my handsome gifted boy fighting the battle of life so pluckily and well ah it is hard fighting when one is hampered by a conscience is it your fault that the cold iron bar of a secret lies between our souls that a bar my own hands have forged and which i have not the courage or the strength to break keeps you from my inmost heart and makes us strangers no you are the best of sons and love me truly but if your eyes were purged and you could see the ugly hateful thing and through and beyond it into my ugly hateful soul ah no that must never be your affection your reverential affection is the only sacred and precious thing yet left to me on earth if i lost that if my spirit were cut off even from the semblance of human sympathy then might the grave close over my body as it would have already closed over my soul and yet should i have the courage to die yes for then paul would know paul would obey my wishes and see me buried among my people paul would hire mourners god hired mourners when i have a son to say the kaddish paul would do his duty though his heart broke terrible ominous words break my son's heart as i did my father's the saints voi i mean god forfend and for opposite reasons ach it is a strange world is religion then a curse eternally dividing man from man no i will not think these blasphemous thoughts my poor brave paul to morrow will be a hard day sunday night i have just read over my last entry how cold how tame the words seem compared with the tempest with which i am shaken and yet it is a relief to have uttered them to have given vent to my passion and pain already this scrawl of mine has become sacred to me already this study in which i write has become a sanctuary to which my soul turns with longing all day long my diary was in my thoughts all my turbulent emotions were softened by the knowledge that i should come here and survey them with calm by the hope that the tranquil reflectiveness which writing induces would lead me into some haven of rest and first let me confess that i am glad paul goes back to st petersburg on tuesday it is a comfort to have him here for a few days and yet oh how i dread to meet his clear gaze how irksome this close contact with the rough rubs it gives to all my sore places how i abhorred myself to day as i went through the ghastly mimicries of prayer and crossing myself and genuflexion in our little church how i hate the sight of its sky blue dome and its gilt minarets when the pope brought me the gospel to kiss fiery shame coursed through my veins and then when i saw the look of humble reverence on paul's face as he pressed his lips to the silver bound volume my blood was frozen to ice strange dead memories seemed to float about the incense laden air shadowy scenes old far away cadences and when the deacon walked past me with his bougie there seemed to flash upon me some childish recollection of a joyous candle bearing procession whereat my eyes grew filled with sudden tears the marble altar the silver candlesticks the glittering jewelled scene faded into mist and then the choir sang and under the music i grew calm again after all religions were made for men and this one was just fitted for the simple muzhiks who dotted the benches with their stupid good natured figures they must have their gold bedecked gods in painting and image and their saints in gold brocade to kneel before at all hours to solace themselves with visions of a brocaded paradise and yet what had i to do with these childish superstitions i whose race preached the great doctrine of the unity to a world sunk in vice and superstition whose childish lips were taught to utter the shemang as soon as they could form the syllables who know that the christian creed is a monstrous delusion to think that i have lent the sanction of my manhood to these grotesque beliefs grotesque say i when to paul they are the essence of all lofty feeling and aspiration and yet i know that he is blind or sees things with that strange perversion of vision of which i have heard him accuse the jews my brethren he believes what he has been taught and who taught him bozhe moi was it not i who have brought him up in these degrading beliefs which he imagines i share god is this my punishment that he is faithful to the creed taught him by a father who was faithless to his own and yet there were excuses enough for me thou knowest why did these forms and ceremonies which now loom beautiful to me through a mist of tears seem hideous chains on the free limbs of childhood was it my father's fault or my own that the stereotyped routine of the day that the being dragged out of bed in the gray dawn to go to synagogue or to intone in monotonous sing song the weary casuistries of the rabbis that the endless precepts or prohibitions made me conceive religion as the most hateful of tyrannies through the cloud of forty years i can but dimly recall the violence of the repulsion with which things jewish inspired me of how it galled me to feel that i was one of that detested race that i was that mockery and byword a zhit that with little sympathy with my people i was yet destined to partake of its burdens and its disabilities bitter as my soul is within me to day i can yet understand can yet half excuse that fatal mistake of ignorant and ambitious youth it were easy for me now to acknowledge myself a jew even with the risk of siberia before me i am rich i have some of the education for which i longed above all i have lived ah how differently the world with its hopes and its fears and its praise and censure looks to the youth who is climbing slowly up the hill and the man who is swiftly descending to the valley but the knowledge of the vanity of all things comes too late this too is vanity enough that i sacrificed the sincerity and reality of life for unrealities which then seemed to me the only things worth having there was none to counsel and none to listen i fled my home i was baptized into the church at once all that hampered me was washed away before me stretched the free open road of culture and well being i was no longer the slave of wanton laws the laughing stock of every muscovite infant liable to be kicked and cuffed and spat at by every true russian what mattered a lip profession of christianity when i cared as little for judaism as for it i never looked back my prior life faded quickly from my memory alone i fought the battle of life alone unaided by man or hope in god a few lucky speculations on the bourse starting from the risking of the few kopecks amassed by tuition rescued me from the need of pursuing my law studies i fell in love and married caterina your lovely face came effectively between me and what vague visions of my past what dim uneasiness of remorse yet haunted me you never knew your family never knew that i was not a slav to the backbone the new life lay fold on fold over the old the primitive writing of the palimpsest was so thickly written over that no thought of what i had once been troubled me during all those years of wedded life made happier by your birth and growth my paul my darling paul no voice came from those forgotten shores save once when who knows through what impalpable medium i learnt or divined my father's death and all the air was filled with hollow echoes of reproach during those years i avoided contact with jews as much as i could when it was inevitable i made the contact brief the thought of the men of their gabardines and their pious ringlets of their studious dronings and their devout quiverings and wailings of the women with their coarse figures and their unsightly wigs the remembrance of their vulgar dialect and their shuffling ways and their accommodating morality filled me with repulsion as if to justify myself to myself my mind conceived of them only in their meanest and tawdriest aspects the black points alone caught my eye and linked themselves into a perfect seeming picture da i have been a good russian a good christian i have not stirred my little finger to help the jews in their many and grievous afflictions they were nothing to me over the vodka and the champagne i have joined in the laugh against them without even feeling i was of them why then these strange sympathies that agitate me now these feelings shadowy but strong and resistless as the shadow of death am i sane or is this but incipient madness am i sinking into a literal second childhood in which all the terrors and the sanctities that once froze or stirred my soul have come to possess me once more am i dying i have heard that the scene of half a century ago may be more vivid to dying eyes than the chamber of death itself has caterina's death left a blank which these primitive beloved memories rush in to fill up was it the light of her face that blinded me to the dear homely faces of my father and mother if i had not met her how would things have been should i have repented earlier of my hollow existence was it the genuineness of her faith in her heathen creed that made me acquiesce in its daily profession and its dominance in our household life and are the old currents flowing so strongly now only because they were so long artificially dammed up of what avail to ask myself these questions i asked them yesterday and i shall be no wiser to morrow no man can analyze his own emotions least of all i unskilled to sound the depths of my soul content if the surface be unruffled perhaps after all it is paul who is the cause of the troubling of the waters which yet i am glad have not been left in their putrid stagnation for since caterina's clay cold form was laid in the moscow churchyard and paul and i have been brought the nearer together for the void my son has opened my eyes to my baseness the light that radiates from his own terrible nobleness has shown me how black and polluted a soul is mine my whole life has been shuffled through under false colours even if i shared few of the jew's beliefs it should have been my duty and my proud duty to proclaim myself of the race if as i fondly believed i was superior to my people then it behoved me to allow that superiority to be counted to their credit and to the honour of the jewish flag my poor brethren sore indeed has been your travail and your cry of pain pierces the centuries perhaps who knows i could have helped a little if i had been faithful as faithful as paul will be to his own ideals ah if paul had been a jew my god is paul a jew have i upon my shoulders the guilt of this loss to judaism too analyze myself reproach myself doubt my own sanity how i may one thing is clear from the bottom of my heart i long i yearn i burn to return to the religion of my childhood i long to say and to sing the hebrew words that come scantily and with effort to my lips i long to join my brethren at prayer to sit with them in the synagogue in the study at the table to join them in their worship and at their meals to share with them their joys and sorrows their wrongs and their inner delights laugh at myself how i will i long to bind my arm and brow with the phylacteries of old and to wrap myself in my fringed shawl and to abase myself in the dust before the god of israel nay to don the greasy gabardine at which i have mocked and to let my hair grow even as theirs as yet this is all but a troubled aspiration but it is irresistible and must work itself out in deeds it cannot be argued with the wind bloweth as it listeth who shall say why i am tempest tossed monday night paul has retired to rest to rise early to morrow for the journey to moscow for something has happened to alter his plans and he goes thither instead of to the capital he is sleeping the sleep of the young the hopeful and the joyous ach that what gives him joy should be to me but let me write down all this morning at breakfast paul received a letter which he read with a cry of astonishment and joy look little father look he exclaimed handing it to me i read trying to disguise my own feelings and to sympathize with his gladness it was a letter from a firm of well known publishers in moscow offering to publish a work on the greek church the ms of which he had submitted to them nu vot batiushka said he i will tell you that this book donnera a penser to the theologians of the bastard forms of christianity the ribald remark that rose to my lips did not pass them but why did you not tell me of this before i asked instead endeavouring to infuse a note of reproach into my indifference ah father i did not want you to distress yourself i knew your affection for me was so great that you might want to stint yourself and put yourself to trouble to help me to pay the expenses of publication myself you would have shared my disappointments i wanted you to share my triumph as now it is two years that i have been trying to get it published i wrote it in the year before mother whose soul is with the saints left us but eka i am recompensed at last and his pale face beamed and his dark eyes flashed with excitement yes paul was right as paul always is brought up i think wisely to believe in my comparative poverty he has become manlier for not having a crutch to lean upon was it not enough that he was devoid from the start of the dull dead weight of judaism which clogged my own early years up to the present though he has not done so well as i russian provincial journalism scatters few luxuries to its votaries paul is so stupidly contented with everything that he is not likely to write anything to make a sensation he has not invented gunpowder paul's voice broke in curiously on my reflections it ought to make some sensation i have collected a whole series of new arguments partly textual partly historical to show the absolute want of locus standi of any other than the orthodox church indeed i murmured and what is the orthodox church paul stared at me i mean i added hastily your conception of the orthodox church my conception said paul i suppose you mean how do i defend the conception which is embodied in our ceremonies and ritual and before i could stop him he had given me a summary of his arguments under which i would not have kept awake if i had not been thinking of other things my poor boy so this wire drawn stuff about the sacrament and the lord's supper is what has cost you toilsome days and sleepless nights while to me the thought that i had embraced one variety of christianity rather than another had never before occurred all forms were the same to me from catholicism to calvinism the baptismal water had glided from my back as from a duck's true i have lived with all the conventional surroundings of my christian fellow countrymen as i have lived with the language of russia on my lips and subservient to russian customs and manners but all the while i was neither a russian nor a christian i was a jew every now and again i roused myself to laudatory assent to one of paul's arguments when i divined by his tone that it was due but when he wound up with a panegyric on our glorious russian state and our little father the czar god's vicegerent on earth who alone of european monarchs incarnates and unites in his person church and state so that loyalty and piety are one i could not refrain from pointing out that it was a pure fluke that russia was orthodox at all suppose said i wladimir when he made his famous choice between the creeds of the world had picked judaism it all turned on a single man's whim father paul cried in a pained tone do not be blasphemous wladimir was divinely inspired to dower his country with the true faith just therein lay the wisdom of providence in achieving such great results through the medium of an individual it is impossible that god should have permitted him to incline his ear to the infidel israelite who has survived to be at once a link with the past and a living proof of the sterility of the soul that refuses the living waters the millions of holy russia perpetuating the stubborn heresy of the jews adopting an unfaith as a faith the very thought makes the blood run cold nay then would every russian deserve to be sunk in squalor dishonesty and rapacity even as every jew not every jew paul i remonstrated no not perhaps every jew in squalor he assented with a sarcastic laugh for too many of the knaves have feathered their nests very comfortably even the raskolnik is more tolerable and many of them are not even jews the russian press is infested with these fellows who take the bread out of the mouths of honest christians and will even write the leaders in the religious papers believe me little father these jewish scribblers who have planted their flagstaffs everywhere have cost me many a heartache many a disappointment i could not help thinking this sentiment somewhat unworthy of my paul though it threw a flood of light on the struggle whose details he had never troubled me with i began to doubt my wisdom in sending so unpractical a youth out into the battle of life to hew his way as best he might but how was i to foresee that he would become a writing man that he would be tripped up at every turn by some clever hebrew and that his aversion from the race would be intensified but surely i said after a moment of silence our slavic journalists are not all christians either they are not he admitted sadly the universities have much to answer for instead of rigidly excluding every vicious book that unsettles the great social and religious ideals of which god designed russia to be the exponent the works of spencer and taine and karl marx and tourguenieff and every literary antichrist are allowed to poison faith in the sap the censor only bars the superficially anti russian books but there will come a reaction a reaction he added solemnly to which this work of mine may by the grace of god be permitted to contribute i could have laughed at my son if i had not felt so inclined to weep paul's pietism irritated me for the first time was it that my reaction against my past had become stronger than ever was it that paul had never exposed his own narrowness so completely before i know not i only know i felt quite angry with him and how do you know there will ever be a reaction i asked christ never leaves himself without a witness long he answered sententiously and already there are symptoms enough that the creed of the materialist does not satisfy the soul look at our tolstoi who is coming back to christianity after ranging at will through the gaudy pleasure grounds of science and life it is true his christianity is cast after his own formula and that he has still much intellectual pride to conquer but he is on the right road to the fountain of life but little father you are unlike yourself this morning he went on putting his hand to my hot forehead you are not well he kissed me let me give you another cup of tea he said and turned on the tap of the samovar with an air that disposed of the subject i sipped at my cup to please him remarking in the interval between two sips as indifferently as i could but what makes you so bitter against the jews and what makes you so suddenly their champion he retorted when have i championed them i asked backing your pardon he said of course i should have understood you are only putting in a word for them for argument's sake but i confess i have no patience with any one who has any patience with these bloodsuckers of the state every true russian must abhor them they despise the true faith and are indifferent to our ideals they sneak out of the conscription they live for themselves and regard us as their natural prey our peasantry are corrupted by their brandy shops squeezed by their money lenders and roused to discontent by the insidious utterances of their peddlers d d wandering jews who hate the government and the tschinn and everything russian when did a jew invest his money in russian industries they are a filthy treacherous swindling set believe me batiushka pity is wasted upon them pity is never spent upon them i retorted they are what the russians what we russians have made them who has pent them into their foul cellars and reeking dens they work with their brains and you we abuse them for not working with their hands they work with their hands and the czar issues a ukase that they are to be driven off the soil they have tilled it is aesop's fable of the wolf and the lamb in which the wolf is the jew said paul coolly the jew can always be trusted to take care of himself his cunning is devilish till his heart is regenerate the jew remains the ishmael of the modern world his hand against every man's every man's against his 'love thy neighbour as thyself' i quoted bitterly even so said paul the jew must be cut off even as the christian must pluck out his own eye if it offendeth him christ came among us to bring not peace but a sword if the kingdom of christ is delayed by these vermin they must be poisoned off for the sake of russia and humanity at large vermin indeed i cried hotly for i could no longer restrain myself and what know you of these vermin of whom you speak with such assurance what know you of their inner lives of their sanctified homes of their patient sufferings have you penetrated to their hearths and seen the beautiful naivete of their lives their simple faith in god's protection though it may well seem illusion their unselfish domesticity their sublime scorn of temptation their fidelity to the faith of their ancestors their touching celebrations of fast and festival their stanchness to one another their humble living and their high respect for things intellectual their unflinching toil from morn till eve for a few kopecks of gain their heroic endurance of every form of torment vilification contempt i felt myself bursting into tears and broke from the breakfast table paul followed me to my room in amazement in the midst of all my tempest of emotion i was no less amazed at my own indiscretion what is the matter with you he said clasping his arm around my neck why make yourself so hot over this accursed race for whom from some strange whim or spirit of perverseness you stand up to day for the first time in my recollection it is true why indeed i murmured striving to master myself after all the picture i had drawn was as ideal in its beauty as paul's in its ugliness nu i only wanted you to remember that they were human beings ach there is the pity of it persisted paul that human beings should fall so low and who has been telling you of all these angelic qualities you roll so glibly off your tongue no one i answered then you have invented them ha ha ha and paul went off into a fit of good humoured laughter that laughter was a sword between his life and mine but i let a responsive smile play across my features and paul went to his own room in higher spirits than ever we met again at dinner and again at our early supper but paul was too full of his book and i of my own thoughts to permit of a renewal of the dispute even a saint i perceive has his touch of egotism and behind all paul's talk of russia's ideals of the misconceptions of their fatherland's function by feather brained nihilists and democrats possessed of that devil the modern spirit there danced i am convinced a glorified vision of st paul floating down the vistas of the future with a nimbus of russian ideals around his head if he has only put them as eloquently into his book as he talks of them he will at least be read but i have bred a bigot and the more bigoted he is the more my heart faints within me for the simple sublime faith of my people behind all the tangled network of ceremony and ritual the larger mind of the man who has lived and loved sees the outlines of a creed grand in its simplicity sublime in its persistence the spirit has clothed itself on with flesh as it must do for human eyes to gaze on it and live with it and if in addition it has swaddled itself with fold on fold of garment even so the music has not gone out of its voice nor the love out of its eyes as soon as paul is gone to morrow i must plan out my future life his book will doubtless launch him on the road to fame and fortune but what remains for me to live on as i am doing would be intolerable to do nothing for my people either with voice or purse to live alone in this sleepy hamlet cut off from all human fellowship alienated from everything that makes my neighbours' lives endurable better death than such a death in life and yet is it possible that i can get into touch again with my youth that after a sort of rip van winkle sleep i can take up again and retwine the severed strands how shall my people receive again a viper into its bosom well come what may there must be an end to this even at this moment reproachful voices haunt my ear and in another moment when i put down my pen to go to my sleepless bed i shall take care to light my bed room candle before extinguishing my lamp for the momentary darkness would be filled with impalpable solemnity bordering on horror flashes and echoes from the ghostly world of my youth the faces of my dead parents strange fragments of sound and speech the sough of the wind in the trees of the house of the living the far away voice of the chazan singing some melancholy tune full of heart break and weirdness the little crowded cheder where the rabbi intoned the monotonous lesson the whizz of the stone little ivanovitch flung at my forehead because i had killed christ no my nerves are not strong enough to bear these visions and voices all my life long i see now i have been reserved and solitary never has any one been admitted to my heart of hearts not even caterina but now i must unburden my soul to some one ere i die and to another living soul for this dead sheet of paper will not i perceive do after all saturday night nearly a week has passed since i wrote the above words and i am driven to your pages again i would have come to you last night but suddenly i recollected that it was the sabbath i have kept the sabbath i have prayed a few broken fragments of prayer recovered almost miraculously from the deeps of memory i have rested from every toil i stayed myself from stirring up the fire though it was cold and i was shivering and a new peace has come to me i have heard from paul he has completed the negotiations with the moscow booksellers the book is to have every chance of course in a way i wish it success it cannot do much harm and i am proud of paul after all what a rabbi he would have made it seems these publishers are also the owners of a paper and paul is to have some work on it which will give him enough to live upon so he will stay in moscow for a few months and see his book through the press he fears the distance is too great for him to come to and fro as he would have done had he been at the capital though i know i shall long for his presence sometimes in my strange reactions yet on the whole i feel relieved to morrow without paul will be an easier day i shall not go to church though honest old clara petroffskovna may stare and cross herself in holy horror and spoil the borsch as for the neighbours let the startchina and the starostas and the retired major from courland and even the bibulous prince shoubinoff gossip as they will i cannot remain here now for more than a few weeks besides i can be unwell no on second thoughts i shall not be unwell i have had enough of shuffling and deceit sunday a day of horrible ennui and despair i tried to read the old testament of course in russian for hebrew books i have none and it is doubtful whether i could read them if i had but the black cloud remained it chokes me as i write my limbs are as lead my head aches and yet i know the ailment is not of the body monday the depression persists i made a little expedition into the country i rowed up the stream in a duscehubka i tried to forget everything but the colours of the forest and the sparkle of the waters the air was less cold than it has been for the last few days but the russet of the pine leaves spoke to me only of melancholy and decay the sun set in blood behind the hills once i heard the howl of the wolves but they were far away monday so just a week nicholas alexandrovitch says i must not write yet but i must fill up the record even if in a few lines it is strange how every habit even diary keeping enslaves you till you think only of your neglected task ah well if i have been ill i have been lucky in my period for those frightful storms would have kept me indoors nicholas alexandrovitch says it was a mild attack of influenza god preserve me from a severe one and yet would it not be better if it had carried me off altogether but that is a cowardly thought i must face the future bravely for my own hands have forged my fate how the writing trembles and contorts itself i must remember nicholas's caution he is a frank good hearted fellow is our village doctor and i have had two or three talks with him from between the bedclothes i don't think friend nicholas is a very devout christian by the by for he said one or two things which i should have taken seriously had i been what he thinks i am but which had an audacious ironical sound to my sympathetic sceptical ears how funny was that story about the archimandrite of czernovitch thursday afternoon my haste to be out of bed precipitated me back again into it but the actual pain has been small i have grown very friendly with nicholas alexandrovitch and he has promised to spend the evening with me i am better now in body though still troubled in mind paul's silence has brought a new anxiety he has not written for twelve days what can be the matter with him i suppose he is overworking himself and now to hunt up my best cigarettes for monsieur le medecin strange that illness should perhaps have brought me a friend nothing alas can bring me a confidant pm astounding discovery nicholas alexandrovitch is a jew i don't know how it was but suddenly something was said we looked at each other and then a sort of light flashed across our faces we read the mutual secret in each other's eyes a magnetic impulse linked our hands together in a friendly clasp and we felt that we were brothers and yet nicholas is a whole world apart from me in feeling and conviction how strange and mysterious is this latent brotherhood which binds our race together through all differences of rank country and even faith for nicholas is an agnostic of agnostics he is even further removed from sympathy with my new found faith than the ordinary christian and yet my sympathy with him is not only warmer than but different in kind from that which i feel toward any christian even caterina's brother i have told him all yes little book him also have i told all and he sneers at me but there lurks more fraternity in his sneer than in a christian's applause we are knit below the surface like two ocean rocks whose isolated crests rise above the waters nicholas laughs at there being any judaism to survive or anything in judaism worth surviving he declares that the chosen people have been chosen for the plaything of the fates fed with illusions and windy conceit and rewarded for their fidelity with torture and persecution he pities them as he would pity a dog that wanders round its master's grave and will not eat for grief in fact save for this pity he is even as i was until these new emotions rent me he is outwardly a christian because he could not live comfortably otherwise but he has nothing but contempt for the poor peasants whose fever wrung brows he touches with a woman's hand he looks upon them only as a superior variety of cattle and upon the well to do people here as animals with all the vices of the muzhiks and none of their virtues for my judaic cravings he has a good natured mockery and tells me i was but sickening for this influenza he says all my symptoms are physical not spiritual that the loss of caterina depressed me that this depression drove me into solitude and that this solitude in its turn reacted on my depression he thinks that religion is a secretion of morbid minds and that my judaism will vanish again with the last traces of my influenza and indeed there is much force in what he says and much truth in his diagnosis and analysis of my condition he advises me to take plenty of outdoor exercise and to go back again to one of the great towns to go back to judaism to ally one's self with an outcast race and a dying religion is he thinks an act of folly only paralleled by its inutility the world will outgrow all these forms and prejudices in time is his confident assurance as he puffs tranquilly at his cigarette and sips his chartreuse he points out what is true enough that i am not alone in my dissent from the religion i profess for as he epigrammatically puts it the greatest raskolniks are the orthodox the religious statistics of the procurator of the state synod are indeed a poor index to the facts well there is comfort in being damned in company i do not agree with him on any other point but he has done me good the black cloud is partially lifted perhaps the trouble was only physical after all i feel brighter and calmer than for months past anyhow if i am to become a jew again i can think it out quietly even if i could bear paul's contempt there would always be as nicholas points out great peril for me in renouncing the orthodox faith true it would be easy enough to bribe the priest and the authorities and to continue to receive my eucharistical certificate but where is the sacrifice in that it is hypocrisy exchanged for hypocrisy and then what would become of paul's prospects if it were known his father was a zhit but i cannot think of all this now paul's silence is beginning to fill me with a frightful uneasiness a presentiment of evil weighs upon me my dear dove my dusha paul friday afternoon still no letter from paul can anything have happened i have written to him briefly informing him that i have been unwell i shall ride to zlotow and telegraph if i do not hear in a day or two saturday morning all petty and stupid thoughts of my own spiritual condition are swallowed up in the thought of paul ever selfish i have allowed him to dwell alone in a far off city exposed to all the vicissitudes of life perhaps he is ill perhaps he is half starved on his journalistic pittance saturday night a cruel disappointment a letter came but it was only from my man of business advising investment in some south american loan have given him carte blanche of what use is my money to me even paul couldn't spend it now with the training i have given him he is only fitted for the cowl he may yet join the black clergy why does he not write my poor st paul sunday obedient to the insistent clamour of the bells i accompanied nicholas alexandrovitch to church and mechanically asked help of the virgin at the street corner for i have gone back into my old indifference as nicholas predicted i have given the necessary orders the paracladnoi is ready to morrow i go to zlotow thence i take the train for moscow he will not tell me the truth if i wire the weather is bitterly cold and the stoves here are so small i am shivering again but a glass of vodka will put me right a knock clara petroffskovna has run to the door who can it be paul monday afternoon no it was not paul only nicholas alexandrovitch he had heard in the village that i was making preparations for a journey and came to inquire about it and to reproach me for not telling him he looked relieved when i told him it was only to moscow to look after paul i fancy he thought i had had a fit of remorse for my morning's devotions and was off to seek readmission into the fold except our innkeeper there is not a jew in this truly god forsaken place of course i don't reckon myself or the doctor i wonder if our pope is a jew i laugh but who knows anyhow i am here wrapped in my thickest fur cloak while it is nicholas who is on the road to moscow he spoke truly in saying i was too weak yet to undertake the journey that springless paracladnoi alone is enough to knock a healthy man up though whether he was equally veracious in professing to have business to transact in moscow i cannot say da he is a good fellow is my brother nicholas to morrow i shall know if anything has happened to my son to my only child tuesday night thank god a wire from nicholas have seen paul no cause for uneasiness will write blessings on you my friend for the trouble you have taken for me i feel much better already paul has i suppose been throwing himself heart and soul into this new journalistic work and has forgotten his loving father after all it is only a fortnight though it has seemed months anyhow he will write i shall hear from him in a day or two now but a sudden thought will write who will write paul or nicholas oh paul paul without doubt nicholas has told him of my anxiety yes to morrow night or the next morning i shall have a letter from paul all is well if i were to tell paul the truth i wonder what he would say i am afraid i shall never know thursday noon a letter from nicholas i cannot do better than place it here my dear demetrius i hope you got my telegram and are at ease again i had a lively journey up here travelling in company with a government employe who is very proud of his country and of the stanislaus cross round his neck such a pompous ass i have never met he beats even our friend prince shoubinoff in his sunday clothes with the barina on his arm as you may imagine i drew him out like a telescope i have many a droll story for you when i return to come to paul i made it my business at once to call upon the publishers it is one of the largest firms here and from them i learnt that your son was still at the same address in the kitai gorod as that given in the first and only letter you have had from him i did not care about going there direct for i thought it best that he should be unaware of my presence in case there should be anything which it would be advisable for me to find out for your information however by haunting the neighbourhood of the offices of his newspaper i caught sight of him within a couple of hours he has a somewhat over wrought expression in his countenance and does not look particularly well i fancy he is exciting himself about the production of his book he has not seen me yet nor shall i let him see me till i ascertain that he is not in any trouble it is only his silence to you that makes me fancy something may be the matter otherwise i should unhesitatingly put down his pallor and intensity of expression to over work and perhaps religious fervour he went straight to the petrovski cathedral on leaving the offices i am here for a few days longer and will write again it is frightfully cold the thermometer is at freezing point i sit in my shuba and shiver au revoir nicholas alexandrovitch there is something not quite satisfying about this letter it looks as if there was more beneath the surface paul is evidently looking ill or ecstatic or both but at any rate my main anxiety is allayed i can wait with more composure for nicholas's second letter but why does not the boy write himself he must have got the letter telling him i had been unwell and yet not a word of sympathy i don't half like nicholas's idea of playing the spy though as if my son is not to be trusted what can he suspect but nicholas alexandrovitch dearly loves to invent a mystery for the sake of ferreting it out these scientific men are so sharp that they often cut themselves friday afternoon at last paul has written my darling papasha i am surprised you should be anxious about me i am quite comfortable here and have now conquered all the difficulties that beset me at the first how came you to allow yourself to be unwell i hope nicholas alexandrovitch is taking care of you by the by i almost thought i saw him here this morning on the bridge looking over into the reka but there was a church procession and i had hurried past the man before the thought struck me and the odds were so much against its being our zemski doktor that i would not trouble to turn back i have already corrected the proofs of several sheets of my book it will be dedicated by special permission to archbishop varenkin my articles in the courier are attracting considerable attention i have left orders for the publishers to send you my last which will appear to morrow may the holy mother and the saints watch over you your devoted son paul ps i am making more money than i want and i shall be glad to send you some if you have any wants unsupplied my darling boy how could i ever have felt myself alienated from you i will come to you and live with you and share your triumphs no miserable scruples shall divide our lives any more the past is ineradicable the future is its inevitable fruit so be it my spiritual yearnings and wrestlings were but the outcome of a morbid physical condition nicholas was right and now to read my son's article which i have here marked with a blue border why should i with my superficial ponderings be right and he wrong saturday night i have a vague remembrance that three stars marked the close of the sabbath and here in the frosty sky i see a whole host scintillating in the immeasurable depths the sabbath is over and once more i drag myself to my writing desk to pour out the anguish of a tortured spirit all day i have sat as in a dumb trance gazing out beyond the izbas and the cabbage fields toward the eternal hills how beautiful and peaceful everything is god wilt thou not impart to me the secret of peace little did i divine what awaited my eyes when they rested fondly on the first sentence of paul's article voi it was a pronouncement on the jewish question venomous scathing mordant terrific it was an indictment of the race lit up with all the glow of moral indignation cruel and slanderous yet noble and righteous in its tone and ideals base as hell yet pure as heaven breathing a savagery as of torquemada and a saintliness as of tolstoi paul in every line my own noble bigoted wrong headed paul as i read it my whole frame trembled a corresponding passion and indignation stirred my blood to fever heat all my slumbering jewish instincts woke again to fresh life and i knew myself for the weak miserable wretch that i am to think that a son of mine should thus vilify his own race what can i do bozhe moi what can i do how can i stop this horrible unnatural thing i dare not open paul's eyes to what he is doing and yet it is my duty it is my duty by that token i know i shall not do it heaven have pity on me tuesday heaven have pity on paul here is nicholas's promised letter dear demetrius i have strange news for you it is quite providential i use the word without prejudice as the lawyers say that i came here but all is well now so you may read what follows without alarm last thursday morning during my purposeful wanderings within paul's usual circuit i came face to face with our young gentleman his eyes stared straight at me without seeing me his face was ghastly white and the lines were rigid as if with some stern determination his lips were moving but i could not catch his mutterings he held a sealed letter in his hand i saw the superscription it was addressed to you instantly the dread came to my mind that he was about to commit suicide and that this was his farewell to you i followed him he posted the letter at the post office turned back threaded his way like a somnambulist across the bridge without however approaching the parapet walked mechanically onward to his own apartments put the latch key into the house door and then fell back in a dead faint into my arms i took him upstairs explained what had happened put him to bed and i write this from the bedside for the crisis is over now the brain fever has abated and he has now nothing to do but to get well though he will be longer about it than a young fellow of his age has a right to be his body is emaciated with fasts and vigils and penances i curse religion when i look at him as if the struggle for life were not hard enough without humanity being hampered by these miserable superstitions but you will be wanting to know what is the matter well batiushka what should be the matter but the old old matter la femme is strange to relate a fine specimen of our own race of lovely women my dear demetrius she is a jewess of the most orthodox family in moscow and therein lies the crux of the situation i am not playing upon words but the phrase is doubly significant here of course paul has not the slightest idea i know all this but of course i have had it from his hot lips all the same as far as i have been able to piece his broken utterances together they have had some stolen love passages each followed by swift remorse on both sides and another furtive love passage paul has been comparing himself to st anthony and even to jesus when satan ce chef admirable spread a first class dinner in the wilderness but the poor lad must have suffered much behind all his heroics and what his final resolution to give her up cost him is pretty evident i suppose he must have told you of it in that letter isn't it the oddest thing in the world rachel jacobvina is the girl's name and her people keep a clothes' store round the corner and her father is the parnass you will remember what that means of his synagogue she is a sweet little thing and paul evidently has a taste for other belles than belles lettres from what you told me of him i fully expected this sort of thing the poor fellow is looking at me now from among his iced bandages with a piteous air of resignation to the will of nicholas alexandrovitch in bringing him back to this world of trouble when he already felt his wings sprouting poor paul he little dreams what i am writing but he will get over this and marry some fair blue eyed circassian with corresponding tastes in fasting and an enthusiastic longing for the kingdom of god when the year shall be a perpetual lent in his failure to realize history he thinks it a crime to adore a jewish virgin though he spends half his time in adoring the madonna how shocked he would be if i pointed this out people who look through ecclesiastical spectacles so rarely realize that the holy family was a jewish one but my pen is running away with me and our patient looks thirsty proshchai nicholas ps there is not the slightest danger of a relapse unless the image of this diabolical girl comes before him again and i keep his attention distracted besides he had finally conquered his passion this illness was at once the seal and the witness of his unchangeable resolve i have heard him repeat the terms of the letter of farewell he sent her it was final so this was the meaning of your silence this the tragedy that lay behind your simple sentence i have now conquered all the difficulties which beset me at the first this was the motive that guided your hand to write those bitter lines about our race so that you might henceforth cut yourself off from the possibility of allying yourself with it even in thought i understand all now my poor high mettled boy how you must have suffered how your pride must have rebelled at the idea that you might have to make such a confession to me little knowing i should have hailed it with delight that temptation should have assailed you too at such a period when you were publishing your great work on the ideals of holy russia mysterious indeed are the ways of providence and yet why may not all be well after all and heaven grant me such grace as i would willingly sacrifice my life to deserve it is impossible that my son's passion can be utterly dead such fires are only covered up i will go to him and tell him all the news that he is a jew will revolutionize him his love will flame up afresh and take on the guise and glamour of duty love posing as logic will whisper in his ear that no bars of early training can avail to keep him from the race to which he belongs by blood and by his father's faith in this girl's eyes he will read god's message of command and i god's message of peace and reconciliation the tears are in my eyes i can hardly see to write the happiness i foresee is too great blessings on your sweet face rachel jacobvina my own darling daughter that is to be to you is allotted the blessed task of solving a fearful problem of rescuing and reuniting two human lives yes heaven is indeed merciful to morrow i start for moscow thursday how can i write it no there is no pity in heaven the sky smiles in steely blankness the air cuts like a knife paul is well or as well as a convalescent can be he must have had a heart of ice but it is fortunate he had seeing what the icy fates have wrought i arrived at moscow and hurried in a droshky across the well known bridge to paul's lodgings a ghastly procession stopped me some burlaks were bearing the corpse of a young girl who had thrown herself into the ice laden river a clammy foreboding gathered at my heart but ere i had time to say a word an old caftan clad man with agonized eyes and a white streaming beard dashed up pulled off the face cloth revealing a strange weird loveliness uttered a scream which yet rings in my ears threw himself passionately on the body rose up again murmured something solemnly and resignedly in hebrew rent his garments readjusted the face cloth and followed weeping in the rear and from lip to lip that for once forgot to curl in scorn flew the murmur rachel jacobvina saturday night i slouched into the synagogue this morning the cynosure of suspicious eyes i nearly uncovered my head in forgetfulness somebody offered me a talith which i wrapped round myself with marked awkwardness the service moved me beyond measure i have neither the pen nor the will to describe my sensations i was a youth again the intervening decades faded away rachel's father said the kaddish the peace of god has touched my soul paul is asleep i have made nicholas take his much needed rest i am reading the hebrew psalms the language comes back to me bit by bit monday paul is sitting up reading proofs i have been to condole with rachel's father as he sat mourning upon the ground i explained that i was a stranger in the town and had heard of the accident i have given five hundred roubles to the synagogue the whole congregation is buzzing with the generosity of the rich jewish farmer from the country fortunately there is no danger of paul hearing anything of my doings he is a prisoner and nicholas and myself keep watch over him by turns tuesday i have just come from a meeting of the palestine colonization society heavens what ideals burn in these breasts supposed to throb only with cupidity and cunning their souls still turn to the orient as the needle turns to the pole and how the better off among them pity their weaker brethren with what enthusiasm they plot and plan to get them beyond the frontier into freer countries but chiefly into the centre of all jewish aspiration the holy land how they wept when i doubled their finances at a stroke my poor much wronged brethren odessa monday it is almost a year since i closed this book and now after a period of peace i am driven to it again paul has made an irruption into my tranquil household for eleven months now i have lived in this little two storied house overlooking the roadstead with isaac and the ekonomka for my sole companions so long as i could pour my troubles into the ear of the venerable old rabbi who was starving for material sustenance when i took him as i was for spiritual so long i had no need of you my old confidant but this visit of paul has reopened all my sores i have smuggled the rabbi out of the way but even if he were here he could not understand the terrible situation the god of israel alone knows what i feel at having to deny him at having to hide my faith from my own son he must not stay the new year is nigh with its feasts and fasts moreover surrounded as one is by spies paul's presence here may lead to discoveries that i am not what the authorities imagine perhaps it would have been better if i had gone back to the village but no there was that church going a village is so small in this great and bustling seaport i am lost or comparatively so a few roubles in the ecclesiastical palm and complete oblivion settles on me to night i shall know to what i owe this sudden visit paul is radiant he plays with his untold news like a child with a new toy he drops all sorts of mysterious hints he frisks around me like a fond spaniel but he reserves his tit bit for to night when the tramp of the sailors and the perambulating peasantry shall have died away and we shall be seated cosily in my study smoking our cigarettes and looking out toward the quiet lights of the shipping of course it is good news heaven help me i fear paul's good news good news that paul has come all the way from st petersburg to tell me which only his own lips may tell me must if past omens speak truly be terrible god grant i may survive the telling what a coward i am have i not long since made up my mind that paul must go his way and i mine what difference then can his news make to me he will never know now that i am a zhit unless he hears it from my dying lips as i utter the declaration of the unity i made up my mind to that when i came here paul threatens to make his mark as a writer on theological subjects to tell him the truth would only sadden him and do him no good while to reveal my own judaism to the world would but serve to damage him and injure his prospects this may seem but a cover for my cowardice for my fear of state reprisals but it is true for all that bozhe moi is it not punishment enough not to be able to join my brethren in their worship i must remain here where i am unknown practising my religion unostentatiously and in secret the sense of being in a jewish city satisfies my soul we are here more than a fourth of the population house rent and fuel are very dear but we thrive and prosper thanks to god i give to our poor through isaac but they hardly want my help i rejoice in the handsome synagogues though i dare not enter them yes i am best here why be upset by my boy's visit paul will tell me his news i shall congratulate him he will go back to the capital and all will be as before monday midnight no all can never be as before one last step remained to divide our lives to all eternity voi paul has taken it all came off as arranged we sat together at my window it was a glorious night and a faint fresh wind blew in from the sea the lights in the harbour twinkled the stars glistened in the sky but as paul told me his good news the whole horizon was one great flame before my eyes he began by recapitulating though with fuller details than was possible by letter what i knew pretty well already the story of the great success of his book which had been reviewed in all the theological magazines of europe and had gone through four editions in the year and been translated into german and italian the story of how he had been encouraged to come to st petersburg and how he had prospered on the press there and then came the grand news he was offered the editorship of the novoe vremia the great st petersburg paper in an instant i realized all it meant and in my horror i almost fainted paul would direct this famous government and anti semitic organ paul would pen day after day those envenomed leaders goading on the mob to turn and rend their jewish fellow citizens denying them the rights of human beings paul would direct the flood of sarcasm and misrepresentation poured forth day after day upon my inoffensive brethren the old anguish with which i had read that article a year ago returned to me but not the old tempest of wrath by sheer force of will i kept myself calm a great issue was at stake and i nerved myself for the contest paul said i you are a lucky fellow i kissed him on the brow with icy lips he saw my great emotion but felt it was but natural da said he i am a lucky fellow it is a great thing few men have had such an opportunity at twenty five nutchozh and how do you propose to utilize it i asked och i must conduct the paper on the same general lines he said of course with improvements amongst the latter the omission of the anti semitic bias i hope he stared at me certainly not the proprietors make its continuance on the same general lines a condition they are very good they even guard me against possible prosecutions by paying a handsome salary to a man of straw ish lui it is a fine berth that i've got should i tell him the thing was impossible that he was a jew no time for that when all other means had failed och you have accepted it i said of course i have father why should i give them time to change their minds i should have thought you would have consulted me first nu uzh i have never consulted you yet about accepting work he said in a wondering disappointed tone nuka but this puts you finally into a career does it not certainly that is why i accepted it and i thought you would be glad that is why you should have refused it but i am glad all the same i do not understand you father nuka golubtchik listen i said in my most endearing tone drawing my arm round his neck your struggles for existence were but struggles for the sake of the struggle you are not as other young men you have succeeded and the moment you win the prize is the moment for retiring gracefully leaving it in the hands of him who needs it your fight was but a game i allowed you to play you are rich rich rich nearly all my life i have been a wealthy man i own land in every part of russia i hold shares in all the most successful companies i have kept this knowledge from you so that you might enjoy your riches more when you knew the truth rich he repeated the word again in a dazed tone ach why did i not know this before you had not succeeded you had not had your experience my son my dearest paul but now your work is over or rather your true work begins freed from the detestable routine of a newspaper office you shall write your books and work out your ideas at leisure and relieved from all material considerations da it would have been a beautiful ideal once he said then added fiercely rich and i did not know it but you were the happier for your ignorance no father the struggle is too terrible often have i sat and wept ish lui time after time my book destined as it was to success came back to me from the publishers and i could have produced it myself all along pangs of remorse agitated me had my plan been indeed a failure but you have the pride of unhelped success and the bitter memories and once he paused once i said once i loved a girl she is dead now so it doesn't matter there were many and complicated obstacles to our union with money they would have been overcome poor boy i said wonderingly for i knew nothing of this apparently new love episode forgive me my son if i have acted mistakenly anyhow from this moment your happiness is my sole care no he said with sudden determination it is too late now you meant it for the best papasha but i do not want the money now i have money of my own and glory why should i give up what my own hands have won because i ask it of you paul because i ask you to allow me to make reparation for the mischief i have done the truest reparation will be to let things go unrepaired he said with a touch of sarcasm i shall be happier as editor of this paper what finer medium for my ideas than a great newspaper what more potent lever to my hand for raising holy russia to a yet higher plane no father let bygones be bygones give my share of your wealth to a society for helping struggling talent i struggle no longer leave me to go on in the path my pen has carved out i fell at his feet and begged him to let me have my way but some obstinate demon seemed to have taken possession of his breast i opened my desk and showered bank notes upon him he spurned them and one flew out into the night neither of us put out a hand to arrest its flight i saw that nothing but the truth had any chance to alter his resolve but i played one more card before resorting to this dangerous weapon listen my own dearest paul i burst out if money will not tempt you let a father's petition persuade you learn then that i dread your taking this position because you will perpetually have to attack the jews as they deserve he put in be it so but i i have a kindness for this oppressed race he looked at me in silence as if awaiting further explanation i gave it blurting out the shameful lie with ill concealed confusion once upon a time i i loved a jewess i could not marry her of course but ever since that time i have had a soft place in my heart for her unhappy race a look of surprise flashed into paul's eyes then his face grew tender he took my hand in his father we have a common sorrow he said the girl i spoke of was a jewess how i exclaimed surprised in my turn it was the same affair then yes she was a jewess but i taught her the truth christ was revealed to her prisoned soul she would have fled with me if we had had the means and if i had been able to support her in some other country but she did not dare be baptized and stay in moscow or anywhere near she said her father would have killed her the only alternative was for me to embrace judaism impossible as you may think it father and i confess it to my eternal shame at the very period i was correcting the proofs of my book i was wrestling with a temptation to embrace this satanic heresy but i conquered the temptation it was easy to conquer to renounce the faith which was my blessed birthright would as you know have cost me dear selfishness warred for once on the side of salvation rachel wished to fly with me i knew she would have been poor and unhappy i refused to take advantage of her girlish impetuousness i heard afterward that she had drowned herself the tears rained down his cheeks we had arranged to wait till i could save a stock of money voi the delay undid us one day rachel's father called on me he had got wind of our secret he fell at my feet and tore his hair and wept and conjured me not to darken his home and his life a jewess could only wed a jew he said if i had only been born a jew all would have been well but his rachel had perhaps talked of becoming a christian did i not know that was impossible as well expect the sheep to howl like the wolf blood was thicker than baptismal water her heart would always cleave to her own religion and was my love so blind as not to see that even if she spoke of christianity it was only to please me that she only kissed the crucifix that i might kiss her and knelt to the virgin that i might kneel to her at home he swore it with fearful oaths she was always bitterly sarcastic at the expense of the true faith i believed him my god i believed him for at times i had feared it myself i would be no party to such carnal blasphemy and charged him with a note of farewell when he went i felt as if i had escaped from a terrible temptation i fell on my knees and thanked the saints but why did you not tell me this at the time i cried in intolerable anguish nu to what end it would only have worried you i did not know you were rich and at this time you offered to send me money i said with sudden recollection since i had not enough you might as well have some of it anyhow father you see all this has made no difference to me i shall never marry now of course but it hasn't altered the opinion i have always had of the jews rather corroborated it rachel told me enough of the superstitious slavery amid which she was forced to live i have no doubt now that her father lied but for his pigheaded tribalism rachel would have been alive to day so why your love for a jewish girl should make you tender to the race i do not see dearest father there are always exceptions to everything rachel was one the woman you loved was another and now it is very late i think i will go to bed he kissed me and went out at the door then he came back and put his head inside again a sweet sad winning smile lit up his pale thoughtful face i will put you on the free list of the novoe vremia father he said good night papasha what could i say what could i do i called up a smile to my trembling lips good night paul i said i shall never tell him now tuesday am i reopen these pages to note an ironic climax to this bitter day through the excitement of paul's coming i had not read my letters after sitting here in a numb trance for hours i suddenly bethought me of them one is from my business man informing me that he has just sold the south american stock respecting which i gave him carte blanche i go to bed richer by five thousand roubles odessa wednesday night six months have passed i am on the free list of the novoe vremia almost every day brings me a fresh stab as i read but i am a constant reader it is my penance and i bear it as such after a long silence i have just had a letter from nicholas alexandrovitch and i reopen my diary to note it he is about to marry a prosperous widow and is going over to catholicism he writes he is very happy lucky soulless being he does not know he will be a richer man when i die happily i am ready though it were to day my peace is made i hope with god and man though paul knows nothing even now he could not fail to learn it though if he came to odessa again i have bribed the spies and the clergy heavily thanks to their silence i am one of the most prominent jews of the town and nobody dreams of connecting me with the trenchant editor of the novoe vremia i see now that i could have acted so all along if i had not been such a coward but i keep paul away it is my last cowardice in a postscript nicholas writes that paul's articles are causing a great sensation in the remotest parts of russia alas i know it are there not anti jewish riots in all parts encouraged by cruel government measures do not the local newspapers everywhere reproduce paul's printed firebrands have i not the pleasure of coming across them again in our own odessa papers in the wiertnik and the listok i should not wonder if we had an outbreak here there was a little affray yesterday in the pereouloks of the jewish quarter though we are quiet enough down this way great god what is that noise i hear yes it is it is down with the zhits down with the zhits there is red on the horizon bozhe moi it is flame voi they are pillaging the jewish quarter the sun sinks in blood as on that unhappy day among the village hills ach paul paul why did i not stop your murderous pen but if not you another would have written no that is no excuse forgive me o god i have been weak ever weak and cowardly from the day i first deserted thee even unto this day i am not worthy of my blood of my race they are coming this way it goes through me like a knife down with the zhits down with the zhits and now i see them they are mad drunk with the vodka they have stolen from the jewish inns great god they have knives and guns and their leader is flourishing a newspaper and shouting out something from it there are soldiers among them and sailors native and foreign and mad muzhiks where are the police the mob is passing under my window god pity me it is paul's words they are shouting they have passed no one thinks of me thank god i am safe i am safe from these demons what a narrow escape ah god they have captured rabbi isaac and are dragging him along by his white beard toward the barracks my place is by his side i will rouse my brethren we are not a few we will turn on these dogs and rend them proshchai my loved diary farewell i go to proclaim the unity footnotes in order to preserve the local colour the translator has occasionally left a word or phrase of the ms in the original russian dissenters x incurable x incurable cast off among the dead like the slain that lie in the grave whom thou rememberest no more and they are cut off from thy hand thou hast laid me in the lowest pit in dark places in the deeps thy wrath lieth hard upon me and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me thou hast made me an abomination unto them i am shut up and i cannot come forth mine eye wasteth away by reason of affliction i have called daily upon thee o lord i have spread forth my hands unto thee eighty eighth psalm there was a restless air about the refuge in a few minutes the friends of the patients would be admitted the incurables would hear the latest gossip of the ghetto for the world was still very much with these abortive lives avid of sensations jewish to the end it was an unpretentious institution two corner houses knocked together near the east lung of london supported mainly by the poor at a penny a week and scarcely recognized by the rich so that paraplegia and vertigo and rachitis and a dozen other hopeless diseases knocked hopelessly at its narrow portals but it was a model institution all the same and the patients lacked for nothing except freedom from pain there was even a miniature synagogue for their spiritual needs with the women's compartment religiously railed off from the men's as if these grotesque ruins of sex might still distract each other's devotions yet the rabbis knew human nature the sprightly hydrocephalous paralytic leah had had the chair she inhabited carried down into the men's sitting room to beguile the moments and was smiling fascinatingly upon the deaf blind man who had the braille bible at his fingers' ends and read on as stolidly as st anthony mad mo had strolled vacuously into the ladies' ward and indifferent to the pretty white aproned christian nurses was loitering by the side of a weird hatchet faced cripple with a stiletto shaped nose supporting big spectacles like most of the patients she was up and dressed only a few of the white pallets ranged along the walls were occupied leah says she'd be quite happy if she could walk like you said mad mo in complimentary tones she always says milly walks so beautiful she says you can walk the whole length of the garden milly huddled in her chair smiled miserably you're crying again rebecca protested a dark eyed bright faced dwarf in excellent english as she touched her friend's withered hand you are in the blues again why that page is all blistered no i feel so nice said the sad eyed russian in her quaint musical accent you sall not tink i cry because i am not happy ven i read sad tings like my life den only i am happy the dwarf gave a short laugh that made her pendent earrings oscillate i thought you were brooding over your love affairs she said me cried rebecca i lost too young my leg to be in love no it is psalm eighty eight dat i brood over 'i am afflicted and ready to die from my yout' up' yes i vas only a girl ven i had to go to koenigsberg to find a doctor to cut off my leg 'lover and friend hast dou put far from me and mine acquaintance into darkness' her face shone ecstatic hush whispered the dwarf with a warning nudge and a slight nod in the direction of a neighbouring waterbed on which a pale rigid middle aged woman lay with shut sleepless eyes se cannot understand englis' said the russian girl proudly don't be so sure look how the nurses here have picked up yiddish rebecca shook her head incredulously sarah is a polis' woman she said for years dey are in england and dey learn noting ick bin krank krank krank suddenly moaned a shrivelled polish grandmother an advanced centenarian as if to corroborate the girl's contention she was squatting monkey like on her bed every now and again murmuring her querulous burden of sickness and jabbering at the nurses to shut all the windows fresh air she objected to as vehemently as if it were butter or some other heterodox dainty hard upon her crooning came bloodcurdling screams from the room above sounds that reminded the visitor he was not in a barnum show that the monstrosities were genuine pretty sister margaret not yet indurated thrilled with pity as before her inner vision rose the ashen perspiring face of the palsied sufferer who sat quivering all the long day in an easy chair her swollen jelly like hands resting on cotton wool pads an air pillow between her knees her whole frame racked at frequent intervals by fierce spasms of pain her only diversion faint blurred reflections of episodes of the street in the glass of a framed picture yet morbidly suspicious of slow poison in her drink and cursed with an incurable vitality meantime sarah lay silent bitter thoughts moving beneath her white impassive face like salt tides below a frozen surface it was a strong stern face telling of a present of pain and faintly hinting at a past of prettiness she seemed alone in the populated ward and indeed the world was bare for her most of her life had been spent in the warsaw ghetto where she was married at sixteen nineteen years before her only surviving son a youth whom the english atmosphere had not improved had sailed away to trade with the kaffirs and her husband had not been to see her for a fortnight when the visitors began to arrive her torpor vanished she eagerly raised the half of her that was not paralyzed partially sitting up but gradually expectation died out of her large gray eyes there was a buzz of talk in the room the hydrocephalous girl was the gay centre of a group the polish grandmother who cursed her grandchildren when they didn't come and when they did was denouncing their neglect of her to their faces everybody had somebody to kiss or quarrel with one or two acquaintances approached the bed ridden wife too but she would speak no word too proud to ask after her husband and wincing under the significant glances occasionally cast in her direction by and by she had the red screen placed round her bed which gave her artificial walls and a quasi privacy her husband would know where to look for her woe is me wailed her centenarian country woman rocking to and fro what sin have i committed to get such grandchildren you only come to see if the old grandmother isn't dead yet so sick so sick so sick twilight filled the wards the white beds looked ghostly in the darkness the last visitor departed sarah's husband had not yet come he is not well mrs kretznow sister margaret ventured to say in her best yiddish or he is busy working work is not so slack any more alone in the institution she shared sarah's ignorance of the kretznow scandal talk of it died before her youth and sweetness he would have written said sarah sternly he is awearied of me i have lain here a year job's curse is on me shall i to him sister margaret paused to excogitate the yiddish word write no he hears me knocking at his heart they had flashes of strange savage poetry these crude yet complex souls sister margaret who was still liable to be startled murmured feebly but leave me in peace with a cry like that of a wounded animal the matron gently touched the novice's arm and drew her away i will write to him she whispered night fell but sleep fell only for some sarah kretznow tossed in a hell of loneliness ah surely her husband had not forgotten her surely she would not lie thus till death that far off death her strong religious instinct would forbid her hastening she had gone into the refuge to save him the constant sight of her helplessness and the cost of her keep was she now to be cut off forever from the sight of his strength the next day he came by special invitation his face was sallow rimmed with swarthy hair his under lip was sensuous he hung his head half veiling the shifty eyes sister margaret ran to tell his wife sarah's face sparkled put up the screen she murmured and in its shelter drew her husband's head to her bosom and pressed her lips to his hair but he surprised into indiscretion murmured i thought thou wast dying a beautiful light came into the gray eyes thy heart told thee right herzel my life i was dying for a sight of thee but the matron wrote to me pressingly he blurted out he felt her breast heave convulsively under his face with her hands she thrust him away god's fool that i am i should have known to day is not visiting day they have compassion on me they see my sorrows it is public talk his pulse seemed to stop they have talked to thee of me he faltered i did not ask their pity but they saw how i suffered one cannot hide one's heart they have no right to talk he muttered in sulky trepidation they have every right she rejoined sharply if thou hadst come to see me even once why hast thou not i i have been travelling in the country with cheap jewellery the tailoring is so slack look me in the eyes law of moses no it is a lie god shall forgive thee why hast thou not come i have told thee tell that to the sabbath fire woman why hast thou not come is it so very much to spare me an hour or two a week if i could go out like some of the patients i would come to thee but i have tired thee out utterly no no sarah he murmured uneasily then why he was covered with shame and confusion his face was turned away i did not like to come he said desperately why not crimson patches came and went on her white cheeks her heart beat madly surely thou canst understand understand what i speak of green and thou answerest of blue i answer as thou askest thou answerest not at all no answer is also an answer he snarled driven to bay thou understandest well enough thyself saidst it was public talk ah h h in a stifled shriek of despair her intuition divined everything the shadowy sinister suggestions she had so long beat back by force of will took form and substance her head fell back on the pillow the eyes closed he stayed on bending awkwardly over her so sick so sick so sick moaned the wizened grandmother thou sayest they have compassion on thee in their talk he murmured at last half deprecatingly half resentfully have they none on me her silence chilled him but thou hast compassion sarah he urged thou understandest presently she reopened her eyes thou art not gone she murmured no thou seest i am not tired of thee sarah my life only wilt thou wash my skin and not make me wet she interrupted bitterly go home go home to her i will not go home then go under like korah he shuffled out that night her lonely hell was made lonelier by the opening of a peep hole into paradise a paradise of adam and eve and forbidden fruit for days she preserved a stony silence toward the sympathy of the inmates of what avail words against the flames of jealousy in which she writhed he lingered about the passage on the next visiting day vaguely remorseful but she would not see him so he went away vaguely indignant and his new housemate comforted him and he came no more when you lie on your back all day and all night you have time to think especially if you do not sleep a situation presents itself in many lights from dawn to dusk and from dusk to dawn one such light flashed on the paradise and showed it to her as but the portico of purgatory her husband would be damned in the next world even as she was in this his soul would be cut off from among its people on this thought she brooded till it loomed horribly in her darkness and at last she dictated a letter to the matron asking herzel to come and see her he obeyed and stood shame faced at her side fidgeting with his peaked cap her hard face softened momentarily at the sight of him her bosom heaved suppressed sobs swelled her throat thou hast sent for me he murmured yes perhaps thou didst again imagine i was on my death bed she replied with bitter irony it is not so sarah i would have come of myself only thou wouldst not see my face i have seen it for twenty years it is another's turn now he was silent it is true all the same i am on my death bed he started a pang shot through his breast he darted an agitated glance at her face is it not so in this bed i shall die but god knows how many years i shall lie in it her calm gave him an uncanny shudder and till the holy one blessed be he takes me thou wilt live a daily sinner i am not to blame god has stricken me i am a young man thou art to blame her eyes flashed fire blasphemer life is sweet to thee yet perchance thou wilt die before me his face grew livid i am a young man he repeated tremulously dost thou forget what rabbi eliezer said 'repent one day before thy death' that is to day for who knows what wouldst thou have me do give up no no he interrupted it is useless i cannot i am so lonely give up she repeated inexorably thy wife what sayest thou my wife but she is not my wife thou art my wife even so give me up give me get divorce his breath failed his heart thumped at the suggestion give thee get he whispered yes why didst thou not send me a bill of divorcement when i left thy home for this he averted his face i thought of it he stammered and then and then he seemed to see a sardonic glitter in the gray eyes i i was afraid afraid she laughed in grim mirthlessness afraid of a bed ridden woman i was afraid it would make thee unhappy the sardonic gleam melted into softness then became more terrible than before and so thou hast made me happy instead stab me not more than i merit i did not think people would be cruel enough to tell thee thine own lips told me nay by my soul he cried startled thine eyes told me then i feared so he said turning them away when she came into my house i i dared not go to see thee that was why i did not come though i always meant to sarah my life i feared to look thee in the eyes i foresaw they would read the secret in mine so i was afraid afraid she repeated bitterly afraid i would scratch them out nay they are good eyes have they not seen my heart for twenty years they have been my light those eyes and mine have seen our children die spasmodic sobs came thickly now swallowing them down she said and she did she not ask thee to give me get nay she was willing to go without she said thou wast as one dead look not thus at me it is the will of god it was for thy sake too sarah that she did not become my wife by law she too would have spared thee the knowledge of her yes ye have both tender hearts she is a mother in israel and thou art a spark of our father abraham thou dost not believe what i say i can disbelieve it and still remain a jewess then satire boiling over into passion she cried vehemently we are threshing empty ears thinkest thou i am not aware of the judgments i the granddaughter of reb shloumi the memory of the righteous for a blessing thinkest thou i am ignorant thou couldst not obtain a get against me me who have borne thee children who have wrought no evil i speak not of the beth din for in this impious country they are loath to follow the judgments and from the english beth din thou wouldst find it impossible to obtain the get in any case even though thou didst not marry me in this country nor according to its laws i speak of our own rabbonim thou knowest even the maggid would not give thee get merely because thy wife is bed ridden that that is what thou wast afraid of but if thou art willing he replied eagerly ignoring her scornful scepticism his readiness to accept the sacrifice was salt upon her wounds thou deservest i should let thee burn in the lowest gehenna she cried the almighty is more merciful than thou he answered it is he that hath ordained it is not good for man to live alone and yet men shun me people talk and she she may leave me to my loneliness again his voice faltered with self pity here thou hast friends nurses visitors i i have nothing true thou didst bear me children but they withered as by the evil eye my only son is across the ocean he hath no love for me or thee the recital of their common griefs softened her toward him go she whispered go and send me the get go to the maggid he knew my grandfather he is the man to arrange it for thee with his friends tell him it is my wish god shall reward thee how can i thank thee for giving thy consent what else have i to give thee my herzel i who eat the bread of strangers truly says the proverb 'when one begs of a beggar the herr god laughs' i will send thee the get as soon as possible thou art right i am a thorn in thine eye pluck me out quickly thou wilt not refuse the get when it comes he replied apprehensively is it not a wife's duty to submit she asked with grim irony nay have no fear thou shalt have no difficulty in serving the get upon me i will not throw it in the messenger's face and thou wilt marry her assuredly people will no longer talk and she must needs bide with me it is my one desire it is mine likewise thou must atone and save thy soul he lingered uncertainly and thy dowry he said at last thou wilt not make claim for compensation be easy i scarce know where my cesubah marriage certificate is what need have i of money as thou sayest i have all i want i do not even desire to purchase a grave lying already so long in a charity grave the bitterness is over he shivered thou art very good to me he said good bye he stooped down she drew the bedclothes frenziedly over her face kiss me not good bye then he stammered god be good to thee he moved away herzel she had uncovered her face with a despairing cry he slouched back toward her perturbed dreading she would retract do not send it bring it thyself let me take it from thy hand a lump rose in his throat i will bring it he said brokenly the long days of pain grew longer the summer was coming harbingered by sunny days that flooded the wards with golden mockery the evening herzel brought the get sarah could have read every word on the parchment plainly if her eyes had not been blinded by tears she put out her hand toward her husband groping for the document he bore he placed it in her burning palm the fingers closed automatically upon it then relaxed and the paper fluttered to the floor but sarah was no longer a wife herzel was glad to hide his burning face by stooping for the fallen bill of divorcement he was long picking it up when his eyes met hers again she had propped herself up in her bed two big round tears trickled down her cheeks but she received the parchment calmly and thrust it into her bosom let it lie there she said stonily there where thy head hath lain blessed be the true judge thou art not angry with me sarah why should i be angry she was right i am but a dead woman only no one may say kaddish for me no one may pray for the repose of my soul i am not angry herzel a wife should light the sabbath candles and throw in the fire the morsel of dough but thy home was desolate there was none to do these things here i have all i need now thou wilt be happy too thou hast been a good wife sarah he murmured touched recall not the past we are strangers now she said with recurrent harshness but i may come and see thee sometimes he had stirrings of remorse as the moment of final parting came wouldst thou reopen my wounds farewell then he put out his hand timidly she seized it and held it passionately yes yes herzel do not leave me come and see me here as a friend an acquaintance a man i used to know the others are thoughtless they forget me i shall lie here perhaps the angel of death will forget me too her grasp tightened till it hurt him acutely yes i will come i will come often he said with a sob of physical pain her clasp loosened she dropped his hand but not till thou art married she said be it so of course thou must have a 'still wedding' the english synagogue will not marry thee the maggid will marry me thou wilt show me her cesubah when thou comest next yes i will contrive to get it from her a week passed he brought the marriage certificate outwardly she was calm she glanced through it god be thanked she said and handed it back they chatted of indifferent things of the doings of the neighbours when he was going she said thou wilt come again yes i will come again thou art so good to spend thy time on me thus but thy wife will she not be jealous he stared bewildered by her strange eerie moments jealous of thee he murmured she took it in its contemptuous sense and her white lips twitched but she only said is she aware thou hast come here he shrugged his shoulders do i know i have not told her tell her as thou wishest there was a pause presently the woman spoke wilt thou not bring her to see me then she will know that thou hast no love left for me he flinched as at a stab after a painful moment he said art thou in earnest i am no marriage jester bring her to me will she not come to see an invalid it is a mitzvah good deed to visit the sick it will wipe out her trespass she shall come she came sarah stared at her for an instant with poignant curiosity then her eyelids drooped to shut out the dazzle of her youth and freshness herzel's wife moved awkwardly and sheepishly but she was beautiful a buxom comely country girl from a russian village with a swelling bust and a cheek rosy with health and confusion sarah's breast was racked by a thousand needles but she found breath at last god bless thee mrs kretznow she said gaspingly she took the girl's hand how good thou art to come and see a sick creature my husband willed it the new wife said in deprecation she had a simple stupid air that did not seem wholly due to the constraint of the strange situation thou wast right to obey be good to him my child for three years he waited on me when i lay helpless he has suffered much be good to him with an impulsive movement she drew the girl's head down to her and kissed her on the lips then with an anguished cry of leave me for to day she jerked the blanket over her face and burst into tears she heard the couple move hesitatingly away the girl's beauty shone on her through the opaque coverings o god she wailed god of abraham isaac and jacob let me die now for the merits of the patriarchs take me soon take me soon her vain passionate prayer muffled by the bedclothes was wholly drowned by ear piercing shrieks from the ward above screams of agony mingled with half articulate accusations of attempted poisoning the familiar paroxysm of the palsied woman who clung to life the thrill passed again through sister margaret she uplifted her sweet humid eyes ah christ she whispered if i could die for her xi the sabbath breaker xi the sabbath breaker the moment came near for the polish centenarian grandmother to die from the doctor's statement it appeared she had only a bad quarter of an hour to live her attack had been sudden and the grandchildren she loved to scold could not be present she had already battled through the great wave of pain and was drifting beyond the boundaries of her earthly refuge the nurses forgetting the trouble her querulousness and her overweening dietary scruples had cost them hung over the bed on which the shrivelled entity lay they did not know she was living again through the one great episode of her life nearly forty years back when though already hard upon seventy and a widow a polish village was all her horizon she received a letter it arrived on the eve of sabbath on a day of rainy summer it was from her little boy her only boy who kept a country inn seven and thirty miles away and had a family she opened the letter with feverish anxiety her son her kaddish was the apple of her eye the old woman eagerly perused the hebrew script from right to left then weakness overcame her and she nearly fell embedded casually enough in the four pages was a passage that stood out for her in letters of blood i am not feeling very well lately the weather is so oppressive and the nights are misty but it is nothing serious my digestion is a little out of order that's all there were roubles for her in the letter but she let them fall to the floor unheeded panic fear travelling quicker than the tardy post of those days had brought rumour of a sudden outbreak of cholera in her son's district already alarm for her boy had surged about her heart all day the letter confirmed her worst apprehensions even if the first touch of the cholera fiend was not actually on him when he wrote still he was by his own confession in that condition in which the disease takes easiest grip by this time he was on a bed of sickness nay perhaps on his death bed if not dead even in those days the little grandmother had lived beyond the common span she had seen many people die and knew that the angel of death does not always go about his work leisurely in an epidemic his hands are too full to enable him to devote much attention to each case maternal instinct tugged at her heart strings drawing her toward her boy the end of the letter seemed impregnated with special omen come and see me soon dear little mother i shall be unable to get to see you for some time yes she must go at once who knew but that it would be the last time she would look upon his face but then came a terrible thought to give her pause the sabbath was just in a moment ago driving riding or any manner of journeying was prohibited during the next twenty four hours frantically she reviewed the situation religion permitted the violation of the sabbath on one condition if life was to be saved by no stretch of logic could she delude herself into the belief her son's recovery hinged upon her presence nay analyzing the case with the cruel remorselessness of a scrupulous conscience she saw his very illness was only a plausible hypothesis no to go to him now were beyond question to profane the sabbath and yet beneath all the reasoning her conviction that he was sick unto death her resolve to set out at once never wavered after an agonizing struggle she compromised she could not go by cart that would be to make others work into the bargain and would moreover involve a financial transaction she must walk sinful as it was to transgress the limit of two thousand yards beyond her village the distance fixed by rabbinical law there was no help for it and of all the forms of travelling walking was surely the least sinful the holy one blessed be he would know she did not mean to work perhaps in his mercy he would make allowance for an old woman who had never profaned his rest day before and so that very evening having made a hasty meal and lodged the precious letter in her bosom the little grandmother girded up her loins to walk the seven and thirty miles no staff took she with her for to carry such came under the talmudical definition of work neither could she carry an umbrella though it was a season of rain mile after mile she strode briskly on toward that pallid face that lay so far beyond the horizon and yet ever shone before her eyes like a guiding star i am coming my lamb she muttered the little mother is on the way it was a muggy night the sky flushed with a weird hectic glamour seemed to hang over the earth like a pall the trees that lined the roadway were shrouded in a draggling vapour at midnight the mist blotted out the stars but the little grandmother knew the road ran straight all night she walked through the forest fearless as una meeting neither man nor beast though the wolf and the bear haunted its recesses and snakes lurked in the bushes but only the innocent squirrels darted across her path the morning found her spent and almost lame but she walked on almost half the journey was yet to do she had nothing to eat with her food too was an illegal burden nor could she buy any on the holy day she said her sabbath morning prayer walking hoping god would forgive the disrespect the recital gave her partial oblivion of her pains as she passed through a village the dreadful rumour of cholera was confirmed it gave wings to her feet for ten minutes then bodily weakness was stronger than everything else and she had to lean against the hedges on the outskirts of the village it was nearly noon a passing beggar gave her a piece of bread fortunately it was unbuttered so she could eat it with only minor qualms lest it had touched any unclean thing she resumed her journey but the rest had only made her feet move more painfully and reluctantly she would have liked to bathe them in a brook but that too was forbidden she took the letter from her bosom and reperused it and whipped up her flagging strength with a cry of courage my lamb the little mother is on the way then the leaden clouds melted into sharp lines of rain which beat into her face refreshing her for the first few moments but soon wetting her to the skin making her sopped garments a heavier burden and reducing the pathway to mud that clogged still further her feeble footsteps in the teeth of the wind and the driving shower she limped on a fresh anxiety consumed her now would she have strength to hold out every moment her pace lessened she was moving like a snail and the slower she went the more vivid grew her prescience of what awaited her at the journey's end would she even hear his dying word perhaps terrible thought she would only be in time to look upon his dead face mayhap that was how god would punish her for her desecration of the holy day take heart my lamb she wailed do not die yet the little mother comes the rain stopped the sun came out hot and fierce and dried her hands and face then made them stream again with perspiration every inch won was torture now but the brave feet toiled on bruised and swollen and crippled they toiled on there was a dying voice very far off yet alas that called to her and as she dragged herself along she replied i am coming my lamb take heart the little mother is on the way courage i shall look upon thy face i shall find thee alive once a wagoner observed her plight and offered her a lift but she shook her head steadfastly the endless afternoon wore on she crawled along the forest way stumbling every now and then from sheer faintness and tearing her hands and face in the brambles of the roadside at last the cruel sun waned and reeking mists rose from the forest pools and still the long miles stretched away and still she plodded on torpid from over exhaustion scarcely conscious and taking each step only because she had taken the preceding from time to time her lips mumbled take heart my lamb i am coming the sabbath was out ere broken and bleeding and all but swooning the little grandmother crawled up to her son's inn on the border of the forest her heart was cold with fatal foreboding there was none of the usual saturday night litter of polish peasantry about the door the sound of many voices weirdly intoning a hebrew hymn floated out into the night a man in a caftan opened the door and mechanically raised his forefinger to bid her enter without noise the little grandmother saw into the room behind her daughter in law and her grandchildren were seated on the floor the seat of mourners blessed be the true judge she said and rent the skirt of her dress when did he die yesterday we had to bury him hastily ere the sabbath came in the little grandmother lifted up her quavering voice and joined the hymn i will sing a new song unto thee o god upon a harp of ten strings will i sing praises unto thee the nurses could not understand what sudden inflow of strength and impulse raised the mummified figure into a sitting posture the little grandmother thrust a shrivelled claw into her peaked shrunken bosom and drew out a paper crumpled and yellow as herself covered with strange crabbed hieroglyphics whose hue had long since faded she held it close to her bleared eyes a beautiful light came into them and illumined the million puckered face the lips moved faintly i am coming my lamb she mumbled courage the little mother is on the way i shall look on thy face i shall find thee alive printed in the united states of america typographical errors corrected in text page stanchness is a legitimate
