merely mary ann by israel zangwill author of children of the ghetto the master etc popular edition london william heinemann mcmxiii first impression september new impressions september twice popular shilling cloth edition the wrapper design is reproduced by special permission from a painting by mr louis loeb of miss eleanor robson the original mary ann merely mary ann i sometimes lancelot's bell rang up mrs leadbatter herself but far more often merely mary ann the first time lancelot saw mary ann she was cleaning the steps he avoided treading upon her being kind to animals for the moment she was merely a quadruped whose head was never lifted to the stars her faded print dress showed like the quivering hide of some crouching animal there were strange irregular splashes of pink in the hide standing out in bright contrast with the neutral background these were scraps of the original material neatly patched in the cold damp steps gave lancelot a shudder for the air was raw he passed by the prostrate figure as quickly as he could and hastened to throw himself into the easy chair before the red fire there was a lamp post before the door so he knew the house from its neighbours baker's terrace as a whole was a defeated aspiration after gentility the more auspicious houses were marked by white stones the steps being scrubbed and hearthstoned almost daily the gloomier doorsteps were black except on sundays thus variety was achieved by houses otherwise as monotonous and prosaic as a batch of fourpenny loaves this was not the reason why the little south london side street was called baker's terrace though it might well seem so for baker was the name of the builder a worthy gentleman whose years and virtues may still be deciphered on a doddering round shouldered stone in a deceased cemetery not far from the scene of his triumphs the second time lancelot saw mary ann he did not remember having seen her before this time she was a biped and wore a white cap besides he hardly glanced at her he was in a bad temper and beethoven was barking terribly at the intruder who stood quaking in the doorway so that the crockery clattered on the tea tray she bore with a smothered oath lancelot caught up the fiery little spaniel and rammed him into the pocket of his dressing gown where he quivered into silence like a struck gong while the girl was laying his breakfast lancelot who was looking moodily at the pattern of the carpet as if anxious to improve upon it was vaguely conscious of relief in being spared his landlady's conversation for mrs leadbatter was a garrulous body who suffered from the delusion that small talk is a form of politeness and that her conversation was a part of the all inclusive her lodgers stipulated for the disease was hereditary her father having been a barber and remarkable for the coolness with which even as a small boy whose function was lathering and nothing more he exchanged views about the weather with his victims the third time lancelot saw mary ann he noticed that she was rather pretty she had a slight well built figure not far from tall small shapely features and something of a complexion this did not displease him she was a little aesthetic touch amid the depressing furniture don't be afraid polly he said more kindly the little devil won't bite he's all bark call him beethoven and throw him a bit of sugar the girl threw beethoven the piece of sugar but did not venture on the name it seemed to her a long name for such a little dog as she timidly took the sugar from the basin by the aid of the tongs lancelot saw how coarse and red her hand was it gave him the same sense of repugnance and refrigescence as the cold damp steps something he was about to say froze on his lips he did not look at mary ann for some days by which time beethoven had conquered his distrust of her though she was still distrustful of beethoven drawing her skirts tightly about her as if he were a rat what forced mary ann again upon lancelot's morose consciousness was a glint of winter sunshine that settled on her light brown hair he said by the way susan tell your mistress or is it your mother mary ann shook her head but did not speak oh you are not miss leadbatter no mary ann she spoke humbly her eyes were shy and would not meet his he winced as he heard the name though her voice was not unmusical ah mary ann and i've been calling you jane all along mary ann what she seemed confused and flushed a little mary ann she murmured merely mary ann yessir he smiled seems a sort of white topsy he was thinking she stood still holding in her hand the tablecloth she had just folded her eyes were downcast and the glint of sunshine had leapt upon the long lashes well mary ann tell your mistress there is a piano coming it will stand over there you'll have to move the sideboard somewhere else a piano mary ann opened her eyes and lancelot saw that they were large and pathetic he could not see the colour for the glint of sunshine that touched them with false fire yes i suppose it will have to come up through the window these staircases are so beastly narrow do you never have a stout person in the house i wonder oh yes sir we had a lodger here last year as was quite a fat man and did he come up through the window by a pulley he smiled at the image and expected to see mary ann smile in response he was disappointed when she did not it was not only that her stolidity made his humour seem feeble he half wanted to see how she looked when she smiled oh dear no said mary ann he lived on the ground floor oh murmured lancelot feeling the last sparkle taken from his humour he was damped to the skin by mary ann's platitudinarian style of conversation despite its prettiness her face was dulness incarnate anyhow remember to take in the piano if i'm out he said tartly i suppose you've seen a piano you'll know it from a kangaroo yessir breathed mary ann oh come that's something there is some civilisation in baker's terrace after all but are you quite sure he went on the teasing instinct getting the better of him because you know you've never seen a kangaroo mary ann's face lit up a little oh yes i have sir it came to the village fair when i was a girl oh indeed said lancelot a little staggered what did it come there for to buy a new pouch no sir in a circus ah in a circus then perhaps you can play the piano too mary ann got very red no sir missus never showed me how to do that lancelot surrendered himself to a roar of laughter this is a real original he said to himself just a touch of pity blending with his amusement i suppose though you'd be willing to lend a hand occasionally he could not resist saying missus says i must do anything i'm asked she said in distress the tears welling to her eyes and a merciless bell mercifully sounding from an upper room she hurried out how much mary ann did lancelot never rightly knew any more than he knew the number of lodgers in the house or who cooked his chops in the mysterious regions below stairs sometimes he trod on the toes of boots outside doors and vaguely connected them with human beings peremptory and exacting as himself to mary ann each of those pairs of boots was a personality with individual hours of rising and retiring breakfasting and supping going out and coming in and special idiosyncrasies of diet and disposition the population of baker's terrace was nine mostly bell ringers life was one ceaseless round of multifarious duties with six hours of blessed unconsciousness if sleep were punctual all the week long mary ann was toiling up and down the stairs or sweeping them making beds or puddings polishing boots or fire irons holidays were not in mary ann's calendar and if sunday ever found her on her knees it was only when she was scrubbing out the kitchen all work and no play makes jack a dull boy it had not apparently made mary ann a bright girl the piano duly came in through the window like a burglar it was a good instrument but hired under lancelot's fingers it sang like a bird and growled like a beast when the piano was done growling lancelot usually started he paced up and down the room swearing audibly then he would sit down at the table and cover ruled paper with hieroglyphics for hours together his movements were erratic to the verge of mystery he had no fixed hours for anything to mary ann he was hopeless at any given moment he might be playing on the piano or writing on the curiously ruled paper or stamping about the room or sitting limp with despair in the one easy chair or drinking whisky and water or smoking a black meerschaum or reading a book or lying in bed or driving away in a hansom or walking about heaven alone knew where or why even mrs leadbatter whose experience of life was wider than mary ann's considered his vagaries almost unchristian though to the highest degree gentlemanly sometimes too he sported the swallow tail and the starched breast plate which was a wonder to mary ann who knew that waiters were connected only with the most stylish establishments baker's terrace did not wear evening dress mary ann liked him best in black and white she thought he looked like the pictures in the young ladies' novelettes which sometimes caught her eye as she passed newsvendors' shops on errands not that she was read in this literature she had no time for reading but even when clothed in rough tweeds lancelot had for mary ann an aristocratic halo in his dressing gown he savoured of the grand turk his hands were masterful the fingers tapering the nails pedantically polished he had fair hair with moustache to match his brow was high and white and his grey eyes could flash fire when he drew himself up to his full height he threatened the gas globes never had no baker's terrace boasted of such a tenant altogether lancelot loomed large to mary ann she dazzled him with his own boots in humble response and went about sad after a reprimand for putting his papers in order her whole theory of life oscillated in the presence of a being whose views could so run counter to her strongest instincts and yet though the universe seemed tumbling about her ears when he told her she must not move a scrap of manuscript howsoever wildly it lay about the floor or under the bed she did not for a moment question his sanity she obeyed him like a dog uncomprehending but trustful but after all this was only of a piece with the rest of her life there was nothing she questioned life stood at her bedside every morning in the cold dawn bearing a day heaped high with duties and she jumped cheerfully out of her warm bed and took them up one by one without question or murmur they were life life had no other meaning any more than it has for the omnibus hack which cannot conceive existence outside shafts and devoid of the intermittent flick of a whip point the comparison is somewhat unjust for mary ann did not fare nearly so well as the omnibus hack having to make her meals off such scraps as even the lodgers sent back mrs leadbatter was extremely economical as much so with the provisions in her charge as with those she bought for herself she sedulously sent up remainders till they were expressly countermanded less economical by nature and hungrier by habit mary ann had much trouble in restraining herself from surreptitious pickings her conscience was rarely worsted still there was a taint of dishonesty in her soul else had the stairs been less of an ethical battleground for her lancelot's advent only made her hungrier somehow the thought of nibbling at his provisions was too sacrilegious to be entertained and yet so queerly are we and life compounded she was probably less unhappy at this period than lancelot who would come home in the vilest of tempers and tramp the room with thunder on his white brow sometimes he and the piano and beethoven would all be growling together at other times they would all three be mute lancelot crouching in the twilight with his head in his hands and beethoven moping in the corner and the closed piano looming in the background like a coffin of dead music one february evening an evening of sleet and mist lancelot who had gone out in evening dress returned unexpectedly bringing with him for the first time a visitor he was so perturbed that he forgot to use his latchkey and mary ann who opened the door heard him say angrily well i can't slam the door in your face but i will tell you in your face i don't think it at all gentlemanly of you to force yourself upon me like this my dear lancelot when did i ever set up to be a gentleman you know that was always your part of the contract and a swarthy thick set young man with a big nose lowered the dripping umbrella he had been holding over lancelot and stepped from the gloom of the street into the fuscous cheerfulness of the ill lit passage by this time beethoven who had been left at home was in full ebullition upstairs and darted at the intruder the moment his calves appeared beethoven barked with short sharp snaps as became a bilious liver coloured blenheim spaniel like master like dog said the swarthy young man defending himself at the point of the umbrella really your animal is more intelligent than the overrated common or garden dog which makes no distinction between people calling in the small hours and people calling in broad daylight under the obvious patronage of its own master this beast of yours is evidently more in sympathy with its liege lord down fido down i wonder they allow you to keep such noisy creatures but stay i was forgetting you keep a piano after that i suppose nothing matters lancelot made no reply but surprised beethoven into silence by kicking him out of the way he lit the gas with a neatly written sheet of music which he rammed into the fire mary ann had been keeping up then as silently he indicated the easy chair thank you said the swarthy young man taking it i would rather see you in it but as there's only one i know you wouldn't be feeling a gentleman and that would make us both uncomfortable 'pon my word peter lancelot burst forth you're enough to provoke a saint 'pon my word lancelot replied peter imperturbably you're more than enough to provoke a sinner why what have you to be ashamed of you've got one of the cosiest dens in london and one of the comfortablest chairs why it's twice as jolly as the garret we shared at leipsic up the ninety stairs we're not in germany now i don't want to receive visitors answered lancelot sulkily a visitor you call me a visitor lancelot it's plain you were not telling the truth when you said just now you had forgiven me i had forgiven and forgotten you come that's unkind it's scarcely three years since i threw up my career as a genius and you know why i left you old man when the first fever of youthful revolt was over i woke to see things in their true light i saw how mean it was of me to help to eat up your wretched thousand pounds neither of us saw the situation nakedly at first it was sicklied o'er with quixotic foolishness you see you had the advantage of me your governor was a gentleman he says 'very well if you won't go to cambridge if you refuse to enter the church as the younger son of a blue blooded but impecunious baronet should and to step into the living which is fattening for you then i must refuse to take any further responsibility for your future here is a thousand pounds it is the money i had set aside for your college course use it for your musical tomfoolery if you insist and then get what living you can' which was severe but dignified unpaternal yet patrician but what does my governor do that cantankerous pig headed old philistine god bless him he's got no sense of the respect a father owes to his offspring not an atom you're simply a branch to be run on the lines of the old business or be shut up altogether and by the way lancelot he hasn't altered a jot since those days when as you remember the city or starvation was his pleasant alternative of course i preferred starvation one usually does at nineteen especially if one knows there's a scion of aristocracy waiting outside to elope with him to leipsic but you told me you were going back to your dad because you found you had mistaken your vocation gospel truth also my heavens shall i ever forget the blank horror that grew upon me when i came to understand that music was a science more barbarous than the mathematics that floored me at school that the life of a musical student instead of being a delicious whirl of waltz tunes was 'one dem'd grind' that seemed to grind out all the soul of the divine art and leave nothing but horrid technicalities about consecutive fifths and suspensions on the dominant i dare say most people still think of the musician as a being who lives in an enchanted world of sound rather than as a person greatly occupied with tedious feats of penmanship just as i myself still think of a prima ballerina not as a hard working gymnast but as a fairy whose existence is all bouquets and lime light but you had a pretty talent for the piano said lancelot in milder accents no one forced you to learn composition you could have learnt anything for the paltry fifteen pounds exacted by the conservatoire from the german flute to the grand organ from singing to scoring band parts no thank you aut caesar aut nihil you remember what i always used to say 'either beethoven ' the spaniel pricked up his ears or bust' if i could not be a great musician it was hardly worth while enduring the privations of one especially at another man's expense so i did the prodigal son dodge as you know and out of the proceeds sent you my year's exes in that cheque you with your damnable pride sent me back again and now old fellow that i have you face to face at last can you offer the faintest scintilla of a shadow of a reason for refusing to take that cheque no you can't nothing but simple beastly stuckuppishness i saw through you at once all your heroics were a fraud i was not your friend but your protege something to practise your chivalry on you dropped your cloak and i saw your feet of clay well i tell you straight i made up my mind at once to be bad friends with you for life only when i saw your fiery old phiz at brahmson's i felt a sort of something tugging inside my greatcoat like a thief after my pocket book and i kinder knew as the americans say that in half an hour i should be sitting beneath your hospitable roof i beg your pardon you will have some whisky he rang the bell violently don't be a fool you know i didn't mean that well don't let us quarrel i have forgiven you for your youthful bounty and you have forgiven me for chucking it up and now we are going to drink to the vaterland he added as mary ann appeared with a suspicious alacrity do you know he went on when they had taken the first sip of renewed amity dissolved in whisky i think i showed more musical soul than you in refusing to trammel my inspiration with the dull rules invented by fools i suppose you have mastered them all eh he picked up some sheets of manuscript great scot how you must have schooled yourself to scribble all this you with your restless nature full scores too i hope you don't offer this sort of thing to brahmson i certainly went there with that intention admitted lancelot i thought i'd catch brahmson himself in the evening he's never in when i call in the morning peter groaned quixotic as ever you can't have been long in london then a year i suppose you'd jump down my throat if i were to ask you how much is left of that he hesitated then turned the sentence facetiously of those twenty thousand shillings you were cut off with let this vile den answer don't disparage the den it's not so bad you are right i may come to worse i've been an awful ass you know how lucky i was while at the conservatoire no you don't how should you well i carried off some distinctions and a lot of conceit and came over here thinking europe would be at my feet in a month i was only sorry my father died before i could twit him with my triumph that's candid isn't it yes you're not such a prig after all mused peter i saw the old man's death in the paper your brother lionel became the bart yes poor beggar i don't hate him half so much as i did he reminds me of a man invited to dinner which is nothing but flowers and serviettes and silver plate i'd pawn the plate anyhow said peter with a little laugh he can't touch anything i tell you everything's tied up ah well he'll get tied up too he'll marry an american heiress confound him i'd rather see the house extinct first hoity toity she'll be quite as good as any of you i can't discuss this with you peter said lancelot gently but firmly if there is a word i hate more than the word heiress it is the word american but why they're both very good words and better things they both smack of the most vulgar thing in the world money said lancelot walking hotly about the room in america there's no other standard to make your pile to strike ile oh how i shudder to hear these idioms and can any one hear the word heiress without immediately thinking of matrimony phaugh it's a prostitution what is you're not very coherent my friend very well i am incoherent if a great old family can only bolster up its greatness by alliances with the daughters of oil strikers then let the family perish with honour but the daughters of oil strikers are sometimes very charming creatures they are polished with their fathers' oil you are right they reek of it pah i pray to heaven lionel will either wed a lady or die a bachelor yes but what do you call a lady persisted peter lancelot uttered an impatient snarl and rang the bell violently peter stared in silence mary ann appeared how often am i to tell you to leave my matches on the mantel shelf snapped lancelot you seem to delight to hide them away as if i had time to play parlour games with you mary ann silently went to the mantel piece handed him the matches and left the room without a word i say lancelot adversity doesn't seem to have agreed with you said peter severely that poor girl's eyes were quite wet when she went out why didn't you speak i could have given you heaps of lights and you might even have sacrificed another scrap of that precious manuscript well she has got a knack of hiding my matches all the same said lancelot somewhat shamefacedly besides i hate her for being called mary ann it's the last terror of cheap apartments if she only had another name like a human being i'd gladly call her miss something i went so far as to ask her and she stared at me in a dazed stupid silly way as if i'd asked her to marry me i suppose the fact is she's been called mary ann so long and so often that she's forgotten her father's name if she ever had any i must do her the justice though to say she answers to the name of mary ann in every sense of the phrase she didn't seem at all bad looking any way said peter every man to his taste growled lancelot she's as platt and uninteresting as a wooden sabot there's many a pretty foot in a sabot retorted peter with an air of philosophy you think that's clever but it's simply silly how does that fact affect this particular sabot i've put my foot in it groaned peter comically besides she might be a houri from heaven said lancelot but a houri in a patched print frock he shuddered and struck a match i don't know exactly what houris from heaven are but i have a kind of feeling any sort of frock would be out of harmony lancelot lit his pipe if you begin to say that sort of thing we must smoke he said laughing between the puffs i can offer you lots of tobacco i'm sorry i've got no cigars wait till you see mrs leadbatter my landlady then you'll talk about houris poverty may not be a crime but it seems to make people awful bores wonder if it'll have that effect on me ach himmel how that woman bores me no there's no denying it there's my pouch old man i hate the poor their virtues are only a shade more vulgar than their vices this leadbatter creature is honest after her lights she sends me up the most ridiculous leavings and i only hate her the more for it i suppose she works mary ann's fingers to the bone from the same mistaken sense of duty said peter acutely thanks think i'll try one of my cigars i filled my case i fancy before i came out yes here it is won't you try one no thanks i prefer my pipe it's the same old meerschaum i see said peter the same old meerschaum repeated lancelot with a little sigh peter lit a cigar and they sat and puffed in silence dear me said peter suddenly i can almost fancy we're back in our german garret up the ninety stairs can't you no said lancelot sadly looking round as if in search of something i miss the dreams and i said peter striving to speak cheerfully i see a dog too much yes said lancelot with a melancholy laugh when you funked becoming a beethoven i got a dog and called him after you what you called him peter no beethoven beethoven really really here beethoven the spaniel shook himself and perked his wee nose up wistfully towards lancelot's face peter laughed with a little catch in his voice he didn't know whether he was pleased or touched or angry you started to tell me about those twenty thousand shillings he said didn't i tell you on the expectations of my triumph i lived extravagantly like a fool joined a club and took up my quarters there when i began to realise the struggle that lay before me i took chambers then i took rooms now i'm in lodgings the more i realised it the less rent i paid i only go to the club for my letters now i won't have them come here i'm living incognito that's taking fame by the forelock indeed then by what name must i ask for you next time for i'm not to be shaken off lancelot lancelot what only lancelot mr lancelot why that's like your mary ann so it is he laughed more bitterly than cordially it never struck me before yes we are a pair how did you stumble on this place i didn't stumble deliberate intelligent selection you see it's the next best thing to piccadilly you just cross waterloo bridge and there you are at the centre five minutes from all the clubs the natives have not yet risen to the idea you mean the rent laughed peter you're as canny and careful as a scotch professor i think it's simply grand the way you've beaten out those shillings in defiance of your natural instincts i should have melted them years ago i believe you have got some musical genius after all you overrate my abilities said lancelot with the whimsical expression that sometimes flashed across his face even in his most unamiable moments you must deduct the thalers i made in exhibitions as for living in cheap lodgings i am not at all certain it's an economy for every now and again it occurs to you that you are saving an awful lot and you take a hansom on the strength of it well i haven't torn up that cheque yet peter said lancelot his flash of gaiety dying away i tell you these things as a friend not as a beggar if you look upon me as the second i cease to be the first but man i owe you the money and if it will enable you to hold out a little longer why in heaven's name shouldn't you you don't owe me the money at all i made no bargain with you i am not a money lender pack dich zum henker growled peter with a comical grimace was fuer a casuist what a swindler you'd make i wonder you have the face to deny the debt well and how did you leave frau sauer kraut he said deeming it prudent to sheer off the subject fat as a christmas turkey of a german sausage the extraordinary things that woman stuffed herself with chunks of fat stewed apples kartoffel salad all mixed up in one plate as in a dustbin don't you make my gorge rise ach himmel to think that this nation should be musical o music heavenly maid how much garlic i have endured for thy sake ha ha ha laughed peter putting down his whisky that he might throw himself freely back in the easy chair and roar oh that garlic he said panting no wonder they smoked so much in leipsic even so they couldn't keep the reek out of the staircases still it's a great country is germany our house does a tremendous business in german patents a great country a land of barbarians rather how can a people be civilised that eats jam with its meat bravo lancelot you're in lovely form to night you seem to go a hundred miles out of your way to come the truly british first it was oil now it's jam there was that aristocratic flash in your eye too that look of supreme disdain which brings on riots in trafalgar square behind the patriotic the national note 'how can a people be civilised that eats jam with its meat' i heard the deeper the oligarchic accent 'how can a people be enfranchised that eats meat with its fingers' ah you are right how you do hate the poor what bores they are you aristocrats the products of centuries of culture comfort and cocksureness will never rid yourselves of your conviction that you are the backbone of england no not though that backbone were picked clean of every scrap of flesh by the rats of radicalism what in the devil are you talking about now demanded lancelot you seem to me to go a hundred miles out of your way to twit me with my poverty and my breeding one would almost think you were anxious to convince me of the poverty of your breeding oh a thousand pardons ejaculated peter blushing violently but good heavens old chap there's your hot temper again you surely wouldn't suspect me of all people in the world of meaning anything personal i'm talking of you as a class contempt is in your blood and quite right we're such snobs we deserve it why d'ye think i ever took to you as a boy at school was it because you scribbled inaccurate sonatas and i had myself a talent for knocking tunes off the piano not a bit of it i thought it was perhaps but that was only one of my many youthful errors no i liked you because your father was an old english baronet and mine was a merchant who trafficked mainly in things teutonic and that's why i like you still 'pon my soul it is you gratify my historic sense like an old building you are picturesque you stand to me for all the good old ideals including the pride which we are beginning to see is deuced unchristian mind you it's a curious kind of pride when one looks into it apparently it's based on the fact that your family has lived on the nation for generations and yet you won't take my cheque which is your own now don't swear i know one mustn't analyse things or the world would come to pieces so i always vote tory then i shall have to turn radical grumbled lancelot certainly you will when you have had a little more experience of poverty retorted peter there there old man forgive me i only do it to annoy you fact is your outbursts of temper attract me they are pleasant to look back upon when the storm is over yes my dear lancelot you are like the king you look you can do no wrong you are picturesque pass the whisky lancelot smiled his handsome brow serene once more he murmured don't talk rot but inwardly he was not displeased at peter's allegiance half mocking though he knew it therefore my dear chap resumed peter sipping his whisky and water to return to our lambs i bow to your patrician prejudices in favour of forks but your patriotic prejudices are on a different level there i am on the same ground as you and i vow i see nothing inherently superior in the british combination of beef and beetroot to the german amalgam of lamb and jam damn lamb and jam burst forth lancelot adding with his whimsical look there's rhyme as well as reason how on earth did we get on this tack i don't know said peter smiling we were talking about frau sauer kraut i think and did you board with her all the time yes and i was always hungry till the last i never learnt to stomach her mixtures but it was really too much trouble to go down the ninety stairs to a restaurant it was much easier to be hungry and did you ever get a reform in the hours of washing the floor ha ha ha no they always waited till i was going to bed i suppose they thought i liked damp they never got over my morning tub you know and that too sprang a leak after you left and helped spontaneously to wash the floor shows the fallacy of cleanliness said peter and the inferiority of british ideals they never bathed in their lives yet they looked the pink of health yes their complexion was high like the fish ha ha yes the fish that was a great luxury i remember about once a month of course the town is so inland said lancelot i see it took such a long time coming ha ha ha and the herr professor is he still a bachelor as the herr professor was a septuagenarian and a misogamist even in peter's time his question tickled lancelot altogether the two young men grew quite jolly recalling a hundred oddities and reknitting their friendship at the expense of the fatherland but was there ever a more madcap expedition than ours exclaimed peter most boys start out to be pirates and some do become music publishers lancelot finished grimly suddenly reminded of a grievance ha ha ha poor fellow' laughed peter then you have found them out already does anyone ever find them in flashed lancelot i suppose they do exist and are occasionally seen of mortal eyes i suppose wives and friends and mothers gaze on them with no sense of special privilege unconscious of their invisibility to the profane eyes of mere musicians my dear fellow the mere musicians are as plentiful as niggers on the sea shore a publisher might spend his whole day receiving regiments of unappreciated geniuses bond street would be impassable you look at the publisher too much from your own standpoint i tell you i don't look at him from any standpoint that's what i complain of he's encircled with a prickly hedge of clerks 'you will hear from us' 'it shall have our best consideration' 'we have no knowledge of the ms in question' yes peter two valuable quartets have i lost messing about with these villains i tell you what i'll give you an introduction to brahmson i know him privately no thank you peter why not because you know him i couldn't give you an introduction if i didn't this is silly of you lancelot if brahmson can't see any merits in my music i don't want you to open his eyes i'll stand on my own bottom and what's more peter i tell you once for all his voice was low and menacing if you try any anonymous deus ex machina tricks on me in some sly roundabout fashion don't you flatter yourself i shan't recognise your hand i shall and by god it shall never grasp mine again i suppose you think that's very noble and sublime said peter coolly you don't suppose if i could do you a turn i'd hesitate for fear of excommunication i know you're like beethoven there your bark is worse than your bite very well try you'll find my teeth nastier than you bargain for i'm not going to try if you want to go to the dogs go why should i put out a hand to stop you these amenities having re established them in their mutual esteem they chatted lazily and spasmodically till past midnight with more smoke than fire in their conversation at last peter began to go and in course of time actually did take up his umbrella not long after lancelot conducted him softly down the dark silent stairs holding his bedroom candlestick in his hand for mrs leadbatter always turned out the hall lamp on her way to bed the old phrases came to the young men's lips as their hands met in a last hearty grip lebt wohl said lancelot auf wiedersehen replied peter threateningly lancelot stood at the hall door looking for a moment after his friend the friend he had tried to cast out of his heart as a recreant the mist had cleared the stars glittered countless in the frosty heaven a golden crescent moon hung low the lights and shadows lay almost poetically upon the little street a rush of tender thoughts whelmed the musician's soul he saw again the dear old garret up the ninety stairs in the hotel cologne where he had lived with his dreams he heard the pianos and violins going in every room in happy incongruity publishing to all the prowess of the players dirty picturesque old leipsic rose before him he was walking again in the hainstrasse in the shadow of the quaint tall houses yes life was sweet after all he was a coward to lose heart so soon fame would yet be his fame and love the love of a noble woman that fame earns some gracious creature breathing sweet refinements cradled in an ancient home such as he had left for ever the sentimentality of the fatherland seemed to have crept into his soul a divinely sweet sad melody was throbbing in his brain how glad he was he had met peter again from a neighbouring steeple came a harsh resonant clang one it roused him from his dream he shivered a little closed the door bolted it and put up the chain and turned half sighing to take up his bedroom candle again then his heart stood still for a moment a figure a girl's figure was coming towards him from the kitchen stairs as she came into the dim light he saw that it was merely mary ann she looked half drowsed her cap was off her hair tangled loosely over her forehead in her disarray she looked prettier than he had ever remembered her there was something provoking about the large dreamy eyes the red lips that parted at the unexpected sight of him good heavens he cried not gone to bed yet no sir i had to stay up to wash up a lot of crockery the second floor front had some friends to supper late missus says she won't stand it again poor thing he patted her soft cheek it grew hot and rosy under his fingers but was not withdrawn mary ann made no sign of resentment in his mood of tenderness to all creation his rough words to her recurred to him you mustn't mind what i said about the matches he murmured when i am in a bad temper i say anything remember now for the future will you yessir her face its blushes flickered over strangely by the candle light seemed to look up at him invitingly that's a good girl and bending down he kissed her on the lips good night he murmured mary ann made some startled gurgling sound in reply five minutes afterwards lancelot was in bed denouncing himself as a vulgar beast i must have drunk too much whisky he said to himself angrily good heavens fancy sinking to mary ann if peter had only seen there was infinitely more poetry in that red cheeked maedchen and yet i never it is true there is something sordid about the atmosphere that subtly permeates you that drags you down to it mary ann a transpontine drudge whose lips are fresh from the coalman's and the butcher's phaugh the fancy seized hold of his imagination he could not shake it off he could not sleep till he had got out of bed and sponged his lips vigorously meanwhile mary ann was lying on her bed dressed doing her best to keep her meaningless half hysterical sobs from her mistress's keen ear ii it was a long time before mary ann came so prominently into the centre of lancelot's consciousness again she remained somewhere in the outer periphery of his thought nowhere near the bull's eye so to speak as a vague automaton that worked when he pulled a bell rope infinitely more important things were troubling him the visit of peter had somehow put a keener edge on his blunted self confidence he had started a grand opera and worked at it furiously in all the intervals left him by his engrossing pursuit after a publisher sometimes he would look up from his hieroglyphics and see mary ann at his side surveying him curiously and then he would start and remember he had rung her up and try to remember what for and mary ann would turn red as if the fault was hers but the publisher was the one thing that was never out of lancelot's mind though he drove lancelot himself nearly out of it he was like an arrow stuck in the aforesaid bull's eye and the target being conscious he rankled sorely lancelot discovered that the publisher kept a musical adviser whose advice appeared to consist of the famous monosyllable don't the publisher generally published all the musical adviser's own works his advice having apparently been neglected when it was most worth taking at least so lancelot thought when he had skimmed through a set of lancers by one of these worthies i shall give up being a musician he said to himself grimly i shall become a musical adviser once half by accident he actually saw a publisher my dear sir said the great man what is the use of bringing quartets and full scores to me you should have taken them to brahmson he's the man you want you know his address of course just down the street lancelot did not like to say that it was brahmson's clerks that had recommended him here so he replied but you publish operas oratorios cantatas ah yes h'm things that have been played at the big festivals composers of prestige quite a different thing sir quite a different thing there's no sale for these things none at all sir public never heard of you now if you were to write some songs nice catchy tunes high class you know with pretty words now lancelot by this time was aware of the publisher's wily ways he could almost have constructed an ollendorffian dialogue entitled between a music publisher and a composer so he opened his portfolio again and said i have brought some well send send them in stammered the publisher almost disconcerted they shall have our best consideration oh but you might just as well look over them at once said lancelot firmly uncoiling them it won't take you five minutes just let me play one to you the tunes are rather more original than the average i can promise you and yet i think they have a lilt that i really can't spare the time now if you leave them we will do our best listen to this bit said lancelot desperately and dashing at a piano that stood handy he played a couple of bars that's quite a new modulation that's all very well said the publisher but how do you suppose i'm going to sell a thing with an accompaniment like that look here and here why it's all accidentals that's the best part of the song explained lancelot a sort of undercurrent of emotion that brings out the full pathos of the words note the elegant and novel harmonies he played another bar or two singing the words softly yes but if you think you'll get young ladies to play that you've got a good deal to learn said the publisher gruffly this is the sort of accompaniment that goes down and seating himself at the piano for a moment somewhat to lancelot's astonishment for he had gradually formed a theory that music publishers did not really know the staff from a five barred gate he rattled off the melody with his right hand pounding away monotonously with his left at a few elementary chords lancelot looked dismayed that's the kind of thing you'll have to produce young man said the publisher feeling that he had at last resumed his natural supremacy if you want to get your songs published elegant harmonies are all very well but who's to play them and do you mean to say that a musician in this god forsaken country must have no chords but tonics and dominants ejaculated lancelot hotly the less he has of any other the better said the great man drily i haven't said a word about the melody itself which is quite out of the ordinary compass and makes demands upon the singer's vocalisation which are not likely to make a demand for the song what you have to remember my dear sir if you wish to achieve success is that music if it is to sell must appeal to the average amateur young person the average amateur young person is the main prop of music in this country lancelot snatched up his song and tied the strings of his portfolio very tightly as if he were clenching his lips if i stay here any longer i shall swear he said good afternoon he went out with a fire at his heart that made him insensitive to the frost without he walked a mile out of his way mechanically then perceiving his stupidity avenged it by jumping into a hansom he dared not think how low his funds were running when he got home he forgot to have his tea crouching in dumb misery in his easy chair while the coals in the grate faded like the sunset from red to grey and the dusk of twilight deepened into the gloom of night relieved only by a gleam from the street lamp the noise of the door opening made him look up beg pardon sir i didn't yer ye come in it was mary ann's timid accents lancelot's head drooped again on his breast he did not answer you've bin and let your fire go out sir don't bother he grumbled he felt a morbid satisfaction in this aggravation of discomfort almost symbolic as it was of his sunk fortunes oh but it'll freeze 'ard to night sir let me make it up taking his sullen silence for consent she ran downstairs and reappeared with some sticks soon there were signs of life which mary ann assiduously encouraged by blowing at the embers with her mouth lancelot looked on in dull apathy but as the fire rekindled and the little flames leapt up and made mary ann's flushed face the one spot of colour and warmth in the cold dark room lancelot's torpidity vanished suddenly the sensuous fascination seized him afresh and ere he was aware of it he was lifting the pretty face by the chin i'm so sorry to be so troublesome mary ann there you shall give me a kiss to show you bear no malice the warm lips obediently met his and for a moment lancelot forgot his worries while he held her soft cheek against his this time the shock of returning recollection was not so violent as before he sat up in his chair but his right arm still twined negligently round her neck the fingers patting the warm face a fellow must have something to divert his mind he thought or he'd go mad and there's no harm done the poor thing takes it as a kindness i'm sure i suppose her life's dull enough we're a pair he felt her shoulders heaving a little as if she were gulping down something at last she said you ain't troublesome i ought to ha' yerd ye come in he released her suddenly her words broke the spell the vulgar accent gave him a shudder don't you hear a bell ringing he said with dual significance nosir said mary ann ingenuously i'd yer it in a moment if there was i yer it in my dreams i'm so used to it one night i dreamt the missus was boxin' my yers and askin' me if i was deaf and i said to 'er can't you say 'her' cried lancelot cutting her short impatiently her said mary ann then why do you say ''er' missus told me to she said my own way was all wrong oh indeed said lancelot it's missus that has corrupted you is it and pray what used you to say she said mary ann lancelot was taken aback she he repeated yessir said mary ann with a dawning suspicion that her own vocabulary was going to be vindicated whenever i said 'she' she made me say ''er' and whenever i said 'her' she made me say 'she' when i said 'her and me' she made me say 'me and she' and when i said 'i got it from she' she made me say 'i got it from 'er' bravo a very lucid exposition said lancelot laughing did she set you right in any other particulars eessir i mean yessir replied mary ann the forbidden words flying to her lips like prisoned skylarks suddenly set free i used to say 'gie i thek there broom oo't' 'arten thee goin' to' 'her did say to i' 'i be goin' on to bed' 'look at ' enough enough what a memory you've got now i understand you're a country girl eessir said mary ann her face lighting up i mean yessir well that redeems you a little thought lancelot with his whimsical look so it's missus is it who's taught you cockneyese my instinct was not so unsound after all i dare say you'll turn out something nobler than a cockney drudge he finished aloud i hope you went a milking eessir sometimes and i drove back the milk trunk in the cart and i rode down on a pony to the second pasture to count the sheep and the heifers then you are a farmer's daughter eessir but my feyther i mean my father had only two little fields when he was alive but we had a nice garden with plum trees and rose bushes and gillyflowers better and better murmured lancelot smiling and indeed the image of mary ann skimming the meads on a pony in the sunshine was more pleasant to contemplate than that of mary ann whitening the wintry steps what a complexion you must have had to start with he cried aloud surveying the not unenviable remains of it well and what else did you do mary ann opened her lips it was delightful to see how the dull veil as of london fog had been lifted from her face her eyes sparkled then oh there's the ground floor bell she cried moving instinctively towards the door nonsense i hear no bell said lancelot i told you i always hear it said mary ann hesitating and blushing delicately before the critical word oh well run along then stop a moment i must give you another kiss for talking so nicely there and stop a moment bring me up some coffee please when the ground floor is satisfied eessir i mean yessir what must i say she added pausing troubled on the threshold say 'yes lancelot' he answered recklessly yessir and mary ann disappeared it was ten endless minutes before she reappeared with the coffee the whole of the second five minutes lancelot paced his room feverishly cursing the ground floor and stamping as if to bring down its ceiling he was curious to know more of mary ann's history but it proved meagre enough her mother died when mary ann was a child her father when she was still a mere girl his affairs were found in hopeless confusion and mary ann was considered lucky to be taken into the house of the well to do mrs leadbatter of london the eldest sister of a young woman who had nursed the vicar's wife mrs leadbatter had promised the vicar to train up the girl in the way a domestic should go and when i am old enough she is going to pay me wages as well concluded mary ann with an air of importance indeed how old were you when you left the village fourteen and how old are you now mary ann looked confused i don't quite know she murmured o come said lancelot laughingly is this your country simplicity you're quite young enough to tell how old you are the tears came into mary ann's eyes i can't mr lancelot she protested earnestly i forgot to count i'll ask missus and whatever she tells you you'll be he said amused at her unshakable loyalty yessir said mary ann and so you are quite alone in the world yessir but i've got my canary they sold everything when my father died but the vicar's wife she bought my canary back for me because i cried so and i brought it to london and it hangs in my bedroom and the vicar he was so kind to me he did give me a lot of advice and mrs amersham who kept the chandler's shop she did give me ninepence all in three penny bits and you never had any brothers or sisters there was our sally but she died before mother nobody else there's my big brother tom but i mustn't tell you about him mustn't tell me about him why not he's so wicked the answer was so unexpected that lancelot could not help laughing and mary ann flushed to the roots of her hair why what has he done said lancelot composing his mouth to gravity i don't know i was only six father told me it was something very dreadful and tom had to run away to america and i mustn't mention him any more and mother was crying and i cried because tom used to give me tickey backs and go blackberrying with me and our little sally and everybody else in the village they seemed glad because they had said so all along because tom would never go to church even when a little boy i suppose then you went to church regularly yessir when i was at home i mean every sunday mary ann hung her head once i went meechin' she said in low tones some boys and girls they wanted me to go nutting and i wanted to go too but i didn't know how to get away and they told me to cough very loud when the sermon began so i did and coughed on and on till at last the vicar glowed at father and father had to send me out of church lancelot laughed heartily then you didn't like the sermon it wasn't that sir the sun was shining that beautiful outside and i never minded the sermon only i did get tired of sitting still but i never done it again our little sally she died soon after lancelot checked his laughter poor little fool he thought then to brighten her up again he asked cheerily and what else did you do on the farm oh please sir missus will be wanting me now bother missus i want some more milk he said emptying the milk jug into the slop basin run down and get some mary ann was startled by the splendour of the deed she took the jug silently and disappeared when she returned he said well you haven't told me half yet i suppose you kept bees oh yes and i fed the pigs hang the pigs let's hear something more romantic there was the calves to suckle sometimes when the mother died or was sold calves h'm h'm well but how could you do that dipped my fingers in milk and let the calves suck 'em the silly creatures thought it was their mothers' teats like this with a happy inspiration she put her fingers into the slop basin and held them up dripping lancelot groaned it was not only that his improved mary ann was again sinking to earth unable to soar in the romantic aether where he would fain have seen her volant it was not only that the coarseness of her nature had power to drag her down it was the coarseness of her red chapped hands that was thrust once again and violently upon his reluctant consciousness then like mary ann he had an inspiration how would you like a pair of gloves mary ann he had struck the latent feminine her eyes gleamed oh sir was all she could say then a swift shade of disappointment darkened the eager little face but i never goes out she cried i never go out he corrected shuddering i never go out said mary ann her lip twitching that doesn't matter i want you to wear them indoors but there's nobody to see 'em indoors i shall see them he reminded her but they'll get dirty no they won't you shall only wear them when you come to me if i buy you a nice pair of gloves will you promise to put them on every time i ring for you but what'll missus say missus won't see them the moment you come in you'll put them on and just before going out you'll take them off see yessir then nobody'll see me looking so grand but you that's it and wouldn't you rather look grand for me than for anybody else of course i would sir said mary ann earnestly with a grateful little sigh so lancelot measured her wrist feeling her pulse beat madly she really had a very little hand though to his sensitive vision the roughness of the skin seemed to swell it to a size demanding a boxing glove he bought her six pairs of tan kid in a beautiful cardboard box he could ill afford the gift and made one of his whimsical grimaces when he got the bill the young lady who served him looked infinitely more genteel than mary ann he wondered what she would think if she knew for whom he was buying these dainty articles perhaps her feelings would be so outraged she would refuse to participate in the transaction but the young lady was happily unconscious she had her best smile for the handsome aristocratic young gentleman and mentioned his moustache later to her bosom friend in the next department and thus mary ann and lancelot became the joint owners of a secret and co players in a little comedy when mary ann came into the room she would put whatever she was carrying on a chair gravely extract her gloves from her pocket and draw them on lancelot pretending not to know she was in the room though he had just said come in after allowing her a minute he would look up in the course of a week this became mechanical so that he lost the semi ludicrous sense of secrecy which he felt at first as well as the little pathetic emotion inspired by her absolute unconsciousness that the performance was not intended for her own gratification nevertheless though he could now endure to see mary ann handling the sugar tongs he remained cold to her for some weeks he had kissed her again in the flush of her joy at the sight of the gloves but after that there was a reaction he rarely went to the club now there was no one with whom he was in correspondence except music publishers and they didn't reply but he dropped in there once soon after the glove episode looked over the papers in the smoking room and chatted with a popular composer and one or two men he knew it was while the waiter was holding out the coffee tray to him that mary ann flashed upon his consciousness the thought of her seemed so incongruous with the sober magnificence the massive respectability that surrounded him the cheerful marble hearth reddened with leaping flame the luxurious lounges the well groomed old gentlemen smoking eighteenpenny cheroots the suave noiseless satellites that lancelot felt a sudden pang of bewildered shame why the very waiter who stood bent before him would disdain her he took his coffee hastily with a sense of personal unworthiness this feeling soon evaporated but it left lees of resentment against mary ann which made him inexplicable to her fortunately her habit of acceptance saved her some tears though she shed others and there remained always the gloves when she was putting them on she always felt she was slipping her hands in his and then there was yet a further consolation for the gloves had also a subtle effect on lancelot they gave him a sense of responsibility vaguely resentful as he felt against mary ann in the intervals of his more definite resentment against publishers he also felt that he could not stop at the gloves he had started refining her and he must go on till she was so to speak all gloves he must cover up her coarse speech as he had covered up her coarse hands he owed that to the gloves it was the least he could do for them so whenever mary ann made a mistake lancelot corrected her he found these grammatical dialogues not uninteresting and a vent for his ill humour against publishers to boot very often his verbal corrections sounded astonishingly like reprimands here again mary ann was forearmed by her feeling that she deserved them she would have been proud had she known how much mr lancelot was satisfied with her aspirates which came quite natural she had only dropped her h's temporarily as one drops country friends in coming to london curiously enough mary ann did not regard the new locutions and pronunciations as superseding the old they were a new language she knew two others her mother tongue and her missus's tongue she would as little have thought of using her new linguistic acquirements in the kitchen as of wearing her gloves there they were for lancelot's ears only as her gloves were for his eyes all this time lancelot was displaying prodigious musical activity so much so that the cost of ruled paper became a consideration there was no form of composition he did not essay none by which he made a shilling once he felt himself the prey of a splendid inspiration and sat up all night writing at fever pitch surrounded with celestial harmonies audible to him alone the little room resounded with the thunder of a mighty orchestra in which every instrument sang to him individually the piccolo the flute the oboes the clarionets filling the air with a silver spray of notes the drums throbbing the trumpets shrilling the four horns pealing with long stately notes the trombones and bassoons vibrating the violins and violas sobbing in linked sweetness the 'cello and the contra bass moaning their under chant and then in the morning when the first rough sketch was written the glory faded he threw down his pen and called himself an ass for wasting his time on what nobody would ever look at then he laid his head on the table overwrought full of an infinite pity for himself a sudden longing seized him for some one to love him to caress his hair to smooth his hot forehead this mood passed too he smoothed the slumbering beethoven instead after a while he went into his bedroom and sluiced his face and hands in ice cold water and rang the bell for breakfast there was a knock at the door in response come in he said gently his emotions had left him tired to the point of tenderness and then he waited a minute while mary ann was drawing on her gloves did you ring sir said a wheezy voice at last mrs leadbatter had got tired of waiting lancelot started violently mrs leadbatter had latterly left him entirely to mary ann it's my hastmer she had explained to him apologetically meeting him casually in the passage i can't trollop up and down stairs as i used to when i fust took this house five an' twenty year ago and pore mr leadbatter and here followed reminiscences long since in their hundredth edition yes let me have some coffee very hot please said lancelot less gently the woman's voice jarred upon him and her features were not redeeming lawd sir i 'ope that gas 'asn't been burnin' all night sir she said as she was going out it has he said shortly you'll hexcoose me sir but i didn't bargen for that i'm only a pore honest 'ard workin' widder and i noticed the last gas bill was 'eavier than hever since that black winter that took pore mr leadbatter to 'is grave fair is fair and i shall 'ave to reckon it a hextry with the rate gone up sevenpence a thousand and my rosie leavin' a fine nursemaid's place in bayswater at the end of the month to come 'ome and 'elp 'er mother 'cos my hastmer will you please shut the door after you interrupted lancelot biting his lip with irritation and mrs leadbatter who was standing in the aperture with no immediate intention of departing could find no repartee beyond slamming the door as hard as she could this little passage of arms strangely softened lancelot to mary ann it made him realise faintly what her life must be i should go mad and smash all the crockery he cried aloud he felt quite tender again towards the uncomplaining girl presently there was another knock lancelot growled half prepared to renew the battle and to give mrs leadbatter a piece of his mind on the subject but it was merely mary ann shaken in his routine he looked on steadily while mary ann drew on her gloves and this in turn confused mary ann her hand trembled let me help you he said and there was lancelot buttoning mary ann's glove just as if her name were guinevere and neither saw the absurdity of wasting time upon an operation which would have to be undone in two minutes then mary ann her eyes full of soft light went to the sideboard and took out the prosaic elements of breakfast when she returned to put them back lancelot was astonished to see her carrying a cage a plain square cage made of white tin wire what's that he gasped please mr lancelot i want to ask you to do me a favour she dropped her eyelashes timidly yes mary ann he said briskly but what have you got there it's only my canary sir would you please sir would you mind then desperately i want to hang it up here sir here he repeated in frank astonishment why please sir i i it's sunnier here sir and i i think it must be pining away it hardly ever sings in my bedroom well but he began then seeing the tears gathering on her eyelids he finished with laughing good nature as long as mrs leadbatter doesn't reckon it an extra oh no sir said mary ann seriously i'll tell her besides she will be glad because she don't like the canary she says its singing disturbs her her room is next to mine you know mr lancelot but you said it doesn't sing much please sir i i mean in summer exclaimed mary ann in rosy confusion and and it'll soon be summer sir sw e e t burst forth the canary suddenly as if encouraged by mary ann's opinion it was a pretty little bird one golden yellow from beak to tail as though it had been dipped in sunshine you see sir she cried eagerly it's beginning already yes said lancelot grimly but so is beethoven i'll hang it high up in the window said mary ann where the dog can't get at it well i won't take any responsibilities murmured lancelot resignedly no sir i'll attend to that said mary ann vaguely after the installation of the canary lancelot found himself slipping more and more into a continuous matter of course flirtation more and more forgetting the slavey in the candid young creature who had at moments strange dancing lights in her awakened eyes strange flashes of witchery in her ingenuous expression and yet he made a desultory struggle against what a secret voice was always whispering was a degradation he knew she had no real place in his life he scarce thought of her save when she came bodily before his eyes with her pretty face and her trustful glance he felt no temptation to write sonatas on her eyebrow to borrow peter's variation for the use of musicians of shakespeare's write sonnets on his mistress's eyebrow and indeed he knew she could be no fit mistress for him this starveling drudge with passive passions meek accepting with well nigh every spark of spontaneity choked out of her the women of his dreams were quite other beautiful voluptuous full of the joy of life tremulous with poetry and lofty thought with dark amorous orbs that flashed responsive to his magic melodies they hovered about him as he wrote and played venuses rising from the seas of his music and then with his eyes full of the divine tears of youth with his brain a hive of winged dreams he would turn and kiss merely mary ann such is the pitiful breed of mortals and after every such fall he thought more contemptuously of mary ann idealise her as he might see all that was best in her as he tried to do she remained common and commonplace enough her ingenuousness while from one point of view it was charming from another was but a pleasant synonym for silliness and it might not be ingenuousness or silliness after all for was mary ann as innocent as she looked the guilelessness of the dove might very well cover the wisdom of the serpent the instinct the repugnance that made him sponge off her first kiss from his lips was probably a true instinct how was it possible a girl of that class should escape the sordid attentions of street swains even when she was in the country she was well nigh of woo able age the likely cynosure of neighbouring ploughboys' eyes and what of the other lodgers a finer instinct that of a gentleman kept him from putting any questions to mary ann indeed his own delicacy repudiated the images that strove to find entry in his brain even as his fastidiousness shrank from realising the unlovely details of mary ann's daily duties these things disgusted him more with himself than with her and yet he found himself acquiring a new and illogical interest in the boots he met outside doors early one morning he went half way up the second flight of stairs a strange region where his own boots had never before trod but came down ashamed and with fluttering heart as if he had gone up to steal boots instead of to survey them he might have asked mary ann or her missus who the other tenants were but he shrank from the topic their hours were not his and he only once chanced on a fellow man in the passage and then he was not sure it was not the tax collector besides he was not really interested it was only a flicker of idle curiosity as to the actual psychology of mary ann that he did not really care he proved to himself by kissing her next time he accepted her as she was because she was there she brightened his troubled life a little and he was quite sure he brightened hers so he drifted on not worrying himself to mean any definite harm to her he had quite enough worry with those music publishers the financial outlook was indeed becoming terrifying he was glad there was nobody to question him for he did not care to face the facts peter's threat of becoming a regular visitor had been nullified by his father despatching him to germany to buy up some more teutonic patents wonderful are the ways of providence he had written to lancelot if i had not flown in the old man's face and picked up a little german here years ago i should not be half so useful to him now i shall pay a flying visit to leipsic not on business but at last peter returned mrs leadbatter panting to the door to let him in one afternoon without troubling to ask lancelot if he was at home he burst upon the musician and found him in the most undisguisable dumps why didn't you answer my letter you impolite old bear peter asked warding off beethoven with his umbrella i was busy lancelot replied pettishly busy writing rubbish haven't you got 'ops' enough i bet you haven't had anything published yet i'm working at a grand opera he said in dry mechanical tones i have hopes of getting it put on gasco the impresario is a member of my club and he thinks of running a season in the autumn i had a talk with him yesterday i hope i shall live to see it said peter sceptically i hope you will said lancelot sharply none of my family ever lived beyond ninety said peter shaking his head dolefully and then my heart is not so good as it might be it certainly isn't cried poor lancelot but everybody hits a chap when he's down he turned his head away striving to swallow the lump that would rise to his throat he had a sense of infinite wretchedness and loneliness oh poor old chap is it so bad as all that peter's somewhat strident voice had grown tender as a woman's he laid his hand affectionately on lancelot's tumbled hair you know i believe in you with all my soul i never doubted your genius for a moment don't i know too well that's what keeps you back come come old fellow can't i persuade you to write rot one must keep the pot boiling you know you turn out a dozen popular ballads and the coin'll follow your music as the rats did the pied piper's then if you have any ambition left you kick away the ladder by which you mounted and stand on the heights of art never cried lancelot it would degrade me in my own eyes i'd rather starve and you can't shake them off the first impression is everything they would always be remembered against me he added after a pause motives mixed reflected peter that's a good sign aloud he said well you think it over this is a practical world old man it wasn't made for dreamers and one of the first dreams that you've got to wake from is the dream that anybody connected with the stage can be relied on from one day to the next they gas for the sake of gassing or they tell you pleasant lies out of mere goodwill just as they call for your drinks their promises are beautiful bubbles on a basis of soft soap and made to 'bust' you grow quite eloquent said lancelot with a wan smile eloquent there's more in me than you've yet found out now then give us your hand that you'll chuck art and we'll drink to your popular ballad hundredth thousand edition no drawing room should be without it lancelot flushed i was just going to have some tea i think it's five o'clock he murmured the very thing i'm dying for cried peter energetically i'm as parched as a pea inwardly he was shocked to find the stream of whisky run dry so lancelot rang the bell and mary ann came up with the tea tray in the twilight we'll have a light cried peter and struck one of his own with a shadowy underthought of saving mary ann from a possible scolding in case lancelot's matches should be again unapparent then he uttered a comic exclamation of astonishment mary ann was putting on a pair of gloves in his surprise he dropped the match mary ann was equally startled by the unexpected sight of a stranger but when he struck the second match her hands were bare and red what in heaven's name were you putting on gloves for my girl said peter amused lancelot stared fixedly at the fire trying to keep the blood from flooding his cheeks he wondered that the ridiculousness of the whole thing had never struck him in its full force before was it possible he could have made such an ass of himself please sir i've got to go out and i'm in a hurry said mary ann lancelot felt intense relief an instant after his brow wrinkled itself oho he thought so this is miss simpleton is it then why did you take them off again retorted peter mary ann's repartee was to burst into tears and leave the room now i've offended her said peter did you see how she tossed her pretty head ingenious minx thought lancelot she's left the tray on a chair by the door went on peter what an odd girl does she always carry on like this she's got such a lot to do i suppose she sometimes gets a bit queer in her head said lancelot conceiving he was somehow safe guarding mary ann's honour by the explanation i don't think that answered peter she did seem dull and stupid when i was here last but i had a good stare at her just now and she seems rather bright why her accent is quite refined she must have picked it up from you nonsense nonsense exclaimed lancelot testily the little danger or rather the great danger of being made to appear ridiculous which he had just passed through contributed to rouse him from his torpor he exerted himself to turn the conversation and was quite lively over tea sw eet sw w w w eet suddenly broke into the conversation more mysteries cried peter what's that only a canary what another musical instrument isn't beethoven jealous i wonder he doesn't consume his rival in his wrath but i never knew you liked birds i don't particularly it isn't mine whose is it lancelot answered briskly mary ann's she asked to be allowed to keep it here it seems it won't sing in her attic it pines away and do you believe that why not it doesn't sing much even here let me look at it ah it's a plain norwich yellow if you wanted a singing canary you should have come to me i'd have given you one 'made in germany' one of our patents they train them to sing tunes and that puts up the price thank you but this one disturbs me sufficiently then why do you put up with it why do i put up with that christmas number supplement over the mantel piece it's part of the furniture i was asked to let it be here and i couldn't be rude no it's not in your nature what a bore it must be to feed it let me see i suppose you give it canary seed biscuits i hope you don't give it butter don't be an ass roared lancelot you don't imagine i bother my head whether it eats butter or or marmalade who feeds it then mary ann of course she comes in and feeds it certainly several times a day i suppose so lancelot said peter solemnly mary ann's mashed on you lancelot shrank before peter's remark as a burglar from a policeman's bull's eye the bull's eye seemed to cast a new light on mary ann too but he felt too unpleasantly dazzled to consider that for the moment his whole thought was to get out of the line of light nonsense he answered why i'm hardly ever in when she feeds it and i believe it eats all day long gets supplied in the morning like a coal scuttle besides she comes in to dust and all that when she pleases and i do wish you wouldn't use that word 'mashed' i loathe it indeed he writhed under the thought of being coupled with mary ann the thing sounded so ugly so squalid in the actual it was not so unpleasant but looked at from the outside unsympathetically it was hopelessly vulgar incurably plebeian he shuddered i don't know said peter it's a very expressive word is 'mashed' but i will make allowance for your poetical feelings and give up the word except in its literal sense of course i'm sure you wouldn't object to mashing a music publisher lancelot laughed with false heartiness oh but if i'm to write those popular ballads you say he'll become my best friend of course he will cried peter eagerly sniffing at the red herring lancelot had thrown across the track you stand out for a royalty on every copy so that if you strike ile oh i beg your pardon that's another of the phrases you object to isn't it don't be a fool said lancelot laughing on you know i only object to that in connection with english peers marrying the daughters of men who have done it oh is that it i wish you'd publish an expurgated dictionary with most of the words left out and exact definitions of the conditions under which one may use the remainder but i've got on a siding what was i talking about royalty muttered lancelot languidly royalty no you mentioned the aristocracy i think then he burst into a hearty laugh oh yes on that ballad now look here i've brought a ballad with me just to show you a thing that is going like wildfire 'not good night and good bye i hope laughed lancelot yes the very one cried peter astonished himmel groaned lancelot in comic despair you know it already inquired peter eagerly no only i can't open a paper without seeing the advertisement and the sickly sentimental refrain you see how famous it is anyway said peter and if you want to strike er to make a hit you'll just take that song and do a deliberate imitation of it wha a a t gasped lancelot my dear chap they all do it when the public cotton to a thing they can't have enough of it but i can write my own rot surely in the face of all this litter of 'ops' i daren't dispute that for a moment but it isn't enough to write rot the public want a particular kind of rot now just play that over oblige me he laid both hands on lancelot's shoulders in amicable appeal lancelot shrugged them but seated himself at the piano played the introductory chords and commenced singing the words in his pleasant baritone suddenly beethoven ran towards the door howling lancelot ceased playing and looked approvingly at the animal by jove he wants to go out what an ear for music that animal's got peter smiled grimly it's long enough i suppose that's why you call him beethoven not at all beethoven had no ear at least not in his latest period he was deaf lucky devil that is if this sort of thing was brought round on barrel organs never mind old man finish the thing but consider beethoven's feelings hang beethoven poor beethoven come here my poor maligned musical critic would they give you a bad name and hang you now you must be very quiet put your paws into those lovely long ears of yours if it gets too horrible you have been used to high class music i know but this is the sort of thing that england expects every man to do so the sooner you get used to it the better he ran his fingers along the keys there peter he's growling already i'm sure he'll start again the moment i strike the theme let him we'll take it as a spaniel obligato oh but his accompaniments are too staccato he has no sense of time why don't you teach him then to wag his tail like the pendulum of a metronome he'd be more use to you that way than setting up to be a musician which nature never meant him for his hair's not long enough but go ahead old man beethoven's behaving himself now indeed as if he were satisfied with his protest the little beast remained quiet while his lord and master went through the piece he did not even interrupt at the refrain kiss me good night dear love dream of the old delight my spirit is summoned above kiss me dear love good night i must say it's not so awful as i expected said lancelot candidly it's not at all bad for a waltz there you see said peter eagerly the public are not such fools after all still the words are the most maudlin twaddle said lancelot as if he found some consolation in the fact yes but i didn't write them replied peter quickly then he grew red and laughed an embarrassed laugh i didn't mean to tell you old man but there the cat's out that's what took me to brahmson's that afternoon we met and i harmonised it myself mind you every crotchet i picked up enough at the conservatoire for that you know lots of fellows only do the tune they give out all the other work so you are the great keeley lesterre eh said lancelot in amused astonishment yes i have to do it under another name i don't want to grieve the old man you see i promised him to reform when he took me back to his heart and business is that strictly honourable peter said lancelot shaking his head oh well i couldn't give it up altogether but i do practically stick to the contract it's all overtime you know it doesn't interfere a bit with business besides as you'd say it isn't music he said slyly and just because i don't want it i make a heap of coin out of it that's why i'm so vexed at your keeping me still in your debt lancelot frowned then you had no difficulty in getting published he asked i don't say that it was bribery and corruption so far as my first song was concerned i tipped a professional to go down and tell brahmson he was going to take it up you know of course well known singers get half a guinea from the publisher every time they sing a song no do they said lancelot how mean of them business my boy it pays the publisher to give it them look at the advertisement but suppose a really fine song was published and the publisher refused to pay this blood money then i suppose they'd sing some other song and let that moulder on the foolish publisher's shelves great heavens said lancelot jumping up from the piano in wild excitement then a musician's reputation is really at the mercy of a mercenary crew of singers who respect neither art nor themselves oh yes we are indeed a musical people easy there several of 'em are pals of mine and i'll get them to take up those ballads of yours as soon as you write 'em let them go to the devil with their ballads roared lancelot and with a sweep of his arm whirled good night and good bye into the air peter picked it up and wrote something on it with a stylographic pen which he produced from his waistcoat pocket there he said that'll make you remember it's your own property and mine that you are treating so disrespectfully i beg your pardon old chap said lancelot rebuked and remorseful don't mention it replied peter and whenever you decide to become rich and famous there's your model never never never cried lancelot when peter went at ten my poor beethoven what you must have suffered never mind i'll play you your moonlight sonata he touched the keys gently and his sorrows and his temptations faded from him he glided into bach and then into chopin and mendelssohn and at last drifted into dreamy improvisation his fingers moving almost of themselves his eyes half closed seeing only inward visions and then all at once he awoke with a start for beethoven was barking towards the door with pricked up ears and rigid tail sh you little beggar he murmured becoming conscious that the hour was late and that he himself had been noisy at unbeseeming hours what's the matter with you and with a sudden thought he threw open the door it was merely mary ann her face flashed so unexpectedly upon him had the piquancy of a vision but its expression was one of confusion and guilt there were tears on her cheeks in her hand was a bed room candlestick she turned quickly and began to mount the stairs lancelot put his hand on her shoulder and turned her face towards him and said in an imperious whisper now then what's up what are you crying about i ain't i mean i'm not crying said mary ann with a sob in her breath come come don't fib what's the matter i'm not crying it's only the music she murmured the music he echoed bewildered yessir the music always makes me cry but you can't call it crying it feels so nice oh then you've been listening yessir her eyes drooped in humiliation but you ought to have been in bed he said you get little enough sleep as it is it's better than sleep she answered the simple phrase vibrated through him like a beautiful minor chord he smoothed her hair tenderly poor child he said there was an instant's silence it was past midnight and the house was painfully still they stood upon the dusky landing across which a bar of light streamed from his half open door and only beethoven's eyes were upon them but lancelot felt no impulse to fondle her only just to lay his hand on her hair as in benediction and pity so you liked what i was playing he said not without a pang of personal pleasure yessir i never heard you play that before so you often listen i can hear you even in the kitchen oh it's just lovely i don't care what i have to do then if it's grates or plates or steps the music goes and goes and i feel back in the country again and standing as i used to love to stand of an evening by the stile under the big elm and watch how the sunset did redden the white birches and fade in the water oh it was so nice in the springtime with the hawthorn that grew on the other bank and the bluebells the pretty face was full of dreamy tenderness the eyes lit up witchingly she pulled herself up suddenly and stole a shy glance at her auditor yes yes go on he said tell me all you feel about the music and there's one song you sometimes play that makes me feel floating on and on like a great white swan she hummed a few bars of the gondel lied flawlessly dear me you have an ear he said pinching it and how did you like what i was playing just now he went on growing curious to know how his own improvisations struck her oh i liked it so much she whispered enthusiastically because it reminded me of my favourite one every moment i did think i thought you were going to come into that the whimsical sparkle leapt into his eyes and i thought i was so original he murmured but what i liked best she began then checked herself as if suddenly remembering she had never made a spontaneous remark before and lacking courage to establish a precedent yes what you liked best he said encouragingly that song you sang this afternoon she said shyly what song i sang no song he said puzzled for a moment oh yes that one about 'kiss me dear love good night' i was going upstairs but it made me stop just here and cry he made his comic grimace so it was you beethoven was barking at and i thought he had an ear and i thought you had an ear but no you're both philistines after all heigho she looked sad oughtn't i to ha' liked it she asked anxiously oh yes he said reassuringly it's very popular no drawing room is without it she detected the ironic ring in his voice it wasn't so much the music she began apologetically now now you're going to spoil yourself he said be natural but it wasn't she protested it was the words that's worse he murmured below his breath they reminded me of my mother as she laid dying ah said lancelot yes sir mother was a long time dying it was when i was a little girl and i used to nurse her i fancy it was our little sally's death that killed her she took to her bed after the funeral and never left it till she went to her own said mary ann with unconscious flippancy she used to look up to the ceiling and say that she was going to little sally and i remember i was such a silly then i brought mother flowers and apples and bits of cake to take to sally with my love i put them on her pillow but the flowers faded and the cake got mouldy mother was such a long time dying and at last i ate the apples myself i was so tired of waiting wasn't i silly and mary ann laughed a little laugh with tears in it then growing grave again she added and at last when mother was really on the point of death she forgot all about little sally and said she was going to meet tom and i remember thinking she was going to america i didn't know people talk nonsense before they die they do a great deal of it unfortunately said lancelot lightly trying to disguise from himself that his eyes were moist he seemed to realise now what she was a child a child who simpler than most children to start with had grown only in body whose soul had been stunted by uncounted years of dull and monotonous drudgery the blood burnt in his veins as he thought of the cruelty of circumstance and the heartless honesty of her mistress he made up his mind for the second time to give mrs leadbatter a piece of his mind in the morning well go to bed now my poor child he said or you'll get no rest at all yessir she went obediently up a couple of stairs then turned her head appealingly towards him the tears still glimmered on her eyelashes for an instant he thought she was expecting her kiss but she only wanted to explain anxiously once again that was why i liked that song 'kiss me good night dear love' it was what my mother yes yes i understand he broke in half amused though somehow the words did not seem so full of maudlin pathos to him now and there he drew her head towards him kiss me good night he did not complete the quotation indeed her lips were already drawn too close to his but ere he released her the long repressed thought had found expression you don't kiss anybody but me he said half playfully oh no sir said mary ann earnestly what more lightly still haven't you got half a dozen young men mary ann shook her head more regretfully than resentfully i told you i never go out except for little errands she had told him but his attention had been so concentrated on the ungrammatical form in which she had conveyed the information that the fact itself had made no impression now his anger against mrs leadbatter dwindled after all she was wise in not giving mary ann the run of the london streets but he hesitated how about the the milkman and the the other gentlemen please sir said mary ann i don't like them after that no man could help expressing his sense of her good taste then you won't kiss anybody but me he said as he let her go for the last time he had a quixotic sub consciousness that he was saving her from his kind by making her promise formally how could i mr lancelot and the brimming eyes shone with soft light i never shall never it sounded like a troth he went back to the room and shut the door but could not shut out her image the picture she had unwittingly supplied of herself took possession of his imagination he saw her almost as a dream figure the virginal figure he knew standing by the stream in the sunset amid the elms and silver birches with daisies in her hands and bluebells at her feet inhaling the delicate scent that wafted from the white hawthorn bushes and watching the water glide along till it seemed gradually to wash away the fading colours of the sunset that glorified it and as he dwelt on the vision he felt harmonies and phrases stirring and singing in his brain like a choir of awakened birds quickly he seized paper and wrote down the theme that flowed out at the point of his pen a reverie full of the haunting magic of quiet waters and woodland sunsets and the gracious innocence of maidenhood when it was done he felt he must give it a distinctive name he cast about for one pondering and rejecting titles innumerable countless lines of poetry ran through his head from which he sought to pick a word or two as one plucks a violet from a posy at last a half tender half whimsical look came into his face and picking his pen out of his hair he wrote merely marianne it was only natural that mary ann should be unable to maintain herself or be maintained at this idyllic level but her fall was aggravated by two circumstances neither of which had any particular business to occur the first was an intimation from the misogamist german professor that he had persuaded another of his old pupils to include a prize symphony by lancelot in the programme of a crystal palace concert this was of itself sufficient to turn lancelot's head away from all but thoughts of fame even if mary ann had not been luckless enough to be again discovered cleaning the steps and without gloves against such a spectacle the veriest idealist is powerless if mary ann did not immediately revert to the category of quadrupeds in which she had started it was only because of lancelot's supplementary knowledge of the creature but as he passed her by solicitous as before not to tread upon her he felt as if all the cold water in her pail were pouring down the back of his neck nevertheless the effect of both these turns of fortune was transient the symphony was duly performed and dismissed in the papers as promising if over ambitious the only tangible result was a suggestion from the popular composer who was a member of his club that lancelot should collaborate with him in a comic opera for the production of which he had facilities the composer confessed he had a fluent gift of tune but had no liking for the drudgery of orchestration and as lancelot was well up in these tedious technicalities the two might strike a partnership to mutual advantage lancelot felt insulted but retained enough mastery of himself to reply that he would think it over as he gave no signs of life or thought the popular composer then wrote to him at length on the subject offering him fifty pounds for the job half of it on account lancelot was in sore straits when he got the letter for his stock of money was dwindling to vanishing point and he dallied with the temptation sufficiently to take the letter home with him but his spirit was not yet broken and the letter crumpled like a rag was picked up by mary ann and straightened out and carefully placed upon the mantel shelf time did something of a similar service for mary ann herself picking her up from the crumpled attitude in which lancelot had detected her on the doorstep straightening her out again and replacing her upon her semi poetic pedestal but as with the cream laid notepaper the wrinklings could not be effaced entirely which was more serious for mary ann not that mary ann was conscious of these diverse humours in lancelot unconscious of changes in herself she could not conceive herself related to his variations of mood still less did she realise the inward struggle of which she was the cause she was vaguely aware that he had external worries for all his grandeur and if he was by turns brusque affectionate indifferent playful brutal charming callous demonstrative she no more connected herself with these vicissitudes than with the caprices of the weather if her sun smiled once a day it was enough how should she know that his indifference was often a victory over himself as his amativeness was a defeat if any excuse could be found for lancelot it would be that which he administered to his conscience morning and evening like a soothing syrup his position was grown so desperate that mary ann almost stood between him and suicide continued disappointment made his soul sick his proud heart fed on itself he would bite his lips till the blood came vowing never to give in and not only would he not move an inch from his ideal he would rather die than gratify peter by falling back on him he would never even accept that cheque which was virtually his own it was wonderful how in his stoniest moments the sight of mary ann's candid face eloquent with dumb devotion softened and melted him he would take her gloved hand and press it silently and mary ann never knew one iota of his inmost thought he could not bring himself to that indeed she never for a moment appeared to him in the light of an intelligent being at her best she was a sweet simple loving child and he scarce spoke to her at all now theirs was a silent communion he had no heart to converse with her as he had done the piano too was almost silent the canary sang less and less though spring was coming and glints of sunshine stole between the wires of its cage even beethoven sometimes failed to bark when there was a knock at the street door and at last there came a day when for the first time in his life lancelot inspected his wardrobe and hunted together his odds and ends of jewelry from this significant task he was aroused by hearing mrs leadbatter coughing in his sitting room he went in with an interrogative look oh my chest said mrs leadbatter patting it it's no use my denyin' of it sir i'm done up it's as much as i can do to crawl up to the top to bed i'm thinkin' i shall have to make up a bed in the kitchen it only shows 'ow right i was to send for my rosie though quite the lady and where will you find a nattier nursemaid in all bayswater nowhere assented lancelot automatically oh i didn't know you'd noticed her running in to see 'er pore old mother of a sunday arternoon said mrs leadbatter highly gratified well sir i won't say anything about the hextry gas though a poor widder and sevenpence hextry on the thousand but i'm thinkin' if you would give my rosie a lesson once a week on that there pianner it would be a kind of set off for you know sir the policeman tells me your winder is a landmark to 'im on the foggiest nights lancelot flushed then wrinkled his brows this was a new idea altogether mrs leadbatter stood waiting for his reply with a deferential smile tempered by asthmatic contortions but have you got a piano of your own oh no sir cried mrs leadbatter almost reproachfully well but how is your rosie to practise one lesson a week is of very little use anyway but unless she practises a good deal it'll only be a waste of time ah you don't know my rosie said mrs leadbatter shaking her head with sceptical pride you mustn't judge by other gels the way that gel picks up things is well i'll just tell you what 'er school teacher miss whiteman said she says my good lady interrupted lancelot i practised six hours a day myself yes but it don't come so natural to a man said mrs leadbatter unshaken and it don't look natural neither to see a man playin' the pianner it's like seein' him knittin' but lancelot was knitting his brows in a way that was exceedingly natural i may as well tell you at once that what you propose is impossible first of all because i am doubtful whether i shall remain in these rooms and secondly because i am giving up the piano immediately i only have it on hire and i i he felt himself blushing oh what a pity interrupted mrs leadbatter you might as well let me go on payin' the hinstalments instead of lettin' all you've paid go for nothing rosie ain't got much time but i could allow 'er a 'our a day if it was my own pianner lancelot explained hire did not mean the hire system but the idea of acquiring the piano having once fired mrs leadbatter's brain could not be extinguished the unexpected conclusion arrived at was that she was to purchase the piano on the hire system allowing it to stand in lancelot's room and that five shillings a week should be taken off his rent in return for six lessons of an hour each one of the hours counterbalancing the gas grievance reviewing the bargain when mrs leadbatter was gone lancelot did not think it at all bad for him use of the piano gas he murmured with a pathetic smile recalling the advertisements he had read before lighting on mrs leadbatter's and five shillings a week it's a considerable relief there's no loss of dignity either for nobody will know but i wonder what the governor would have said the thought shook him with silent laughter a spectator might have fancied he was sobbing but after the lessons began it might almost be said it was only when a spectator was present that he was not sobbing for rosie who was an awkward ungraceful young person proved to be the dullest and most butter fingered pupil ever invented for the torture of teachers at least so lancelot thought but then he had never had any other pupils and was not patient it must be admitted though that rosie giggled perpetually apparently finding endless humour in her own mistakes but the climax of the horror was the attendance of mrs leadbatter at the lessons for to lancelot's consternation she took it for granted that her presence was part of the contract she marched into the room in her best cap and sat smiling in the easy chair wheezing complacently and beating time with her foot occasionally she would supplement lancelot's critical observations it ain't as i fears to trust 'er with you sir she also remarked about three times a week for i knows sir you're a gentleman but it's the neighbours they never can mind their own business i told 'em you was going to give my rosie lessons and you know sir that they will talk of what don't concern 'em and after all sir it's an hour and an hour is sixty minutes ain't it sir and lancelot groaning inwardly and unable to deny this chronometry felt that an ironic providence was punishing him for his attentions to mary ann and yet he only felt more tenderly towards mary ann contrasted with these two vulgar females whom he came to conceive as her oppressors sitting in gauds and finery and taking lessons which had better befitted their cinderella the figure of mary ann definitely reassumed some of its antediluvian poetry if we may apply the adjective to that catastrophic washing of the steps and mary ann herself had grown gloomier once or twice he thought she had been crying though he was too numbed and apathetic to ask and was incapable of suspecting that rosie had anything to do with her tears he hardly noticed that rosie had taken to feeding the canary the question of how he should feed himself was becoming every day more and more menacing he saw starvation slowly closing in upon him like the walls of a torture chamber he had grown quite familiar with the pawnshop now though he still slipped in as though his goods were stolen and at last there came a moment when lancelot felt he could bear it no longer and then he suddenly saw daylight why should he teach only rosie nay why should he teach rosie at all if he was reduced to giving lessons and after all it was no degradation to do so no abandonment of his artistic ideal rather a solution of the difficulty so simple that he wondered it had not occurred to him before why should he give them at so wretched a price he would get another pupil other pupils who would enable him to dispense with the few shillings he made by rosie he would not ask anybody to recommend him pupils there was no need for his acquaintances to know and if he asked peter peter would probably play him some philanthropic trick no he would advertise after he had spent his last gold breast pin in advertisements he realised that to get piano forte pupils in london was as easy as to get songs published by the time he had quite realised it it was may and then he sat down to realise his future the future was sublimely simple as simple as his wardrobe had grown all his clothes were on his back in a week or two he would be on the streets for a poor widow could not be expected to lodge partially board with use of the piano gas an absolutely penniless young gentleman though he combined the blood of twenty county families with the genius of a pleiad of tone poets there was only one bright spot in the prospect rosie's lessons would come to an end what he would do when he got on the streets was not so clear as the rest of this prophetic vision he might take to a barrel organ but that would be a cruel waste of his artistic touch perhaps he would die on a doorstep like the professor of many languages whose starvation was recorded in that very morning's paper thus driven by the saturnine necessity that sneers at our puny resolutions lancelot began to meditate surrender for surrender of some sort must be either of life or ideal after so steadfast and protracted a struggle oh it was cruel it was terrible how noble how high minded he had been and this was how the fates dealt with him but at that moment sw eet went the canary and filled the room with its rapturous demi semi quavers its throat swelling its little body throbbing with joy of the sunshine and then lancelot remembered not the joy of the sunshine not the joy of life no merely mary ann noble high minded no let peter think that let posterity think that but he could not cozen himself thus he had fallen horribly vulgarly how absurd of him to set himself up as a saint a martyr an idealist he could not divide himself into two compartments like that and pretend that only one counted in his character who was he to talk of dying for art no he was but an everyday man he wanted mary ann yes he might as well admit that to himself now it was no use hum bugging himself any longer why should he give her up she was his discovery his treasure trove his property and if he could stoop to her why should he not stoop to popular work to devilling to anything that would rid him of these sordid cares bah away with all pretences was not this shamefaced pawning as vulgar as wounding to the artist's soul as the turning out of tawdry melodies yes he would escape from mrs leadbatter and her rosie he would write to that popular composer he had noticed his letter lying on the mantel piece the other day and accept the fifty pounds and whatever he did he could do anonymously so that peter wouldn't know after all he would escape from this wretched den and take a flat far away somewhere where nobody knew him and there he would sit and work with mary ann for his housekeeper poor mary ann how glad she would be when he told her the tears came into his eyes as he thought of her naive delight he would rescue her from this horrid monotonous slavery and happy thought he would have her to give lessons to instead of rosie yes he would refine her prune away all that reminded him of her wild growth so that it might no longer humiliate him to think to what a companion he had sunk how happy they would be of course the world would censure him if it knew but the world was stupid and prosaic and measured all things by its coarse rule of thumb it was the best thing that could happen to mary ann the best thing in the world and then the world wouldn't know sw eet went the canary sw eet this time the joy of the bird penetrated to his own soul the joy of life the joy of the sunshine he rang the bell violently as though he were sounding a clarion of defiance the trumpet of youth mary ann knocked at the door came in and began to draw on her gloves he was in a mad mood the incongruity struck him so that he burst out into a roar of laughter mary ann paused flushed and bit her lip the touch of resentment he had never noted before gave her a novel charm spicing her simplicity he came over to her and took her half bare hands no they were not so terrible after all perhaps she had awakened to her iniquities and had been trying to wash them white his last hesitation as to her worthiness to live with him vanished mary ann he said i'm going to leave these rooms the flush deepened but the anger faded she was a child again her big eyes full of tears he felt her hands tremble in his mary ann he went on how would you like me to take you with me do you mean it sir she asked eagerly yes dear it was the first time he had used the word the blood throbbed madly in her ears if you will come with me and be my little housekeeper we will go away to some nice spot and be quite alone together in the country if you like amid the foxglove and the meadowsweet or by the green waters where you shall stand in the sunset and dream and i will teach you music and the piano her eyes dilated and you shall not do any of this wretched nasty work any more what do you say sw eet sw eet said the canary in thrilling jubilation her happiness was choking her she could not speak and we will take the canary too unless i say good bye to you as well oh no you mustn't leave us here and then he said slowly it will not be good bye nor good night do you understand yes yes she breathed and her face shone but think think mary ann he said a sudden pang of compunction shooting through his breast he released her hands do you understand i understand i shall be with you always he replied uneasily i shall look after you always yes yes she breathed her bosom heaved always then his very first impression of her as a sort of white topsy recurred to him suddenly and flashed into speech mary ann i don't believe you know how you came into the world i dare say you 'specs you growed' no sir said mary ann gravely god made me that shook him strangely for a moment but the canary sang on sw eet sw w w w w eet iii and so it was settled he wrote the long delayed answer to the popular composer found him still willing to give out his orchestration and they met by appointment at the club i've got hold of a splendid book said the popular composer awfully clever jolly original bound to go from the french you know haven't had time to set to work on it old engagement to run over to monte carlo for a few days but i'll leave you the book you might care to look over it and i say if any catchy tunes suggest themselves as you go along you might just jot them down you know not worth while losing an idea eh my boy ha ha ha well good bye see you again when i come back don't suppose i shall be away more than a month good bye and having shaken lancelot's hand with tremendous cordiality the popular composer rushed downstairs and into a hansom lancelot walked home with the libretto and the five five pound notes he asked for mrs leadbatter and gave her a week's notice he wanted to drop rosie immediately on the plea of pressure of work but her mother received the suggestion with ill grace and said that rosie should come up and practise on her own piano all the same so he yielded to the complexities of the situation and found hope a wonderful sweetener of suffering despite rosie and her giggling and mrs leadbatter and her best cap and her asthma the week went by almost cheerfully he worked regularly at the comic opera nearly as happy as the canary which sang all day long and though scarcely a word more passed between him and mary ann their eyes met ever and anon in the consciousness of a sweet secret it was already friday afternoon he gathered together his few personal belongings his books his manuscripts opera innumerable there was room in his portmanteau for everything now he had no clothes on the monday the long nightmare would be over he would go down to some obscure seaside nook and live very quietly for a few weeks and gain strength and calm in the soft spring airs and watch hand in hand with mary ann the rippling scarlet trail of the setting sun fade across the green waters life no doubt would be hard enough still struggles and trials enough were yet before him but he would not think of that now enough that for a month or two there would be bread and cheese and kisses and then in the midst of a tender reverie with his hand on the lid of his portmanteau he was awakened by ominous sounds of objurgation from the kitchen his heart stood still he went down a few stairs and listened not another stroke of work do you do in my house mary ann then there was silence save for the thumping of his own heart what had happened he heard mrs leadbatter mounting the kitchen stairs wheezing and grumbling well of all the sly little things mary ann had been discovered his blood ran cold at the thought the silly creature had been unable to keep the secret not a word about 'im all this time oh the sly little thing who would hever a believed it and then in the intervals of mrs leadbatter's groanings there came to him the unmistakable sound of mary ann sobbing violently hysterically he turned from cold to hot in a fever of shame and humiliation how had it all come about oh yes he could guess the gloves what a fool he had been mrs leadbatter had unearthed the box why did he give her more than the pair that could always be kept hidden in her pocket yes it was the gloves and then there was the canary mrs leadbatter had suspected he was leaving her for a reason she had put two and two together she had questioned mary ann and the ingenuous little idiot had naively told her he was going to take her with him it didn't really matter of course he didn't suppose mrs leadbatter could exercise any control over mary ann but it was horrible to be discussed by her and rosie and then there was that meddlesome vicar who might step in and make things nasty mrs leadbatter's steps and wheezes and grumblings had arrived in the passage and lancelot hastily stole back into his room his heart continuing to flutter painfully he heard the complex noises reach his landing pass by and move up higher she wasn't coming in to him then he could endure the suspense no longer he threw open his door and said is there anything the matter mrs leadbatter paused and turned her head his there anything the matter she echoed looking down upon him a nice thing when a woman's troubled with hastmer and brought 'ome 'er daughter to take 'er place that she should 'ave to start 'untin' afresh why is rosie going away he said immeasurably relieved my rosie she's the best girl breathing it's that there mary ann wh a t he stammered mary ann leaving you well you don't suppose replied mrs leadbatter angrily as i can keep a gel in my kitchen as is a goin' to 'ave 'er own nors end kerridge her own horse and carriage repeated lancelot utterly dazed what ever are you talking about well there's the letter exclaimed mrs leadbatter indignantly see for yourself if you don't believe me i don't know how much two and a 'arf million dollars is but it sounds unkimmonly like a nors end kerridge and never said a word about 'im the whole time the sly little thing the universe seemed oscillating so that he grasped at the letter like a drunken man it was from the vicar he wrote i have much pleasure in informing you that our dear mary ann is the fortunate inheritress of two and a half million dollars by the death of her brother tom who as i learn from the lawyers who have applied to me for news of the family has just died in america leaving his money to his surviving relatives he was rather a wild young man but it seems he became the lucky possessor of some petroleum wells which made him wealthy in a few months i pray god mary ann may make a better use of the money than he would have done i want you to break the news to her please and to prepare her for my visit as i have to preach on sunday i cannot come to town before but on monday dv i shall run up and shall probably take her back with me as i desire to help her through the difficulties that will attend her entry into the new life how pleased you will be to think of the care you took of the dear child during these last five years i hope she is well and happy i think you omitted to write to me last christmas on the subject please give her my kindest regards and best wishes and say i shall be with her dv on monday the words swam uncertainly before lancelot's eyes but he got through them all at last he felt chilled and numbed he averted his face as he handed the letter back to mary ann's missus what a fortunate girl he said in a low stony voice fortunate ain't the word for it the mean sly little cat fancy never telling me a word about 'er brother all these years me as 'as fed her and clothed her and lodged her and kepper out of all mischief as if she'd bin my own daughter never let her go out bankhollidayin' in loose company as you can bear witness yourself sir and eddicated 'er out of 'er country talk and rough ways and made 'er the smart young woman she is fit to wait on the most troublesome of gentlemen and now she'll go away and say i used 'er 'arsh and overworked 'er and lord knows what don't tell me oh my poor chest i think you may make your mind quite easy said lancelot grimly i'm sure mary ann is perfectly satisfied with your treatment but she ain't there listen don't you hear her going on poor mary ann's sobs were still audible though exhaustion was making them momently weaker she's been going on like that ever since i broke the news to 'er and gave her a piece of my mind the sly little cat she wanted to go on scrubbing the kitchen and i had to take the brush away by main force a nice thing indeed a gel as can keep a nors end kerridge down on the cold kitchen stones 'twasn't likely i could allow that 'no mary ann' says i firmly 'you're a lady and if you don't know what's proper for a lady you'd best listen to them as does you go and buy yourself a dress and a jacket to be ready for that vicar who's been a real good kind friend to you he's coming to take you away on monday he is and how will you look in that dirty print here's a suvrin' says i 'out of my 'ard earned savin's and get a pair o' boots too you can git a sweet pair for s d at rackstraw's afore the sale closes' and with that i shoves the suvrin into 'er hand instead o' the scrubbin' brush and what does she do why busts out a cryin' and sits on the damp stones and sobs and sulks and stares at the suvrin in her hand as if i'd told her of a funeral instead of a fortune concluded mrs leadbatter alliteratively but you did her brother's death said lancelot that's what she's crying about mrs leadbatter was taken aback by this obverse view of the situation but recovering herself she shook her head i wouldn't cry for no brother that lef me to starve when he was rollin' in two and a 'arf million dollars she said sceptically and i'm sure my rosie wouldn't but she never 'ad nobody to leave her money poor dear child except me please gaud it's only the fools as 'as the luck in this world and having thus relieved her bosom she resumed her panting progress upwards the last words rang on in lancelot's ears long after he had returned to his room in the utter breakdown and confusion of his plans and his ideas it was the one definite thought he clung to as a swimmer in a whirlpool clings to a rock his brain refused to concentrate itself on any other aspect of the situation he could not would not dared not think of anything else he knew vaguely he ought to rejoice with her over her wonderful stroke of luck that savoured of the fairy story but everything was swamped by that one almost resentful reflection oh the irony of fate blind fate showering torrents of gold upon this foolish babyish household drudge who was all emotion and animal devotion without the intellectual outlook of a hottentot and leaving men of genius to starve or sell their souls for a handful of it how was the wisdom of the ages justified verily did fortune favour fools and tom the wicked he had flourished as the wicked always do like the green bay tree as the psalmist discovered ever so many centuries ago but gradually the wave of bitterness waned he found himself listening placidly and attentively to the joyous trills and roulades of the canary till the light faded and the grey dusk crept into the room and stilled the tiny winged lover of the sunshine then beethoven came and rubbed himself against his master's leg and lancelot got up as one wakes from a dream and stretched his cramped limbs dazedly and rang the bell mechanically for tea he was groping on the mantel piece for the matches when the knock at the door came and he did not turn round till he had found them he struck a light expecting to see mrs leadbatter or rosie he started to find it was merely mary ann but she was no longer merely mary ann he remembered with another shock she loomed large to him in the match light he seemed to see her through a golden haze tumultuous images of her glorified gilded future rose and mingled dizzily in his brain and yet was he dreaming surely it was the same mary ann with the same winsome face and the same large pathetic eyes ringed though they were with the shadow of tears mary ann in her neat white cap yes and in her tan kid gloves he rubbed his eyes was he really awake or a thought still more dizzying had he been dreaming had he fallen asleep and reinless fancy had played him the fantastic trick from which cramped and dazed he had just awakened to the old sweet reality mary ann he cried wildly the lighted match fell from his fingers and burnt itself out unheeded on the carpet yessir is it true his emotion choked him is it true you've come into two and a half million dollars yessir and i've brought you some tea the room was dark but darkness seemed to fall on it as she spoke but why are you waiting on me then he said slowly don't you know that you that you please mr lancelot i wanted to come in and see you he felt himself trembling but mrs leadbatter told me she wouldn't let you do any more work i told missus that i must i told her she couldn't get another girl before monday if then and if she didn't let me i wouldn't buy a new dress and a pair of boots with her sovereign it isn't suvrin is it sir no murmured lancelot smiling in spite of himself with her sovereign and i said i would be all dirty on monday but what can you get for a sovereign he asked irrelevantly he felt his mind wandering away from him oh ever such a pretty dress the picture of mary ann in a pretty dress painted itself upon the darkness how lovely the child would look in some creamy white evening dress with a rose in her hair he wondered that in all his thoughts of their future he had never dressed her up thus in fancy to feast his eyes on the vision and so the vicar will find you in a pretty dress he said at last no sir but you promised mrs leadbatter to i promised to buy a dress with her sovereign but i shan't be here when the vicar comes he can't come till the afternoon why where will you be he said his heart beginning to beat fast with you she replied with a faint accent of surprise he steadied himself against the mantel piece but he began and ended is that honest he dimly descried her lips pouting we can always send her another when we have one she said he stood there dumb glad of the darkness i must go down now she said i mustn't stay long why he articulated rosie she replied briefly what about rosie she watches me ever since she came don't you understand this time he was the dullard he felt an extra quiver of repugnance for rosie but said nothing while mary ann briskly lit the gas and threw some coals on the decaying fire he was pleased she was going down he was suffocating he did not know what to say to her and yet as she was disappearing through the doorway he had a sudden feeling things couldn't be allowed to remain an instant in this impossible position mary ann he cried yessir she turned back her face wore merely the expectant expression of a summoned servant the childishness of her behaviour confused him irritated him are you foolish he cried suddenly half regretting the phrase the instant he had uttered it her lip twitched no mr lancelot she faltered but you talk as if you were he said less roughly you mustn't run away from the vicar just when he is going to take you to the lawyer's to certify who you are and see that you get your money but i don't want to go with the vicar i want to go with you you said you would take me with you she was almost in tears now yes but don't you don't you understand that that he stammered then temporising but i can wait can't the vicar wait said mary ann he had never known her show such initiative he saw that it was hopeless that the money had made no more dint upon her consciousness than some vague dream that her whole being was set towards the new life with him and shrank in horror from the menace of the vicar's withdrawal of her in the opposite direction if joy and redemption had not already lain in the one quarter the advantages of the other might have been more palpably alluring as it was her consciousness was full up in the matter so to speak he saw that he must tell her plain and plump startle her out of her simple confidence listen to me mary ann yessir you are a young woman not a baby strive to grasp what i am going to tell you yessir in a half sob that vibrated with the obstinate resentment of a child that knows it is to be argued out of its instincts by adult sophistry what had become of her passive personality you are now the owner of two and a half million dollars that is about five hundred thousand pounds five hundred thousand pounds think of ten sovereigns ten golden sovereigns like that mrs leadbatter gave you then ten times as much as that and ten times as much as all that he spread his arms wider and wider and ten times as much as all that and then here his arms were prematurely horizontal so he concluded hastily but impressively and then fifty times as much as all that do you understand how rich you are yessir she was fumbling nervously at her gloves half drawing them off now all this money will last for ever for you invest it if only at three per cent never mind what that is and then you get fifteen thousand a year fifteen thousand golden sovereigns to spend every please sir i must go now rosie oh but you can't go yet i have lots more to tell you yessir but can't you ring for me again in the gravity of the crisis the remark tickled him he laughed with a strange ring in his laughter all right run away you sly little puss he smiled on as he poured out his tea finding a relief in prolonging his sense of the humour of the suggestion but his heart was heavy and his brain a whirl he did not ring again till he had finished tea she came in and took her gloves out of her pocket no no he cried strangely exasperated an end to this farce put them away you don't need gloves any more she squeezed them into her pocket nervously and began to clear away the things with abrupt movements looking askance every now and then at the overcast handsome face at last he nerved himself to the task and said well as i was saying mary ann the first thing for you to think of is to make sure of all this money this fifteen thousand pounds a year you see you will be able to live in a fine manor house such as the squire lived in in your village surrounded by a lovely park with a lake in it for swans and boats mary ann had paused in her work slop basin in hand the concrete details were beginning to take hold of her imagination oh but i should like a farm better she said a large farm with great pastures and ever so many cows and pigs and outhouses and a oh just like atkinson's farm and meat every day with pudding on sundays oh if father was alive wouldn't he be glad yes you can have a farm anything you like oh how lovely a piano yes six pianos and you will learn me he shuddered and hesitated well i can't say mary ann why not why won't you you said you would you learn rosie i may not be there you see he said trying to put a spice of playfulness into his tones oh but you will she said feverishly you will take me there we will go there instead of where you said instead of the green waters her eyes were wild and witching he groaned inwardly i cannot promise you now he said slowly don't you see that everything is altered what's altered you are here and here am i her apprehension made her almost epigrammatic ah but you are quite different now mary ann i'm not i want to be with you just the same he shook his head i can't take you with me he said decisively why not she caught hold of his arm entreatingly you are not the same mary ann to other people you are a somebody before you were a nobody nobody cared or bothered about you you were no more than a dead leaf whirling in the street yes you cared and bothered about me she cried clinging to him her gratitude cut him like a knife the eyes of the world are on you now he said people will talk about you if you go away with me now why will they talk about me what harm shall i do them her phrases puzzled him i don't know that you will harm them he said slowly but you will harm yourself how will i harm myself she persisted well one day you will want a a husband with all that money it is only right and proper you should marry no mr lancelot i don't want a husband i don't want to marry i should never want to go away from you there was another painful silence he sought refuge in a brusque playfulness i see you understand i'm not going to marry you yessir he felt a slight relief well then he said more playfully still suppose i wanted to go away from you mary ann but you love me she said unaffrighted he started back perceptibly after a moment he replied still playfully i never said so no sir but but she lowered her eyes a coquette could not have done it more artlessly but i know it the accusation of loving her set all his suppressed repugnances and prejudices bristling in contradiction he cursed the weakness that had got him into this soul racking situation the silence clamoured for him to speak to do something what what were you crying about before he said abruptly i i don't know sir she faltered was it tom's death no sir not much i did think of him blackberrying with me and our little sally but then he was so wicked it must have been what missus said and i was frightened because the vicar was coming to take me away away from you and then oh i don't know i felt i couldn't tell you i felt i must cry and cry like that night when she paused suddenly and looked away when he said encouragingly i must go rosie she murmured and took up the tea tray that night when he repeated tenaciously when you first kissed me she said he blushed that that made you cry he stammered why please sir i don't know mary ann he said gravely don't you see that when i did that i was like your brother tom no sir tom didn't kiss me like that i don't mean that mary ann i mean i was wicked mary ann stared at him don't you think so mary ann oh no sir you were very good no no mary ann don't say good ever since then i have been so happy she persisted oh that was because you were wicked too he explained grimly we have both been very wicked mary ann and so we had better part now before we get more wicked she stared at him plaintively suspecting a lurking irony but not sure but you didn't mind being wicked before she protested i'm not so sure i mind now it's for your sake mary ann believe me my dear he took her bare hand kindly and felt it burning you're a very simple foolish little thing yes you are don't cry there's no harm in being simple why you told me yourself how silly you were once when you brought your dying mother cakes and flowers to take to your dead little sister well you're just as foolish and childish now mary ann though you don't know it any more than you did then after all you're only nineteen i found it out from the vicar's letter but a time will come yes i'll warrant in only a few months' time you'll see how wise i am and how sensible you have been to be guided by me i never wished you any harm mary ann believe me my dear i never did and i hope i do hope so much that this money will make you happy so you see you mustn't go away with me now you don't want everybody to talk of you as they did of your brother tom do you dear think what the vicar would say but mary ann had broken down under the touch of his hand and the gentleness of his tones i was a dead leaf so long i don't care she sobbed passionately nobody never bothered to call me wicked then why should i bother now beneath the mingled emotions her words caused him was a sense of surprise at her recollection of his metaphor hush you're a silly little child he repeated sternly hush or mrs leadbatter will hear you he went to the door and closed it tightly listen mary ann let me tell you once for all that even if you were fool enough to be willing to go with me i wouldn't take you with me it would be doing you a terrible wrong she interrupted him quietly why more now than before he dropped her hand as if stung and turned away he knew he could not answer that to his own satisfaction much less to hers you're a silly little baby he repeated resentfully i think you had better go down now missus will be wondering mary ann's sobs grew more spasmodic you are going away without me she cried hysterically he went to the door again as if apprehensive of an eavesdropper the scene was becoming terrible the passive personality had developed with a vengeance hush hush he cried imperatively you are going away without me i shall never see you again be sensible mary ann you will be you won't take me with you how can i take you with me he cried brutally losing every vestige of tenderness for this distressful vixen don't you understand that it's impossible unless i marry you he concluded contemptuously mary ann's sobs ceased for a moment can't you marry me then she said plaintively you know it is impossible he replied curtly why is it impossible she breathed because he saw her sobs were on the point of breaking out and had not the courage to hear them afresh he dared not wound her further by telling her straight out that with all her money she was ridiculously unfit to bear his name that it was already a condescension for him to have offered her his companionship on any terms he resolved to temporise again go downstairs now there's a good girl and i'll tell you in the morning i'll think it over go to bed early and have a long nice sleep missus will let you now it isn't monday yet we have plenty of time to talk it over she looked up at him with large appealing eyes uncertain but calming down do now there's a dear he stroked her wet cheek soothingly yessir and almost instinctively she put up her lips for a good night kiss he brushed them hastily with his she went out softly drying her eyes his own grew moist he was touched by the pathos of her implicit trust the soft warmth of her lips still thrilled him how sweet and loving she was the little dialogue rang in his brain can't you marry me then you know it is impossible why is it impossible because because what an audacious voice whispered why should he not he stilled the voice but it refused to be silent was obdurate insistent like mary ann herself because oh because of a hundred things he told it because she is no fit mate for me because she would degrade me make me ridiculous an unfortunate fortune hunter the butt of the witlings how could i take her about as my wife how could she receive my friends for a housekeeper a good loving housekeeper she is perfection but for a wife my wife the companion of my soul impossible why is it impossible repeated the voice catching up the cue and then from that point the dialogue began afresh because this and because that and because the other in short because i am lancelot and she is merely mary ann but she is not merely mary ann any longer urged the voice yes for all her money she is merely mary ann and am i to sell myself for her money i who have stood out so nobly so high mindedly through all these years of privation and struggle and her money is all in dollars pah i smell the oil struck ile of all things in the world her brother should just go and strike ile a great shudder traversed his form everything seems to have been arranged out of pure cussedness just to spite me she would have been happier without the money poor child without the money but with me what will she do with all her riches she will only be wretched like me then why not be happy together impossible why is it impossible because her dollars would stick in my throat the oil would make me sick and what would peter say and my brother not that i care what he says and my acquaintances what does that matter to you while you were a dead leaf nobody bothered to talk about you they let you starve you with your genius now you can let them talk you with your heiress five hundred thousand pounds more than you will make with all your operas if you live a century fifteen thousand a year why you could have all your works performed at your own expense and for your own sole pleasure if you chose as the king of bavaria listened to wagner's operas you could devote your life to the highest art nay is it not a duty you owe to the world would it not be a crime against the future to draggle your wings with sordid cares to sink to lower aims by refusing this heaven sent boon the thought clung to him he rose and laid out heaps of muddled manuscript opera disjecta and turned their pages yes yes give us life they seemed to cry to him we are dead drops of ink wake us to life and beauty how much longer are we to lie here dusty in death we have waited so patiently have pity on us raise us up from our silent tomb and we will fly abroad through the whole earth chanting your glory yea the world shall be filled to eternity with the echoes of our music and the splendour of your name but he shook his head and sighed and put them back in their niches and placed the comic opera he had begun in the centre of the table there lie the only dollars that will ever come my way he said aloud and humming the opening bars of a lively polka from the manuscript he took up his pen and added a few notes then he paused the polka would not come the other voice was louder it would be a degradation he repeated to silence it it would be merely for her money i don't love her are you so sure of that if i really loved her i shouldn't refuse to marry her are you so sure of that what's the use of all this wire drawing the whole thing is impossible why is it impossible he shrugged his shoulders impatiently refusing to be drawn back into the eddy and completed the bar of the polka then he threw down his pen rose and paced the room in desperation was ever any man in such a dilemma he cried aloud did ever any man get such a chance retorted his silent tormentor yes but i mustn't seize the chance it would be mean it would be meaner not to you're not thinking of that poor girl only of yourself to leave her now would be more cowardly than to have left her when she was merely mary ann she needs you even more now that she will be surrounded by sharks and adventurers poor poor mary ann it is you who have the right to protect her now you were kind to her when the world forgot her you owe it to yourself to continue to be good to her no no i won't humbug myself if i married her it would only be for her money no no don't humbug yourself you like her you care for her very much you are thrilling at this very moment with the remembrance of her lips to night think of what life will be with her life full of all that is sweet and fair love and riches and leisure for the highest art and fame and the promise of immortality you are irritable sensitive delicately organised these sordid carking cares these wretched struggles these perpetual abasements of your highest self a few more years of them they will wreck and ruin you body and soul how many men of genius have married their housekeepers even good clumsy homely bodies who have kept their husbands' brain calm and his pillow smooth and again a man of genius is the one man who can marry anybody the world expects him to be eccentric and mary ann is no coarse city weed but a sweet country bud how splendid will be her blossoming under the sun do not fear that she will ever shame you she will look beautiful and men will not ask her to talk nor will you want her to talk she will sit silent in the cosy room where you are working and every now and again you will glance up from your work at her and draw inspiration from her sweet presence so pull yourself together man your troubles are over and life henceforth one long blissful dream come burn me that tinkling inglorious comic opera and let the whole sordid past mingle with its ashes so strong was the impulse so alluring the picture that he took up the comic opera and walked towards the fire his fingers itching to throw it in but he sat down again after a moment and went on with his work it was imperative he should make progress with it he could not afford to waste his time which was money because another person mary ann to wit had come into a superfluity of both in spite of which the comic opera refused to advance somehow he did not feel in the mood for gaiety he threw down his pen in despair and disgust but the idea of not being able to work rankled in him every hour seemed suddenly precious now that he had resolved to make money in earnest now that for a year or two he could have no other aim or interest in life perhaps it was that he wished to overpower the din of contending thoughts then a happy thought came to him he rummaged out peter's ballad he would write a song on the model of that as peter had recommended something tawdry and sentimental with a cheap accompaniment he placed the ballad on the rest and started going through it to get himself in the vein but to night the air seemed to breathe an ineffable melancholy the words no longer mawkish had grown infinitely pathetic kiss me good night dear love dream of the old delight my spirit is summoned above kiss me dear love good night the hot tears ran down his cheeks as he touched the keys softly and lingeringly he could go no further than the refrain he leant his elbows on the keyboard and dropped his head upon his arms the clashing notes jarred like a hoarse cry then vibrated slowly away into a silence that was broken only by his sobs he rose late the next day after a sleep that was one prolonged nightmare full of agonised abortive striving after something that always eluded him he knew not what and when he woke after a momentary breath of relief at the thought of the unreality of these vague horrors he woke to the heavier nightmare of reality oh those terrible dollars he drew the blind and saw with a dull acquiescence that the brightness of the may had fled the wind was high he heard it fly past moaning in the watery sky the round sun loomed silver pale and blurred to his fevered eye it looked like a worn dollar he turned away shivering and began to dress he opened the door a little and pulled in his lace up boots which were polished in the highest style of art but when he tried to put one on his toes stuck fast in the opening and refused to advance annoyed he put his hand in and drew out a pair of tan gloves perfectly new astonished he inserted his hand again and drew out another pair then another reddening uncomfortably for he divined something of the meaning he examined the left boot and drew out three more pairs of gloves two new and one slightly soiled he sank down half dressed on the bed with his head on his breast leaving his boots and mary ann's gloves scattered about the floor he was angry humiliated he felt like laughing and he felt like sobbing at last he roused himself finished dressing and rang for breakfast rosie brought it up hullo where's mary ann he said lightly she's above work now said rosie with an unamiable laugh you know about her fortune yes but your mother told me she insisted on going about her work till monday so she said yesterday silly little thing but to day she says she'll only help mother in the kitchen and do all the boots of a morning she won't do any more waiting ah said lancelot crumbling his toast i don't believe she knows what she wants concluded rosie turning to go then i suppose she's in the kitchen now he said pouring out his coffee down the side of his cup no she's gone out now sir gone out he put down the coffee pot his saucer was full gone out where only to buy things you know her vicar is coming to take her away the day after tomorrow and mother wanted her to look tidy enough to travel with the vicar so she gave her a sovereign ah yes your mother said something about it and yet she won't answer the bells said rosie and mother's asthma is worse so i don't know whether i shall be able to take my lesson to day mr lancelot i'm so sorry because it's the last rosie probably did not intend the ambiguity of the phrase there was real regret in her voice do you like learning then said lancelot softened for the first time towards his pupil his nerves seemed strangely flaccid to day he did not at all feel the relief he should have felt at foregoing his daily infliction ever so much sir i know i laugh too much sometimes but i don't mean it sir i suppose i couldn't go on with the lessons after you leave here she looked at him wistfully well he had crumbled the toast all to little pieces now i don't quite know perhaps i shan't go away after all rosie's face lit up oh i'll tell mother she exclaimed joyously no don't tell her yet i haven't quite settled but if i stay of course the lessons can go on as before oh i do hope you'll stay said rosie and went out of the room with airy steps evidently bent on disregarding his prohibition if indeed it had penetrated to her consciousness lancelot made no pretence of eating breakfast he had it removed and then fished out his comic opera but nothing would flow from his pen he went over to the window and stood thoughtfully drumming on the panes with it and gazing at the little drab coloured street with its high roof of mist along which the faded dollar continued to spin imperceptibly suddenly he saw mary ann turn the corner and come along towards the house carrying a big parcel and a paper bag in her ungloved hands how buoyantly she walked he had never before seen her move in free space nor realised how much of the grace of a sylvan childhood remained with her still what a pretty colour there was on her cheeks too he ran down to the street door and opened it before she could knock the colour on her cheeks deepened at the sight of him but now that she was near he saw her eyes were swollen with crying why do you go out without gloves mary ann he inquired sternly remember you're a lady now she started and looked down at his boots then up at his face oh yes i found them mary ann a nice graceful way of returning me my presents mary ann you might at least have waited till christmas then i should have thought santa claus sent them please sir i thought it was the surest way for me to send them back but what made you send them back at all mary ann's lip quivered her eyes were cast down oh mr lancelot you know she faltered but i don't know he said sharply please let me go downstairs mr lancelot missus must have heard me come in you shan't go downstairs till you've told me what's come over you come upstairs to my room yessir she followed him obediently he turned round brusquely here give me your parcels and almost snatching them from her he carried them upstairs and deposited them on his table on top of the comic opera now then sit down you can take off your hat and jacket yessir he helped her to do so now mary ann why did you return me those gloves please sir i remember in our village when when she felt a diffidence in putting the situation into words and wound up quickly something told me i ought to i don't understand you he grumbled comprehending only too well but why couldn't you come in and give them to me instead of behaving in that ridiculous way i didn't want to see you again she faltered he saw her eyes were welling over with tears you were crying again last night he said sharply yessir but what did you have to cry about now aren't you the luckiest girl in the world yessir as she spoke a flood of sunlight poured suddenly into the room the sun had broken through the clouds the worn dollar had become a dazzling gold piece the canary stirred in its cage then what were you crying about i didn't want to be lucky you silly girl i have no patience with you and why didn't you want to see me again please mr lancelot i knew you wouldn't like it what ever put that into your head i knew it sir said mary ann firmly it came to me when i was crying i was thinking all sorts of things of my mother and our sally and the old pig that used to get so savage and about the way the organ used to play in church and then all at once somehow i knew it would be best for me to do what you told me to buy my dress and go back with the vicar and be a good girl and not bother you because you were so good to me and it was wrong for me to worry you and make you miserable tw oo tw oo it was the canary starting on a preliminary carol so i thought it best she concluded tremulously not to see you again it would only be two days and after that it would be easier i could always be thinking of you just the same mr lancelot always that wouldn't annoy you sir would it because you know sir you wouldn't know it lancelot was struggling to find a voice but didn't you forget something you had to do mary ann he said in hoarse accents she raised her eyes swiftly a moment then lowered them again i don't know i didn't mean to she said apologetically didn't you forget that i told you to come to me and get my answer to your question no sir i didn't forget that was what i was thinking of all night about your asking me to marry you yessir and my saying it was impossible yessir and i said 'why is it impossible' and you said 'because ' and then you left off but please mr lancelot i didn't want to know the answer this morning but i want to tell you why don't you want to know because i found out for myself mr lancelot that's what i found out when i was crying but there was nothing to find out sir i knew it all along it was silly of me to ask you but you know i am silly sometimes sir like i was when my mother was dying and that was why i made up my mind not to bother you any more mr lancelot i knew you wouldn't like to tell me straight out and what was the answer you found out ah you won't speak it looks as if you don't like to tell me straight out come come mary ann tell me why why it is impossible she looked up at last and said slowly and simply because i am not good enough for you mr lancelot he put his hands suddenly to his eyes he did not see the flood of sunlight he did not hear the mad jubilance of the canary no mary ann his voice was low and trembling i will tell you why it is impossible i didn't know last night but i know now it is impossible because you are right i don't like to tell you straight out she opened her eyes wide and stared at him in puzzled expectation mary ann he bent his head it is impossible because i am not good enough for you mary ann grew scarlet then she broke into a little nervous laugh oh mr lancelot don't make fun of me believe me my dear he said tenderly raising his head i wouldn't make fun of you for two million million dollars it is the truth the bare miserable wretched truth i am not worthy of you mary ann i don't understand you sir she faltered thank heaven for that he said with the old whimsical look if you did you would think meanly of me ever after yes that is why mary ann i am a selfish brute selfish to the last beat of my heart to the inmost essence of my every thought beethoven is worth two of me aren't you beethoven the spaniel thinking himself called trotted over he never calculates he just comes and licks my hand don't look at me as if i were mad mary ann you don't understand me thank heaven again come now does it never strike you that if i were to marry you now it would be only for your two and a half million dollars no sir faltered mary ann i thought not he said triumphantly no you will always remain a fool i am afraid mary ann she met his contempt with an audacious glance but i know it wouldn't be for that mr lancelot no no of course it wouldn't be not now but it ought to strike you just the same it doesn't make you less a fool mary ann there there i don't mean to be unkind and as i think i told you once before it's not so very dreadful to be a fool a rogue is a worse thing mary ann all i want to do is to open your eyes two and a half million dollars are an awful lot of money a terrible lot of money do you know how long it will be before i make two million dollars mary ann no sir she looked at him wonderingly two million years yes my child i can tell you now you thought i was rich and grand i know but all the while i was nearly a beggar perhaps you thought i was playing the piano yes and teaching rosie for my amusement perhaps you thought i sat up writing half the night out of sleeplessness he smiled at the phrase or a wanton desire to burn mrs leadbatter's gas no mary ann i have to get my own living by hard work by good work if i can by bad work if i must but always by hard work while you will have fifteen thousand pounds a year i shall be glad overjoyed to get fifteen hundred and while i shall be grinding away body and soul for my fifteen hundred your fifteen thousand will drop into your pockets even if you keep your hands there all day don't look so sad mary ann i'm not blaming you it's not your fault in the least it's only one of the many jokes of existence the only reason i want to drive this into your head is to put you on your guard though i don't think myself good enough to marry you there are lots of men who will think they are though they don't know you it is you not me who are grand and rich mary ann beware of men like me poor and selfish and when you do marry oh mr lancelot cried mary ann bursting into tears at last why do you talk like that you know i shall never marry anybody else hush hush mary ann i thought you were going to be a good girl and never cry again dry your eyes now will you yessir here take my handkerchief yessir but i won't marry anybody else you make me smile mary ann when you brought your mother that cake for sally you didn't know a time would come when oh please sir i know that but you said yesterday i was a young woman now and this is all different to that no it isn't mary ann when they've put you to school and made you a ward in chancery or something and taught you airs and graces and dressed you up a pang traversed his heart as the picture of her in the future flashed for a moment upon his inner eye why by that time you'll be a different mary ann outside and inside don't shake your head i know better than you we grow and become different life is full of chances and human beings are full of changes and nothing remains fixed then perhaps she flushed up her eyes sparkled perhaps she grew dumb and sad again perhaps what he waited for her thought the rapturous trills of the canary alone possessed the silence perhaps you'll change too she flashed a quick deprecatory glance at him her eyes were full of soft light this time he was dumb sw eet trilled the canary sw eet though lancelot felt the throbbings of his heart must be drowning its song acutely answered he said at last you're not such a fool after all mary ann but i'm afraid it will never be dear perhaps if i also made two million dollars and if i felt i had grown worthy of you i might come to you and say two and two are four let us go into partnership but then you see he went on briskly the odds are i may never even have two thousand perhaps i'm as much a duffer in music as in other things perhaps you'll be the only person in the world who has ever heard my music for no one will print it mary ann perhaps i shall be that very common thing a complete failure and be worse off than even you ever were mary ann oh mr lancelot i'm so sorry and her eyes filled again with tears oh don't be sorry for me i'm a man i dare say i shall pull through just put me out of your mind dear let all that happened at baker's terrace be only a bad dream a very bad dream i am afraid i must call it forget me mary ann everything will help you to forget me thank heaven it'll be the best thing for you promise me now yessir if you will promise me promise you what to do me a favour certainly dear if i can you have the money mr lancelot instead of me i don't want it and then you could now now mary ann he interrupted laughing nervously you're getting foolish again after talking so sensibly oh but why not she said plaintively it is impossible he said curtly why is it impossible she persisted because he began and then he realised with a start that they had come back again to that same old mechanical series of questions if only in form because there is only one thing i could ever bring myself to ask you for in this world he said slowly yes what is that she said flutteringly he laid his hand tenderly on her hair merely mary ann she leapt up oh mr lancelot take me take me you do love me you do love me he bit his lip i am a fool he said roughly forget me i ought not to have said anything i spoke only of what might be in the dim future if the chances and changes of life bring us together again as they never do no you were right mary ann it is best we should not meet again remember your resolution last night yessir her submissive formula had a smack of sullenness but she regained her calm swallowing the lump in her throat that made her breathing difficult good bye then mary ann he said taking her hard red hands in his good bye mr lancelot the tears she would not shed were in her voice please sir could you couldn't you do me a favour nothing about money sir well if i can he said kindly couldn't you just play good night and good bye for the last time you needn't sing it only play it why what an odd girl you are he said with a strange spasmodic laugh why certainly i'll do both if it will give you any pleasure and releasing her hands he sat down to the piano and played the introduction softly he felt a nervous thrill going down his spine as he plunged into the mawkish words and when he came to the refrain he had an uneasy sense that mary ann was crying he dared not look at her he sang on bravely kiss me good night dear love dream of the old delight my spirit is summoned above kiss me dear love good night he couldn't go through another verse he felt himself all a quiver every nerve shattered he jumped up yes his conjecture had been right mary ann was crying he laughed spasmodically again the thought had occurred to him how vain peter would be if he could know the effect of his commonplace ballad there i'll kiss you too dear he said huskily still smiling that'll be for the last time their lips met and then mary ann seemed to fade out of the room in a blur of mist an instant after there was a knock at the door forgot her parcels after a last good bye thought lancelot and continued to smile at the comicality of the new episode he cleared his throat come in he cried and then he saw that the parcels were gone too and it must be rosie but it was merely mary ann i forgot to tell you mr lancelot she said her accents were almost cheerful that i'm going to church to morrow morning to church he echoed yes i haven't been since i left the village but missus says i ought to go in case the vicar asks me what church i've been going to i see he said smiling on she was closing the door when it opened again just revealing mary ann's face well he said amused but i'll do your boots all the same mr lancelot and the door closed with a bang they did not meet again on the monday afternoon the vicar duly came and took mary ann away all baker's terrace was on the watch for her story had now had time to spread the weather remained bright it was cold but the sky was blue mary ann had borne up wonderfully but she burst into tears as she got into the cab sweet sensitive little thing said baker's terrace what a good woman you must be mrs leadbatter said the vicar wiping his spectacles as part of baker's terrace lancelot witnessed the departure from his window for he had not left after all beethoven was barking his short snappy bark the whole time at the unwonted noises and the unfamiliar footsteps he almost extinguished the canary though that was clamorous enough shut up you noisy little devils growled lancelot and taking the comic opera he threw it on the dull fire the thick sheets grew slowly blacker and blacker as if with rage while lancelot thrust the five five pound notes into an envelope addressed to the popular composer and scribbled a tiny note dear peter if you have not torn up that cheque i shall be glad of it by return yours lancelot ps i send by this post a reverie called 'marianne' which is the best thing i have done and should be glad if you could induce brahmson to look at it a big sudden blaze like a jubilant bonfire shot up in the grate and startled beethoven into silence but the canary took it for an extra flood of sunshine and trilled and demi semi quavered like mad sw eet sweet by jove said lancelot starting up mary ann's left her canary behind then the old whimsical look came over his face i must keep it for her he murmured what a responsibility i suppose i oughtn't to let rosie look after it any more let me see what did peter say canary seed biscuits yes i must be careful not to give it butter curious i didn't think of her canary when i sent back all those gloves but i doubt if i could have squeezed it in my boots are only sevens after all to say nothing of the cage
