elijahs goblet the hirelings samooborona list of illustrations at last i said good morning frontispiece to face page i work onon shabbos you compare my wife to a kangaroo the jews scattered before him like dogs the model of sorrows the model of sorrows chapter i how i found the model i cannot pretend that my ambition to paint the man of sorrows had any religious inspiration though i fear my dear old dad at the parsonage at first took it as a sign of awakening grace and yet as an artist i have always been loath to draw a line between the spiritual and the beautiful for i have ever held that the beautiful has in it the same infinite element as forms the essence of religion but i cannot explain very intelligibly what i mean for my brush is the only instrument through which i can speak and if i am here paradoxically proposing to use my pen to explain what my brush failed to make clear it is because the criticism with which my picture of the man of sorrows has been assailed drives me to this attempt at verbal elucidation my picture let us suppose is halfarticulate perhaps my pen can manage to say the other half especially as this other half mainly consists of things told me and things seen and in the first place let me explain that the conception of the picture which now hangs in its gilded frame is far from the conception with which i startedwas in fact the ultimate stage of an evolutionfor i began with nothing deeper in my mind than to image a realistic christ the christ who sat in the synagogue of jerusalem or walked about the shores of galilee as a painter in love with the modern it seemed to me that despite the innumerable representations of him by the masters of all nations few if any had sought their inspiration in reality each nation had unconsciously given him its own national type and though there was a subtle truth in this for what each nation worshipped was truly the god made over again in its own highest image this was not the truth after which i was seeking i started by rejecting the blonde beardless type which da vinci and others have imposed upon the world for christ to begin with must be a jew and even when in the course of my researches for a jewish model i became aware that there were blonde types too these seemed to me essentially teutonic a characteristic of the oriental face as i figured it was a sombre majesty as of the rabbis of rembrandt the very antithesis of the ruddy gods of walhalla the characteristic jewish face must suggest more of the arab than of the goth i do not know if the lay reader understands how momentous to the artist is his model how dependent he is on the accident of finding his creation already anticipated or at least shadowed forth in nature to me as a realist it was particularly necessary to find in nature the original without which no artist can ever produce those subtle nuances which give the full sense of life after which if i say that my aim is not to copy but to interpret and transfigure i suppose i shall again seem to be selfcontradictory but that again must be put down to my fumbling penstrokes perhaps i ought to have gone to palestine in search of the ideal model but then my fathers failing health kept me within a brief railway run of the parsonage besides i understood that the dispersion of the jews everywhere made it possible to find jewish types anywhere and especially in london to which flowed all the streams of the exile but long days of hunting in the jewish quarter left me despairing i could find types of all the apostles but never of the master running down one weekend to brighton to recuperate i joined the church parade on the lawns it was a sunny morning in early november and i admired the three great even stretches of grass sea and sky making up a picture that was unspoiled even by the stuccoed boardinghouses the parasols fluttered amid the vast crowd of promenaders like a swarm of brilliant butterflies i noted with amusement that the church parade was guarded by beadles from the intrusion of the illdressed and the spectacle of overdressed jews paradoxically partaking in it reminded me of the object of my search in vain my eye roved among these their figures were strangely lacking in the dignity and beauty which i had found among the poorest suddenly i came upon a sight that made my heart leap there squatting oddly enough on the pavementcurb of a street opposite the lawns sat a frowsy gaberdined jew vividly set between the tiny green cockleshell hat on his head and the long uncombed black beard was the face of my desire the head was bowed towards the earth it did not even turn towards the gay crowd as if the mere spectacle was beadlebarred i was about to accost this strange creature who sat there so immovably when a venerable royal academician who resides at hove came towards me with hearty hand outstretched and bore me along in the stream of his conversation and geniality i looked back yearningly it was as if the academy was dragging me away from true art i think if you dont mind ill get that old chaps address i said he looked back and shook his head in laughing reproof another study in dirt and ugliness oh you youngsters my heart grew hot against his smug satisfaction with his own conventional patterns and prettinesses behind that ugliness and dirt i see the christ i retorted i certainly did not see him in the church parade have you gone on the religious lay now he asked with a burst of his bluff laughter no but im going i said and turned back i stood pretending to watch the gay parasols but furtively studying my jew yes in that odd figure so strangely seated on the pavement i had chanced on the very features the haunting sadness and mystery of which i had been so long in quest i wondered at the simplicity with which he was able to maintain a pose so essentially undignified i told myself i beheld the east squatted broodingly as on a divan while the west paraded with parasol and prayerbook i wondered that the beadles were unobservant of him were they content with his abstention from the holy ground of the church parade and the less sacred seats on the promenade without or would they if their eyes drew towards him move him on from further profaning those frigidly respectable windows and stuccoed portals at last i said goodmorning and he rose hurriedly and began to move away uncomplainingly as one used to being hounded from everywhere guten morgen i said in german with a happy inspiration for in my futile search in london i had found that a corrupt german called yiddish usually proved a means of communication he paused as if reassured gut morgen he murmured and then i saw that his stature was kingly like that of the sons of anak and his manner a strange blend of majesty and humility pardon me i went on in my scrupulously worst german may i ask you a question he made a curious movement of acquiescence compounded of a shrug and a slight uplifting of his palms are you in need of work and why do you wish to know he replied answering as i had already found was the jewish way one question by another i thought i could find you some i said have you scrolls of the law for me to write he replied incredulously you are not even a jew still there may be something i replied let us walk along i felt that the beadles eye was at last drawn to us both and i hurried my model down a sidestreet i noticed he hobbled as if footsore he did not understand what i wanted but he understood a pound a week for he was starving and when i said he must leave brighton for london he replied awestruck it is the finger of god for in london were his wife and children his name was israel quarriar his country russia the picture was begun on monday morning israel quarriars presence dignified the studio it was thrilling and stimulating to see his noble figure and tragic face the head drooped humbly the beard like a prophets it is the finger of god i too murmured and fell to work exalted i worked for the most part in rapt silenceperhaps the models silence was contagiousbut gradually through the days i grew to communion with his shy soul and piecemeal i learnt his sufferings i give his story so far as i can in his own words which i often paused to take down when they were characteristic chapter ii the models story i came here because russia had grown intolerable to me all my life and during the lives of my parents we quarriars had been innkeepers and thereby earned our bread but russia took away our livelihood for herself and created a monopoly thus we were left destitute so what could i do with a large family of london and america i had long heard as places where they have compassion on foreigners they are not countries like russia where truth exists not secondly my children also worried me greatly they are females all the five and a female in russia however beautiful good and clever she be if she have no dowry has to accept any offer of marriage however uncongenial the man may be these things conspired to drive me from russia so i turned everything into money and realized three hundred and fifty roubles people had told me that the whole journey to london should cost us two hundred roubles so i concluded i should have one hundred and fifty roubles with which to begin life in the new country it was very bitter to me to leave my fatherland but as the moujik says necessity brings everything so we parted from our friends with many tears little had we thought we should be so broken up in our old age but what else could i do in such a wretched country as the moujik says if the goat doesnt want to go to market it is compelled to go so i started for london we travelled to isota on the austrian frontier as we sat at the railwaystation there wondering how we were going to smuggle ourselves across the frontier in came a benevolentlooking jew with a long venerable beard two very long earlocks and a girdle round his waist washed his hands ostentatiously at the station tap prayed aloud the asher yotzer with great fervour and on finishing his prayer looked everyone expectantly in the eyes and all responded amen then he drew up his coatsleeve with great deliberation extended his hand gave me an effusive shalom aleichem and asked me how it went with me soon he began to talk about the frontier said he as you see me an ish kosher a ritually correct man i will do you a kindness not for money but for the sake of the mitzvah good deed i began to smell a rat and thought to myself how comes it that you know i want the frontier your kindness is suspicious for as the moujik says the devil has guests but if we need the thief we cut him down even from the gallows such a necessary rascal proved elzas kazelia i asked him how much he wanted to smuggle me across he answered thus i see that you are a clever respectable man so look upon my beard and earlocks and you will understand that you will receive fair treatment from me i want to earn a mitzvah good deed and a little money thereby then he cautioned me not to leave the station and go out into the street because in the street were to be found jews without beards who would inform on me and give me up to the police the world does not contain a sea of kazelias said he would that it did not contain even that one then he continued shake out your money on the table and we will see how much you have and i will change it for you oh said i i want first to find out the rate of exchange when kazelia heard this he gave a great spring and shrieked hoi hoi on account of jews like you the messhiach messiah cant come and the redemption of israel is delayed if you go out into the street you will find a jew without a beard who will charge you more and even take all your money away i swear to you as i should wish to see messhiach ben david that i want to earn no money i only desire your good and so to lay up a little mitzvah in heaven thereupon i changed my money with him afterwards i found that he had swindled me to the extent of fifteen roubles elzas kazelia is like to the russian forest robber who waylays even the peasant we began to talk further about the frontier he wanted eighty roubles and swore by his kosher yiddishkeit ritually pure judaism that the affair would cost him seventyfive thereupon i became sorely troubled because i had understood it would only cost us twenty roubles for all of us and so i told him said he if you seek others with short beards they will take twice as much from you but i went out into the street to seek a second murderer the second promised to do it cheaper said that kazelia was a robber and promised to meet me at the railway station immediately i left elzas kazelia the kosher jew went to the police and informed them that i and my family were running away from russia and were going to london and we were at once arrested and thrown bag and baggage into a filthy cell lighted only by an iron grating in the door no food or drink was allowed us as though we were the greatest criminals such is russian humanity to starve innocent people the little provender we had in a bag scarcely kept us from fainting with hunger on the second day kazelia sent two jews with beards suddenly i heard the door unlock and they appeared saying we have come to do you a favour but not for nothing if your life and the lives of your family are dear to you we advise you to give the police seventy roubles and we want ten roubles for our kindness and you must employ kazelia to take you over the frontier for eighty roubles otherwise the police will not be bribed if you refuse you are lost well how could i answer how could one give away the last kopeck and arrive penniless in a strange land every rouble taken from us was like a piece of our life so my people and i began to weep and to beg for pity have compassion we cried answered they in a frontier town compassion dwells not give money that will bring compassion and they slammed the door and we were locked in once more tears and cries helped nothing my children wept agonizedly oh truth truth russia russia how scurvily you handle the guiltless for an enlightened land to be thus father father the children said give away everything so that we die not in this cell of fear and hunger but even had i wished i could do nothing from behind barred doors our shouting was useless at last i attracted a warder who was watching in the corridor bring me a jew i cried i wish to tell him of our plight and he answered hold your peace if you dont want your teeth knocked out recognise that you are a prisoner you know well what is required of you yes i thought my money or my life on the third day our sufferings became almost insupportable and the russian cold seized on our bodies and our strength began to fail we looked upon the cell as our tomb and on kazelia as the angel of death here it seemed we were to die of hunger we lost hope of seeing the sun for well we know russia who seeks truth finds death more easily as the russian proverb says if you want to know truth you will know death at length the warder seemed to take pity on our cries and brought again the two jews for the last time we tell you give us money and we will do you a kindness we have been seized with compassion for your family so i said no more but gave them all they asked and elzas kazelia came and said to me rebukingly it is a characteristic of the jew never to part with his money unless chastised i said to elzas kazelia i thought you were an honourable pious jew how could you treat a poor family so he answered me an honourable pious jew must also make a little money thereupon he conducted us from the prison and sent for a conveyance no sooner had we seated ourselves than he demanded six roubles well what could i do i had fallen among thieves and must part with my money we drove to a small room and remained there two hours for which we had to pay three roubles as the preparations for our crossing were apparently incomplete when we finally got to the frontierin this case a shallow riverthey warned us not even to sneeze for if the soldiers heard we should be shot without more ado i had to strip in order to wade through the water and several men carried over my family my two bundles with all my belongings consisting of clothes and household treasures remained however on the russian side suddenly a wild disorder arose the soldiers the soldiers hide hide in the bushes in the bushes when all was still againthough no soldiers became visiblethe men went back for the baggage but brought back only one bundle the other worth over a hundred roubles had disappeared wailing helped nothing kazelia said hold your peace here too dangers lurk i understood the game but felt completely helpless in his hands he drove us to his house and our remaining bundle was deposited there later when i walked into the town i went to the rabbi and complained said he what can i do with such murderers you must reconcile yourself to the loss i went back to my family at kazelias house and he cautioned me against going into the street on my way i had met a man who said he would charge twentyeight roubles each for our journey to london so kazelia was evidently afraid i might yet fall into honester hands then we began to talk with him of london for it is better to deal with the devil you know than the devil you dont know said he it will cost you thirtythree roubles each i said i have had an offer of twentyeight roubles but you i will give thirty hoi hoi shrieked he on a jew a lesson is lost it is just as at the frontier you wouldnt give eighty roubles and it cost you double you want the same again one darent do a jew a favour so i held my peace and accepted his terms but i saw i should be twentyfive roubles short of what was required to finish the journey said kazelia i can do you a favour i can borrow twentyfive roubles on your luggage at the railway and when you get to london you can repay and he took the bundle and conveyed it to the railway what he did there i know not he came back and told me he had done me a turn this time it seemed a good one he then took envelopes and placed in each the amount i was to pay at each stage of the journey so at last we took train and rode off and at each place i paid the dues from its particular envelope the children were offered food by our fellowpassengers though they could only take it when it was kosher and this enabled us to keep our pride there was one kind jewess from lemberg with a heart of gold and delicious rings of sausages when we arrived at leipsic they told me the amount was twelve marks short so we missed our train not knowing what to do as i had now no money whatever but what was in the envelopes the officials ordered us from the station so we went out and walked about leipsic we attracted the suspicion of the police and they wanted to arrest us but we pleaded our innocence and they let us go so we retired into a narrow dark street and sat down by a blank wall and told each other not to murmur we sat together through the whole rainy night the rain mingling with our tears when day broke i thought of a plan i took twelve marks from the envelope containing the ships money and ran back to the station and took tickets to rotterdam and so got to the end of our overland journey when we got to the ship they led us all into a shed like cattle one of the kazelia conspiratorsfor his arm reaches over europecalled us into his office and said how much money have you i shook out the money from the envelopes on the table said he the amount is twelve marks short he had had advices he said from kazelia that i would bring a certain amount and i didnt have it here you can stay tonight tomorrow you go back so he played on my ignorance for i was paying at every stage in excess of the legal fares but i knew not what powers he had every official was a possible disaster we hardly lived till the day then i began to beg him to take my tallis and tephillin prayingshawl and phylacteries for the twelve marks said he i have no use for them you must go back with difficulty i got his permission to go out into the town and i took my tallis and tephillin and went into a shool synagogue and i begged someone to buy them but a good man came up and would not permit the sale he took out twelve marks and gave them to me i begged him to give me his address that i might be able to repay him said he i desire neither thanks nor money thus was i able to replace the amount lacking we embarked without a bit of bread or a farthing in money we arrived in london at nine oclock in the morning penniless and without luggage whereas i had calculated to have at least one hundred and fifty roubles and my household stuff i had a friends address and we all went to look for him but found that he had left london for america we walked about all day till eight oclock at night the children could scarcely drag along from hunger and weariness at last we sat down on the steps of a house in wellclose square i looked about and saw a building which i took to be a shool synagogue as there were hebrew posters stuck outside i approached it an old jew with a long grey beard came to meet me and began to speak with me i understood soon what sort of a person he was and turned away this meshummad converted jew persisted tempting me sorely with offers of food and drink for the family and further help i said i want nothing of you nor do i desire your acquaintance i went back to my family the children sat crying for food they attracted the attention of a man baruch zezangski ship alley and he went away returning with bread and fish when the children saw this they rejoiced exceedingly and seized the mans hand to kiss it meanwhile darkness fell and there was nowhere to pass the night so i begged the man to find me a lodging for the night he led us to a cellar in ship alley it was pitch black they say there is a hell this may or may not be but more of a hell than the night we passed in this cellar one does not require every vile thing in the world seemed to have taken up its abode therein we sat the whole night sweeping the vermin from us after a year of horroras it seemedcame the dawn in the morning entered the landlord and demanded a shilling i had not a farthing but i had a leather bag which i gave him for the nights lodging i begged him to let me a room in the house so he let me a small back room upstairs the size of a table at three and sixpence a week he relied on our collecting his rent from the kindhearted we entered the empty room with joy and sat down on the floor we remained the whole day without bread the children managed to get a crust now and again from other lodgers but all day long they cried for food and at night they cried because they had nothing to sleep on i asked our landlord if he knew of any work we could do he said he would see what could be done next day he went out and returned with a heap of linen to be washed the family set to work at once but i am sure my wife washed the things less with water than with tears oh kazelia we washed the whole week the landlord each day bringing bread and washing at the end of the week he said you have worked out your rent and have nothing to pay i should think not indeed my eldest daughter was fortunate enough to get a place at a tailors for four shillings a week and the others sought washing and scrubbing so each day we had bread and at the end of the week rent bread and water alone formed our sustenance but we were very grateful all the same when the holidays came on my daughter fell out of work i heard a word slack i inquired what is the meaning of the word slack then my daughter told me that it means schlecht bad there is nothing to be earned now what should i do i had no means of living the children cried for bread and something to sleep on still we lived somehow till rosh hashanah new year hoping it would indeed be a new year it was erev yomtov the day before the holiday and no washing was to be had we struggled as before death the landlord of the house came in he said to me arent you ashamed cant you see your children have scarcely strength to live why have you not compassion on your little ones go to the charity board there you will receive help believe me i would rather have died but the little ones were starving and their cries wrung me so i went to a charity board i said weeping my children are perishing for a morsel of bread i can no longer look upon their sufferings and the board answered after yomtov we will send you back to russia but meanwhile i answered the children want food whereupon one of the board struck a bell and in came a stalwart angel of death who seized me by the arm so that it ached all day and thrust me through the door i went out my eyes blinded with tears so that i could not see where i went it was long before i found my way back to ship alley my wife and daughters already thought i had drowned myself for trouble such was our plight the eve of the day of atonement and not a morsel of bread to take in the fast with but just at the worst a woman from next door came in and engaged one of my daughters to look after a little child during the fast while she was in the synagogue at a wage of tenpence paid in advance with joy we expended it all on bread and then we prayed that the day of atonement should endure long so that we could fast long and have no need to buy food for as the moujik says if one had no mouth one could wear a golden coat i went to the jews free school which was turned into a synagogue and passed the whole day in tearful supplication when i came home at night my wife sat and wept i asked her why she wept she answered why have you led me to such a land where even prayer costs moneyat least for women the whole day i went from one shool to another but they would not let me in at last i went to the shool of the sons of the soul where pray the pious jews with beards and earlocks and even there i was not allowed in the heathen policeman begged for me and said to them shame on you not to let the poor woman in the gabbai treasurer answered if one hasnt money one sits at home and my wife said to him weeping my tears be on your head and went home and remained home the whole day weeping with a woman yom kippur is a wonderworking day she thought that her prayers might be heard that god would consider her plight if she wept out her heart to him in the shool but she was frustrated and this was perhaps the greatest blow of all to her moreover she was oppressed by her own brethren and this was indeed bitter if it had been the gentile she would have consoled herself with the thought we are in exile when the fast was over we had nothing but a little bread left to break our fast on or to prepare for the next days fast nevertheless we sorrowfully slept but the wretched day came again and the elder children went out into the street to seek parnosoh employment and found scrubbing that brought in ninepence we bought bread and continued to live further likewise we obtained three shillings worth of washing to do and were as rich as rothschild when succoth tabernacles came again no money no bread and i went about the streets the whole day to seek for work when i was asked what handicraftsman i was of course i had to say i had no trade for foolishly enough among the jews in my part of russia a trade is held in contempt and when they wish to hold one up to scorn they say to him anybody can see you are a descendant of a handicraftsman i could write holy scrolls indeed and keep an inn but what availed these accomplishments as i found i could obtain no work i went into the shool of the sons of the soul i seated myself next a man and we began to speak i told him of my plight said he i will give you advice call on our rabbi he is a very fine man i did so as i entered he sat in company with another man holding his lulov and esrog palm and citron what do you want i couldnt answer him my heart was so oppressed but suddenly my tears gushed forth it seemed to me help was at hand i felt assured of sympathy if of nothing else i told him we were perishing for want of bread and asked him to give me advice he answered nothing he turned to the man and spoke concerning the tabernacle and the citron he took no further notice of me but left me standing so i understood he was no better than elzas kazelia and this is a rabbi as i saw i might as well have talked to the wall i left the room without a word from him as the moujik would say sad and bitter is the poor mans lot it is better to lie in the dark tomb and not to see the sunlit world than to be a poor man and be compelled to beg for money i came home where my family was waiting patiently for my return with bread i said good yomtov weeping for they looked scarcely alive having been without a morsel of food that day so we tried to sleep but hunger would not permit it but demanded his due hunger you old fool why dont you let us sleep but he refused to be talked over so we passed the night when day came the little children began to cry father let us go we will beg bread in the streets we die of hunger dont hold us back when the mother heard them speak of begging in the streets she swooned whereupon arose a great clamour among the children when at length we brought her to she reproached us bitterly for restoring her to life i would rather have died than hear you speak of begging in the streetsrather see my children die of hunger before my eyes this speech of the mother caused them to forget their hunger and they sat and wept together on hearing the weeping a man from next door gershon katcol came in to see what was the matter he looked around and his heart went out to us so he went away and returned speedily with bread and fish and tea and sugar and went away again returning with five shillings he said this i lend you later he came back with a man nathan beck who inquired into our story and took away the three little ones to stay with him afterwards when i called to see them in his house in st georges road they hid themselves from me being afraid i should want them to return to endure again the pangs of hunger it was bitter to think that a stranger should have the care of my children and that they should shun me as one shuns a forestrobber after yomtov i went to grunbach the shipping agent to see whether my luggage had arrived as i had understood from kazelia that it would get here in a months time i showed my pawnticket and inquired concerning it said he your luggage wont come to london only to rotterdam if you like i will write a letter to inquire if it is at rotterdam and how much money is due to redeem it i told him i had borrowed twentyfive roubles on it whereupon he calculated that it would cost me l s including freight to redeem it but i told him to write and ask some days later a letter came from rotterdam stating the cost at eightythree roubles l s irrespective of freight dues when i heard this i was astounded and i immediately wrote to kazelia why do you behave like a forestrobber giving me only twentyfive roubles where you got eightythree answered he shame on you to write such a letter havent you been in my house and seen what an honourable jew i am shame on you to such men as you one cant do a favour do you think there are a sea of kazelias in the world you are all thickheaded you cant read a letter i only took fiftyfour roubles on the luggage i had to recoup myself because i lost money through sending you to london i calculated my loss and only took what was due to me i showed the letter to grunbach and he wrote again to rotterdam and they answered that they knew nothing of a kazelia i must pay the l s if i wanted my bundle well what was to be done the weather grew colder hunger we had become inured to but how could we pass the winter nights on the bare boards i wrote again to kazelia but received no answer whatever day and night i went about asking advice concerning the luggage nobody could help me and as i stood thus in the middle of the sea word came to me of a landsmann countryman i had once helped to escape from the russian army in the days when i was happy and had still my inn they said he had a great business in jewellery on a great highroad in front of the sea in a great town called brighton so i started off at once to talk to himtwo days journey they saidfor i knew he would help and if not he who i would come to him as his sabbath guest he would surely fall upon my neck the first night i slept in a barn with another tramp who pointed me the way but because i stopped to earn sixpence by chopping wood lo when sabbath came i was still twelve miles away and durst not profane the sabbath by walking so i lingered that friday night in a village thanking god i had at least the money for a bed though it was sinful even to touch my money and all next day i know not why the streetboys called me a goy heathen and a foxgoyfox goyfoxand they let off fireworks in my face so i had to wander in the woods around keeping within the sabbath radius and when the three stars appeared in the sky i started for brighton but so footsore was i i came there only at midnight and could not search and i sat down on a bench it was very cold but i was so tired but the policeman came and drove me awayhe was gods messenger for i should perchance have diedand a drunken female with a painted face told him to let me be and gave me a shilling how could i refuse i slept again in a bed and on the sunday morning i started out and walked all down in front of the sea but my heart grew sick for i saw the shops were shut at last i saw a jewellery shop and my landsmanns name over it it sparkled with gold and diamonds and little bills were spread over itgreat sale great sale then i went joyfully to the door but lo it was bolted so i knocked and knocked and at last a woman came from above and told me he lived in that road in hove where i found indeed my redeemer but not my landsmann it was a great house with steps up and steps down i went down to a great door and there came out a beautiful heathen female with a shining white cap on her head and a shining white apron and she drove me away goyfox was yesterday she shouted with wrath and slammed the door on my heart and i sat down on the pavement without and i became a pillar of salt all frozen tears but when i looked up i saw the angel of the lord chapter iii the picture evolves such was my models simple narrative the homely realism of which appealed to me on my most imaginative side for through all its sordid details stood revealed to me the tragedy of the wandering jew was it heine or another who said the people of christ is the christ of peoples at any rate such was the idea that began to take possession of me as i painted away at the sorrowhaunted face of my muchtried modelto paint not the christ that i had started out to paint but the christ incarnated in a race sufferingand who knew that he did not suffer over againin its passion yes israel quarriar could still be my model but after another conception altogether it was an idea that called for no change in what i had already done for i had worked mainly upon the head and now that i purposed to clothe the figure in its native gaberdine there would be little to redraw and so i fell to work with renewed intensity feeling even safer now that i was painting and interpreting a real thing than when i was trying to reconstruct retrospectively the sacred figure that had walked in galilee and no sooner had i fallen to work on this new conception than i found everywhere how old it was it appeared even to have scriptural warrant for from a brief report of a historicaltheological lecture by a protestant german professor i gleaned that many of the passages in the prophets which had been interpreted as pointing to a coming messiah really applied to israel the people israel it was whom isaiah in that famous fiftythird chapter had described as despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows israel it was who bore the sins of the world he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter yes israel was the man of sorrows and in this view the german professor i found was only reechoing rabbinic opinion my model proved a mine of lore upon this as upon so many other points even the jewish expectation of the messiah he had never shared he saidthat the messhiach would come riding upon a white ass israel would be redeemed by itself though his neighbours would have called the sentiment epicurean whoever saves me is my messhiach he declared suddenly and plucked at my hand to kiss it now you shock me i said pushing him away no no he said i agree with the word of the moujik the good people are god then i suppose you are what is called a zionist i said yes he replied now that you have saved me i see that god works only through men as for the messhiach on the white ass they do not really believe it but they wont let another believe otherwise for my own part when i say the prayer blessed be thou who restorest the dead to life i always mean it of you such oriental hyperbolic gratitude would have satisfied the greediest benefactor and was infinitely in excess of what he owed me he seemed unconscious that he was doing work journeying punctually long miles to my studio in any and every weather it is true that i early helped him to redeem his household gods but could i do less for a man who had still no bed to sleep in my recovery of the rotterdam bundle served to unveil further complications the agents at the east end charged him three shillings and sixpence per letter and conducted the business with a fine legal delay but it was not till kazelia was eulogized by one of these gentry as a very fine man that both the model and i grew suspicious that the long chain of roguery reached even unto london and that the confederates on this side were playing for time so that the option should expire and the railway sell the unredeemed luggage which they would doubtless buy in cheap making another profit ultimately quarriar told me his second daughterfor the eldest was blind of one eyewas prepared to journey alone to rotterdam as the safest way of redeeming the goods admiring her pluck i added her fare to the expenses one fine morning israel appeared transfigured with happiness when does man rejoice most he cried when he loses and finds again ah then you have got your bedding at last i cried now accustomed to his methods of expression i hope you slept well we could not sleep for blessing you he replied unexpectedly as the psalmist says all my bones praise the lord not that the matter had gone smoothly even now the kazelia gang at rotterdam denied all knowledge of the luggage sent the girl to the railway where the dues had now mounted to l s again the cup was dashed from her lips for i had only given her l but she went to the rabbi and offered if he supplied the balance to repledge the sabbath silver candlesticks that were the one family heirloom in the bundle and therewith repay him instantly while she was pleading with him in came a noble jew paid the balance lodged her and fed her and saw her safely on board with the longlost treasures chapter iv i become a sorter as the weeks went by my satisfaction with the progress i was making was largely tempered by the knowledge that after the completion of my picture my model would be thrown again on the pavement and several times i fancied i detected him gazing at it sadly as if watching its advancing stages with a sort of hopeless fear my anxiety about him and his family grew from day to day but i could not see any possible way of helping him he was touchingly faithful anxious to please and uncomplaining either of cold or hunger once i gave him a few shillings to purchase a secondhand pair of topboots which were necessary for the picture and these he was able to procure in the ghetto sunday market for a minute sum and he conscientiously returned me the balanceabout twothirds i happened to have sold an english landscape to sir asher aaronsberg the famous philanthropist and picturebuyer of middleton then up in town in connection with his parliamentary duties and knowing how indefatigably he was in touch with the london jewish charities i inquired whether some committee could not do anything to assist quarriar sir asher was not very encouraging the man knew no trade however if he would make application on the form enclosed and answer the questions he would see what could be done i saw that the details were duly filled inthe ages and sex of his five children etc but the committee came to the conclusion that the only thing they could do was to repatriate the man return to russia cried israel in horror occasionally i inquired if any plan for the future had occurred to him but he never raised the subject of his difficulties of his own accord and his very silence born as it seemed to me of the majestic dignity of the man was infinitely pathetic now and again came a fitful gleam of light his second daughter would be given a weeks work for a few shillings by his landlord a working mastertailor in a small way from whom he now rented two tiny rooms on the top floor but that was only when there was an extra spasm of activity his halfblind daughter would do a little washing and the landlord would allow her the use of the backyard at last one day i found he had an idea and an idea moreover that was carefully worked out in all its details the scheme was certainly a novel and surprising one to me but it showed how the art of forcing a livelihood amid impossible circumstances had been cultivated among these people forced for centuries to exist under impossible conditions briefly his scheme was this in the innumerable tailors workshops of his district great piles of cuttings of every kind and quality of cloth accumulated and for the purchase of these cuttings a certain competition existed among a class of people known as piecesorters the sale of these cuttings by weight and for cash brought the mastertailors a pleasant little revenue which was the more prized as it was a sort of perquisite the masters were able to command payment for their cuttings in advance and the sorter would call to collect them week by week as they accumulated till the amount he had advanced was exhausted quarriar would set up as a piecesorter and thus be able to employ his daughters too the whole family would find occupation in sorting out their purchases and each quality and size would be readily saleable as raw material to be woven again into the cheaper woollen materials through the recommendation of his countrymen there were several tailors who had readily agreed to give him the preference his own landlord in particular had promised to befriend him and even now was allowing his cuttings to accumulate at some inconvenience since he might have had ready money for them moreover his friends had introduced him to a very respectable and honest sorter who would take him into partnership teach him and allow his daughters to partake in the sorting if he could put down twenty pounds his friends would jointly advance him eight on the security of his silver candlesticks if only he could raise the other twelve this promising scheme took an incubus off my mind and i hastened somewhat revengefully to acquaint the professional philanthropist who had been so barren of ideas with my intention to set up quarriar as a piecesorter ah sir asher replied unmoved then you had better employ my man conn he does a good deal of this sort of work for me he will find quarriar a partner and professor but quarriar has already found a partner i explained the scheme the partner will cheat him twenty pounds is ridiculous five pounds is quite enough take my advice and let it all go through conn if i wanted my portrait painted you wouldnt advise me to go to an amateur by the way here are the five pounds but please dont tell conn i gave them i dont believe the moneyll do any good and conn will lose his respect for me my interest in piecesortingan occupation i had never even heard of beforehad grown abnormally and i had gone into the figures and quantitiesso many hundredweights purchased at fifteen shillings sorted into lots and sold at various priceswith as thoroughgoing an eagerness as if my own livelihood were to depend upon it i confess i was now rather bewildered by so serious a difference of estimate as to the cost of a partnership but i was inclined to set down sir ashers scepticism to that pessimism which is the penalty of professional philanthropy on the other hand i felt that whether the partnership was to cost five pounds or twenty quarriars future would be safer from kazelias under the auspices of sir asher and his conn so i handed the latter the five pounds and bade him find quarriar a guide philosopher and partner with the advent of conn all my troubles began and the picture passed into its third and last stage i soon elicited that quarriar and his friends were rather sorry conn had been introduced into the matter he was alleged to favour some people at the expense of others and to be not at all popular among the people amid whom he worked and altogether it was abundantly clear that quarriar would rather have gone on with the scheme in his own way without official interference later sir asher wrote to me direct that the partner put forward by the quarriar faction was a shady customer conn had selected his own man but even so there was little hope quarriars future would be thus provided for there seemed moreover a note of suspicion of quarriar sounding underneath but i found comfort in the reflection that to sir asher my model was nothing more than the usual applicant for assistance whereas to me who had lived for months in daily contact with him he was something infinitely more human spring was now nearing i finished my picture early in marchafter four months strenuous labourshook hands with my model and received his blessing i was somewhat put out at learning that conn had not yet given him the five pounds necessary to start him as i had been hoping he might begin his new calling immediately the sittings ended i gave him a small present to help tide over the time of waiting but that tragic face on my own canvas remained to haunt me to ask the question of his future and few days elapsed ere i found myself starting out to visit him at his home he lived near ratcliffe highway a district which i found had none of that boisterous marine romance with which i had associated it the house was a narrow building of at least the sixteenth century with the number marked up in chalk on the rusty little door i happened to have stumbled on the jewish passover quarriar was called down evidently astonished and unprepared for my appearance at his humble abode but he expressed pleasure and led me up the narrow steep stairway whose ceiling almost touched my head as i climbed up after him on the first floor the landlord in festal raiment intercepted us introduced himself in english which he spoke with pretentious inaccuracy and barring my further ascent took possession of me and led the way to his best parlour as if it were entirely unbecoming for his tenant to receive a gentleman in his attic he was a strapping young fellow full of acuteness and vigoura marked contrast to quarriars drooping dignified figure standing silently near by and radiating poverty and suffering all the more in the little old panelled room elegant with a big carved walnut cabinet and gay with chromos and stuffed birds effusively the mastertailor painted himself as the champion of the poor fellow and protested against this outside partnership that was being imposed on him by the notorious conn he himself though he could scarcely afford it was keeping his cuttings for him in spite of tempting offers from other quarters even of a shilling a sack but of course he didnt see why an outsider foisted upon him by a philanthropic factotum should benefit by this goodness of his he discoursed to me in moved terms of the sorrows and privations of his tenants in their two tiny rooms upstairs and all the while quarriar preserved his attitude of drooping dignity saying no syllable except under special appeal the landlord produced a goblet of rum and shrub for the benefit of the highborn visitor and we all clinked glasses the young mastertailor beaming at me unctuously as he set down his glass i love company he cried with no apparent consciousness of impudent familiarity i returned however to my central interest in lifethe piecesorting it occurred to me afterwards that possibly i ought not to have insisted on such a secular subject on a jewish holiday but after all the landlord had broached it and both men now entered most cordially into the discussion the landlord started repeating his lamentwhat a pity it would be if quarriar were really forced to accept conns partnerwhen quarriar timidly blurted out that he had already signed the deed of partnership though he had not yet received the promised capital from conn nor spoken over matters with the partner provided the landlord seemed astonished and angry at learning this pricking up his ears curiously at the word signed and giving quarriar a look of horror signed he cried in yiddish what hast thou signed at this point the landlords wife joined us in the parlour with a pretty child in her arms and another shy one clinging to her skirts completing the picture of felicity and prosperity and throwing into greater shadow the attic to which i shortly afterwards climbed my way up the steep airless stairs i was hardly prepared for the depressing spectacle that awaited me at their summit it was not so much the shabby fusty rooms devoid of everything save a couple of mattresses a rickety wooden table a chair or two and a heap of passover cakes as the unloveliness of the three women who stood there awkward and flushing before their important visitor the wifeandmother was dwarfed and blackwigged the daughters were squat with tallowcoloured round faces vaguely suggestive of caucasian peasants while the sightless eye of the elder lent a final touch of ugliness how little my academic friends know me who imagine i am allured by the ugly it is only that sometimes i see through it a beauty that they are blind to but here i confess i saw nothing but the ghastly misery and squalor and i was oppressed almost to sickness as much by the scene as by the atmosphere may i open a window i could not help inquiring the genial landlord who had followed in my footsteps rushed to anticipate me and when i could breathe more freely i found something of the tragedy that had been swallowed in the sordidness my eye fell again on the figure of my host standing in his drooping majesty the droop being now necessary to avoid striking the ceiling with his kingly head surely a pretty wife and graceful daughters would have detracted from the splendour of the tragedy israel stood there surrounded by all that was mean yet losing nothing of his regal dignityindeed the man of sorrows ere i left i suddenly remembered to ask after the three younger children they were still with their kind benefactor the father told me i suppose you will resume possession of them when you make your fortune by the piecesorting i said god grant it he replied my bowels yearn for that day against my intention i slipped into his hand the final seven pounds i was prepared to pay if your partnership scheme fails try again alone i said his blessings pursued me down the steep staircase his womankind remained shy and dumb when i got home i found a telegram from the parsonage my father was dangerously ill i left everything and hastened to help nurse him my picture was not sent in to any exhibitioni could not let it go without seeing it again without a last touch or two when some months later i returned to town my first thoughtinspired by the sight of my picturewas how quarriar was faring i left the studio and telephoned to sir asher aaronsberg at the london office of his great middleton business that his contempt penetrated even through the wires smashed up long ago just as i expected and the sneer of the professional philanthropist vibrated triumphantly i was much upset but ere i could recover my composure sir asher was cut off in the evening i received a note saying quarriar was a rogue who had to flee from russia for illicit sale of spirits he had only two at most three elderly daughters the three younger girls were a myth for a moment i was staggered then all my faith in israel returned those three children a figment of the imagination impossible why i remembered countless little anecdotes about these very children told me with the most evident fatherly pride he had even repeated the quaint remarks the youngest had made on her return home from her first morning at the english school impossible that these things could have been invented on the spur of the moment no i could not possibly doubt the genuineness of my models spontaneous talk especially as in those days he had had no reason for expecting anything from me and he had most certainly not demanded anything and then i remembered that tragic passage describing how these three little ones sheltered and fed by a kindly soul hid themselves when their father came to see them fearing to be reclaimed by him to hunger and cold if quarriar could invent such things he was indeed a poet for in the whole literature of starvation i could recall no better touch i went to sir asher he said that quarriar challenged by conn to produce these children had refused to do so or to answer any further questions i found myself approving of his conduct a man ought not to be insulted by such absurd charges i said sir asher merely smiled and took up his usual unshakable position behind his impregnable wall of official distrust and pessimism i wrote to quarriar to call on me without delay he came immediately his head bowed his features careworn and full of infinite suffering yes it was true the piecesorting had failed for a few weeks all had gone well he had bought cuttings himself had given the partner thrust upon him by conn various sums for the same purpose they had worked together sorting in a cellar rented for the purpose of which his partner kept the key so smoothly had things gone that he had felt encouraged to invest even the reserve seven pounds i had given him but when the cellar was full of their common stock and his own suspicions had been lulled by the regular division of the profitsseventeen shillings per week for eachone morning on arriving at the cellar to start the days work he found the place locked and when he called at the partners house for an explanation the man laughed in his face everything in the cellar now belonged to him he claimed insisting that quarriar had eaten up the original capital and his share of the profits besides besides it never was your money was the rogues ultimate argument why shouldnt i profit too by the christians simplicity conn blindly believed his own man for the transactions had not been recorded in writing and it was only a case of quarriars word against the partners it was the latter who in his venomous craft had told conn the younger children did not exist but thank heaven his quiver was not empty of them he had blissfully taken them home when prosperity began but now that he was again face to face with starvation they had returned to his hospitable countryman nathan beck you are sure you could absolutely produce the little ones he looked grieved at my distrusting him my faith in his probity was he said with dignity the one thing he valued in this world i dismissed him with a little to tide him over the next week thoroughly determined that the mans good name should be cleared the crocodile partner must disgorge and the eyes of my benevolent friend and of conn must be finally opened to the injustice they had unwittingly sanctioned again i wrote to my friend as usual sir asher replied kindly and without a trace of impatience would i get some intelligible written statement from quarriar as to what had taken place so at my request quarriar sent me a statement in quaint englishprobably the landlordsalleging specifically that the partner had detained goods and money belonging to quarriar to the amount of l s d and had assaulted him into the bargain when the partner was threatened with policecourt proceedings he had defied quarriar with the remark that mr conn would bear out his honesty quarriar could give as references to show that he was an honest man and had made a true statement as to the number of his children seven russians named who would attest that the partner provided by conn was well known as a swindler though he was starving quarriar refused to have anything further to say to conn quarriar further referred to his landlord who would willingly testify to his honesty but being afraid of conn and not inclined to commit himself in writing the landlord would give his version verbally against this statement my philanthropic friend had to set another as made by the partner quarriar according to this had received the five pounds direct from conn and had handed over niggardly sums to the partner for the purchase of goods to wit two separate sums of one pound each of which he returned to quarriar thirtythree shillings from sales while quarriar only gave him as his share of the profits for the whole of the five weeks the sum of seventeen shillings instead of the minimum of ten shillings each week that had been arranged the partner insisted further that he had never handled any money of which quarriar had always retained full control and that all the goods in the cellar at the time of the quarrel were only of the value of ten shillings to which he was entitled as quarriar still owed him thirtythree shillings moreover he was willing to repeat in quarriars presence the lies the latter had tried to persuade him to tell as to the children he challenged quarriar to produce them in vain i attempted to grapple with these conflicting documents my head was in a whirl it seemed to me that no judicial bench however eminent could from the bare materials presented probe to the bottom of this matter the arithmetic of both parties was hopelessly beyond me the names of the witnesses introduced showed that there must be two camps and that certainly quarriar was solidly encamped amid his advisers the whole business was taking on a most painful complexion and i was torn by conflicting emotions and swayed alternately by suspicion and confidence how sift the false from the true amid all this tangled mass and yet mere curiosity would not leave me content to go to my grave not knowing whether my model was apostle or ananias i too must then become a ragsorter dabbling amid dirty fragments was there a black rag and was there a white or were both rags particoloured to take only the one point of the children it would seem a very simple matter to determine whether a man has five daughters or two and yet the more i looked into it the more i saw the complexity even if three little girls were produced for my inspection it was utterly impossible for me to tell whether they really were the models nor was it open to me to repeat the device of solomon and have them hacked in two to see whose heart would be moved and then if israels story was false here what of the rest was kazelia also a myth did the second daughter ever go to hamburg was the landlords detaining me in the parlour a ruse to gain time for the attics to be emptied of any comforts where were the silver candlesticks these and other questions surged up torturingly but i remembered the footsore figure on the brighton pavement i remembered the months he had practically lived with me the countless conversations and as the man of sorrows rose reproachful before me from my own canvas with his noble bowed head my faith in his dignity and probity returned unbroken i called on sir asheri had to go to the house of commons to find himand his practical mind quickly suggested the best course in the circumstances he appointed a date for all partieshimself myself conn the two partners and any witnesses they might care to bringto appear at his office but above all quarriar must bring the three children with him on getting back to my studio i found quarriar waiting for me he was come to pour out his heart to me and to complain that all sorts of underhand inquiries were being directed against him so that he scarcely dared to draw breath so thick was the air with treachery he was afraid that his very friends who were anxious not to offend conn and sir asher might turn against him even his landlord had threatened to kick him out as he had been unable to pay his rent the last week or two i told him he might expect a letter asking him to attend at sir ashers office that i should be there and he should have an opportunity of facing his swindling partner he welcomed it joyfully and enthusiastically promised to obey the call and bring the children i emptied my purse into his handthere were three or four poundsand he promised me that quite apart from the old tangle he could now as an expert set up as a piecesorter himself and so his kingly figure passed out of my sight the next document sent me in this cause celebre was a letter from conn to announce that he had made all arrangements for the great meeting sir ashers private room in his office will be placed at the disposal of the inquiry the original application form filled up by quarriar clearly condemns him the partner will be there and i have arranged for quarriars landlord to appear if you think it necessary i may add that i have very good reason to believe that quarriar does not mean to appear i fancy he is trying to wriggle out of the appointment i at once wrote a short note to quarriar reminding him of the absolute necessity of appearing with the children who should be even kept away from school i reproduce the exact reply dear sir referring to your welcome letter i gratify you very much for the trouble you have taken for me but im sorry to tell you that i refuse to go before the committee according you arranged to as i received a letter without any name threatening me that i should not dare to call for the committee to tell the truth for i will be put into mischief and trouble it is stated also that the same gentleman does not require the truth he helps only those he likes to so i will not call and wish you my dear gentleman not to trouble to come therefore if you wish to assist me in somehow is very good and i will certainly gratify you and if not i will have to do without it and will have to trust the almighty so kindly do not trouble about it as i do not wish to enter a risk i remain your humble and grateful servant israel quarriar pslast wednesday a man called on my landlord and asked him some secrets about me and told him at last that i shall have to state according i will be commanded to and not as i wish i enclose you herewith the same letter i received it is written in jewish please not to show it to anyone but to tear it at once as i would not trust it to any other one i would certainly call at the office and follow your advice but my life is dearer so you should not trouble to come i fear already i gratify you for kind help till now in the future you may do as you wish chapter v last stage of all this letter seemed decisive i did not trouble mr conn to english the yiddish epistle my imagination saw too clearly quarriar himself dictating its luridly romantic phraseology such counterplots coils treasons and stratagems in so simple a matter how quarriar could even think them plausible i could not at first imagine and with my anger was mingled a flush of resentment at his low estimate of my intellect afterreflection instructed me that he wrote as a russian to whom apparently nothing mediaeval was strange but at the moment i had only the sense of outrage and trickery all these months i had been fed upon lies day after day i had been swathed with them as with feathers i had so pledged my reputation as a reader of character that he would appear with his three younger children bear every test and be triumphantly vindicated and in that moment of hot anger and wounded pride i had almost slashed through my canvas and mutilated beyond redemption that kingly head but it looked at me sadly with its sweet majesty and i stayed my hand almost persuaded to have faith in it still i began multiplying excuses for quarriar figuring him as misled by his neighbours more skilled than he in playing upon philanthropic heartstrings he had been told doubtless that two daughters made no impression upon the flinty heart of bureaucratic charity that in order to soften it one must increase and multiply he had got himself into a network of falsehood from which though his better nature recoiled he had been unable to disentangle himself but then i remembered how even in russia he had pursued an illegal calling how he had helped a friend to evade military service and again i took up my knife but the face preserved its reproachful dignity seemed almost to turn the other cheek illegal calling no it was the law that was illegalthe cruel impossible law that in taking away all means of livelihood had contorted the jews conscience it was the country that was illegalthe cruel country whose frontiers could only be crossed by bribery and deceitthe country that had made him cunning like all weak creatures in the struggle for survival and so gradually softer thoughts came to me and less unmingled feelings i could not doubt the general accuracy of his melancholy wanderings between russia and rotterdam between london and brighton and were he spotless as the dove that only made surer the blackness of kazelia and the partnerhis brethren in israel and in the exile and so the new man of sorrows shaped himself to my vision and taking my brush i added a touch here and a touch there till there came into that face of sorrows a look of craft and guile and as i stood back from my work i was startled to see how nearly i had come to a photographic representation of my model for those lines of guile had indeed been there though i had eliminated them in my confident misrepresentation now that i had exaggerated them i had idealized so to speak in the reverse direction and the more i pondered upon this new face the more i saw that this return to a truer homeliness and a more real realism did but enable me to achieve a subtler beauty for surely here at last was the true tragedy of the people of christto have persisted sublimely and to be as sordidly perverted to be king and knave in one to survive for two thousand years the loss of a fatherland and the pressure of persecution only to wear on its soul the yellow badge which had defaced its garments for to suffer two thousand years for an idea is a privilege that has been accorded only to israelthe soldier of god that were no tragedy but an heroic epic even as the prophet isaiah had prefigured the true tragedy the saddest sorrow lay in the martyrdom of an israel unworthy of his sufferings and this was the israelthe high tragedian in the comedy sockthat i tried humbly to typify in my man of sorrows anglicization anglicization english all english thats my dream cecil rhodes i even in his provincial days at sudminster solomon cohen had distinguished himself by his anglican mispronunciation of hebrew and his insistence on a minister who spoke english and looked like a christian clergyman and he had set a precedent in the congregation by docking the e of his patronymic there are many ways of concealing from the briton your shame in being related through a pedigree of three thousand years to aaron the high priest of israel and cohn is one of the simplest and most effective once taken to task by a pietist solomon defended himself by the quibble that hebrew has no vowels but even this would not account for the whittling away of his solomon s cohn was the insignium over his clothing establishment not that he was anxious to deny his jewishnesswas not the shop closed on saturdayshe was merely anxious not to obtrude it when we are in england we are in england he would say with his talmudic singsong s cohn was indeed a personage in the seaport of sudminster and his name had been printed on voting papers and what is more he had at last become a town councillor really the citizens liked his stanch adherence to his ancient faith evidenced so tangibly by his sabbath shutters even the christian clothiers bore him goodwill not suspecting that s cohns saturday losses were more than counterbalanced by the general impression that a man who sacrificed business to religion would deal more fairly by you than his fellows and his person too had the rotundity which the ratepayer demands but twin with his town councillors pride was his pride in being gabbai treasurer of the little synagogue tucked away in a back street in which for four generations prayer had ebbed and flowed as regularly as the tides of the sea with whose careless rovers the worshippers did such lucrative business the synagogue not the sea was the poetry of these eager traffickers here they wore phylacteries and waved palmbranches and did other picturesque things which in their utter ignorance of catholic or other ritual they deemed unintelligible to the heathen and a barrier from mankind very imposing was solomon cohn in his official pew under the reading platform for there is nothing which so enhances a mans dignity in the synagogue as the consideration of his christian townsmen that is one of the earliest stages of anglicization ii mrs cohn was a pale image of mr cohn seeing things through his gold spectacles and walking humbly in the shadow of his greatness she had dutifully borne him many children and sat on the ground for such as died her figure refused the jewesss tradition of opulency and remained slender as though repressed her work was manifold and unceasing for besides her domestic and shopwomanly duties she was necessarily a philanthropist fettered with jewish charities as the gabbais wife tangled with christian charities as the consort of the town councillor in speech she was literally his echo catching up his mistakes indeed admonished by him of her slips in speaking the councillors english he had had the start of her by five years for she had been brought from poland to marry him through the good offices of a friend of hers who saw in her little dowry the nucleus of a thriving shop in a thriving port and from this initial inferiority she never recoveredfive milestones behind on the road of anglicization it was enough to keep down a more assertive personality than poor hannahs the mere danger of slipping back unconsciously to the banned yiddish put a curb upon her tongue her large dark eyes had a doglike look and they were set pathetically in a sallow face that suggested illhealth yet immense staying power that s cohn was a bit of a bully can scarcely be denied it is difficult to combine the offices of gabbai and town councillor without a selfsatisfaction that may easily degenerate into dissatisfaction with others least endurable was s cohn in his religious rigidity and he could never understand that pietistic exercises in which he found pleasure did not inevitably produce ecstasy in his son and heir and when simon was discovered reading the pirates of pechili dexterously concealed in his prayerbook the boy received a strapping that made his mother wince simons breakfast lay only at the end of a long volume of prayers and having ascertained by careful experiment the minimum of time his father would accept for the gabbling of these empty oriental sounds he had fallen back on penny numbers to while away the hungry minutes the quartering and burning of these tales in an avenging fireplace was not the least of the reasons why the whipped youth wept and it needed several pieces of cake maternally smuggled into his maw while the fathers back was turned to choke his sobs iii with the daughtersand there were three before the son and heirthere was less of religious friction since women have not the pious privileges and burdens of the sterner sex when the eldest deborah was married her husband received by way of compensation the goodwill of the sudminster business while s cohn migrated to the metropolis in the ambition of making s cohns trouserings a household word he did indeed achieve considerable fame in the holloway road gradually he came to live away from his business and in the most fashionable street of highbury but he was never to recover his exalted posts the london parish had older inhabitants the local synagogue richer members the cry for anglicization was common property from pioneer s cohn found himself outmoded the minister indeed was only too englishand especially his wife one would almost have thought from their deportment that they considered themselves the superiors instead of the slaves of the congregation s cohn had been accustomed to a series of clergymen who must needs be taught painfully to parrot our sovereign lady queen victoria the prince of wales the princess of wales and all the royal familythe indispensable atom of english in the serviceso that he the expert had held his breath while they groped and stumbled along the precipitous pass now the whilom gabbai and town councillor found himself almost patronizedas a poor provincialby this mincing genteel clerical couple he retorted by animadverting upon the preachers heterodoxy an urban unconcern met the profound views so often impressed on simon with a strap we are not in poland now said the preacher shrugging his shoulders in poland s cohns blood boiled to be twitted with poland after decades of anglicization he who employed a host of anglosaxon clerks counterjumpers and packers and where did your father come from he retorted hotly he had almost a mind to change his synagogue but there was no other within such easy walking distancean important sabbatic considerationand besides the others were reported to be even worse dread rumours came of a younger generation that craved almost openly for organs in the synagogue and womens voices in the choir nay of even more flagitious spiritsdevotional dynamitardswhose dream was a service all english that could be understood instead of chanted dark mutterings against the ancient rabbis were in the very air of these wealthier quarters of london oh shameless ignorance of the new age s cohn was wont to complain that does not know the limits of anglicization iv that simon should enter his fathers business was as inevitable as that the business should prosper in spite of simon his career had been settled ere his father became aware that highbury aspired even to law and medicine and the idea that simons education was finished was not lightly to be dislodged simons education consisted of the knowledge conveyed in seaport schools for the sons of tradesmen while a long course of penny dreadfuls had given him a peculiar and extensive acquaintance with the ways of the world carefully curtained away in a secret compartment lay his elementary hebrew lore it did not enter into his conception of the perfect englishman ah how he rejoiced in this wider horizon of london so thickly starred with musichalls billiardrooms and restaurants we are emancipated now was his cry we have too much intellect to keep all those old laws and he swallowed the forbidden oyster in a fine spiritual glow which somehow or other would not extend to bacon that stuck more in his throat and so was only taken in selfdefence to avoid the suspicions of a convivial company as he sat at his fathers side in the synagoguea demure son of the covenantthis young englishman lurked beneath his prayingshawl even as beneath his prayerbook had lurked the pirates of pechili in this hidden life mrs s cohn was not an aider or abettor except in so far as frequent gifts from her own pocketmoney might be considered the equivalent of the surreptitious cake of childhood she would have shared in her husbands horror had she seen simon banqueting on unrighteousness and her apoplexy would have been original not derivative for her indeed london had proved narrowing rather than widening she became part of a parish instead of part of a town and of a ghetto in a parish at that the vast background of london was practically a miragethe london suburb was farther from london than the provincial town no longer did the currents of civic life tingle through her she sank entirely to family affairs excluded even from the ladies committee her lords life too shrank though his business extendedthe which uneasily suspected did but increase his irritability he had now the pomp and pose of his late offices minus any visible reason a sir oracle without a shrine an abdomen without authority even the two new sonsinlaw whom his ability to clothe them had soon procured in london listened impatiently once they had safely passed under the canopy and were ensconced in plush parlours of their own home and shop became his only realm and his autocratic tendencies grew the stronger by compression he read the largest circulation and his wife became an echo of its opinions these opinions never nebulous became sharp as illuminated skysigns when the boer war began the impertinent rascals cried s cohn furiously they have invaded our territory is it possible ejaculated mrs cohn this comes of our kindness to them after majuba v a darkness began to overhang the destinies of britain three defeats in one week it is humiliating said s cohn clenching his fist it makes a miserable christmas said mrs cohn gloomily although her spouse still set his face against the christmas pudding which had invaded so many anglojewish homes the festival with its shopwindow flamboyance entered far more vividly into his consciousness than the jewish holidays which produced no impression on the life of the streets the darkness grew denser young men began to enlist for the front the city formed a new regiment of imperial volunteers s cohn gave his foreign houses large orders for khaki trouserings he sent out several parcels of clothing to the seat of war and had the same duly recorded in his favourite christian newspaper whence it was copied into his favourite jewish weekly which was if possible still more chauvinist and had a fullpage portrait of sir asher aaronsberg mp for middleton who was equipping a local corps at his own expense gradually s cohn became aware that the military fever of which he read in both his organs was infecting his clothing emporiumthat his own counterjumpers were in heats of adventurous resolve the military microbes must have lain thick in the khaki they handled at any rate s cohn always quick to catch the contagion of the correct thing announced that he would present a bonus to all who went out to fight for their country and that he would keep their places open for their return the saturday this patriotic offer was recorded in his newspaperon inquiry at s cohns the great clothing purveyor of the holloway road our representative was informed that no less than five of the young men were taking advantage of their employers enthusiasm for england and the empirethe already puffedup solomon had the honour of being called to read in the law and first as befitted the sons of aaron it was a man restored almost to his provincial pride who recited the ancient benediction blessed art thou o lord our god who hast chosen us from among all peoples and given to us his law but there was a drop of vinegar in the cup and why wasnt simon in synagogue he inquired of his wife as she came down the gallery stairs to meet her lord in the lobby where the congregants loitered to chat do i know murmured mrs cohn flushing beneath her veil when i left the house he said he was coming on he didnt know you were to be called up it isnt that hannah he grumbled think of the beautiful warsermon he missed in these dark days we should be thinking of our country not of our pleasures and he drew her angrily without where the brightlydressed worshippers lingeringly exchanging eulogiums on the rule britannia sermon made an oriental splotch of colour on the wintry pavement vi at lunch the reprobate appeared looking downcast where have you been thundered s cohn who never growing older imagined simon likewise stationary i went out for a walkit was a fine morning and where did you go oh dont bother but i shall bother where did you go he grew sullen it doesnt matterthey wont have me who wont have you the war office thank god broke from mrs cohn eh mr cohn looked blankly from one to the other it is nothinghe went to see the enlisting and all that your soup is getting cold but s cohn had taken off his gold spectacles and was polishing them with his serviettealways a sign of a stormy meal it seems to me something has been going on behind my back he said looking from mother to son well i didnt want to annoy you with simons madcap ideas hannah murmured but its all over now thank god oh hed better know said simon sulkily especially as i am not going to be choked off its all stuff what the doctor says im as strong as a horse and whats more im one of the few applicants who can ride one hannah will you explain to me what this meshuggas madness is cried s cohn lapsing into a nonanglicism ive got to go to the front just like other young men what shrieked s cohn enlist you that i brought up as a gentleman its gentlemen thats goingthe city imperial volunteers the volunteers but thats my own clerks no there are gentlemen among them read your paper but not rich jews oh yes i saw several chaps from bayswater we jews of this favoured country put in hannah eagerly grateful to the noble people who have given us every right every liberty must s cohn was taken aback by this halfunconscious quotation from the warsermon of the morning yes we must subscribe and all that he interrupted we must fight said simon you fight his father laughed halfhysterically why youd shoot yourself with your own gun he had not been so upset since the day the minister had disregarded his erudition oh would i though and simon pursed his lips and nodded meaningly as sure as today is the holy sabbath and youd be stuck on your own bayonet like an obstinate pig simon got up and left the table and the room hannah kept back her tears before the servant there she said and now hes turned sulky and wont eat didnt i say an obstinate pig hes always been like that from a baby but his stomach always surrenders he resumed his meal with a wronged air keeping his spectacles on the table for frequent nervous polishing of a sudden the door reopened and a soldier presented himselfgun on shoulder for a moment s cohn devoid of his glasses stared without recognition wild hereditary tremors ran through him born of the russian persecution and he had a vague nightmare sense of the chappers the jewish mangatherers who collected the tribute of young jews for the little father but as simon began to loom through the red fog a gun on the sabbath he cried it was as if the bullet had gone through all his conceptions of life and of simon hannah snatched at the sideissue i read in josephussimons prize for hebrew you knowthat the jews fought against the romans on sabbath yes but they fought for themselvesfor our holy temple but its for ourselves now said simon didnt you always say we are english s cohn opened his mouth in angry retort then he discovered he had no retort only anger and this made him angrier and his mouth remained open quite terrifyingly for poor mrs cohn what is the use of arguing with him she said imploringly the war office has been sensible enough to refuse him we shall see said simon i am going to peg away at em again and if i dont get into the mounted infantry im a dutchmanand of the boer variety he seemed any kind of man save a jew to the puzzled father hannah you must have known of thisthese clothes s cohn spluttered they dont cost anything she murmured the child amuses himself he will never really be called out if he is ill stop his supplies oh said simon airily the government will attend to that indeed and s cohns face grew black but rememberyou may go but you shall never come back oh solomon how can you utter such an awful omen simon laughed dont bother mother hes bound to take me back isnt it in the papers that he promised s cohn went from black to green vii simon got his way the authorities reconsidered their decision but the father would not reconsider his ignorant of his boys graceless existence he fumed at the first fine thing in the boys life tis a wise father that knows his own child mere emulation of his christian comrades and the fun of the thing had long ago induced the lad to add volunteering to his other dissipations but once in it the love of arms seized him and when the call for serious fighters came some new passion that surprised even himself leapt to his breastthe first call upon an idealism choked rather than fed by a misunderstood judaism anglicization had done its work from his schooldays he had felt himself a descendant not of judas maccabaeus but of nelson and wellington and now that his brethren were being mowed down by a kopjeguarded foe his whole soul rose in venomous sympathy and mixed with this genuine instinct of devotion to the great cause of country were stirrings of anticipated adventure gorgeous visions of charges forlorn hopes pickedup shells redoubts stormed heritages of the pirates of pechili and all the military romances that his prayerbook had masked he looked every inch an anglosaxon in his khaki uniform and his great slouch hat with his bayonet and his bandolier the night before he sailed for south africa there was a service in st pauls cathedral for which each volunteer had two tickets simon sent his to his father the lord mayor will attend in state i dare say youll like to see the show he wrote flippantly hell become a christian next said s cohn tearing the cards in twain later mrs cohn pieced them together it was the last chance of seeing her boy viii unfortunately the cathedral service fell on a friday night when s cohn the emporium closed was wont to absorb the sabbath peace he would sit after high tea of which cold fried fish was the prime ingredient dozing over the jewish weekly he still approved platonically of its bellicose sentiments this january night the sabbath arriving early in the afternoon he was snoring before seven and mrs cohn slipped out risking his wrath her religion forced her to make the long journey on foot but hurrying she arrived at st pauls before the doors were opened and throughout the long walk was a morbid sense of one wasted ticket she almost stopped at a friends house to offer the exciting spectacle but dread of a religious rebuff carried her past with christians she was not intimate enough to invite companionship besides would not everybody ask why she was going without her husband she inquired for the door mentioned on her ticket and soon found herself one of a crowd of parents on the steps a very genteel crowd she noted with pleasure her boy would be in good company the scraps of conversation she caught dealt with a world of alien thingshow little she was anglicized she thought after all those years and when she was borne forward into the cathedral her heart beat with a sense of dim remote glories to have lived so long in london and never to have entered here she was awed and soothed by the solemn vistas the perspectives of pillars and arches the great nave the white robes of the choir vaguely stirring a sense of angels the overarching dome defined by a fiery rim but otherwise suggesting dim skyey space suddenly she realized that she was sitting among the men but it did not seem to matter the building kept ones thoughts religious around the waiting congregation the human sea outside the cathedral rumoured and whenever the door was opened to admit some dignitary the roar of cheering was heard like a salvo saluting his entry the lord mayor and the aldermen passed along the aisle preceded by macebearers and mingled with this dazzle of gilded grandeur and robes was a regretful memory of the days when as a town councillors consort she had at least touched the hem of this unknown historic english life the skirl of bagpipes shrilled from withoutthat exotic halfbarbarous sound now coming intimately into her life and then a little later the wild cheers swept into the cathedral like a furious wind and the thrill of the marching soldiers passed into the air and the congregation jumped up on the chairs and craned towards the right aisle to stare at the khaki couples how she looked for simon the volunteers filed on filed onbeardless youths mostly a few with a touch of thought in the face many with the honest nullity of the clerk and the shopman some with the prizefighters jaw but every face set and serious ah at last there was her simonmanlier handsomer than them all but he did not see her he marched on stiffly he was already sucked up into this strange life her heart grew heavy but it lightened again when the organ pealed out the newspapers the next day found fault with the plain music with the responses all in monotone but to her it was divine only the words of the opening hymn which she read in the form of prayer discomforted her fight the good fight with all thy might christ is thy strength and christ thy right but the bulk of the liturgy surprised her so strangely like was it to the jewish the ninetyfirst psalm did they then pray the jewish prayers in christian churches for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways ah how she prayed that for simon as the ecclesiastical voice droned on unintelligibly inaudibly in echoing vaulted space she studied the hymns and verses with their insistent old testament savour culminating in the farewell blessing the lord bless you and keep you the lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you the lord lift up the light of his countenance upon you and give you peace how often she had heard it in hebrew from the priests as they blessed the other tribes her husband himself had chanted it with uplifted palms and curiously grouped fingers but never before had she felt its beauty she had never even understood its words till she read the english of them in the giltedged prayerbook that marked rising wealth surely there had been some monstrous mistake in conceiving the two creeds as at daggers drawn and though she only pretended to kneel with the others she felt her knees sinking in surrender to the larger life around her as the volunteers filed out and the cheers came in she wormed her way nearer to the aisle scrambling even over backs of chairs in the general mellay this time simon saw her he stretched out his martial arm and blew her a kiss oh delicious tears full of heartbreak and exaltation this was their farewell she passed out into the roaring crowd with a fantastic dreamsense of a nightsky and a great stone building dark with age and solemnity and unreal figures perched on railings and points of vantage and hurrahing hordes that fused themselves with the procession and became part of its marching she yearned forwards to vague glories aware of a poor past she ran with the crowd how they cheered her boy her boy she saw him carried off on the shoulders of christian citizens yes he was a hero she was the mother of a hero ix the first news she got from him was posted at st vincent he wrote to her alone with a jocose hope that his father would be satisfied with his sufferings on the voyage not only had the sea been rough but he had suffered diabolically from the inoculation against enteric fever which even after he had got his sealegs kept him to his berth and gave him a day of atonement thirst ah growled s cohn he sees what a fool hes been and hell take the next boat back but that would be desertion well he didnt mind deserting the business mr cohns bewilderment increased with every letter the boy was sleeping in sodden trenches sometimes without blankets and instead of grumbling at that his one grievance was that the regiment was not getting to the front heat and frost hurricane and duststormnothing came amiss and he described himself as stronger than ever and poured scorn on the medical wiseacre who had tried to refuse him all the same sighed hannah i do hope they will just be used to guard the lines of communication she was full of warknowledge acquired with painful eagerness prattled of basuto ponies and mauser bullets pontoons and pompoms knew the exact position of the armies and marked her warmap with coloured pins simon too had developed quite a literary talent under the pressure of so much vivid new life and from his cheery letters she learned much that was not in the papers especially in those tense days when the civs did at last get to the frontand remained there tales of horses mercifully shot and sheep mercilessly poisoned and oxen dropping dead as they dragged the convoys tales of muddle and accident tales of british soldiers slain by their own protective cannon as they lay behind antheaps facing the enemy and british officers culled under the very eyes of the polomatch tales of hospital and camp of shirts turned sable and putties worn to rags and all the hidden miseries of uncleanliness and insanitation that underlie the glories of war there were tales too of quarterrations but these she did not read to her husband lest the mention of bullybeef should remind him of how his son must be eating forbidden food once even two fat pigs were captured at a hungry moment for the battalion but there came a day when s cohn seized those letters and read them first he began to speak of his boy at the warnay to read the letters to enthralled groups in the synagogue lobbygroups that swallowed without reproach the tripha meat cooked in simons messtin it was like being gabbai over again moreover simons view of the boer was so strictly orthodox as to give almost religious satisfaction to the proud parent a canting hypocrite a psalmsinger and devildodger he has no civilization worth the name and his customs are filthy since the great trek he has acquired from long intercourse with his kaffir slaves many of the natives savage traits in short a born liar credulous and barbarous crassly ignorant and inconceivably stubborn crassly ignorant and inconceivably stubborn repeated s cohn pausing impressively havent i always said that the boy only bears out what i knew without going there but hear further is it to be wondered at that the boer farmer hidden in the vast undulations of the endless veldt with his wife his children and his slaves should lose all sense of proportion ignorant of the outside world his sole knowledge filtering through joburgh as s cohn made another dramatic pause it was suddenly borne in on his wife with a stab of insight that he was reading a description of himselfnay of herself of her whole race hidden in the great world awaiting some vague future of glory that never came the important voice of her husband broke again upon her reflections he has held many nights of supplication to his fetish and is still unconvinced that his god of battles is asleep the reader chuckled and a broad smile overspread the synagogue lobby they are braveoh yes but it is not what we mean by itthey are good fighters because they have dutch blood at the back of them and a profound contempt for us their whole life has been spent on the open veldt we are always fighting them on somebodys farm who knows every inch of the ground and they never risk anything except in the trap sort of manoeuvres the brave rush of our tommies is unknown to them and their slim nature would only see the idiocy of walking into a deathtrap cool as in a play were there ever two races less alike wound up the youthful philosopher in his tent i really do not see how they are to live together after the war thats easy enough s cohn had already commented to his wife as oracularly as if she did not read the same morning paper intermarriage in a generation or two there will be one fine angloafrican race thats the solutionmark my words and you can tell the boy as muchonly dont say i told you to write to him father says im to tell you intermarriage is the solution mrs cohn wrote obediently he really is getting much softer towards you tell father thats nonsense simon wrote back the worst individuals we have to deal with come from a boer mother and an english father deposited here by the first transvaal war s cohn snorted angrily at the message that was because there were two governmentshe forgets there will be only one united empire now he was not appeased till private cohn was promoted and sent home a thrilling adventure which the proud reader was persuaded by the lobby to forward to the communal organ the organ asked for a photograph to boot then s cohn felt not only gabbai but town councillor again this wonderful letter of which s cohn distributed printed copies to the staff of the emporium with a beanfeast air ran we go out every dayi am speaking of my own squadroneach officer taking his turn with twenty to fifty men and sweep round the farms a few miles out and we seldom come back without seeing boers hanging round on the chance of a snipe at our flanks or waiting to put up a trap if we go too far the local commando fell on our cattleguard the other daya hundred and fifty to our twentyfiveand we suffered it was a horrible bit of country there was a young chap winstayrather a pal of minehe had a narrow squeak knocked over by a shot in his breast i managed to get him safe back to campheaven knows howand they made me a lancecorporal and the beggar says i saved his life but it was really through carrying a fat letter from his sisternot even his sweetheart we chaff him at missing such a romantic chance he got off with a flesh wound but there is a great blot of red ink on the letter you may imagine we were not anxious to let our comrades go unavenged my superiors being sick or otherwise occupied i was allowed to make a nightmarch with thirtyfive men on a farm nine miles awayjust to get square it was a nasty piece of work as we were within a few miles of the boer laager three hundred strong there was moonlight tooit was like a dream that strange silent ride with only the stumble of a horse breaking the regular thud of the hoofs we surrounded the farm in absolute silence dismounting some thousand yards away and fixing bayonets i told the men i wanted no shotsthat would have brought down the commandobut cold steel and silence we crept up and swept the farmit was weird but alas they were out on the loot the men were furious but we live in hopes the end was a trifle disappointing but s cohn too lived in hopesof some monstrous and memorable butchery even his wife had got used to the firingline now that neither shot nor shell could harm her boy for he shall give his angels charge over thee she had come to think her secret daily repetition of the ninetyfirst psalm talismanic when simon sent home the box which had held the chocolates presented by the queen a boer bullet and other curios s cohn displayed them in his window and the crowd and the business they brought him put him more and more in sympathy with simon and the empire in conversation he deprecated the nonmilitarism of the jew if i were only a younger man myself sir the night mafeking was relieved the emporium was decorated with bunting from roof to basement and a great illuminated window revealed nothing but stacks of khaki trouserings so that although the good man still sulked over simon to his wife she was not deceived and the time drawing nigh for simons return she began to look happily forward to a truly reunited family in her wildest anxiety it never occurred to her that it was her husband who would die yet this is what the irony of fate brought to pass in the unending campaign which death wages with life s cohn was slain and simon returned unscratched from the war to recite the kaddish in his memory x simon came back bronzed and a man the shock of finding his father buried had supplied the last transforming touch and somewhat to his mothers surprise he settled down contentedly to the business he had inherited and now that he had practically unlimited money to spend he did not seem to be spending it but to be keeping better hours than when dodging his fathers eye his only absences from home he accounted for as visits to winstay his pal of the campaign with whom he had got chummier than ever since the affair of the cattleguard winstay he said was of good english family with an old house in harrowfortunately on the london and north western railway so that he could easily get a breath of country air on saturday and sunday afternoons he seemed to have forgotten although the emporium was still closed on saturdays that riding was forbidden and his mother did not remind him of it the life that had been risked for the larger cause she vaguely felt as enfranchised from the limitations of the smaller nearly two months after simons return a special military service was held at the great synagogue on the feast of chanukahthe commemoration of the heroic days of judas maccabaeusand the jewish civs were among the soldiers invited mrs cohn too got a ticket for the imposing ceremony which was fixed for a sunday afternoon as they sat at the midday meal on the exciting day mrs cohn said suddenly guess who paid me a visit yesterday goodness knows said simon mr sugarman and she smiled nervously sugarman repeated simon blankly thetheerthe matrimonial agent what impudence before your year of mourning is up mrs cohns sallow face became one flame not me you she blurted me well of all the cheek and simons flush matched his mothers oh its not so unreasonable she murmured deprecatingly i suppose he thought you would be looking for a wife before long and naturally she added her voice growing bolder i should like to see you settled before i follow your father after all you are no ordinary match sugarman says there isnt a girl in bayswater even who would refuse you the very reason for refusing them cried simon hotly what a ghastly idea that your wife would just as soon have married any other fellow with the same income mrs cohn cowered under his scorn yet felt vaguely exalted by it as by the organ in st pauls and strange tears of shame came to complicate her emotions further she remembered how she had been exported from poland to marry the unseen s cohn ah how this new young generation was snapping asunder the ancient coils how the new and diviner sap ran in its veins i shall only marry a girl i love mother and its not likely to be one of these jewish girls i tell you frankly she trembled one of which jewish girls she faltered oh any sort they dont appeal to me her face grew sallower i am glad your father isnt alive to hear that she breathed but father said intermarriage is the solution retorted simon mrs cohn was struck dumb he was thinking how to make the boers english she said at last and didnt he say the jews must be english too arent there plenty of jewish girls who are english she murmured miserably you mean who dont care a pin about the old customs then wheres the difference retorted simon the meal finished in uncomfortable silence and simon went off to don his khaki regimentals and join in the synagogue parade mrs cohns heart was heavy as she dressed for the same spectacle her brain was busy piecing it all together yes she understood it all nowthose sedulous saturday and sunday afternoons at harrow she lived at harrow then this christian this grateful sister of the rescued winstay it was she who had steadied his life hers were those fat letters faintly aromatic it must be very wonderful this strange passion luring her son from his people with its forbidden glamour how highbury would be scandalized robbed of so eligible a bridegroom the sonsinlaw she had enriched would reproach her for the shame imported into the familythey who had cleaved to the faith andmore formidable than all the restshe heard the tongue of her castoff seaport to whose reverence or disesteem she still instinctively referred all her triumphs and failures yet on the other hand surged her herosons scorn at the union by contract consecrated by the generations but surely a compromise could be found he should have lovethis strange english thingbut could he not find a jewess ah happy inspiration he should marry a quite poor jewesshe had money enough thank heaven that would show him he was not making a match that he was truly in love but this strange girl at harrowhe would never be happy with her no no there were limits to anglicization xi it was not till she was seated in the ancient synagogue relieved from the squeeze of entry in the wake of soldiers and the exhilaration of hearing see the conquering hero comes pealing she knew not whence that she woke to the full strangeness of it all and to the consciousness that she was actually sitting among the menjust as in st pauls and what men everywhere the scarlet and grey of uniforms the glister of gold lacethe familiar decorous lines of devout tophats broken by glittering helmets bearskins white nodding plumes busbies red caps acock glengarries all the colour of the british army mixed with the feathered jauntiness of the colonies and the khaki sombreros of the civs coldstream guards scots guards dragoon guards lancers hussars artillery engineers kings royal rifles all the corps that had for the first time come clearly into her consciousness in her tardy absorption into english realities jews seemed to be among them all and without conscriptionoh what would poor solomon have thought of that the great synagogue itself struck a note of modern english gaiety as of an hotel diningroom freshly gilded divested of its historic mellowness the electric light replacing the ancient candles and flooding the winter afternoon with white resplendence the pulpityes the pulpitwas swathed in the union jack and looking towards the box of the parnass and gabbai she saw it was occupied by officers with gold sashes somebody whispered that he with the medalled breast was a christian knight and commander of the batha great honour for the synagogue what were christians coming to jewish services even as she had gone to christian why here was actually a white cross on an officers sleeve and before these alien eyes the cantor intoning his hebrew chant on the steps of the ark lit the great manybranched chanukah candlestick truly the world was changing under her eyes and when the chief rabbi went toward the ark in his turn she saw that he wore a strange scarlet and white gown military too she imagined in her ignorance andoh even rarer sighthe was followed by a helmeted soldier who drew the curtain revealing the ornate scrolls of the law and amid it all a sound broke forth that sent a sweetness through her blood an organ an organ in the synagogue ah here indeed was anglicization it was thin and reedy even to her ears compared with that divine resonance in st pauls a tinkling apology timidly disconnected from the congregational singing and hovering meekly on the borders of the serviceshe read afterwards that it was only a harmoniumyet it brought a strange exaltation and there was an uplifting even to tears in the glittering uniforms and nodding plumes simons eyes met his mothers and a flash of the old childish love passed between them there was a sermonthe text taken with dual appropriateness from the book of maccabees fully one in ten of the jewish volunteers said the preacher had gone forth to drive out the bold invader of the queens dominions their beloved country had no more devoted citizens than the children of israel who had settled under her flag they had been gratified but not surprised to see in the jewish press the names of more than seven hundred jews serving queen and country many more had gone unrecorded so that they had proportionally contributed more soldiersfrom colonel to buglerboythan their mere numbers would warrant so at one in spirit and ideals were the englishman and the jew whose scriptures he had imbibed that it was no accident that the anglophobes of europe were also antisemites and then the congregation rose while the preacher behind the folds of the union jack read out the names of the jews who had died for england in the faroff veldt every head was bent as the names rose on the hushed air of the synagogue it went on and on this list reeking with each bloody historic field recalling every regiment british or colonial on and on in the reverent silence till a black pall seemed to descend inch by inch overspreading the synagogue she had never dreamed so many of her brethren had died out there ah surely they were knit now these races their friendship sealed in blood as the soldiers filed out of synagogue she squeezed towards simon and seized his hand for an instant whispering passionately my lamb marry herwe are all english alike nor did she ever know that she had said these words in yiddish xii now came an enchanting season of confidences the mother caught up in the glow of this strange love learning to see the girl through the boys eyes though the only aid to his eloquence was the photograph of a plump little blonde with bewitching dimples the time was not ripe yet for bringing lucy and her together he explained in fact he hadnt actually proposed his mother understood he was waiting for the year of mourning to be up but how will you be married she once asked oh theres the registrar he said carelessly but cant you make her a proselyte she ventured timidly he coloured it would be absurd to suddenly start talking religion to her but she knows youre a jew oh i dare say i never hid it from her brother so why shouldnt she know but her fathers a bit of a crank so i rather avoid the subject a crank about jews well old winstay has got it into his noddle that the jews are responsible for the warand that they leave the fighting to the english its rather sickening even in south africa we are not treated as we should be considering her dark eye lost its pathetic humility but how can he say that when you yourselfwhen you saved his well i suppose just because he knows i was fighting he doesnt think of me as a jew its a bit illogical i know and he smiled ruefully but then logic is not the old boys strong point he seemed such a nice old man said mrs cohn as she recalled the photograph of the whitehaired cherub writing with a quill at a property desk oh off his hobbyhorse hes a dear old boy thats why i dont help him into the saddle but how can he be ignorant that weve sent seven hundred at least to the war she persisted why the paper had all their photographs what paper said simon laughing do you suppose he reads the jewish whatsaname like you why hes never heard of it then you ought to show him a copy oh mother and he laughed again that would only prove to him there are too many jews everywhere a cloud began to spread over mrs cohns hardwon content but apparently it only shadowed her own horizon simon was as happily full of his lucy as ever nevertheless there came a sunday evening when simon returned from harrow earlier than his wont and hannahs doglike eye noted that the cloud had at last reached his brow you have had a quarrel she cried only with the old boy but what about the old driveller has just joined some league of londoners for the suppression of the immigrant alien but you should have told him we all agree there should be decentralization said mrs cohn quoting her favourite jewish organ it isnt thatits the old fellows vanity thats hurt you see he composed the appeal to the briton and gloated over it so conceitedly that i couldnt help pointing out the horrible contradictions but lucy his mother began anxiously lucys a brick i dont know what my life would have been without the little darling but listen mother and he drew out a portentous prospectus they say aliens should not be admitted unless they produce a certificate of industrial capacity and in the same breath they accuse them of taking the work away from the british workman now this isnt a jewish question and i didnt raise it as suchjust a piece of muddleand even as an englishman i cant see how we can exclude outlanders here after fighting for the outland but lucy his mother interrupted his vehement selfassertion passed into an affectionate smile lucy was dimpling all over her face she knows the old boys vanity of course she couldnt side with me openly but what will happen will you go there again the cloud returned to his brow oh well well see a letter from lucy saved him the trouble of deciding the point dear silly old sim it ran father has been going on dreadfully so you had better wait a few sundays till he has cooled down after all you yourself admit there is a grievance of congestion and high rents in the east end and it is only naturalisnt itthat after shedding our blood and treasure for the empire we should not be in a mood to see our country overrun by dirty aliens dirty muttered simon as he read has she seen the christian slumsflower and dean street and his handsome oriental brow grew duskier with anger it did not clear till he came to let us meet at the crystal palace next saturday dear quarrelsome person three oclock in the pompeian room i have got an aunt at sydenham and i can go in to tea after the concert and hear all about the missionary work in the south sea islands xiii ensued a new phase in the relation of simon and lucy once they had met in freedom neither felt inclined to revert to the restricted courtship of the drawingroom even though their chat was merely of books and music and pictures it was delicious to make their own atmosphere untroubled by the flippancy of the brother or the earnestness of the father in the presence of lucys artistic knowledge simon was at once abashed and stimulated she moved in a delicate world of symphonies and silverpoint drawings of whose very existence he had been unaware and reverence quickened the sense of romance which their secret meetings had already enhanced once or twice he spoke of resuming his visits to harrow but the longer he delayed the more difficult the conciliatory visit grew father is now deeper in the league than ever she told him he has joined the committee and the prospectus has gone forth in all its glorious selfcontradiction but considering i am the son of an alien and i have fought for there there quarrelsome person she interrupted laughingly no no no you had better not come till you can forget your remote genealogy you see even now father doesnt quite realize you are a jew he thinks you have a strain of jewish blood but are in every other respect a decent christian body christian cried simon in horror why not you fought side by side with my brother you ate ham with us simon blushed hotly but lucy you dont think religion is ham what then merely shem she laughed simon laughed too how clever she was but you know i never could believe in the trinity and all that and whats more i dont believe you do yourself it isnt exactly what one believes i was baptized into the church of englandi feel myself a member really sim you are a dreadfully argumentative and quarrelsome person ill never quarrel with you lucy he said half entreatingly for somehow he felt a shiver of cold at the word baptized as though himself plunged into the font in this wise did both glide away from any deep issue or decision till the summer itself glided away mrs cohn anxiously following the courtship through sims lovesmitten eyes her suggestion that the girl be brought to see her received with equal postponement began to fret for the great thing to come to pass one cannot be always heroically stiffened to receive the cavalry of communal criticism waiting weakens the backbone but she concealed from her boy these flaccid relapses you said youd bring her to see me when she returned from the seaside she ventured to remind him so i did but now her father is dragging her away to scotland you ought to get married the moment she gets back i cant expect her to rush thingswith her father to square still you are not wrong mother its high time we came to a definite understanding between ourselves at least what gasped mrs cohn arent you engaged oh in a way of course but weve never said so in so many words for fear this should be the english way mrs cohn forbore to remark that the definiteness of the sugarman method was not without compensations she merely applauded simons more sensible mood but mrs cohn was fated to a further season of fret day after day the fat letters arrived with the scottish postmark and the faint perfume that always stirred her own wistful sense of lost romancesomething faroff and delicious with the sweetness of roses and the salt of tears and still the lover floating in his golden mist vouchsafed her no definite news one night she found him restive beyond his wont she knew the reason for two days there had been no scented letter and she saw how he started at every creak of the gardengate as he waited for the last post when at length a step was heard crunching on the gravel he rushed from the room and mrs cohn heard the halldoor open her ear disappointed of the rattat morbidly followed every sound but it seemed a long time before her boys returning footstep reached her the strange slow drag of it worked upon her nerves and her heart grew sick with premonition he held out the letter towards her his face was white she cannot marry me because i am a jew he said tonelessly cannot marry you she whispered huskily oh but this must not be i will go to the father i will explain you saved his sonhe owes you his daughter he waved her hopelessly back to her seatfor she had started up it isnt the father its herself now that i wont let her drift any longer she cant bring herself to it shes honest anyway my little lucy she wont fall back on the old jewbaiter but how dare shehow dare she think herself above you her doglike eyes were blazing yet once again why are you jews surprised he said bitterly youve held yourself aloof from the others long enough god knows yet you wonder theyve got their prejudices too and suddenly laying his head on the table he broke into sobssobs that tore at his mothers heart that were charged with memories of his ancient tears of the days of paternal wrath and the rending of the pirates of pechili and again as in the days when his boyish treasures were changed to ashes she stole towards him with an involuntary furtive look to see if s cohns back was turned and laid her hands upon his heaving shoulders but he shook her off why didnt a boer bullet strike me down then with a swift pang of remorse he raised his contorted face and drew hers close against ittheir love the one thing saved from anglicization the jewish trinity the jewish trinity i with the christian mayoress of middleton to take in to dinner at sir asher aaronsbergs leopold barstein as a jewish native of that thriving british centre should have felt proud and happy but barstein was young and a sculptor fresh from the paris schools and salon triumphs he had long parted company with jews and judaism and to his ardent irreverence even the christian glories of middleton seemed unspeakably parochial in paris he had danced at night on the boule miche out of sheer joy of life and joined in choruses over midnight bocks and london itself now seemed drab and joyless though many a gay circle welcomed the wit and high spirits and even the physical graces of this fortunate young man who seemed to shed a blonde radiance all around him the factories of middleton which had manufactured sir asher aaronsberg exmp and nearly all his wealthy guests were to his artistic eye an outrage upon a beautiful planet and he was still in that crude phase of juvenile revolt in which one speaks ones thoughts of the mess humanity has made of its world but unfortunately the mayoress of middleton was deafish so that he could not even shock her with his epigrams it was extremely disconcerting to have his bland blasphemies met with an equally bland smile on his other hand sat mrs samuels the buxom and highly charitable relict of the peoples clothier whose ugly pictorial posters had overshadowed barsteins youth little wonder that the artists glance frequently wandered across the great shining table towards a girl who if they had not been so plaguily intent on honouring his fame might have now been replacing the mayoress at his side true the girl was merely a jewess and he disliked the breed but mabel aaronsberg was unexpected she had a statuesque purity of outline and complexion seemed indeed worthy of being a creation of his own how the tedious old manufacturer could have produced this marmoreal prodigy provided a problem for the sculptor as he almost silently ate his way through the long and exquisite menu not that sir asher himself was unpicturesque indeed he was the very picture of the bluff and burly briton whitebearded like father christmas but he did not seem to lead to yonder vision of poetry and purity lady aaronsberg who might have supplied the missing link was deadbefore even arriving at ladyship alasand when she was alive barstein had not enjoyed the privilege of moving in these high municipal circles this he owed entirely to his foreign fame and to his invitation by the corporation to help in the organization of a local art exhibition i do admire sir asher the mayoress broke in suddenly upon his reflections he seems to me exactly like your patriarchs a palestinian patriarch was the last person sir asher with his hovering lackeys would have recalled to the sculptor who in so far as the patriarchs ever crossed his mind conceived them as resembling rembrandts rabbis but he replied blandly our patriarchs were polygamists exactly assented the deaf mayoress barstein disconcerted yearned to repeat his statement in a shout but neither the pitch nor the proposition seemed suitable to the dinnertable the mayoress added ecstatically you can imagine him sitting at the door of his tent talking with the angels this time barstein did shout but with laughter all eyes turned a bit enviously in his direction youre having all the fun down there called out sir asher benevolently and the bluff britoneven to the northerly burrwas so vividly stamped upon barsteins mind that he wondered the more that the mayoress could see him as anything but the prosy provincial whilom member of parliament he so transparently was a mere literary illusion he thought she has read the bible and now reads sir asher into it as well see a saxon pirate or a norman jongleur in a modern londoner as if to confirm barsteins vision of the bluff and burly briton sir asher was soon heard over the clatter of conversation protesting vehemently against the views of tom fuller the degenerate son of a tory squire give ireland home rule he was crying passionately oh my dear mr fuller it would be the beginning of the end of our empire but the irish have as much right to govern themselves as we have the young englishman maintained they would not so much govern themselves as misgovern the protestant minority cried sir asher becoming almost epigrammatic in his excitement home rule simply means the triumph of roman catholicism it occurred to the cynical barstein that even the defeat of roman catholicism meant no victory for judaism but he stayed his tongue with a salted almond let the briton make the running this the young gentleman proceeded to do at a great pace then how about home rule for india theres no catholic majority there give up india sir asher opened horrified eyes this heresy was new to him give up the brightest jewel in the british crown and let the russian bear come and swallow it up no no a thousand times no sir asher even gestured with his fork in his patriotic fervour forgetting he was not on the platform so i imagine the patriarchs to have talked said the mayoress admiringly observing his animation whereat the sculptor laughed once more he was amused too at the completeness with which the lion of judah had endued himself with the skin of the british lion to a cosmopolitan artist this bourgeois patriotism was peculiarly irritating but soon his eyes wandered again towards miss aaronsberg and he forgot trivialities ii the end of the meal was punctuated not by the rising of the ladies but by the hosts assumption of a black cap which popped up from his coattail pocket with his head thus orientally equipped for prayer sir asher suddenly changed into a rembrandtesque figure his white beard hiding the society shirtfront and as he began intoning the grace in hebrew the startled barstein felt that the mayoress had at least a superficial justification there came to him a touch of new and artistic interest in this prosy provincial exmp who environed by powdered footmen sat at the end of his glittering dinnertable uttering the language of the ancient prophets and he respected at least the sturdiness with which miss aaronsbergs father wore his faith like a phylactery on his forehead it said much for his character that these fellowcitizens of his had once elected him as their member despite his unpopular creed and race and were now willing to sit at his table under this tedious benediction sir asher did not even let them off with the shorter form of grace invented by a wise rabbi for these difficult occasions yet so far as was visible it was only the jewish guestscomically distinguished by serviettes shamefacedly dabbed on their headswho fidgeted under the pious torrent these were no doubt fearful of boring the christians whose precious society the jew enjoyed on a parlous tenure in the hosts son julius a superadded intellectual impatience was traceable he had brought back from oxford a contempt for his fathers creed which was patent to every jew save sir asher barstein observing all this uneasiness became curiously angry with his fellowjews despite that he had scrupulously forborne to cover his own head with his serviette a racial pride he had not known latent in him surged up through all his cosmopolitanism and he maliciously trusted that the brave sir asher would pray his longest he himself had been a tolerable hebraist in his forcedly pious boyhood and though he had neither prayed nor heard any hebrew prayers for many a year his new artistic interest led him to listen to the grace and to disentangle the meaning from the obscuring layers of verbal association and from the peculiar chant enlivened by occasional snatches of melody with which it was intoned how he had hated this grace as a boythis pious taskwork that almost spoilt the anticipation of meals but tonight after so long an interval he could look at it without prejudice and with artistic aloofness render to himself a true impression of its spiritual value we thank thee o lord our god because thou didst give as an heritage unto our fathers a desirable good and ample land and because thou didst bring us forth o lord our god from the land of egypt and didst deliver us from the house of bondage barstein heard no more for the moment the paradox of this retrospective gratitude was too absorbing what sir asher was thankful because over three thousand years ago his ancestors had obtainednot without hard fighting for ita land which had already been lost again for eighteen centuries what a marvellous long memory for a race to have delivered from the house of bondage forsooth sir asher himselfand here a musing smile crossed the artists lipshad never even known a house of bondage unless indeed the house of commons from which he had been delivered by the radical reaction might be so regarded and his own house was as he was fond of saying liberty hall but that the russian jew should still rejoice in the redemption from egypt o miracle of pious patience o sublime that grazed the ridiculous but sir asher was still praying on have mercy o lord our god upon israel thy people upon jerusalem thy city upon zion the abiding place of thy glory upon the kingdom of the house of david thine anointed barstein lost himself in a fresh reverie here was indeed the palestinian patriarch not with the corporation of middleton nor the lobbies of westminster not with his colossal business not even with the glories of the british empire was sir ashers true heart he had but caught phrases from the environment to his deepest self he was not even a briton have mercy o lord upon israel thy people despite all his outward pomp and prosperity he felt himself one of that dispersed and maltreated band of brothers who had for eighteen centuries resisted alike the storm of persecution and the sunshine of tolerance and whose one consolation in the long exile was the dream of zion the artist in barstein began to thrill what more fascinating than to catch sight of the dreamer beneath the manufacturer the hebrew visionary behind the english mp this palatial dwellingplace with its liveried lackeys was then no fort of philistinism in which an artist must needs asphyxiate but a very citadel of the spirit a new respect for his host began to steal upon him involuntarily he sought the face of the daughter the secret of her beauty was after all not so mysterious old asher had a soul and the soul is form and doth the body make unconscious of the effect he was producing on the sensitive artist the rembrandtesque figure prayed on and rebuild jerusalem the holy city speedily and in our days it was the climax of the romance that had so strangely stolen over the british dinnertable rebuild jerusalem today did jews really conceive it as a contemporary possibility barstein went hot and cold the idea was absolutely novel to him evidently as a boy he had not understood his own prayers or his own people all his imagination was inflamed he conjured up a zion built up by such virile hands as sir ashers and peopled by such beautiful mothers as his daughter the great empire that would spring from the unity and liberty of a race which even under dispersion and oppression was one of the most potent peoples on the planet and thus when the ladies at last rose he was in so deep a reverie that he almost forgot to rise too and when he did rise he accompanied the ladies outside the door it was only miss aaronsbergs tactful dont you want to smoke that saved him almost as long a grace as the dinner tom fuller murmured to him as he returned to the table do the jews say that after every meal theyre supposed to barstein replied a little jarred as he picked up a cigar no wonder they beat the christians observed the young radical who evidently took original views so much time for digestion would enable any race to survive in this age of quick lunches in america now they should rule the roast literally he added with a laugh its a beautiful grace said barstein rebukingly the glamour of zion thrown over the prose of diet youre not a jew said tom with a sudden suspicion yes i am the artist replied with a dignity that surprised himself i should never have taken you for one said tom ingenuously despite himself barstein felt a thrill of satisfaction but why he asked himself instantly to feel complimented at not being taken for a jewwhat does it mean is there a core of antisemitism in my nature has our race reached selfcontempt i beg your pardon tom went on i didnt mean to be irreverent i appreciate the picturesqueness of it allhearing the very language of the bible and all that and i do sympathize with your desire for jewish home rule my desire murmured the artist taken aback sir asher here interrupted them by pressing his port upon both and directing the artists attention in particular to the pictures that hung around the stately diningroom there was a gainsborough a reynolds a landseer he drew barstein round the walls i am very fond of the english school he said his cap was back in his coattail and he had become again the bluff and burly briton you dont patronize the italians at all asked the artist no said sir asher he lowered his voice between you and i said heit was his main fault of grammarin italian art one is never safe from the madonna not to mention her son it was a fresh reminder of the palestinian patriarch sir asher never discussed theology except with those who agreed with him nor did he ever whether in private or in public breathe an unfriendly word against his christian fellowcitizens all were sons of the same father as he would frequently say from the platform but in his heart of hearts he cherished a contempt softened by stupefaction for the arithmetical incapacity of trinitarians christianity under any other aspect did not exist for him it was a blunder impossible to a race with a genius for calculation how can three be one he would demand witheringly of his cronies the question was in his eye now as he summed up italian art to the sculptor and a faint smile twitching about his lips invited his fellowjew to share with him his feeling of spiritual and intellectual superiority to the poor blind christians at his table as well as to christendom generally but the artist refused to come up on the pedestal surely the madonna was a very beautiful conception he said sir asher looked startled ah yes you are an artist he remembered you think only of the beautiful outside but how can there be threeinone or oneinthree barstein did not reply and sir asher added in a low scornful tone neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance iii a sudden commission recalled barstein to town before he could even pay his afterdinner call but the seed sown in his soul that evening was not to be stifled this seed was nothing less than the idea of a national revival of his people he hunted up his old prayerbooks and made many discoveries as his modern consciousness depolarized page upon page that had never in boyhood been anything to him but a series of syllables to be gabbled off as rapidly as possible when their meaning was not still further overlaid by being sung slowly to a tune i might as well have turned a prayerwheel he said regretfully as he perceived with what iron tenacity the race beaten down by the roman empire and by every power that had reigned since had preserved its aspiration for its old territory and this mystery of race and blood this beauty of unforgetting aspiration was all physically incarnate in mabel aaronsberg he did not move one inch out of his way to see her because he saw her all day long she appeared all over his studio in countless designs in clay but from this image of the beauty of the race his deepening insight drove him to interpret the tragedy also and he sought out from the slums and small synagogues of the east end strange forlorn figures with ragged curls and wistful eyes it was from one of these figures that he learnt to his astonishment that the dream of zion whereof he imagined himself the sole dreamer was shared by myriads and had even materialized into a national movement he joined the movement and it led him into strange conventicles he was put on a committee which met in a little backroom and which at first treated him and his arguments with deference soon with familiarity and occasionally with contempt hucksters and cigarmakers held forth much more eloquently on their ideals than he could with far greater command of talmudic quotation while their knowledge of how to run their local organization was naturally superior but throughout all the mean surroundings the petty wrangles and the grotesque jealousies that tarnished the movement he retained his inner exaltation he had at last found himself and found his art he fell to work upon a great michelangelesque figure of the awakening genius of his people blowing the trumpet of resurrection it was sent for exhibition to a zionist congress where it caused a furore and where the artist met other artists who had long been working under the very inspiration which was so novel to him and whose work was all around him in plaque and picture in bust and book and even postcard some of them were setting out for palestine to start a school of arts and crafts barstein began to think of joining them meantime the bohemian circles which he had adorned with his gaiety and goodfellowship had been wondering what had become of him his new work in the exhibitions supplied a sort of answer and the few who chanced to meet him reported dolefully that he was a changed man gone was the lighthearted and lightfooted dancer of the paris pavement silent the licentious wit of the neopagan this was a new being with brooding brow and pained eyes that lit up only when they beheld his dream never had bohemia known such a transformation iv but a change came over the spirit of the dream before he could seriously plan out his journey to palestine he met mabel aaronsberg in the flesh she was staying in town for the season in charge of an aunt and the meeting occurred in one of the galleries of the newer art in front of mabels own self in marble she praised the psyche without in the least recognising herself and barstein albeit disconcerted could not but admit how far his statue was from the breathing beauty of the original after this the jewish borderland of bohemia where writers and painters are courted began to see barstein again but unfortunately this was not mabels circle and barstein was reduced to getting himself invited to that jewish bayswater his loathing for which had not been overcome even by his newfound nationalism here amid hundreds of talking and dancing shadows with which some shadowy self of his own danced and talked he occasionally had a magic hour of realitywith mabel one could not be real and not talk of the national dream mabel who took most of her opinions from her brother julius was frankly puzzled though her marmoreal gift of beautiful silence saved her lover from premature shocks she had indeed scarcely heard of such things zionism was something in the east end nobody in her class ever mentioned it but then barstein was a sculptor and strange and besides he did not look at all like a jew so it didnt sound so horrible in his mouth his lithe figure stood out almost anglosaxon amid the crowds of hulking undersized young men and though his manners were not so good as a christiansshe never forgot his blunder at her fathers dinnerpartystill he looked up to one with almost a christians adoration instead of sizing one up with an orientals calculation these other london jews thought her provincial she knew whereas barstein had one day informed her she was universal julius too had admired barsteins sculpture the modern note in which had been hailed by the oxford elect but what most fascinated mabel was the constant eulogy of her lovers work in the christian papers and when at last the formal proposal came it found her fearful only of her fathers disapproval hes so orthodox she murmured as they sat in a rosegarlanded niche at a great jewish charity ball lapped around by waltzmusic and the sweetness of love confessed well im not so wicked as i was he smiled but you smoke on the sabbath leoyou told me and you told me your brother julius does the same yes but father doesnt know if julius wants to smoke on friday evening he always goes to his own room and i shant smoke in your fathers nobut youll tell him youre so outspoken well i wont tell himunless he asks me she looked sad he wont ask youhell never get as far he smiled confidently youre not very encouraging dear whats the matter with me everything youre an artist with all sorts of queer notions and youre not soshe blushed and hesitatednot so rich he pressed her fingers yes i am im the richest man here a little delighted laugh broke from her lips though they went on but you told me your profits are smallmarble is so dear so is celibacy i shall economize dreadfully by marrying she pouted his flippancy seemed inadequate to the situation and he seemed scarcely to realize that she was an heiress but he continued to laugh away her fears she was so beautiful and he was so strongwhat could stand between them certainly not the palestinian patriarch with whose inmost psychology he had fortunately become in such cordial sympathy but mabels pessimism was not to be banished even by the supper champagne they had secured a little table for two and were recklessly absorbed in themselves at the worst we can elope to palestine he said at last gaily serious mabel shuddered live entirely among jews she cried the radiance died suddenly out of his face it was as if she had thrust the knife she was wielding through his heart her silent reception of his nationalist rhapsodies he had always taken for agreement nor might mabel have undeceived him had his ideas remained platonic their irruption into the world of practical politics into her own life was however another pair of shoes since barstein had brought zionism to her consciousness she had noted that distinguished christians were quite sympathetic but this was the one subject on which christian opinion failed to impress mabel zionisms all very well for christianstheyre in no danger of having to go to palestine she had reflected shrewdly and why couldnt you live entirely among jews barstein asked slowly mabel drew a great breath as if throwing off a suffocating weight one couldnt breathe she explained arent you living among jews now dont look so glum silly you dont want jews as background as well as foreground a great ghetto and again she shuddered instinctively every other people is background as well as foreground and you dont call france a ghetto or italy a ghetto there was antisemitism he feltunconscious antisemitismbehind mabels instinctive repugnance to an aggregation of jews and he knew that her instinct would be shared by every jew in that festive aggregation around him his heart sank nevereven in those east end backrooms where the pitiful disproportion of his consumptivelooking collaborators to their great task was sometimes borne in dismally upon himhad he felt so black a despair as in this brilliant supperroom surrounded by all that was strong and strenuous in the racelawyers and soldiers and men of affairs whose united forces and finances could achieve almost anything they set their heart upon jews cant live off one another mabel explained with an air of philosophy barstein did not reply he was asking himself with an artists analytical curiosity whence came this suicidal antisemitism was it the selfcontempt natural to a race that had not the strength to build and fend for itself no alas it did not even spring from so comparatively noble a source it was merely a part of their general imitation of their neighboursjews reflecting everything had reflected even the dislike for the jew only since the individual could not dislike himself he applied the dislike to the race and this unconscious assumption of the prevailing point of view was quickened by the fact that the jewish firstcomers were always aware of an existence on sufferance with their slowlywon privileges jeopardized if too many other jews came in their wake he consulted his own prezionist psychology yes he decided every jew who moves into our country our city our wateringplace our street even seems to us an invader or an interloper he draws attention to us he accentuates our difference from the normal he increases the chance of the renewal of rishus malice and so we become antisemites ourselves but by what a comical confusion of logic is it that we carry over the objection to jewish aggregation even to an aggregation in palestine in our own land or is it only too logical is it that the rise of a jewish autonomous power would be a standing reminder to our fellowcitizens that we others are not so radically british or german or french or american as we have vaunted ourselves are we afraid of being packed off to palestine and is the fulfilment of the dream of eighteen centuries our deadliest dread the thought forced from him a sardonic smile and i feared you were like king henrynever going to smile again mabel smiled back in relief were such a ridiculous people he answered his smile fading into sombreness neither fish flesh fowl nor good red herring well finish your good white fowl laughed mabel she had felt her hold over him slipping and her own apprehensions now vanished in the effort to banish his gloom but she had only started him on a new tack fowl he cried grimly kosher of course but with bits of fried wurst to ape the scraps of bacon and presently we shall be having water ices to simulate cream we cant even preserve our dietary individuality truly said feuerbach der mensch ist was er isst in palestine we shall at least dare to be true to our own gullets he laughed bitterly youre not very romantic mabel pouted indeed this barstein whose mere ideal could so interrupt the rhapsodies due to her admissions of affection was distinctly unsatisfactory she touched his hand furtively under the tablecloth after all she is very young he thought thrilling and youth was plastiche the sculptor could surely mould her besides was she not sir ashers daughter she must surely have inherited some of his love for palestine and his people it was this philistine set that had spoiled her julius too that young oxford prighe reflected illogicallyhad no doubt been a baleful influence shall i give you some almondpudding he replied tenderly mabel laughed uneasily i ask for romance and you offer me almondpudding oh i should like to go to a jewish party where there wasnt almondpudding you shallin palestine he laughed back she pouted again all roads lead to palestine they do he said seriously without palestine our past is a shipwreck and our future a quicksand she looked frightened again but what should we do there we cant pray all day long of course not he said eagerly theres the new generation to train for its glorious future i shall teach in the arts and crafts school bezalel its called isnt that a beautiful name its from bezalel the first man mentioned in the bible as filled with divine wisdom and understanding in all manner of workmanship she shook her head youll be excommunicated the palestine rabbis always excommunicate everything and everybody he laughed what do you know about palestine more than you think father gets endless letters from there with pressed flowers and citrons and olivewood boxes and paperknivesa perennial shower the letters are generally in the most killing english and he wont let me laugh at them because he has a vague feeling that even palestine spelling and grammar are holy barstein laughed again well send all the rabbis to jericho she smiled but retorted thats where theyll send you you maker of graven images why your very profession is forbidden ill corner em with this very bezalel text the cutting of stones is just one of the arts which god says he had inspired bezalel with besides you forget my statue at the bale congress bale isnt palestine theres nothing but superstition and squalor and im sorry to say fathers always bolstering it all up with his cheques bravo sir asher unconsciously he has been bolstering up the eventual renaissance your father and his kind have kept the seed alive we shall bring it to blossom his prophetic assurance cast a fresh shade of apprehension over her marmoreal brow but her face lightened with a sudden thought well perhaps after all we shant need to elope i never thought for a moment we should he answered as cheerfully but all the same we can spend our honeymoon in palestine oh i dont mind that said mabel lots of christians do that there was a cooks party went out from middleton for last easter the lover was too pleased with her acquiescence in the palestinian honeymoon to analyse the terms in which it was given he looked into her eyes and saw there the shechinahthe divine glory that once rested on zion v it was in this happier mood that barstein ran down to middleton to plead his suit verbally with sir asher aaronsberg mabel had feared to commit their fates to a letter whether from herself or her lover a plump negative would be so difficult to fight against a personal interview permitted one to sound the ground to break the thing delicately to reason to explain to charm away objections it was clearly the mans duty to face the music not that barstein expected anything but the music of the wedding march he was glad that his original contempt for sir asher had been exchanged for sincere respect and that the bluff briton was a mere veneer it was to the palestinian patriarch that he would pour out his hopes and his dreams alas he found only the bluff briton and a briton no longer genially but bluntly bluff it is perfectly impossible barstein bewildered pleaded for enlightenment was he not pious enough or not rich enough too artistic or too lowborn or did sir asher consider his past life improper or his future behaviour dubious let sir asher say but sir asher would not say i am not bound to give my reasons we are all proud of your workit confers honour on our community the mayor alluded to it only yesterday he spoke in his best platform manner but to receive you into my familythat is another matter and all the talk advanced things no further it would be an entirely unsuitable match sir asher caressed his long beard with an air of finality with a lovers impatience barstein had made the mistake of seeking sir asher in his countinghouse where the municipal magnate sat among his solidities the mahogany furniture the iron safes the ledgers the silent obsequious clerks and attendants through whom barstein had had to penetrate the factory buildings stretching around with their sense of throbbing machinery and disciplined workers all gave the burly briton a background against which visions and emotions seemed as unreal as ghosts under gaslight the artist felt all this solid life closing round him like the walls of a torturechamber squeezing out his confidence his aspirations his very life then you prefer to break your daughters heart he cried desperately break my daughters heart echoed sir asher in amaze it was apparently a new aspect to him you dont suppose she wont suffer dreadfully barstein went on perceiving his advantage break her heart repeated sir asher startled out of his discreet reticence id sooner break her heart than see her married to a zionist this time it was the sculptors turn to gasp to a what he cried to a zionist you dont mean to deny youre a zionist said sir asher sternly barstein gazed at him in silence come come said sir asher you dont suppose i dont read the jewish papers i know all about your goingson the artist found his tongue butbut he stammered you yearn for zion too naturally but i dont presume to force the hand of providence how can any of us force providence to do anything it doesnt want to surely it is through human agency that providence always works god helps those who help themselves spare me your blasphemies perhaps you think you are the messiah i can be an atom of him the whole jewish people is its own messiahgod working through it take care young man youll be talking trinity next and with these heathen notions you expect to marry my daughter you must excuse me if i wish to hear no further his hand began to wander towards the row of electric bells on his desk then how do you suppose we shall ever get to palestine inquired the irritated artist sir asher raised his eyes to the ceiling in gods good time he said and when will that be when we are either too good or too bad for our present sphere today we are too neutral besides there will be signs enough what signs read your bible mount zion will be split by an earthquake as the prophet barstein interrupted him with an impatient gesture but why cant we go to jerusalem and wait for the earthquake there he asked because we have a mission to the nations we must live dispersed we have to preach the unity of god i have never heard you preach it you lowered your voice when you denounced the trinity to me lest the christians should hear we have to preach silently by our example merely by keeping our own religion we convert the world but who keeps it dispersion among sundaykeeping peoples makes our very sabbath an economic impossibility i have not found it so said sir asher crushingly indeed the growth of the saturday halfholiday since my young days is a remarkable instance of judaizing so we have to remain dispersed to promote the weekend holiday to teach international truth sir asher corrected sharply not narrow tribalism but we dont remain dispersed five millions are herded in the russian pale to begin with the providence of god has long been scattering them to new york yes four hundred thousand in one square mile a pretty scattering sir asher flushed angrily but they go to the argentine too i heard of a colony even in paraguay where they are preaching the unity to the indians i do not discuss religion with a mocker we are in exile by gods decreewe must suffer suffer the artists glance wandered cynically round the snug solidities of sir ashers exile but he forbore to be personal then if we must suffer why did you subscribe so much to the fund for the russian jews sir asher looked mollified at barsteins acquaintance with his generosity that i might suffer with them he replied with a touch of humour then you are a jewish patriot retorted barstein the bluff british face grew clouded again heaven forbid i only know of british patriots you talk treason to your country young man treasoni the young man laughed bitterly it is you zionists that will undermine all the rights we have so painfully won in the west oh then youre not really a british patriot barstein began i will beg you to remember sir that i equipped a corps of volunteers for the transvaal i dare say but a corps of volunteers for zionthat is blasphemy narrow tribalism zions soil is holy we want no volunteers there we want saints and teachers and what would your volunteers do in zion fight the sultan with his million soldiers they couldnt even live in palestine as men of peace there is neither coal nor ironhence no manufactures agriculture its largely stones and swamps not to mention its too hot for jews to work in the fields theyd all starve youve no right to play recklessly with human lives besides even if palestine were as fertile as england jews could never live off one another and think how theyd quarrel sir asher ended almost goodhumouredly his array of arguments seemed to him a row of steamhammers we can live off one another as easily as any other people as for quarrelling werent you in parliament party government makes quarrel the very basis of the constitution sir asher flushed again a long lifetime of laying down the law had ill prepared him for repartee a pretty mess we should make of government he sneered why we have given ministers to every cabinet in the world yeswere all right as long as were under others sir asher was recovering his serenity all right so long as were under others gasped the artist do you realize what youre saying sir asher the boers against whom you equipped volunteers fought frenziedly for three years not to be under others and wethe thought of jewish autonomy makes us foam at the mouth the idea of independence makes us turn in the graves we call our fatherlands sir asher dismissed the subject with a podsnappian wave of the hand this is all a waste of breath fortunately the acquisition of palestine is impossible then why do you pray for itspeedily and in our days sir asher glared at the bold questioner that seems a worse waste of breath added barstein drily i said you were a mocker said sir asher severely it is a divine event i pray fornot the creation of a ghetto a ghetto barstein groaned in sheer hopelessness yes youre an antisemite toolike your daughter like your son like all of us were all antisemites i an antisemite ho ho ho sir ashers anger broke down in sheer amusement i have made every allowance for your excitement he said recovering his magisterial note i was once in love myself but when it comes to calling me an antisemite it is obvious you are not in a fit state to continue this interview indeed i no longer wonder that you think yourself the messiah even if i do our tradition only makes the messiah a man somebody some day will have to win your belief but what i said was that god acts through man ah yes said sir asher goodhumouredly threeinone and oneinthree and why not said barstein with a flash of angry intuition arent you a trinity yourself me sir asher was now quite sure of the sculptors derangement yesthe briton the jew and the antisemitethreeinone and oneinthree sir asher touched one of the electric bells with a jerk he was quite alarmed barstein turned white with rage at his dismissal never would he marry into these triune tribes and its the same in every land where were emancipated as it is called he went on furiously the jews a patriot everywhere and a jew everywhere and an antisemite everywhere passionate hungarians and trueborn italians eaglewaving americans and loyal frenchmen imperial germans and double dutchmen we are dispersed to preach the unity and what we illustrate is the jewish trinity a delicious irony threeinone and oneinthree he laughed to sir asher his laugh sounded maniacal the old gentleman was relieved to see his stalwart doorkeeper enter barstein turned scornfully on his heel neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance he ended grimly the sabbath question in sudminster the sabbath question in sudminster i there was a storm in sudminster not on the waters which washed its leading jews their living but in the breasts of these same marine storekeepers for a competitor had appeared in their hive of industryan alien immigrant without roots or even relatives at sudminster and simeon samuels was equipped not only with capital and enterprisethe showy plateglass front of his shop revealed an enticing miscellanybut with blasphemy and bravado for he did not close on friday eve and he opened on saturday morning as usual the rumour did not get round all sudminster the first friday night but by the sabbath morning the synagogue hummed with it it set a clammy horror in the breasts of the congregants distracted their prayers gave an unreal tone to the cantors roulades brought a tremor of insecurity into the very foundations of their universe for nearly three generations a congregation had been established in sudminsterlike every jewish congregation a camp in not friendly countrystruggling at every sacrifice to keep the holy day despite the supplementary burden of sunday closing and the god of their fathers had not left unperformed his part of the contract for the harvests of profit were abundant and if the latter and the former rain of their unchanging supplication were mere dried metaphors to a people divorced from palestine and the soil for eighteen centuries the wine and the oil came in casks and the corn in cakes the poor were few and well provided for even the mortgage on the synagogue was paid off and now this epicurean was come to trouble the snug security to break the long chain of sabbath observance which stretched from sinai what wonder if some of the worshippers especially such as had passed his blatant shopwindow on their return from synagogue on friday evening were literally surprised that the earth had not opened beneath him as it had opened beneath korah even the man who gathered sticks on the sabbath was stoned to death whispered the squat solomon barzinsky to the lanky ephraim mendel marinedealers both alas that would not be permitted in this heathen country sighed ephraim mendel hitching his prayingshawl more over his left shoulder but at least his windows should be stoned solomon barzinsky smiled with a gleeful imagining of the shattering of the shameless plateglass yes and that waxdummy of a sailor should be hung as an atonement for hisholy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory the last phrase solomon suddenly shouted in hebrew in antiphonal response to the cantor and he rose three times on his toes bowing his head piously no wonder he can offer gold lace for the price of silver he concluded bitterly he sells shoddy new reachmedowns as pawned old clo complained lazarus levy who had taken over s cohns business together with his daughter deborah and he charges the sudminster donkeyheads more than the price we ask for em as new talk of the devil at this point simeon samuels stalked into the synagogue late but serene had the real horned asmodeus walked in the agitation could not have been greater the first appearance in synagogue of a new settler was an event in itself but that this sabbathbreaker should appear at all was startling to a primitive community escorted by the obsequious and unruffled beadle to the seat he seemed already to have engagedthat highpriced seat facing the presidential pew that had remained vacant since the death of tevele the pawnbrokersimeon samuels wrapped himself reverently in his prayingshawl and became absorbed in the service his glossy high hat bespoke an immaculate orthodoxy his long black beard had a rabbinic religiousness his devotion was a rebuke to his gossiping neighbours a wave of uneasiness passed over the synagogue had he been the victim of a jealous libel even those whose own eyes had seen him behind his counter when he should have been consecrating the sabbathwine at his suppertable wondered if they had been the dupe of some hallucination when in accordance with hospitable etiquette the newcomer was summoned canorously to the reading of the lawshall stand simeon the son of nehemiahand he arose and solemnly mounted the central platform his familiarity with the due obeisances and osculations and benedictions seemed a withering reply to the libel when he descended and the parnass proffered his presidential hand in pious congratulation upon the holy privilege all the congregants who found themselves upon his line of return shot forth their arms with remorseful eagerness and thus was simeon samuels switched on to the brotherhood of sudminsterian israel yet as his now trusting coreligionists passed his shop on their homeward walkand many a pair of legs went considerably out of its way to do sotheir eyes became again saucers of horror and amaze the broad plateglass glittered nakedly unveiled by a single shutter the waxen dummy of the sailor hitched devilmaycare breeches the gold lace ticketed with layers of erased figures boasted brazenly of its cheapness the procession of customers came and went and the pavement splashed with sunshine remained imperturbably perturbingly acquiescent ii on the sunday night solomon barzinsky and ephraim mendel in pious black velvet caps and their stout spouses in gold chains and diamond earrings found themselves playing solo whist in the parnasss parlour and their religious grievance weighed upon the game the parnass though at heart as outraged as they by the new departure felt it always incumbent upon him to display his presidential impartiality and his dry humour his authority mainly based on his being the only retired shopkeeper in the community was greatly strengthened by his slow manner of taking snuff at a crisis my dear mendel observed the wizened senior flicking away the spilth with a blue handkerchief simeon samuels has already paid his annual subscriptionand you havent my money is good mendel replied reddening no wonder he can pay so quickly said solomon barzinsky shuffling the cards savagely how he makes his money is not the question said the parnass weightily he has paid it and therefore if i were to expel him as you suggest he might go to law law retorted solomon cant we prove he has broken the law of moses and suppose said the parnass picking up his cards placidly do we want to wash our dirty talysim prayingshawls in public he is right solomon said mrs barzinsky we should become a laughingstock among the heathen i dont believe hed drag us to the christian courts the little man persisted i pass the rubber continued cheerlessly a man who keeps his shop open on sabbath is capable of anything said the lanky mendel gloomily sweeping in his winnings the parnass took snuff judicially besides he may have a christian partner who keeps all the saturday profits he suggested that would be just as forbidden said barzinsky as he dealt the cards but your cousin david his wife reminded him sells his groceries to a christian at passover that is permitted it would not be reasonable to destroy hundreds of pounds of leaven but sabbath partnerships are not permitted perhaps the question has never been raised said the parnass i am enough of a lamdan pundit to answer it retorted barzinsky i prefer going to a specialist rejoined the parnass barzinsky threw down his cards you can go to the devil he cried for shame solomon said his wife dont disturb the game to gehenna with the game the shame is on a parnass to talk like an epikouros epicurean the parnass blew his nose elaborately it stands in the talmud for vain swearing noxious beasts came into the world and if it stands in the psalmist barzinsky interrupted the law of thy mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver it stands in the perek the parnass rejoined severely that the wise man does not break in upon the speech of his fellow it stands in the shulchan aruch barzinsky shrieked that for the sanctification of the sabbath it stands in the talmud interposed mendel with unwonted animation in his long figure that one must not even offer a nut to allure customers from light to heavy therefore it may be deduced that a still small voice broke in upon the storm but simeon samuels hasnt a christian partner said mrs mendel there was an embarrassed pause he has only his wife to help him she went on i know because i went to the shop friday morning on pretence of asking for a cuckooclock but a marinedealer doesnt sell clocks put in the parnasss wife timidly it was her first contribution to the conversation for she was overpowered by her husbands greatness dont be silly hannah said the parnass that was just why mrs mendel asked for it yes but unfortunately simeon samuels did have one mrs mendel confessed and i couldnt get out of buying it there was a general laugh cutthroat competition i call it snarled solomon barzinsky recovering from his merriment but you dont sell clocks said the parnass thats just it he gets hold of our customers on pretence of selling them something else the talmudical prohibition cited by mendel applies to that too so i wasnt so silly put in the parnasss wife feeling vaguely vindicated well you saw his wife said the parnass to mendels wife disregarding his own more than ive done for she wasnt in synagogue perhaps she is the christian partner his suggestion brought a new and holier horror over the cardtable no no replied mrs mendel reassuringly i caught sight of her frying fish in the kitchen this proof of her jewishness passed unquestioned and the newborn horror subsided but in spite of the fish said mr mendel she served in the shop while he was at synagogue yes hissed barzinsky and in spite of the synagogue he served in the shop a greater mockery was never known not at all not at all said the parnass judicially if a man breaks one commandment thats no reason he should break two but he does break two solomon thundered smiting the green cloth with his fist for he steals my custom by opening when im closed take careyou will break my plates said the parnass take a sandwich thank youyouve taken away my appetite im sorrybut the sandwiches would have done the same i really cant expel a respectable seatholder before i know that he is truly a sinner in israel as it is written thou shalt inquire and make search and ask diligently he may have only opened this once by way of a sendoff every dog is allowed one bite at that rate it would be permitted to eat a hamsandwichjust for once said solomon scathingly dont say i called you a dog the parnass laughed a mezaire announced the hostess hurriedly after all its the almightys business not ours no its our business solomon insisted yes agreed the parnass drily it is your business iii the week went by with no lull in the storm though the plateglass window was unshaken by the gusts it maintained its flaunting seductiveness assisted people observed by simeon samuels habit of lounging at his shopdoor and sucking in the hesitating spectator and it did not shutter itself on the sabbath that succeeded the horror was tinged with consternation the strange apathy of the pavement and the sky the remissness of the volcanic fires and the celestial thunderbolts in face of this staring profanity lent the cosmos an air almost of accessory after the fact never had the congregation seen heaven so openly defied and the consequences did not at all correspond with their deep if undefined forebodings it is true a horse and carriage dashed into peleg the pawnbrokers window down the street frightened peleg maintained by the oilskins fluttering outside simeon samuels shop but as the suffering was entirely limited to the nerves of mrs peleg who was pious and to the innocent nose of the horse this catastrophe was not quite what was expected solomon barzinsky made himself the spokesman of the general dissatisfaction and his remarks to the minister after the sabbath service almost insinuated that the reverend gentleman had connived at a breach of contract the rev elkan gabriel quoted scripture the lord is merciful and longsuffering and will not at once awaken all his wrath but meantime the sinner makes a pretty penny quoth solomon unappeased saturday is payday and the heathen havent patience to wait till the three stars are out and our shops can open it is your duty mr gabriel to put a stop to this profanation the minister hummed and had he was middleaged and shabby with a german diploma and accent and a large family it was the first time in his five years of office that one of his congregants had suggested such authoritativeness on his part elected by their vote he was treated as their servant his duties rigidly prescribed his religious ideas curbed and corrected by theirs what wonder if he could not suddenly rise to dictatorship even at home mrs gabriel was a congregation in herself but as the week went by he found barzinsky was not the only man to egg him on to prophetic denunciation the congregation at large treated him as responsible for the scandal and if the seven marinedealers were the bitterest the pawnbrokers and the linendrapers were none the less outraged it is a profanation of the name they said unanimously and such a bad example to our poor he would not listen to me the poor minister would protest you had much better talk to him yourself me the buttonholer would ejaculate i would not lower myself hed think i was jealous of his success simeon samuels seemed indeed a formidable person to tackle bland and aloof he pursued his own affairs meeting the congregation only in synagogue and then more bland and aloof than ever at last the minister received a presidential command to preach upon the subject forthwith but theres no text suitable just yet he pleaded we are still in genesis bah replied the parnass impatiently any text can be twisted to point any moral you must preach next sabbath but we are reading the sedrah weekly portion about joseph how are you going to work sabbathkeeping into that it is not my profession i am a mere manoftheearth but whats the use of a preacher if he cant make any text mean something else well of course every text usually does said the preacher defensively there is the hidden meaning and the plain meaning but joseph is merely historical narrative the sabbath although mentioned in genesis chapter two wasnt even formally ordained yet and what about potiphars wife thats the seventh commandment not the fourth thank you for the information do you mean to say you cant jump from one commandment to another oh well the minister meditated iv and joseph was a goodly person and well favoured and it came to pass that his masters wife cast her eyes upon joseph the congregation looked startled really this was not a text which they wished their pastor to enlarge upon there were things in the bible that should be left in the obscurity of the hebrew especially when ones womenkind were within earshot uneasily their eyes lifted towards the bonnets behind the balconygrating but joseph refused solomon barzinsky coughed peleg the pawnbroker blew his nose like a protesting trumpet the congregations eyes returned from the balcony and converged upon the parnass he was taking snuff as usual my brethren began the preacher impressively temptation comes to us all a sniff of indignant repudiation proceeded from many nostrils a blush overspread many cheeks but not always in the shape it came to joseph in this congregation where by the blessing of the almighty we are free from almost every form of wrongdoing there is yet one temptation which has power to touch usthe temptation of unholy profit the seduction of sabbathbreaking a great sigh of dual relief went up to the balcony and simeon samuels became now the focus of every eye his face was turned towards the preacher wearing its wonted synagogue expression of reverential dignity oh my brethren that it could always be said of us and joseph refused a genial warmth came back to every breast ah now the cosmos was righting itself heaven was speaking through the mouth of its minister the rev elkan gabriel expanded under this warmth which radiated back to him his stature grew his eloquence poured forth polysyllabic as he ended the congregation burst into a heartfelt yosher koach may thy strength increase the minister descended the arksteps and stalked back solemnly to his seat as he passed simeon samuels that gentleman whipped out his hand and grasped the man of gods and his neighbours testified that there was a look of contrite exaltation upon his goodly features v the sabbath came round again but alas it brought no balm to the congregation rather was it a day of unrest the plateglass window still flashed in iniquitous effrontery still the ungodly proprietor allured the stream of custom he does not even refuse to take money solomon barzinsky exclaimed to peleg the pawnbroker as they passed the blasphemous window on their way from the fridayevening service why what would be the good of keeping open if you didnt take money naively inquired peleg behemah animal replied solomon impatiently dont you know its forbidden to touch money on the sabbath of course i know that but if you open your shop all the same you might compromise you might give the customers the things they need as it is written open thy hand to the needy but they could pay on saturday night and if they didnt pay if they drank their money away said the pawnbroker true but why couldnt they pay in advance how in advance they could deposit a sum of money with you and draw against it not with me peleg made a grimace all very well for your line but in mine i should have to deposit a sum of money with them i dont suppose theyd bring their pledges on friday night and wait till saturday night for the money besides how could one remember one would have to profane the sabbath by writing write heaven forbid ejaculated solomon barzinsky but you could have a system of marking the amounts against their names in your register a pin could be stuck in to represent a pound or a stamp stuck on to indicate a crown there are lots of ways one could always give ones self a device he concluded in yiddish but it is written in job he disappointeth the devices of the crafty so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise have a little of jobs patience and trust the lord to confound the sinner we shall yet see simeon samuels in the bankruptcy court i hope not the rogue id like to see him ruined thats what i mean leave him to the lord the lord is too longsuffering said solomon ah our parnass has caught us up good shabbos sabbath parnass this is a fine scandal for a godfearing congregation i congratulate you is he open again gasped the parnass hurled from his judicial calm is my eye open witheringly retorted barzinsky a fat lot of good your preacher does it was you who would elect him instead of rochinsky the parnass reminded him barzinsky was taken aback well we dont want foreigners do we he murmured and you caught an englishman in simeon samuels chuckled the parnass in whose breast the defeat of his candidate had never ceased to rankle not he an englishman plays fair retorted barzinsky he seriously considered himself a briton regarding his naturalization papers as retrospective we are just passing the reverend gabriels house he went on let us wait a moment hell come along and well give him a piece of our minds i cant keep my family waiting for kiddush home service said peleg come home father im hungry put in peleg junior who with various barzinsky boys had been trailing in the parental wake silence impudent face snapped barzinsky if i was your fatherah here comes the minister good shabbos sabbath mr gabriel i congratulate you on the effect of your last sermon an exultant light leapt into the ministers eye is he shut is your mouth shut solomon replied scathingly i doubt if hell even come to shool synagogue tomorrow the ministerial mouth remained open in a fishy gasp but no words came from it im afraid youll have to use stronger language mr gabriel said the parnass soothingly but if he is not there to hear it oh dont listen to barzinsky hell be there right enough just give it to him hot your sermon was too general added peleg who had lingered though his son had not you might have meant any of us but we must not shame our brother in public urged the minister it is written in the talmud that he who does so has no share in the world to come well you shamed us all retorted barzinsky a stranger would imagine we were a congregation of sabbathbreakers but there wasnt any stranger said the minister there was simeon samuels the parnass reminded him perhaps your sermon against sabbathbreaking made him fancy he was just one of a crowd and that you have therefore only hardened him but you told me to preach against sabbathbreaking said the poor minister against the sabbathbreaker corrected the parnass you didnt single him out added barzinsky you didnt even make it clear that joseph wasnt myself i said joseph was a goodly person and wellfavoured retorted the goaded minister the parnass took snuff and his sneeze sounded like a guffaw well well he said more kindly you must try again tomorrow i didnt undertake to preach every saturday grumbled the minister growing bolder as long as simeon samuels keeps open you cant shut said solomon angrily its a duel between you added peleg and simeon actually comes into tomorrows sedrah portion barzinsky remembered exultantly and took from them simeon and bound him before their eyes theres your very text youll pick out simeon from among us and bind him to keep the sabbath or you can say satan has taken simeon and bound him added the parnass you have a choiceyourself or satan perhaps you had better preach yourself then said the minister sullenly i still cant see what that text has to do with sabbathbreaking it has as much to do with sabbathbreaking as potiphars wife shrieked solomon barzinsky vi and jacob their father said unto them me have ye bereaved joseph is not and simeon is not and ye will take benjamin as the word simeon came hissing from the preachers lips a veritable thrill passed through the synagogue even simeon samuels seemed shaken for he readjusted his prayingshawl with a nervous movement my brethren these words of israel the great forefather of our tribes are still ringing in our ears today more than ever is israel crying joseph is notour holy land is lost simeon is notour holy temple is razed to the ground one thing only is left usone blessing with which the almighty father has blessed usour holy sabbath and ye will take benjamin the pathos of his accents melted every heart tears rolled down many a feminine cheek simeon samuels was seen to blow his nose softly thus successfully launched the rev elkan gabriel proceeded to draw a tender picture of the love between israel and his benjamin sabbaththe one consolation of his exile and he skilfully worked in the subsequent verse if mischief befall him by the way on which ye go then shall ye bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to the grave yes it would be the destruction of israel he urged if the sabbath decayed woe to those sons of israel who dared to endanger benjamin from reuben and simeon down to gad and asher his life shall be required at their hands oh it was a redhotcannonballfiring sermon and solomon barzinsky could not resist leaning across and whispering to the parnass wasnt i right in refusing to vote for rochinsky this reminder of his candidates defeat was wormwood to the parnass spoiling all his satisfaction in the sermon he rebuked the talker with a noisy shaa silence the congregation shrank delicately from looking at the sinner it would be too painful to watch his wriggles his neighbours stared pointedly every other way thus the only record of his deportment under fire came from yankele the poor glaziers boy who said that he kept looking from face to face as if to mark the effect on the congregation stroking his beard placidly the while but as to his behaviour after the guns were still there was no dubiety for everybody saw him approach the parnass in the exodus from synagogue and many heard him say in hearty accents i really must congratulate you mr president on your selection of your minister vii you touched his heart so shrieked solomon barzinsky an hour later to the reverend elkan gabriel that he went straight from shool synagogue to his shop solomon had rushed out the first thing after breakfast risking the digestion of his sabbath fish to call upon the unsuccessful minister that is not my fault said the preacher crestfallen yes it isif you had only stuck to my text but no you must set yourself up over all our heads you told me to get in simeon and i obeyed yes you got him in but what did you call him the holy temple a fine thing upon my soul it was only anananalogy stammered the poor minister an apology oh so you apologized to him too better and better no no i mean a comparison a comparison you never compared me to the holy temple and im solomonsolomon who built it solomon was wise murmured the minister oh and im silly if i were you mr gabriel id remember my place and who i owed it to but for me rochinsky would have stood in your shoes rochinsky is lucky oh indeed so this is your gratitude very well either simeon samuels shuts up shop or you do thats final dont forget you were only elected for three years and the little man flung out the parnass meeting his minister later in the street took a similar view you really must preach again next sabbath he said the congregation is terribly wrought up there may even be a riot if simeon samuels keeps open next sabbath i cant answer that they wont go and break his windows then they will break the sabbath oh they may wait till the sabbath is out theyll be too busy opening their own shops dont argue you must preach his shop shut very well said the reverend gabriel sullenly thats right a man with a family must rise to great occasions do you think id be where i am now if i hadnt had the courage to buy a bankrupt stock that i didnt see my way to paying for its a fight between you and simeon samuels may his name be blotted out impatiently cried the minister in the hebrew imprecation no no replied the parnass smiling his name must not be blotted outit must be mentioned andunmistakably it is against the talmud to shame a man is equivalent to murder the minister persisted yet it is written in leviticus thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour and not suffer sin upon him and the parnass took a triumphant pinch viii simeon and levi are brethren into their assembly be not thou united in their selfwill they digged down a wall the parnass applauded mentally the text from jacobs blessing was ingeniously expurgated to meet the case the wall he perceived at once was the sabbaththe jews one last protection against the outer world the one last dyke against the waves of heathendom nor did his complacency diminish when his intuition proved correct and the preacher thundered against the selfwillay and the selfseekingthat undermined israels last fortification what did they seek under the wall did they think their delving spades would come upon a hidden store of gold upon an ancient treasurechest nay it was a coffin they would strikea coffin of dead bones and living serpents a cold wave of horror traversed the synagogue a little shriek came from the gallery i dont think i ever enjoyed a sermon so much said the pawnbroker to the parnass oh hes improving said the parnass still swollen with satisfaction but as that worthy elder emerged from the synagogue placidly snuffing himself he found an excited gentleman waiting him in the lobby it was lazarus levy whom his wife deborah daughter of s cohn now of highbury was vainly endeavouring to pacify either that reverend gabriel goes mr parnass or i resign my membership what is it mr levywhat is the matter everybody knows ive been a good jew all my life and though saturday is so good for the clothing business ive striven with all my might to do my duty by the almighty of course of course everybody knows that and yet today im pointed out as a sinner in israel im coupled with that simeon samuels simeon and levy are brothers in their iniquitywith their assembly be not united a pretty libel indeed the parnasss complacency collapsed like an airball at a pinprick oh nonsense everybody knows he couldnt mean you i dont know so much there are always people ready to think one has just been discovered keeping a backdoor open or something i shouldnt be at all surprised to get a letter from my fatherinlaw in londonyou know how pious old cohn is as for simeon he kept looking at me as if i was his longlost brother ah there comes our precious minister look here mr gabriel ill have the law on you simeons no brother of mine the sudden appearance of simeon through the other swingdoor cut the speaker short good shabbos said the shameless sinner ah mr gabriel that was a very fine sermon he stroked his beard i quite agree with you to dig down a public wall is indefensible nobody has the right to make more than a private hole in it where it blocks out his own prospect so please do not bracket me with mr levy again good shabbos and waving his hand pleasantly he left them to their consternation ix what an impudent face said the gabbai treasurer who witnessed the episode and our minister says im that mans brother exclaimed mr levy hush enough said the parnass with a tactful inspiration you shall read the haphtorah prophetic section next shabbos and mr gabriel must explain he didnt mean me he stipulated mollified by the magnificent mitzvah pious privilege you always try to drive a hard bargain grumbled the parnass thats a question for mr gabriel the reverend gentleman had a happy thought wait till we come to the text wherefore levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren youre a gentleman mr gabriel ejaculated s cohns soninlaw clutching at his hand and if he doesnt close today after your splendid sermon added the gabbai you must call and talk to him face to face the minister made a wry face but thats not in my duties pardon me mr gabriel put in the parnass you have to call upon the afflicted and the bereaved and simeon samuels is spiritually afflicted and has lost his sabbath but he doesnt want comforting well solomon barzinsky does said the parnass go to him instead then for im past soothing him choose ill go to simeon samuels said the preacher gloomily x it is most kind of you to call said simeon samuels as he wheeled the parlour armchair towards his reverend guest my wife will be so sorry to have missed you we have both been looking forward so much to your visit you knew i was coming said the minister a whit startled i naturally expected a pastoral visit sooner or later im afraid it is later murmured the minister subsiding into the chair better late than never cried simeon samuels heartily as he produced a bottle from the sideboard do you take it with hot water thank younot at all i am only staying a moment ah he stroked his beard you are busy terribly busy said the rev elkan gabriel even on sunday rather its my day for secretarial work as theres no school poor mr gabriel i at least have sunday to myself but you have to work saturday and sunday too its really too bad eh said the minister blankly oh of course i know you must work on the sabbath i work onon shabbos the minister flushed to the temples oh im not blaming you one must live in an ideal world of course youd preach and pray and sing and recite the law for nothing so that heaven might perhaps overlook your hard labour but as things are you must take your wages illustration i work onon shabbos the minister had risen agitatedly i earn my wages for the rest of my workthe sabbath work i throw in he said hotly oh come mr gabriel that quibble is not worthy of you but far be it from me to judge a fellowman far be it indeed the attempted turning of his sabrepoint gave him vigour for the lunge youyou whose shop stands brazenly open every saturday my dear mr gabriel i couldnt break the fourth commandment what would you have me break the fourth commandment i do not understand and yet you hold a rabbinic diploma i am told does not the fourth commandment run six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work if i were to close on saturday i should only be working five days a week since in this heathen country sunday closing is compulsory but you dont keep the other half of the commandment said the bewildered minister and on the seventh is the sabbath yes i doafter my six days the seventh is my sabbath i only sinned once if you will have it so the first time i shifted the sabbath to sunday since when my sabbath has arrived regularly on sundays but you did sin once said the minister catching at that straw granted but as to get right again would now make a second sin it seems more pious to let things be not that i really admit the first sin for let me ask you sir which is nearer to the spirit of the commandmentto work six days and keep a day of restmerely changing the day once in ones whole lifetimeor to work five days and keep two days of rest the minister taken aback knew not how to meet this novel defence he had come heavily armed against all the usual arguments as to the necessity of earning ones bread he was prepared to prove that even from a material point of view you really gained more in the long run as it is written in the conclusionofsabbath service blessed shalt thou be in the city and blessed shalt thou be in the field simeon samuels pursued his advantage my coreligionists in sudminster seem to have put all the stress upon the resting half of the commandment forgetting the working half of it i do my best to meet their viewsas you say one should not dig down a wallby attending their sabbath service on a day most inconvenient to me but no sacrifice is too great to achieve prayerful communion with ones brethren but if your views were to prevail there would be an end of judaism the minister burst forth then heaven forbid they should prevail said simeon samuels fervently it is your duty to put the opposition doctrine as strongly as possible from the pulpit then as the minister rose in angry obfuscation you are sure you wont have some whisky he added no i will take nothing from a house of sin and if you show yourself next sabbath i will preach at you again so that is your idea of religionto drive me from the synagogue you are more likely to drive away the rest of the congregation sick of always hearing the same sermon as for me you forget how i enjoy your eloquence devoted though it is to the destruction of judaism me the minister became ungrammatical in his indignation yes you to mix up religion with the almanac people who find that your sabbath wall shuts them out of all public life and all professions just go outside it altogether and think themselves outside the gates of judaism if my fatherpeace be upon himhadnt had your narrow notions i should have gone to the bar instead of being condemned to shopkeeping you are a very good devils advocate now retorted the minister simeon samuels stroked his beard thank you and i congratulate your client you are an epikouros epicurean and i am wasting my time and mine too the minister strode into the shop at the streetdoor he turned then you persist in setting a bad example a bad example to whom to your godly congregation considering every other shop in the town is open on shabbos one more or less cant upset them when it is the only jewish shop are you aware sir that every other jew in sudminster closes rigorously on the sabbath i ascertained that before i settled here said simeon samuels quietly xi the report of the pastors collapse produced an emergency meeting of the leading sheep the midday dinnerhour was chosen as the slackest a babble of suggestions filled the parnasss parlour solomon barzinsky kept sternly repeating his delenda est carthago he must be expelled from the congregation he should be expelled from the town altogether said mendel as it is written and remove satan from before and behind us since when have we owned sudminster sneered the parnass you might as well talk of expelling the mayor and the corporation i didnt mean by act of parliament said mendel we could make his life a torture and meantime he makes yours a torture no no the only way is to appeal to his soul may it be an atonement for us all interrupted peleg the pawnbroker we must beg him not to destroy religion repeated the parnass i thought mr gabriel had done that said the gabbai he is only a minister he has no worldly tact then why dont you go said solomon barzinsky i have too much worldly tact the presidents visit might seem like an appeal to authority it would set up his bristles besides there wouldnt be me left to appeal to the congregation must keep some trump up its sleeve no a mere plain member must go a simple brother in israel to talk to him heart to heart you barzinsky are the very man no no im not such a simple brother as all that im in the same line and he might take it for trade jealousy then peleg must go no no im not worthy to be the sheliach tzibbur envoy of the congregation the parnass reassured him as to his merits the congregation could not have a worthier envoy but i cant leave my business you with your fine grownup daughters cried barzinsky dont beshrew themi will go at once and these gentlemen must await you here said the president tapping his snuffbox incongruously at the here in order to continue the sitting if you fail i cant wait more than a quarter of an hour grumbled various voices in various keys peleg departed nervously upborne by the congregational esteem he returned without even his own instead he carried a bulky barometer you must buy this for the synagogue gentlemen he said it will do to hang in the lobby the parnass was the only one left in command of his breath buy a barometer he gasped well it isnt any good to me retorted peleg angrily then why did you buy it cried the gabbai it was the cheapest article i could get off with but you didnt go to buy said the parnass i know thatbut you come into the shopnaturally he takes you for a customerhe looks so dignified he strokes his beardyou cant look a fool you must be one snapped the parnass and then you come to us to share the expenses well what do i want with a barometer itll do to tell you theres a storm when the chimneypots are blowing down suggested the parnass crushingly put it in your windowyoull make a profit out of it said mendel not while simeon samuels is selling them cheaper as with his sabbath profits he can well afford to do oh he said hed stick to his sabbath profit did he inquired the parnass we never touched on that said peleg miserably i couldnt manage to work the sabbath into the conversation this is terrible barzinskys fist smote the table ill golet him suspect my motives or not the almighty knows they are pure bravo well spoken there was a burst of applause several marinedealers shot out their hands and grasped barzinskys in admiration do not await me gentlemen he said importantly go in peace xii good afternoon mr samuels said solomon barzinsky good afternoon sir what can i do for you youyou dont know me i am a fellowjew thats as plain as the nose on your face you dont remember me from shool mr barzinsky i had the rollingup of the scroll the time you had the elevation of it ah indeed at these solemn moments i scarcely notice people but i am very glad to find you patronizing my humble establishment i dont want a barometer said solomon hurriedly that is fortunate as i have just sold my last but in the way of waterproofs we have a new pattern very seasonable no no i didnt come for a waterproof these oilskins i didnt come to buy anything ah you wish to sell me something not that either the fact is ive come to beg of you as one jew to another a schnorrer interrupted simeon samuels oh lord i ought to have recognised you by that synagogue beginning me a schnorrer the little man swelled skywards me solomon barzinsky whose shop stood in sudminster twenty years before you poked your nose in i beg your pardon there you see im a beggar too and simeon samuels laughed mirthlessly well youve come to beg of me and his fingers caressed his patriarchal beard i dont come on my own account only barzinsky stammered i understand you want a contribution to the passover cake fund my time is precious so is yours what is the parnass giving im not begging for money i represent the congregation dear me why didnt you come to the point quicker the congregation wishes to beg my acceptance of office well its very good of you all especially as im such a recent addition but i really feel a diffidence you see my views of the sabbath clash with those of the congregation they do cried barzinsky leaping at his opportunity yes i am for a much stricter observance than appears general here scarcely one of you carries his handkerchief tied round his loins like my poor old father peace be upon him you all carry the burden of it impiously in a pocket i never noticed your handkerchief round your waist cried the bewildered barzinsky perhaps not i never had a cold it remained furled simeon samuels superb insolence twitched barzinskys mouth agape but you keep your shop open he cried at last that would be still another point of clashing admitted simeon samuels blandly altogether you will see the inadvisability of my accepting office office echoed barzinsky meeting the others ironic fence with crude thwacks do you think a godfearing congregation would offer office to a sabbathbreaker ah so that was at the back of it i suspected something underhand in your offer i was to be given office was i on condition of closing my shop on saturday no mr barzinsky go back and tell those who sent you that simeon samuels scorns stipulations and that when you offer to make him parnass unconditionally he may consider your offer but not till then goodbye you must jog along with your present apology for a parnass youyou elisha ben abuyai and consoled only by the aptness of his reference to the atheist of the talmud barzinsky rushed off to tell the parnass how simeon samuels had insulted them both xiii the parnass however was not to be drawn yet he must keep himself in reserve he still insisted but perhaps he admitted simeon samuels resented mere private members or committeemen let the gabbai go accordingly the pompous treasurer of the synagogue strode into the notorious shop on the sabbath itself catching simeon samuels redhanded but nothing could be suaver than that gentlemans good shabbos what can i do for you you can shut up your shop said the gabbai brusquely and how shall i pay your bill then id rather give you a seat and all the honours for nothing than see this desecration you must have a goodly surplus then we have enough thats strange youre the first gabbai i ever knew who was satisfied with his balancesheet is it your excellent management i wonder or have you endowments thats not for me to say i mean we have five or six hundred pounds in legacies indeed soundly invested i hope firstclass english railway debentures i see trustee stock simeon samuels stroked his beard and so your whole congregation works on the sabbath a pretty confession what do you mean runs railway trains lights enginefires keeps porters and signalmen toiling and pockets the profits who does you sir in particular as the financial representative of the congregation how can any jew hold industrial shares in a heathen country without being a partner in a sabbath businessay and opening on the day of atonement itself and it is you who have the audacity to complain of me i at least do my own dirty work not hide myself behind stocks and shares good shabbos to you mr gabbai and kindly mind your own business in futureyour locomotives and your sidings and your stinking tunnels xiv the parnass could no longer delay the diplomatic encounter twas vain to accuse the others of tactlessness and shirk the exhibition of his own tact he exhibited it most convincingly by not informing the others that he was about to put it to a trial hence he refrained from improving a synagogue opportunity but sneaked one weekday towards the shop he lingered without waiting to be invited within thus all appearance of his coming to rebuke would be removed his mission should pop up from a casual conversation he peeped into the window passed and repassed simeon samuels aware of a fly hovering on the purlieus of his web issued from its centre as the parnass turned his back on the shop and gazed musingly at the sky looks threatening for rain sir observed simeon samuels addressing the back our waterproofs bless my soul but it surely isnt our parnass yes im just strolling about i seem to have stumbled on your establishment lucky for me and a pleasure for me i never knew you had such a nice display wont you come inside and see the stock thank you i must really get back home and besides as you say it is threatening for rain ill lend you a waterproof or even sell you one cheap come in sircome in pray honour me congratulating himself on catching the spider the fly followed him within a quarter of an hour passed in which he must buzz about the stock it seemed vastly difficult to veer round to the sabbath through the web of conversation the spider wove round him simeon samuels conception of a marinedealers stock startled him by its comprehensiveness and when he was asked to admire an indian shawl he couldnt help inquiring what it was doing there well explained simeon samuels occasionally a captain or first mate will come back to england home and beauty and will have neglected to buy foreign presents for his womenkind i then remind him of the weakness of womenkind for such trophies of their menfolks travel excellent i wont tell your competitors oh those cattle simeon snapped his fingers if they stole my idea theyd not be able to carry it out its not easy to cajole a captain no youre indeed a honeyed rascal thought the parnass i also do a brisk business in chutney went on simeon its a thing women are especially fond of having brought back to them from india and yet its the last thing their menkind think of till i remind them of it on their return i certainly brought back none said the parnass smiling in spite of himself you have been in india i have replied the parnass with a happy inspiration and i brought back to my wife something more stimulating than chutney indeed yes the story of the beniisrael the black jews who surrounded by all those millions of hindoos still keep their sabbath ah poor niggers then youve been half round the world all round the world for i went there and back by different routes and it was most touching wherever i went to find everywhere a colony of jews and everywhere the holy sabbath kept sacred but on different days of course said simeon samuels eh not at all on the same day on the same day how could that be the day changes with every move east or west when its day here its night in australia darkness began to cloud the presidential brow dont you try to make black white he said angrily its you that are trying to make white black retorted simeon samuels perhaps you dont know that i hail from australia and that by working on saturday i escape profaning my native australian sabbath while you who have been all round the world and have either lost or gained a day according as you travelled east or west are desecrating your original sabbath either by working on friday or smoking on sunday the parnass felt his head going roundhe didnt know whether east or west he tried to clear it by a pinch of snuff which he in vain strove to make judicial oh and so and soatchewand so youre the saint and im the sinner he cried sarcastically no i dont profess to be a saint replied simeon samuels somewhat unexpectedly but i do think the saturday was meant for palestine not for the lands of the exile where another day of rest rules when you were in india you probably noted that the mohammedans keep friday a poor jew in the bazaar is robbed of his hindoo customers on friday of his jews on saturday and his christians on sunday the fourth commandment is eternal said the parnass with obstinate sublimity but the fifth says that thy days may be long in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee i believe this reward belongs to all the first five commandmentsnot only to the fifthelse an orphan would have no chance of long life keep the sabbath in the land that the lord giveth thee not in england which isnt thine oho retorted the parnass then at that rate in england you neednt honour your father and mother not if you havent got them rejoined simeon samuels and if you havent got a land you cant keep its sabbath perhaps you think we can keep the jubilee also without a country the sabbath is eternal repeated the parnass doggedly it has nothing to do with countries before we got to the promised land we kept the sabbath in the wilderness yes and god sent a double dose of manna on the friday do you mean to say he sends us here a double dose of profit he doesnt let us starve we prospered well enough before you brought your wretched example then my wretched example cannot lead the congregation away i am glad of it you do them much more harm by your way of sabbathbreaking my way yes my dear old fatherpeace be upon himwould have been scandalized to see the burden you carry on the sabbath what burden do i carry your snuffbox the parnass almost dropped it that little thing i call it a cumbrous not to say tasteless thing but before the almighty there is no great and no small one who stands in such a high place in the synagogue must be especially mindful and every unnecessary burden but snuff is necessary for mei cant do without it other presidents have done without it as it is written in jeremiah and the wild asses did stand in the high places they snuffed up the wind the parnass flushed like a beetroot ill teach you to know your place sir he turned his back on the scoffer and strode towards the door but if youd care for a smaller snuffbox said simeon samuels i have an artistic assortment xv at the next meeting of the synagogue council a notice of motion stood upon the agenda in the name of the parnass himself that this council views with the greatest reprobation the breach of the fourth commandment committed weekly by a member of the congregation and calls upon him either to resign his seat with the burial and other rights appertaining thereto or to close his business on the sabbath when the resolution came up mr solomon barzinsky moved as an amendment that weekly be altered into twice a week since the member kept open on friday night as well as saturday the parnass refused to accept the amendment there was only one sabbath a week though it had two periods and the evening and the morning were one day mr peleg supported the amendment they must not leave mr simeon samuels a loophole of escape it was also he said the duty of the council to buy a barometer the rogue had foisted upon him after an animated discussion mainly about the barometer the president accepted the amendment but produced a great impression by altering twice a week into biweekly a mr john straumann however who prided himself on his style and had even changed his name to john because jacob grated on his delicate ear refused to be impressed committed biweekly by a member sounded almost jocose he argued buy buy it sounded like a butchers cry mr enoch the kosher butcher rose amid excitement and asked if he had come there to be insulted sit down sit down said the parnass roughly its no matter how the resolution sounds it will be in writing then why not add sarcastically persisted the stylist committed biweekly by a member by buying and selling order order said the parnass angrily those who are in favour of the resolution carried by a majority sneered the stylist subsiding mr secretarythe president turned to the poor reverendofallworkyou need not record this verbal discussion in the minutes by request said the stylist reviving but whats the use of the resolution if you dont mention the members name suddenly inquired ephraim mendel stretching his long languid limbs but theres only one sabbathbreaker replied the parnass today yes but tomorrow there might be two it could hardly be tomorrow said the stylist for that happens to be a monday barzinsky bashed the table mr president are we here for business or are we not you may be here for businessi am here for religion retorted straumann the stylist youyou snubnosed monkey what do you mean order order gentlemen said the parnass i will not order said solomon barzinsky excitedly i did not come here to be insulted insulted quoth straumann its you that must apologize you illiterate icthyosaurus i appeal to the president you have both insulted me was that worthys ruling i give the word to mr mendel but from both the combatants simultaneously order order from a dozen throats i said simeon samuels name must be put in mendel repeated you should have said so beforethe resolution is carried now said the president and a fat lot of good it will do said peleg gentlemen if you knew him as well as i if you had my barometer to read him by youd see that the only remedy is to put him in cherem excommunication if he cant get buried it is a kind of cherem said the gabbai assuredly added the parnass he will be frightened to think that if he dies suddenly and he is sure to take a sudden death put in barzinsky with unction he will not be buried among jews wound up the parnass hear hear a murmur of satisfaction ran round the table all felt that simeon samuels was cornered at last it was resolved that the resolution be sent to him xvi mr simeon samuels requests me to say that he presents his compliments to the secretary of the sudminster hebrew congregation and begs to acknowledge the receipt of the councils resolution in reply i am to state that mr samuels regrets that his views on the sabbath question should differ from those of his fellowworshippers but he has not attempted to impress his views on the majority and he regrets that in a free country like england they should have imported the tyranny of the lands of persecution from which they came fortunately such procedure is illegal by the act of charles i the sabbath is defined as the sunday and as a british subject mr samuels takes his stand upon the british constitution mr samuels has done his best to compromise with the congregation by attending the sabbath service on the day most convenient to the majority in regard to the veiled threat of the refusal of burial rights mr samuels desires me to say that he has no intention of dying in sudminster but merely of getting his living there in any case under his will his body is to be deported to jerusalem where he has already acquired a buryingplace next year in jerusalem cried barzinsky fervently when this was read to the next meeting order order said the parnass i dont believe in his jerusalem grave they wont admit his dead body he relies on smuggling in alive said barzinsky gloomily as soon as he has made his pile that wont be very long at this rate added ephraim mendel the sooner the better said the gabbai impatiently let him go to jericho there was a burst of laughter to the gabbais great astonishment order order gentlemen said the parnass dont you see from this insolent letter how right i was the rascal threatens to drag us to the christian courts thats clear all that about jerusalem is only dust thrown into our eyes gravedust murmured straumann order he is a dangerous customer shopkeeper corrected straumann the parnass glared but took snuff silently i dont wonder he laughed at us said straumann encouraged biweekly by a member ha ha ha mr president barzinsky screamed will you throw that laughing hyena out or shall i straumann froze to a statue of dignity let any animalcule try it on said he shut up you children ill chuck you both out said ephraim mendel in conciliatory tones the point iswhats to be done now mr president nothingtill the end of the year when he offers his new subscription we refuse to take it that cant be illegal we ought all to go to him in a friendly deputation said straumann these formal resolutions buy buy put his back up well go to him as brothersall israel are brethren and blood is thicker than water chutney is thicker than blood put in the parnass mysteriously hell simply try to palm off his stock on the deputation ephraim mendel and solomon barzinsky jumped up simultaneously what a good idea said ephraim there you have hit it said solomon their simultaneous poppingup had an air of finalitylike the long and the short of it you mean said the parnass befogged in his turn i mean said barzinsky we could buy up his stock me and the other marinedealers between us and he could clear out if he sold it reasonably added mendel even unreasonably you must make a sacrifice for the sabbath said the parnass besides divided among the lot of you the loss would be little and you can buy in my barometer with the rest added peleg we could call a meeting of marinedealers said barzinsky disregarding him we could say to them we must sacrifice ourselves for our religion tell that to the marinedealers murmured straumann and that we must buy out the sabbathbreaker at any cost buy buy said straumann if youd only thought of that sort of buy buy at the first order order said the parnass it would be more in order said straumann to appoint an executive subcommittee to deal with the question im sick of it and surely we as a synagogue council cant be in order in ordering some of our members to buy out another hear hear his suggestion found general approval it took a long discussion however before the synagogue decided to wash its hands of responsibility and give over to a subcommittee of three the task of ridding sudminster of its plaguespot by any means that commended itself to them solomon barzinsky ephraim mendel and peleg the pawnbroker were elected to constitute this council of three xvii the glad news spread through the sudminster congregation that simeon samuels had at last been bought outat a terrible loss to the martyred marinedealers who had had to load themselves with chutney and other unheardof and unsaleable stock but they would get back their losses it was felt by the removal of his rivalry carts were drawn up before the dismantled plateglass window carrying off its criminal contents and simeon samuels stood stroking his beard amid the ruins then the shop closed the shutters that should have honoured the sabbath now depressed the tuesday simeon samuels was seen to get into the london train the demon that troubled their sanctity had been exorcised a great peace reigned in every heart almost like the sabbath peace coming into the middle of the week if they had only taken my advice earlier said solomon barzinsky to his wife as he rolled his forkful of beef in the chutney you can write to your father deborah said lazarus levy that we no longer need the superior reachmedowns on the wednesday strange new rumours began to circulate and those who hastened to confirm them stood dumbfounded before great posters on all the shutters closed for restocking the oldfashioned stock of this business having been sold off to the trade simeon samuels is taking the opportunity to lay in the best and most uptodate london and continental goods for his customers bargains and novelties in every department reopen saturday next xviii a hurried emergency meeting of the executive subcommittee was called he has swindled us said solomon barzinsky this paper signed by him merely undertakes to shut up his shop and he will plead he meant for a day or two and he agreed to leave the town wailed peleg but he meant to buy goods well we can have the law of him said mendel we paid him compensation for disturbance and cant he claim he was disturbed shrieked barzinsky his whole stock turned upside down let him claim said mendel there is such a thing as obtaining money under false pretences and such a thing as becoming the laughingstock of the heathen said peleg we must grin and bear it ourselves its all very well for you to grin said solomon tartly weve got to bear it you didnt take over any of his old rubbish didnt i indeed what about the barometer confound your barometer cried ephraim mendel ill have the law of him ive made up my mind well youll have to bear the cost then said peleg its none of my business yes it is shouted mendel as a member of the subcommittee you cant dissociate yourselves from us a nice idea thatim to be dragged into your lawsuits hush leave off these squabbles said solomon barzinsky the law is slow and not even sure the time has come for desperate measures we must root out the plaguespot with our own hands hear hear said the rest of the subcommittee xix on the succeeding sabbath simeon samuels was not the only figure in the synagogue absorbed in devotion solomon barzinsky ephraim mendel and peleg the pawnbroker were all rapt in equal piety while the rest of the congregation was shaken with dreadful gossip about them their shops were open too it would seem immediately after the service the parnass arrested solomon barzinskys exit and asked him if the rumour were true perfectly true replied solomon placidly the executive subcommittee passed the resolution to to break the sabbath interrupted the parnass we had already sacrificed our money there was nothing left but to sacrifice our deepest feelings but what for why to destroy his advantage of course fivesixths of his sabbath profits depend on the marinedealers closing and when he sees hes breaking the sabbath in vain rubbish you are asked to stop a congregational infection and you vaccinate ourselves with the same stuff to make sure the attack shall be light its a hair of the dog that bit us said mendel who with peleg had lingered to back up barzinsky of the mad dog exclaimed the parnass and youre all raging mad its the only sane way urged peleg when he sees his rivals open you the president turned on him you are not even a marinedealer why are you open how could i dissociate myself from the rest of the subcommittee inquired peleg with righteous indignation you are a set of sinners in israel cried the parnass forgetting even to take snuff this will split up the congregation the congregation through its council gave the committee full power to deal with the matter said barzinsky with dignity but then the other marinedealers will open as well as the committee i trust not replied barzinsky fervently two of us are enough to cut down his takings but the whole lot of you would be still more efficacious oh this is the destruction of our congregation the death of our religion no no no said solomon soothingly you are mistaken we are most careful not to touch money we are going to trust our customers and keep our accounts without pen or ink we have invented a most ingenious system which gives us far more work than writing but we have determined to spare ourselves no trouble to keep the sabbath from unnecessary desecration and once the customers dont pay up your system will break down no no i shall write to the chief rabbi we will explain our motives said mendel your motives need no explanation this scandal must cease and who are you to give orders shrieked solomon barzinsky youre not speaking to a schnorrer mind you my banking account is every bit as big as yours for two pins i start an opposition shool a sunday shool said the parnass sarcastically and why not it would be better than sitting playing solo on sundays we are not in palestine now oh simeon samuels has been talking to you has he i dont need simeon samuels wisdom im an englishman myself xx the desperate measures of the subcommittee were successful the other marinedealers hastened to associate themselves with the plan of campaign and simeon samuels soon departed in search of a more pious seaport but alas homoeopathy was only halfvindicated for the remedy proved worse than the disease and the cuttingout of the original plaguespot left the other marinestores still infected the epidemic spread from them till it had overtaken half the shops of the congregation some had it in a mild formonly one shutter open or a back door not closedbut in many it came out over the whole shopwindow the one bright spot in the story of the sudminster sabbath is that the congregation of which the present esteemed parnass is solomon barzinsky esq jp managed to avert the threatened split and that while in so many other orthodox synagogues the poor minister preaches on the sabbath to empty benches the sudminster congregation still remains at the happy point of compromise acutely discovered by simeon samuels of listening reverentially every saturday morning to the unchanging principles of its ministerelect the while its shops are engaged in supplying the wants of christendom the red mark the red mark the curious episode in the london ghetto the other winter while the epidemic of smallpox was raging escaped the attention of the reporters though in the world of the boardschools it is a vivid memory but even the teachers and the committees the inspectors and the board members have remained ignorant of the part little bloomah beckenstein played in it to explain how she came to be outside the schoolgates instead of inside them we must go back a little and explain her situation both outside and inside her school bloomah was probably blume which is german for a flower but she had always been spelt bloomah in the school register for even boardschool teachers are not necessarily familiar with foreign languages they might have been forgiven for not connecting bloomah with blooms for she was a sadfaced child and even in her tenth year showed deep dark circles round her eyes but they were beautiful eyes large brown and soft shining with love and obedience mrs beckenstein however found neither of these qualities in her youngest born who seemed to her entirely sucked up by the school in my days she would grumble it used to be god almighty first your parents next and school last now its all a red mark first your parents and god almighty nowhere the red mark was the symbol of punctuality set opposite the childs name in the register to gain it she must be in her place at nine oclock to the stroke a moment after nine and only the black mark was attainable twenty to ten and the ducks egg of the absent was sorrowfully inscribed by the recording angel who in bloomahs case was a pale pupilteacher with eyeglasses but it was the banner which loomed largest on the school horizon intensifying bloomahs anxiety and her mothers grievance i dont see nothing mrs beckenstein iterated no prize no medalnothing but a red mark and a banner the banner was indeed a novelty it had not unfurled itself in mrs beckensteins young days nor even in the young days of bloomahs married brothers and sisters as the worthy matron would say theres been jack beckenstein theres been joey beckenstein theres been briny beckenstein theres been benjy beckenstein theres been ada beckenstein theres been becky beckenstein god bless their hearts and they all grew up scholards and prizewinners and a credit to their queen and their religion without this meshuggas madness of a banner vaguely mrs beckenstein connected the degenerate innovation with the invasion of the school by furrinersall these hordes of russian polish and roumanian jews flying from persecution who were sweeping away the good old english families of which she considered the beckensteins a shining example what did english people want with banners and suchlike gewgaws the banner was a class trophy of regularity and punctuality it might be said metaphorically to be made of red marks and indeed its groundhue was purple the class that had scored the highest weekly average of red marks enjoyed its emblazoned splendours for the next week it hung by a cord on the classroom wall amid the dull drab mapsa glorious sight with its oaken frame and its richcoloured design in silk life moved to a chivalrous music lessons went more easily in presence of its proud pomp twas like marching to a band instead of painfully plodding and the desire to keep it became a passion to the winners the little girls strained every nerve never to be late or absent but alas some mischance would occur to one or other and it passed in its purple and gold to some strenuous and luckier class in another section of the building turning to a funeralbanner as it disappeared dismally through the door of the cold and empty room woe to the latecomer who imperilled the banner the black mark on the register was a snowflake compared with the black frown on all those childish foreheads as for the absentee the scowls that would meet her return not improbably operated to prolong her absence only once had bloomahs class won the trophy and that was largely through a yellow fog which hit the other classes worse for bloomah was the black sheep that spoilt the chances of the foldthe black sheep with the black marks perhaps those great rings round her eyes were the black marks incarnate so morbidly did the poor child grieve over her sins of omission yet these sins of omission were virtues of commission elsewhere for if bloomahs desk was vacant it was only because bloomah was slaving at something that her mother considered more important the beckenstein family first the workshop second and school nowhere bloomah might have retorted on her mother at home she was the girlofallwork in the livingrooms she did cooking and washing and sweeping in the shop above whenever a hand fell sick or work fell heavy she was utilized to make buttonholes school hours or no school hours bloomah was likewise the errandgirl of the establishment and the portress of goods to and from s cohns emporium in holloway and the watchdog when mrs beckenstein went shopping or pleasuring lock up the house the latter would cry when bloomah tearfully pleaded for that course my things are much too valuable to be locked up but i know youd rather lose my jewellery than your precious banner when mrs beckenstein had new grandchildrenand they came frequentlybloomah would be summoned in hot haste to the new scene of service curt postcards came on these occasions thus conceived dear mother a son send bloomah briny sometimes these messages were mournfully inverted dear mother poor little rachie is gone send bloomah to your heartbroken becky occasionally the postcard went the other way dear becky send back bloomah your loving mother the care of her elder brother daniel was also part of bloomahs burden and in the evenings she had to keep an eye on his street sports and comrades for since he had shocked his parents by dumping down a new pair of boots on the table he could not be trusted without supervision not that he had stolen the bootsfar worse beguiled by a card cunningly printed in hebrew he had attended the evening classes of the meshummodim those converted jews who try to bribe their brethren from the faith and who are the bugbear and execration of the ghetto daniel was thereafter looked upon at home as a lamb who had escaped from the lions den and must be the object of their vengeful pursuit while on bloomah devolved the duties of shepherd and sheepdog it was in the midst of all these diverse duties that bloomah tried to go to school by day and do her home lessons by night she did not murmur against her mother though she often pleaded she recognised that the poor woman was similarly distracted between domestic duties and turns at the machines upstairs only it was hard for the child to dovetail the two halves of her life at night she must sit up as late as her elders poring over her school books and in the morning it was a fierce rush to get through her share of the housework in time for the red mark in mrs beckensteins language dont eat dont sleep boil nor bake stew nor roast nor fry nor nothing her case was even worse than her mother imagined for sometimes it was ten minutes to nine before bloomah could sit down to her own breakfast and then the steaming cup of tea served by her mother was a terrible hindrance and if that good womans head was turned bloomah would sneak towards the improvised sinkwhich consisted of two dirty buckets the one holding the clean water being recognisable by the tin pot standing on its coveringboardwhere she would pour half her tea into the one bucket and fill up from the other when this stratagem was impossible she almost scalded herself in her gulpy haste then how she snatched up her satchel and ran through rain or snow or fog or scorching sunshine yet often she lost her breath without gaining her mark and as she cowered tearfully under the angry eyes of the classroom a stab at her heart was added to the stitch in her side it made her classmates only the angrier that despite all her unpunctuality she kept a high position in the class even if she could never quite attain prizerank but there came a week when bloomahs family remained astonishingly quiet and selfsufficient and it looked as if the banner might once again adorn the dry scholastic room and throw a halo of romance round the blackboard then a curious calamity befell a girl who had left the school for another at the end of the previous week returned on the thursday explaining that her parents had decided to keep her in the old school an indignant heartcry broke through all the discipline teacher dont have her from bloomah burst the peremptory command go back sarah for the unlucky children felt that her interval would now be reckoned one of absence and they were right sarah reduced the gross attendance by six and the banner was lost yet to have been so near incited them to a fresh spurt again the tantalizing thursday was reached before their hopes were dashed this time the breakdown was even crueller for every pinafored pupil not excluding bloomah was in her place redmarked upon this saintly company burst suddenly bloomahs mother who ignoring the teacher and pointing her finger dramatically at her daughter cried bloomah beckenstein go home bloomahs face became one large red mark at which all the other girls eyes were directed tears of humiliation and distress dripped down her cheeks over the dark rings if she were thus hauled off ere she had received two hours of secular instruction her attendance would be cancelled the class was all in confusion fold arms cried the teacher sharply and the girls sat up rigidly bloomah obeyed instinctively with the rest bloomah beckenstein do you want me to pull you out by your plait mrs beckenstein really you mustnt come here like that said the teacher in her most ladylike accents tell bloomah that answered mrs beckenstein unimpressed shes come here by runnin away from home theres nobody but her to see to things for we are all broken in our bones from dancin at a weddin last night and comin home at four in the mornin and pourin cats and dogs if you go to our house please teacher youll see my benjy in bed hes given up his days work he must have his sleep he earns three pounds a week as head cutter at s cohnshe can afford to be in bed thank god so now then bloomah beckenstein dont they teach you here honour thy father and thy mother poor bloomah rose feeling vaguely that fathers and mothers should not dishonour their children with hanging head she moved to the door and burst into a passion of tears as soon as she got outside after if not in consequence of this behaviour mrs beckenstein broke her leg and lay for weeks with the limb cased in plasterofparis that finished the chances of the banner for a long time between nursing and house management bloomah could scarcely ever put in an attendance so heavily did her twin troubles weigh upon the sensitive child day and night that she walked almost with a limp and dreamed of her name in the register with ominous rows of black ciphers they stretched on and on to infinityin vain did she turn page after page in the hope of a red mark the little black eggs became larger and larger till at last horrid horned insects began to creep from them and scramble all over her and she woke with creeping flesh sometimes she lay swathed and choking in the coils of a black banner and to add to these worries the school board officer hovered and buzzed around threatening summonses but at last she was able to escape to her beloved school the expected scowl of the room was changed to a sigh of relief extremes meet and her absence had been so prolonged that reproach was turned to welcome bloomah remorsefully redoubled her exertions the hope of the banner flamed anew in every breast but the other classes were no less keen a fifth standard in particular kept the banner for a full month grimly holding it against all comers came they ever so regularly and punctually suddenly a new and melancholy factor entered into the competition an epidemic of smallpox broke out in the east end with its haphazard effects upon the varying classes red marks and black marks medals and prizes all was luck and lottery the pride of the fifth standard was laid low one of its girls was attacked two others were kept at home through parental panic a disturbing insecurity as of an earthquake vibrated through the school in bloomahs class aloneas if inspired by her martial determinationthe ranks stood firm unwavering the epidemic spread the ghetto began to talk of special psalms in the little synagogues in this crisis which the epidemic produced the banner seemed drifting steadily towards bloomah and her mates they started monday morning with all hands on deck so to speak they sailed round tuesday and wednesday without a black mark in the schoollog the thursday on which they had so often split was passed under full canvas and if they could only get through friday the trophy was theirs and friday was the easiest day of all inasmuch as in view of the incoming sabbath it finished earlier school did not break up between the two attendances there was a mere dinnerinterval in the playground at midday nobody could get away and whoever scored the first mark was sure of the second bloomah was up before dawn on the fateful winter morning she could run no risks of being late she polished off all her housework wondering anxiously if any of her classmates would oversleep herself yet at heart confident that all were as eager as she still there was always that troublesome smallpox she breathed a prayer that god would keep all the little girls and send them the banner as she sat at breakfast the postman brought a postcard for her mother bloomahs heart was in her mouth when mrs beckenstein clucked her tongue in reading it she felt sure that the epidemic had invaded one of those numerous family hearths her mother handed her the card silently dear mother i am rakked with neuraljia send bloomah to fry the fish becky bloomah turned white this was scarcely less tragic poor becky said her heedless parent theres time after school she faltered what shrieked mrs beckenstein and not give the fish time to get cold its that red mark againsooner than lose it youd see your own sister eat hot fish be off at once to her you unnatural brat or ill bang the fryingpan about your head thatll give you a red markyes and a black mark too my poor becky never persecuted me with banners and shes twice the scholard you are why she cant spell neuralgia said bloomah resentfully and who wants to spell a thing like that its bad enough to feel it wait till you have babies and neuralgy of your own and youll see how youll spell she cant spell racked either put in daniel his mother turned on him witheringly she didnt go to school with the meshummodim bloomah suddenly picked up her satchel whats your books for you dont fry fish with books mrs beckenstein wrested it away from her and dashed it on the floor the pencilcase rolled one way the thimble another but i can get to school for the afternoon attendance madness with your sister in agony have you no feelings dont let me see your brazen face before the sabbath bloomah crept out brokenhearted on the way to beckys her feet turned of themselves by long habit down the miry street in which the redbrick schoolbuilding rose in dreary importance the sight of the great iron gate and the hurrying children caused her a throb of guilt for a moment she stood wrestling with the temptation to enter it was but for the moment she might rise to the heresy of hot fried fish in lieu of cold but beckys sabbath altogether devoid of fried fish was a thought too sacrilegious for her childish brain from her earliest babyhood chunks of cold fried fish had been part of her conception of the day of rest visions and odours of her mother frying plaice and solesat worst cod or mackerelwere inwoven with her most sacred memories of the coming sabbath it is probable she thought friday was short for fryingday with a sob she turned back hurrying as if to escape the tug of temptation bloomah where are you off to it was the alarmed cry of a classmate bloomah took to her heels her face a fiery mass of shame and grief towards midday beckys fish nicely browned and sprigged with parsley stood cooling on the great blue willowpattern dish and beckys neuralgia abated perhaps from the mental relief of the spectacle when the clock struck twelve bloomah was allowed to scamper off to school in the desperate hope of saving the afternoon attendance the london sky was of lead and the london pavement of mud but her heart was aglow with hope as she reached the familiar street a certain strangeness in its aspect struck her people stood at the doors gossiping and excited as though no sabbath pots were acooking straggling groups possessed the roadway impeding her advance and as she got nearer to the school the crowd thickened the roadway became impassable a gesticulating mob blocked the iron gate poor bloomah paused in her breathless career ready to cry at this malicious fate fighting against her and for the first time allowing herself time to speculate on what was up all around her she became aware of weeping and wailing and shrieking and wringing of hands the throng was chiefly composed of russian and roumanian women of the latest immigration as she could tell by the pious wigs hiding their tresses those in the front were pressed against the bars of the locked gate shrieking through them shaking them with passion although bloomahs knowledge of yiddish was slightas became a scion of an old english familyshe could make out their elemental ejaculations you murderers give me my rachel they are destroying our daughters as pharaoh destroyed our sons give me back my children and ill go back to russia they are worse than the russians the poisoners o god of abraham how shall i live without my leah on the other side of the bars the childrenreleased for the dinnerintervalwere clamouring equally shouting weeping trying to get to their mothers some howled with their sleeves rolled up to exhibit the upper arm see the women cried the red marks oh the poisoners a light began to break upon bloomahs brain evidently the school board had suddenly sent down compulsory vaccinators i wont die moaned a plump goldenhaired girl im too young to die yet my little lamb is dying a woman near bloomah with auburn wisps showing under her black wig wrung her hands i hear her talkalways always about the red mark now they have given it her she is poisonedmy little apple your little carrot is all right said bloomah testily theyve only vaccinated her the woman caught at the only word she understood vaccinate vaccinate she repeated then relapsing into jargon and raising her hands heavenward a sudden death upon them all bloomah turned despairingly in search of a wigless woman one stood at her elbow cant you explain to her that the doctors mean no harm bloomah asked oh dont they indeed just you read this she flourished a handbill english on one side yiddish on the other bloomah read the english version not without agitation mothers look after your little ones the school tyrants are plotting to inject filthy vaccine into their innocent veins keep them away rather than let them be poisoned to enrich the doctors there followed statistics to appal even bloomah what wonder if the refugees from lands of persecutionlands in which anything might happenbelieved they had fallen from the fryingpan into the fire if the rumour that executioners with instruments had entered the schoolbuildings had run like wildfire through the quarter enflaming oriental imagination to semimadness while bloomah was reading a headshawled woman fainted and the din and frenzy grew but i was vaccinated when a baby and im all right murmured bloomah half to reassure herself my arm im poisoned and another pupil flew frantically towards the gate the women outside replied with a dull roar of rage and hurled themselves furiously against the lock a window on the playground was raised with a sharp snap and the headmistress appeared shouting alternately at the children and the parents but she was neither heard nor understood and a polish crone shook an answering fist you old maidchildless pitiless shrill whistles sounded and resounded from every side and soon a posse of eight policemen were battling with the besiegers trying to push themselves between them and the gate a fat and genial officer worked his way past bloomah his truncheon ready for action dont hurt the poor women bloomah pleaded they think their children are being poisoned i know missie what can you do with such greenhorns why dont they stop in their own country ive just been vaccinated myself and its no joke to get my arm knocked about like this then show them the red marks and that will quiet them the policeman laughed a sleeveless policeman it would destroy all the dignity and prestige of the force then ill show them mine said bloomah resolutely mine are old and not very showy but perhaps theyll do lift me up pleasei mean on your unvaccinated arm overcome by her earnestness the policeman hoisted her on his burly shoulder the apparent arrest made a diversion all eyes turned towards her you narronim fools she shrieked desperately mustering her scraps of yiddish your children are safe ich bin vaccinated look she rolled up her sleeve der policeman ist vaccinated lookif i tap him he winces see hold on missie the policeman grimaced the king ist vaccinated went on bloomah and the queen and the prince of wales yes even the teachers themselves there are no devils inside there this papershe held up the billis lies and falsehood she tore it into fragments no it is true as the law of moses retorted a man in the mob as the law of moses echoed the women hoarsely bloomah had an inspiration the law of moses pooh dont you know this is written by the meshummodim the crowd looked blank fell silent if indeed the handbill was written by apostates what could it hold but satans lies bloomah profited by her moment of triumph go home you narronim she cried pityingly from her perch and then veering round towards the children behind the bars shut up you squalling sillies she cried as for you golda benjamin im ashamed of youa girl of your age put your sleeve down crybaby bloomah would have carried the day had not her harangue distracted the police from observing another party of rioterswomen assisted by husbands hastily summoned from stall and barrow who were battering at a side gate and at this very instant they burst it open and with a great cry poured into the playground screaming and searching for their progeny the police darted round to the new battlefield expecting an attack upon doors and windows and bloomah was hastily set down in the seething throng and carried with it in the wake of the police who could not prevent it flooding through the broken side gate the large playground became a pandemonium of parents children police and teachers all shouting and gesticulating but there was no riot the law could not prevent mothers and fathers from snatching their offspring to their bosoms and making off overjoyed the children who had not the luck to be kidnapped escaped of themselves some panicstricken some merely mischievous and in a few minutes the school was empty the school management committee sat formally to consider this unprecedented episode it was decided to cancel the attendance for the day red marks black marksall fell into equality the very ciphers were reduced to their native nothingness the schoolweek was made to end on the thursday next monday morning saw bloomah at her desk happiest of a radiant sisterhood on the wall shone the banner the bearer of burdens the bearer of burdens i when her fanny did at last marry natalyaas everybody called the old clowomanwas not overpleased at the bargain natalya had imagined beforehand that for a matronly daughter of twentythree almost past the marrying age any wedding would be a profitable transaction but when a husband actually presented himself all the old dealers critical maternity was set abristle henry elkman she insisted had not a true jewish air there was in the very cut of his clothes a subtle suggestion of going to the races it was futile of fanny to insist that henry had never gone to the races that his duties as bookkeeper of s cohns clothing emporium prevented him from going to the races and that the cut of his clothes was intended to give tone to his own establishment ah yes he does not take thee to the races she insisted in yiddish but all these young men with check suits and flowers in their buttonholes bet and gamble and go to the bad and their wives and children fall back on their old mothers for support i shall not fall back on thee fanny retorted angrily and on whom else a pretty daughter would you fall back on a stranger or perhaps you are thinking of the board of guardians and a shudder of humiliation traversed her meagre frame for at sixty she was already meagre had already the appearance of the venerable grandmother she was now to become save that her hair being only a pious wig remained rigidly young and black life had always gone hard with her since her husbands death when fanny was a child she had scraped together a scanty livelihood by selling odds and ends for a mite more than she gave for them at the back doors of villas she haggled with miserly mistresses gentlewoman and oldclo woman linked by their common love of a bargain natalya would sniff contemptuously at the muddle of ancient finery on the floor and spurn it with her foot how can i sell that she would inquire last time i gave you too muchi lost by you and having wrung the price down to the lowest penny she would pay it in clanking silver and copper from a grimy leather bag she wore hidden in her bosom then cramming the goods hastily into the maw of her sack she would stagger joyously away the mens garments she would modestly sell to a secondhand shop but the womens she cleaned and turned and transmogrified and sold in petticoat lane of a sunday morning scavenger earthworm and alchemist she was a humble agent in the great economic process by which castoff clothes renew their youth and freshness and having set in their original sphere rise endlessly on other social horizons of english she had when she began only enough to bargain with but in one year of forced intercourse with english folk after her husbands death she learnt more than in her quarter of a century of residence in the spitalfields ghetto fannys function had been to keep house and prepare the evening meal but the old clowomans objection to her marriage was not selfish she was quite ready to light her own fire and broil her own bloater after the days tramp fanny had indeed offered to have her live in the elegant tworoomed cottage near kings cross which henry was furnishing she could sleep in a convertible bureau in the parlour but the old womans independent spirit and her mistrust of her soninlaw made her prefer the humble ghetto garret against all reasoning she continued to feel something antipathetic in henrys clothes and even in his occupationperhaps it was really the subconscious antagonism of the old clo and the new subtly symbolic of the old generation and the smart new world springing up to tread it down henry himself was secretly pleased at her refusal in the first ardours of courtship he had consented to swallow even the polish crone who had strangely mothered his buxom british fanny but for his own part he had a responsive horror of old clo felt himself of the great english world of fashion and taste intimately linked with the burly britons whose girths he recorded from his high stool at his glassenvironed desk and in touch even with the lion comique the details of whose cheap but stylish evening dress he entered with a proud flourish ii the years went by and it looked as if the old womans instinct were awry henry did not go to the races nor did fanny have to fall back on her motherinlaw for the maintenance of herself and her two children becky and joseph on the contrary she doubled her position in the social scale by taking a fourroomed house in the holloway road its proximity to the clothing emporium enabled henry to come home for lunch but alas fanny was not allowed many years of enjoyment of these grandeurs and comforts the oneroomed grave took her leaving the fourroomed house incredibly large and empty even natalyas ghetto garret which fanny had not shared for seven years seemed cold and vacant to the poor mother a new loneliness fell upon her not mitigated by ever rarer visits to her grandchildren devoid of the link of her daughter the house seemed immeasurably aloof from her in the social scale henry was frigid and the little ones went with marked reluctance to this stern forbidding old woman who questioned them as to their prayers and smelt of redherrings she ceased to go to the house and then at last all her smouldering distrust of henry elkman found overwhelming justification before the year of mourning was up before he was entitled to cease saying the kaddish funeral hymn for her darling fanny the wretch she heard was married again and marriedvillainy upon villainy horror upon horrorto a christian girl a heathen abomination natalya was wrestling with her overfull sack when she got the news from a gossiping lady client and she was boring holes for the passage of string to tie up its mouth she turned the knife viciously as if it were in henry elkmans heart she did not know the details of the piquant tender courtship between him and the pretty assistant at the great drapery store that neighboured the holloway clothing emporium any more than she understood the gradual process which had sapped henrys instinct of racial isolation or how he had passed from admiration of british ways into entire abandonment of jewish she was spared too the knowledge that latterly her own fanny had slid with him into the facile paths of impiety that they had ridden for a breath of country air on sabbath afternoons they had been considerate enough to hide that from her to the old clowomans crude mind henry elkman existed as a monster of readymade wickedness and she believed even that he had been married in church and baptized despite that her informant tried to console her with the assurance that the knot had been tied in a registrars office may he be cursed with the boils of pharaoh she cried in her picturesque jargon may his fine clothes fall from his flesh and his flesh from his bones may my fannys outraged soul plead against him at the judgment bar and shethis heathen femalemay her death be sudden and she drew the ends of the string tightly together as though round the females neck hush you old witch cried the gossip revolted and what would become of your own grandchildren they cannot be worse off than they are now with a heathen in the house all their judaism will become corrupted she may even baptize them oh father in heaven the thought weighed upon her she pictured the innocent becky and joseph kissing crucifixes at the best there would be no kosher food in the house any more how could this stranger understand the mysteries of purging meat of separating meatplates from butterplates at last she could bear the weight no longer she took the elkman house in her rounds and bent under her sack knocked at the familiar door it was lunchtime and unfamiliar culinary smells seemed wafted along the passage her morbid imagination scented bacon the orthodox amulet on the doorpost did not comfort her it had been left there forgotten a mute symbol of the jewish past a pleasant young woman with blue eyes and freshcoloured cheeks opened the door the blood surged to natalyas eyes so that she could hardly see old clo she said mechanically no thank you replied the young woman her voice was sweet but it sounded to natalya like the voice of lilith stealer of newborn children her rosy cheek seemed smeared with seductive paint in the background glistened the dual crockery of the erst pious kitchen which the newcomer profaned and between natalya and it between natalya and her grandchildren this alien girlish figure seemed to stand barrierwise she could not cross the threshold without explanations is mr elkman at home she asked you know the name said the young woman a little surprised yes i have been here a good deal the old womans sardonic accent was lost on the listener i am sorry there is nothing this time she replied not even a pair of old shoes no but the dead womans are you then standing in them the words were so fierce and unexpected the crones eyes blazed so weirdly that the new wife recoiled with a little shriek henry she cried fork in hand he darted in from the livingroom but came to a sudden standstill what do you want here he muttered fannys shoes she cried who is it his wifes eyes demanded a halfwitted creature we deal with out of charity he gestured back and he put her inside the roomdoor whispering let me get rid of her so thats your painted poppet hissed his motherinlaw in yiddish painted he said angrily madge painted shes just as natural as a rosy apple shes a country girl and her mother was a lady her mother perhaps but she you see a glossy high hat marked sixteen and sixpence and you think its new but i know what its come froma battered thing that has rolled in the gutter ah how she could have bewitched you when there are so many honest jewesses without husbands i am sorry she doesnt please you but after all its my business and not yours not mine after i gave you my fanny and she slaved for you and bore you children its just for her children that i had to marry what you had to marry a christian for the sake of fannys children oh god forgive you we are not in poland now he said sulkily ah i always said you were a sinner in israel my fanny has been taken for your sins a black death on your bones if you dont leave off cursing i shall call a policeman oh lock me up lock me upinstead of your shame let the whole world know that go away then you have no right to come here and frighten madgemy wife she is in delicate health as it is may she be an atonement for all of us i have the right to come here as much as i please you have no right i have a right to the children my blood is in their veins you have no right the children are their fathers yes their fathers in heaven and she raised her hand like an ancient prophetess while the other supported her bag over her shoulder the children are the children of israel and they must carry forward the yoke of the law and what do you propose he said with a scornful sniff give me the children i will elevate them in the fear of the lord you go your own godless way free of burdensyou and your christian poppet you no longer belong to us give me the children and ill go away he looked at her quizzingly you have been drinking my good motherinlaw ay the waters of affliction give me the children but they wont go with you they love their stepmother love that painted jade they with jewish blood warm in their veins with the memory of their mother warm in their hearts impossible he opened the door gently becky joe no dont you come madge darling its all right the old lady wants to say goodday to the children the two children tripped into the passage with napkins tied round their chins their mouths greasy but the rest of their persons unfamiliarly speckless and tidy they stood still at the sight of their grandmother so stern and frowning henry shut the door carefully my lambs natalya cried in her sweetest but harsh tones wont you come and kiss me becky a mature person of seven advanced courageously and surrendered her cheek to her grandmother how are you granny she said ceremoniously and joseph said natalya not replying my heart and my crown will he not come the fourandahalf year old joseph stood dubiously with his fist in his mouth bring him to me becky tell him i want you and him to come and live with me becky shrugged her precocious shoulders he may i wont she said laconically oh becky said the grandmother do you want to stay here and torture your poor mother becky stared shes dead she said yes but her soul lives and watches over you come joseph apple of my eye come with me she beckoned enticingly but the little boy imagining the invitation was to enter her bag and be literally carried away therein set up a terrific howl thereupon the pretty young woman emerged hastily and the child with a great sob of love and confidence ran to her and nestled in her arms mamma mamma he cried henry looked at the old woman with a triumphant smile natalya went hot and cold it was not only that little joseph had gone to this creature it was not even that he had accepted her maternity it was this word mamma that stung the word summed up all the blasphemous foreignness of the new domesticity mamma was redolent of cold christian houses in whose doorways the old clowoman sometimes heard it fanny had been motherthe dear homely jewish mother this mamma taught to the orphans was like the haughty parade of christian elegance across her grave when mammas shoes are to be sold dont forget me natalya hissed ill give you the best price in the market henry shuddered but replied half pushing her outside certainly certainly goodafternoon ill buy them at your own priceah i see them coming coming into my bag the door closed on her grotesque sibylline intensity and henry clasped his wife tremblingly to his bosom and pressed a long kiss upon her fragrant cherry lips later on he explained that the crazy old clowoman was known to the children as to everyone in the neighbourhood as granny iii in the bearing of her first child the second mrs elkman died the rosy face became a white angelic mask the dainty figure lay in statuesque severity and a screaming baldheaded atom of humanity was the compensation for this silence henry elkman was overwhelmed by grief and superstition for three things women die in childbirth kept humming in his brain from his ancient hebrew lore he did not remember what they were except that one was the omission of the wife to throw into the fire the lump of dough from the sabbath bread but these neglects could not be visited on a christian he thought dully the only distraction of his grief was the infants pressing demand on his attention it was some days before the news penetrated to the old woman it is his punishment she said with solemn satisfaction now my fannys spirit will rest but she did not gloat over the decree of the god of israel as she had imagined beforehand nor did she call for the dead womans old clo she was simply contentan unrighteous universe had been set straight again like a mended watch but she did call without her bag to inquire if she could be of service in this tragic crisis out of my sight you and your evil eye cried henry as he banged the door in her face natalya burst into tears torn by a chaos of emotions so she was still to be shut out iv the next news that leaked into natalyas wizened ear was as startling as madges death henry had married again doubtless with the same pretext of the childrens needs he had taken unto himself a third wife and again without the decencies of adequate delay and this wife was a jewess as of yore henry had reverted matrimonially to the fold was it conscience was it terror nobody knew but everybody knew that the third mrs elkman was a bouncing beauty of a good orthodox stock that she brought with her fifty pounds in cash besides bedding and houselinen accumulated by her parents without prevision that she would marry an old hand already provided with these household elements the old clowomans emotions were more mingled than ever she felt vaguely that the jewish minister should not so unquestioningly have accorded the scamp the privileges of the hymeneal canopy some lustral rite seemed necessary to purify him of his christian conjunction and the memory of fanny was still outraged by this burying of her so to speak under layers of successive wives on the other hand the children would revert to judaism and they would have a jewish mother not a mamma to care for them and to love them the thought consoled her for being shut out of their lives as she felt she must have been even had henry been friendlier this third wife had alienated her from the household had made her kinship practically remote she had sunk to a sort of third cousin or a motherinlaw twice removed the days went on and again the elkman household occupied the gossips and news of itsecondhand like everything that came to herwas picked up by natalya on her rounds henrys third wife was it transpired a melancholy failure her temper was frightful she beat her stepchildren andworst and rarest sin in the jewish housewifeshe drank henry was said to be in despair nebbich the poor little children cried natalya horrified her brain began plotting how to interfere but she could find no way the weeks passed with gathering rumours of the iniquities of the third mrs elkman and then at last came the thunderclaphenry had disappeared without leaving a trace the wicked wife and the innocent brats had the fourroomed home to themselves the clothing emporium knew him no more some whispered suicide others america benjamin beckenstein the cutter of the emporium who favoured the latter hypothesis reported a significant saying i have lived with two angels i cant live with a demon ah at last he sees my fanny was an angel said natalya neglecting to draw the deduction anent america and passing over the other angel and she embroidered the theme how indeed could a man who had known the blessing of a sober godfearing wife endure a drunkard and a childbeater no wonder he killed himself the gossips pointed out that the saying implied flight rather than suicide you are right natalya admitted illogically just what a coward and blackguard like that would doleave the children at the mercy of the woman he couldnt face himself how in heavens name will they live oh her father the furrier will have to look after them the gossips assured her he gave her good money you know fifty pounds and the bedding ah trust elkman for that he knew he wasnt leaving the children to starve i dont know so much said the old woman shaking her bewigged head what was to be done suppose the furrier refused the burden but henrys flight she felt had removed her even farther from the elkman household if she went to spy out the land she would now have to face the virago in possession but no on second thoughts it was this other woman whom henrys flight had changed to a stranger what had the wretch to do with the children she was a mere intruder in the house out with her or at least out with the children yes she would go boldly there and demand them poor becky poor joseph her heart wailed you to be beaten and neglected after having known the love of a mother true it would not be easy to support them but a little more haggling a little more tramping a little more mending and a little less gorging and gormandising they would be at school during the day so would not interfere with her rounds and in the evening she could have them with her as she sat refurbishing the purchases of the day ah what a blessed release from the burden of loneliness heavier than the heaviest sack it was well worth the price and then at bedtime she would say the hebrew nightprayer with them and tuck them up just as she had once done with her fanny but how if the woman refused to yield them upas natalya could fancy her refusingout of sheer temper and devilry what if amply subsidized by her welltodo parent she wished to keep the little ones by her and revenge upon them their fathers desertion or hold them hostages for his return why then natalya would use cunningay and force tooshe would even kidnap them once in their grandmothers hands the law would see to it that they did not go back to this stranger this bibulous brute whose rights over them were nil it was while buying up on a sunday afternoon the sloughed vestments of a jewish family in holloway that her resolve came to a head a cab would be necessary to carry her goods to her distant garret what an opportunity for carrying off the children at the same time the house was actually on her homeward route the economy of it tickled her made her overestimate the chances of capture as she packed the motley farspreading heap into the symmetry of her sack pressing and squeezing the clothes incredibly tighter and tighter till it seemed a magic sack that could swallow up even the holloway clothing emporium natalyas brain revolved feverish fancypictures of the coming adventure leaving the bag in the basement passage she ran to fetch a cab usually the hiring of the vehicle occupied natalya half an hour she would harangue the christian cabmen on the rank pleading her poverty and begging to be conveyed with her goods for a ridiculous sum at first none of them would take notice of the old jewish crone but would read their papers in contemptuous indifference but gradually as they remained idly on the rank the endless stream of persuasion would begin to percolate and at last one would relent half out of pity and would end by bearing the sack gratuitously on his shoulder from the house to his cab often there were two sacks quite filling the interior of a fourwheeler and then natalya would ride triumphantly beside her cabby on the box the two already the best of friends things went ill if natalya did not end by trading off something in the sacks against the fareat a new profit but today she was too excited to strike more than a mediocre bargain the cumbrous sack was hoisted into the cab natalya sprang in beside it and in a resolute voice bade the driver draw up for a moment at the elkman home v the unwonted phenomenon of a cab brought becky to the door ere her grandmother could jump out she was still under ten but prematurely developed in body as in mind there was something unintentionally insolent in her precocity in her habitual treatment of adults as equals but now her face changed almost to a childs and with a glad tearful cry of oh grandmother she sprang into the old womans arms it was the compensation for little josephs mamma tears ran down the old womans cheeks as she hugged the strayed lamb to her breast a petulant infantile wail came from within but neither noted it where is your stepmother my poor angel natalya asked in a half whisper beckys forehead gloomed in an ugly frown her face became a womans again one oclock the publichouses open on sundays she snorted oh my god cried natalya forgetting that the circumstance was favouring her project a jewish woman you dont mean to say that she drinks in publichouses you dont suppose i would let her drink here said becky we have nice scenes i can tell you the only consolation is shes bettertempered when shes quite drunk the infants wail rang out more clamorously hush you little beast becky ejaculated but she moved mechanically within and her grandmother followed her all the ancient grandeur of the sittingroom seemed overclouded with shabbiness and untidiness to natalya everything looked and smelt like the things in her bag and there in a stuffy cradle a baby wrinkled its red face with shrieking becky had bent over it and was soothing it ere its existence penetrated at all to the old womans preoccupied brain its pipings had been like an unheeded wail of wind round some centre of tragic experience even when she realized the childs existence her brain groped for some seconds in search of its identity ah the baby whose birth had cost that painted poppets life so it still lived and howled in unwelcome reminder and perpetuation of that brief but shameful episode grow dumb like your mother she murmured resentfully what a bequest of misery henry elkman had left behind him ah how right she had been to suspect him from the very first but where is my little joseph she said aloud hes playing somewhere in the street ach mein gott playing when he ought to be weeping like this child of shame go and fetch him at once what do you want him for i am going to take you both awayout of this misery youd like to come and live with meeh my lamb ratheranythings better than this natalya caught her to her breast again go and fetch my joseph but quick quick before the publichouse woman comes back becky flew out and natalya sank into a chair breathless with emotion and fatigue the baby in the cradle beside her howled more vigorously and automatically her foot sought the rocker and she heard herself singing sleep little baby sleep thy father shall be a rabbi thy mother shall bring thee almonds blessings on thy little head as the howling diminished she realized with a shock that she was rocking this misbegotten infantnay singing to it a jewish cradlesong full of inappropriate phrases she withdrew her foot as though the rocker had grown suddenly redhot the yells broke out with fresh vehemence and she angrily restored her foot to its old place nu nu she cried rocking violently go to sleep she stole a glance at it when it grew stiller and saw that the teat of its feedingbottle was out of its mouth there theresuck she said readjusting it the baby opened its eyes and shot a smile at her a wonderful trustful smile from great blue eyes natalya trembled those were the blue eyes that had supplanted the memory of fannys dark orbs and the lips now sucking contentedly were the cherry lips of the painted poppet nebbich the poor deserted little orphan she apologized to herself and this is how the new jewish wife does her duty to her stepchildren she might as well have been a christian then a remembrance that the christian woman had seemingly been an unimpeachable stepmother confused her thoughts further and while she was groping among them becky returned haling in joseph who in his turn haled in a kite with a long tail the boy now a sturdy lad of seven did not palpitate towards his grandmother with beckys eagerness probably he felt the domestic position less but he surrendered himself to her long hug did she beat him she murmured soothingly beat my own little joseph dont waste time granny becky broke in petulantly if we are going no my dear well go at once and releasing the boy natalya partly undid the lower buttons of his waistcoat you wear no fourcorner fringes she exclaimed tragically she neglects even to see to that ah it will be a good deed to carry you from this godless home but i dont want to go with you he said sullenly reminded of past inquisitorial worryings about prayers you little fool said becky you are goingand in that cab in that cab he cried joyfully yes my apple and you will never be beaten again oh she dont hurt he said contemptuously she hasnt even got a canelike at school but shant we take our things said becky no only the things you stand in they shant have any excuse for taking you back ill find you plenty of clothes as good as new and little daisy oh is it a girl your stepmother will look after that she cant complain of one burden she hustled the children into the cab where with the sack and herself they made a tightlypacked quartette i say i didnt bargain for extras inside grumbled the cabman you cant reckon these children said natalya with confused legal recollections theyre both under seven the cabman started becky stared out of the window i wonder if well pass mrs elkman she said amused joseph busied himself with disentangling the tails of his kite but natalya was too absorbed to notice their indifference to her that poor little daisy the image of the baby swam vividly before her what a terrible fate to be left in the hands of the publichouse woman who knew what would happen to it what if in her drunken fury at the absence of becky and joseph she did it a mischief at the best the besotted creature would not take cordially to the task of bringing it up it was no child of hershad not even the appeal of pure jewish blood and there it lay smiling with its beautiful blue eyes it had smiled trustfully on herself not knowing she was to leave it to its fate and now it was crying she heard it crying above the rattle of the cab but how could she charge herself with itshe with her daily rounds to make the other children were grown up passed the day at school no it was impossible and the childs cry went on in her imagination louder and louder she put her head out of the window turn back turn back ive forgotten something the cabman swore dye think youve taken me by the week threepence extra drive back the cab turned round the innocent horse got a stinging flip of the whip and set off briskly what have you forgotten grandmother said becky its very careless of you the cab stopped at the door natalya looked round nervously sprang out and then uttered a cry of despair ach we shut the door and the inaccessible baby took on a tenfold desirability its all right said becky just turn the handle natalya obeyed and ran in there was the baby not crying but sleeping peacefully natalya snatched it up frenziedly and hurried the freshsqualling bundle into the cab taking daisy cried becky but she isnt yours natalya shut the cabdoor with a silencing bang and the vehicle turned again ghettowards vi the fact that natalya had taken possession of the children could not be kept a secret but the stepmothers family made no effort to regain them and indeed the woman herself shortly went the way of all henry elkmans wives though whether she like the rest had a successor is unknown the sudden change from a lone old lady to a materfamilias was not however so charming as natalya had imagined the cost of putting daisy out to nurse was a terrible tax but this was nothing compared to the tax on her temper levied by her legitimate grandchildren who began to grumble on the first night at the poverty and pokiness of the garret and were thenceforward never without a lament for the good old times they had indeed been thoroughly spoilt by the father and the irregular menage the christian wifes influence had been refining but too temporary it had been only long enough to wean joseph from the religious burdens indoctrinated by fanny and thus to add to the grandmothers difficulties in coaxing him back to the yoke of piety the only sweet in natalyas cup turned out to be the love of little daisy who grew ever more beautiful gracious and winning natalya had never known so lovable a child all daisy did seemed to her perfect for instant obedience and instant comprehension she declared her matchless one day when daisy was three the child told the grandmother that in her momentary absence becky had pulled josephs hair hush you mustnt tell tales natalya said reprovingly becky did not pull joeys hair daisy corrected herself instantly much to the disgust of becky who wished to outgrow the ghetto even while she unconsciously manifested its worst heritages daisy picked up the yiddish words and phrases which in spite of beckys remonstrances natalya was too old to give up this was not the only subject of dispute between becky and the grandmother whom she roundly accused of favouritism of daisy and she had not reached fifteen when with an independence otherwise praiseworthy she set up for herself on her earnings in the fur establishment of her second stepmothers father lodging with a family who she said bored her less than her grandmother in another year or so freed from the compulsory education of the school board joseph joined her and thus by the unforeseen turns of fortunes wheel the oldclo woman of seventyfive was left alone with the child of seven but this child was compensation for all she had undergone for all the years of trudging and grubbing and patching and turning daisy threaded her needle for her at night when her keen eyes began to fail and while she made the old clo into new daisy read aloud her english storybooks natalya took an absorbing interest in these nursery tales heard for the first time in her second childhood jack the giantkiller aladdin cinderella they were all delightful novelties the favourite story of both was little red ridinghood with its refrain of grandmother what large eyes youve got that could be said with pointed fun it seemed to be written especially for them often daisy would look up suddenly and say grandmother what a large mouth youve got all the better to bite you with grandmother would reply and then there would be hugs and kisses but friday night was the great night the one night of the week on which natalya could be stopped from working only religion was strong enough to achieve that the two sabbath candles in the copper candlesticks stood on the white tablecloth and were lighted as soon as the welcome dusk announced the advent of the holy day and they shed their pious illumination on her dish of fish and the rituallytwisted loaves and after supper natalya would sing the hebrew grace at much leisurely length and with great unction then she would tell stories of her youth in polandcomic tales mixed with tales of oppression and the memories of ancient wrong and daisy would weep and laugh and thrill the fusion of races had indeed made her sensitive and intelligent beyond the common and natalya was not unjustified in planning out for her some illustrious future but after eighteen months of this delightful life natalyas wonderful vitality began slowly to collapse she earned less and less and amid her gratitude to god for having relieved her of the burden of becky and joseph a secret fear entered her heart would she be taken away before daisy became selfsupporting nay would she even be able to endure the burden till the end what made things worse was that owing to the increase of immigrants her landlord now exacted an extra shilling a week for rent when daisy was asleep the old woman hung over the bed praying for life for strength it was a sultry summer making the trudge from door to door under the everswelling sack almost intolerable and a little thing occurred to bring home cruelly to natalya the decline of all her resources physical and financial the childrens country holiday was in the air at daisys board school throwing an aroma and a magic light over the droning classroom daisy was to go was to have a fortnight with a cottager in kent but towards the expenses the childs parent or guardian was expected to contribute four shillings daisy might have gone free had she pleaded absolute poverty but that would have meant investigation from such humiliation natalya shrank she shrank even more from frightening the poor child by uncovering the skeleton of poverty most of all she shrank from depriving daisy of all the rural delights on which the childs mind dwelt in fascinated anticipation natalya did not think much of the country herself having been born in a poor polish village amid huts and pigs but she would not disillusion daisy by miles of extra trudging in the heat and miracles of bargaining with bewildered housewives natalya raised the four shillings and the unconscious daisy glided off in the happy noisy train while on the platform natalya waved her coloured handkerchief wet with tears that first night without the little sunshiny presence was terrible for the oldclo woman the last prop against decay and collapse seemed removed but the next day a joyous postcard came from daisy which the greengrocer downstairs read to natalya and she was able to take up her sack again and go forth into the sweltering streets in the second week the child wrote a letter saying that she had found a particular friend in an old lady very kind and rich who took her for drives in a chaise and asked her many questions this old lady seemed to have taken a fancy to her from the moment she saw her playing outside the cottage perhaps god has sent her to look after the child when i am gone thought natalya for the task of going down and up the stairs to get this letter read made her feel as if she would never go up and down them again beaten at last she took to her bed her nextroom neighbour the cobblers wife tended her and sent for the penny doctor but she would not have word written to daisy or her holiday cut short on the day daisy was to come back she insisted despite all advice and warning in being up and dressed she sent everybody away and lay on her bed till she heard daisys footsteps then she started to her feet and drew herself up in pretentious good health but the sound of other footsteps and the entry of a spectacled silverhaired old gentlewoman with the child spoilt her intended hug daisys new friend had passed from her memory and she stared pathetically at the strange lady and the sunburnt child oh grandmother what great eyes youve got and daisy ran laughingly towards her the usual repartee was wanting and the room is not tidied up natalya said reproachfully and began dusting a chair for the visitor but the old lady waved it aside i have come to thank you for all you have done for my grandchild your grandchild natalya fell back on the bed yes i have had inquiries madeit is quite certain daisy was even called after me i am glad of that at least her voice faltered natalya sat as bolt upright as years of bending under sacks would allow and you have come to take her from me she shrieked already daisys new ruddiness seemed to her the sign of life that belonged elsewhere no no do not be alarmed i have suffered enough from my selfishness it was my bad temper drove my daughter from me she bowed her silver head till her form seemed as bent as natalyas what can i do to repairto atone will you not come and live with me in the country and let me care for you i am not rich but i can offer you every comfort natalya shook her head i am a jewess i could not eat with you thats just what i told her grandmother added daisy eagerly then the child must remain with you at my expense said the old lady but if she likes the country so murmured natalya i like you better grandmother and daisy laid her ruddied cheek to the withered cheek which grew wet with ecstasy she calls you grandmother not me said the old gentlewoman with a sob yes and i wished her mother dead god forgive me natalya burst into a passion of tears and rocked to and fro holding daisy tightly to her faintly pulsing heart what did you say daisys grandmother flamed and blazed with her ancient anger you wished my madge dead natalya nodded her head her arms unloosed their hold of daisy dead dead dead she repeated in a strange crooning voice gradually a vacant look crept over her face and she fell back again on the bed she looked suddenly very old despite her glossy black wig she is ill daisy shrieked the cobblers wife ran in and helped to put her back between the sheets and described volubly her obstinacy in leaving her bed natalya lived till near noon of the next day and daisys real grandmother was with her still at the end side by side with the jewish deathwatcher about eleven in the morning natalya said light the candles daisy the sabbath is coming in daisy spread a white tablecloth on the old wooden table placed the copper candlesticks upon it drew it to the bedside and lighted the candles they burned with curious unreality in the full august sunshine a holy peace overspread the oldclo womans face her driedup lips mumbled the hebrew prayer welcoming the sabbath eve gradually they grew rigid in death daisy said her grandmother say the text i taught you come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden sobbed the child obediently and i will give you rest the luftmensch the luftmensch i leopold barstein the sculptor was sitting in his lonesome studio brooding blackly over his dead illusions when the postman brought him a letter in a large straggling unknown hand it began angel of god he laughed bitterly just when i am at my most diabolical he did not at first read the letter divining in it one of the many beggingletters which were the aftermath of his eastend zionist period but he turned over the page to see the name of the orientally effusive scribe it was nehemiah silvermann dentist and restaurateur his laughter changed to a more genial note his sense of humour was still saving the figure of the restaurateurdentist sprang to his imagination in marble on a pedestal in one hand the figure held a cornucopia in the other a pair of pincers he read the letter a the minories e angel of god i have the honour now to ask your very kind humane merciful cordial nobility to assist me by your clement philanthropical liberal relief in my very hard troublesome sorrows and worries on which i suffer violently i lost all my fortune and i am ruined by russia i am here at present without means and dental practice and my restaurant is impeded with lack of a few frivolous pounds i do not know really what to do in my actual very disgraceful mischief i heard the people saying your propitious magnanimous beneficent charities are everywhere exceedingly well renowned and considerably gracious thus i solicit and supplicate your good very kind genteel clement humanity by my very humble quite instant request to support me by your merciful aid and please to respond me as soon as possible according to your generous very philanthropy in my urgent extreme immense difficulty your obedient servant respectfully nehemiah silvermann dentist and restaurateur such a flood of language carried away the last remnants of barsteins melancholia he saw his imagined statue showering adjectives from its cornucopia it is the cry of a dictionary in distress he murmured rereading the letter with unction it pleased his humour to reply in the baldest language he asked for details of silvermanns circumstances and sorrows had he applied to the russojewish fund which existed to help such refugees from persecution did he know jacobs the dentist of the neighbouring mansel place jacobs had been one of barsteins fellowcouncillors in zionism a pragmatic inexhaustible debater in the small back room and the voluble little man now loomed suddenly large as a possible authority upon his brotherdentist by return of post a second eruption descended upon the studio from the dictionary in distress a the minories e most honourable and angelical mr leopold barstein i have the honour now to thank you for your kind answer of my letter i did not succeed here by my vital experience in the last of ten years i got my livelihood a certain time by my dental practice so long there was not a hard violent competition then i had never any efficacious relief protection then i have no relation then we and the time are changeable too then without money is impossible to perform any matter if i had at present in my grieved desperate position l for my restaurant then i were rescued i do not earn anything and i must despond at last i perish here in russia i was ruined please to aid me in your merciful humanity by something if i had l i could start off from here to go somewhere to look for my daily bread and if i had l so i shall go to jerusalem because i am convinced by my bitter and sour troubles and shocking tribulations here is nothing to do any more for me i have not been in the russojewish fund and do not know it where it is and if it is in the jewish shelter of leman street so i have no protection no introduction no recommendation for it poverty has very seldom a few clement humane good people and little friends the people say jacobs the dentist of mansel place is not a good man and so it is i tried it for he makes the impossible competition i ask your good genteel cordial nobility according to the universal good reputation of your gracious goodness to reply me quick by some help now your obedient servant respectfully nehemiah silvermann dentist and restaurateur this letter threw a new but not reassuring light upon the situation instead of being a victim of the russian troubles a recent refugee from massacre and robbery nehemiah had already existed in london for ten years and although he might originally have been ruined by russia he had survived his ruin by a decade his ideas of his future seemed as hazy as his past four pounds would be a very present help he could continue his london career with fifteen pounds he was ready to start off anywhither with thirty pounds he would end all his troubles in jerusalem such nebulousness appeared to necessitate a personal visit and the next day finding himself in bad form barstein angrily bashed in a clay visage clapped on his hat and repaired to the minories but he looked in vain for either a dentist or a restaurant at no a it appeared a humble corner residence trying to edge itself into the important street at last after wandering uncertainly up and down he knocked at the shabby door a frowsy woman with long earrings opened it staring and said that the silvermanns occupied two rooms on her second floor what cried barstein is he married i should hope so replied the landlady severely he has eleven children at least barstein mounted the narrow carpetless stairs and was received by mrs silvermann and her brood with much consternation and ceremony the family filled the whole front room and overflowed into the back which appeared to be a sort of kitchen for mrs silvermann had rushed thence with tuckedup sleeves and sounds of frying still proceeded from it but mr silvermann was not at home the small faded bewigged creature told him apologetically barstein looked curiously round the room half expecting indications of dentistry or dining but he saw only a minimum of brokendown furniture bottomless cane chairs a wooden table and a cracked mirror a hanging shelf heaped with ragged books and a standing cupboard which obviously turned into a bedstead at night for half the family but of a dentists chair there was not even the ruins his eyes wandered over the brokenbacked bookssome were indeed dictionaries in distress he noted a russogerman and a germanenglish then the sounds of frying penetrated more keenly to his brain you are the cook of the restaurant he inquired restaurant echoed the woman resentfully have i not enough cooking to do for my own family and where shall i find money to keep a restaurant your husband said murmured barstein as in guilty confusion a squalling from the overflow offspring in the kitchen drew off the mother for a moment leaving him surrounded by an openeyed juvenile mob from the rear he heard smacks loud whispers and whimperings then the poor woman reappeared bearing what seemed a scrubbingboard she placed it over one of the caneless chairs and begged his excellency to be seated it was a half holiday at the school she complained otherwise her family would be less numerous where does your husband do his dentistry barstein inquired seating himself cautiously upon the board do i know said his wife he goes out he comes in at this moment to barsteins great satisfaction he did come in holy angel he cried rushing at the hem of barsteins coat and kissing it reverently he was a gaunt melancholy figure elongated to over six feet and still further exaggerated by a rusty tophat of the tallest possible chimneypot and a threadbare frockcoat of the longest possible tails at his advent his wife vastly relieved shepherded her flock into the kitchen and closed the door leaving barstein alone with the long man who seemed as he stood gazing at his visitor positively soaring heavenwards with rapture but barstein inquired brutally where do you do your dentistry never mind me replied nehemiah ecstatically let me look on you and a more passionate worship came into his tranced gaze but barstein feeling duped replied sternly where do you do your dentistry the question seemed to take some moments penetrating through nehemiahs rapt brain but at last he replied pathetically and where shall i find achers in russia i had my living of it here i have no friends the homeliness of his vocabulary amused barstein evidently the dictionary was his fount of inspiration without it niagara was reduced to a trickle he seemed indeed quite shy of speech preferring to gaze with large liquid eyes but you have managed to live here for ten years barstein pointed out you see how merciful god is nehemiah rejoined eagerly never once has he deserted me and my children but what have you done inquired barstein the first shade of reproach came into nehemiahs eyes ask sooner what the almighty has done he said barstein felt rebuked one does not like to lose ones character as a holy angel but your restaurant he said where is that that is here here echoed barstein staring round again where else here is a wide opening for a kosher restaurant there are hundreds and hundreds of greeners lodging all aroundpoor young men with only a bed or a corner of a room to sleep on they know not where to go to eat and my wife god be thanked is a knowing cook oh then your restaurant is only an idea naturallya counsel that i have given myself but have you enough plates and dishes and tablecloths can you afford to buy the food and to risk its not being eaten nehemiah raised his hands to heaven not being eaten with a family like mine barstein laughed in spite of himself and he was softened by noting how sensitive and artistic were nehemiahs outspread handsthey might well have wielded the forceps yes i dare say that is what will happen he said how can you keep a restaurant up two pairs of stairs where no passerby will ever see it as he spoke however he remembered staying in an hotel in sicily which consisted entirely of one upper room perhaps in the ghetto sicilian fashions were paralleled i do not fly so high as a restaurant in once nehemiah explained but here is this great empty room what am i to do with it at night of course most of us sleep on it but by daylight it is a waste also i receive several hebrew and yiddish papers a week from my friends in russia and america and one of which i even buy here when i have read them these likewise are a waste therefore have i given myself a counsel if i would make here a readingroom they should come in the evenings many young men who have only a bed or a roomcorner to go to and when once they have learnt to come here it will then be easy to make them to eat and drink first i will give to them only coffee and cigarettes but afterwards shall my wife cook them all the delicatessen of poland when our custom will become too large we shall take over bergmans great fashionable restaurant in the whitechapel road he has already given me the option thereof it is only two hundred pounds and if your gentility but i cannot afford two hundred pounds interrupted barstein alarmed no no it is the almighty who will afford that said nehemiah reassuringly from you i ask nothing in that case replied barstein drily i must say i consider it an excellent plan your idea of building up from small foundations is most sensiblesome of the young men may even have toothachebut i do not see where you need meunless to supply a few papers did i not say you were from heaven nehemiahs eyes shone again but i do not require the papers it is enough for me that your holy feet have stood in my homestead i thought you might send money but to come with your own feet now i shall be able to tell i have spoken with him face to face barstein was touched i think you will need a larger table for the readingroom he said the tall figure shook its tall hat it is only gas that i need for my operations gas repeated barstein astonished then you propose to continue your dentistry too it is for the restaurant i need the gas elucidated nehemiah unless there shall be a cheerful shining here the young men will not come but the penny gas is all i need well if it costs only a penny began barstein a penny in the slot corrected nehemiah but then there is the meter and the cost of the burners he calculated that four pounds would convert the room into a salon of light that would attract all the homeless moths of the neighbourhood so this was the fourpound solution barstein reflected with his first sense of solid foothold after all nehemiah had sustained his surprise visit fairly wellhe was obviously no croesusand if four pounds would not only save this swarming family but radiate cheer to the whole neighbourhood he sprung open the sovereignpurse that hung on his watchchain it contained only three pounds ten he rummaged his pockets for silver finding only eight shillings im afraid i havent quite got it he murmured as if i couldnt trust you cried nehemiah reproachfully and as he lifted his long coattails to trouserpocket the money barstein saw that he had no waistcoat ii about six months later when barstein had utterly forgotten the episode he received another letter whose phraseology instantly recalled everything to the most honourable competent authentical illustrious authority and universal celebrious dignity of the very famous sculptor a the minories e dear sir i have the honour and pleasure now to render the real and sincere gratitude of my very much obliged thanks for your grand gracious clement sympathical propitious merciful liberal compassionable cordial nobility of your real humane generous benevolent genuine very kind magnanimous philanthropy which afforded to me a great redemption of my very lamentable desperate necessitous need wherein i am at present very poor indeed in my total ruination by the cruel cynical russia therein is every day a daily tyrannous massacre and assassinate here is nothing to do any more for me previously i shall rather go to bursia than to russia i received from your dear kind amiable amicable goodness recently l the same was for me a momental recreateing aid in my actual very indigent paltry miserable calamitous situation wherein i gain now nothing and i only perish here even i cannot earn here my daily bread by my perfect scientifick knowledge of diverse languages i know the philological neology and archaiology the best way is for me to go to another country to wit to bursia or turkey thus i solicit and supplicate your charitable generosity by my very humble and instant request to make me go away from here as soon as possible according to your humane kind merciful clemency your obedient servant respectfully nehemiah silvermann dentist and professor of languages so an academy of languages had evolved from the gas not a restaurant anyhow the dictionary was in distress again emigration appeared now the only salvation but where in the world was bursia possibly persia was meant but why persia wherein lay the attraction of that exotic land and whatever would mrs silvermann and her overflowing progeny do in persia nehemiahs original suggestion of jerusalem had been much more intelligible perhaps it persisted still under the head of turkey not least characteristic barstein found nehemiahs tenacious gloating over his ancient ruin at the hands of russia for some days the sculptor went about weighed down by nehemiahs misfortunes and the necessity of finding time to journey to the minories but he had an absorbing piece of work and before he could tear himself away from it a still more urgent shower of words fell upon him a the minories e i have the honour now the new letter ran to inquire about my decided and expecting departure i must sue by my quite humble and very instant entreaty your noble genteel cordial humanity in my very hard troublous and bitter and sour vexations and tribulations to effect for my poor position at least a private anonymous prompt collection as soon as possible according to your clement magnanimous charitable mercy of l if not l among your very estimable and respectfully good friends in good order to go in another country even bursia to get my livelihood by my dental practice or by my other scientifick and philological knowledge the great competition is here in anything very vigorous i have here no dental employment no dental practice no relations no relief no gain no earning no introduction no protection no recommendation no money no good friends no good connecting acquaintance in russia i am ruined and i perish here i am already desperate and despond entirely i do not know what to do and what shall i do do now in my actual urgent extreme immense need i am told by good many people that the board of guardians is very seldom to rescue by aid the people but very often is to find only faults and vices and to make them guilty i have nothing to do there and in the russian jewish fund i found once sir asher aaronsberg and he is not to me sympathical i supply and solicit considerably your kind humane clement mercy to answer me as soon as possible quick according to your very gracious mercy your obedient servant respectfully nehemiah silvermann dentist and professor of languages as soon as the light failed in his studio barstein summoned a hansom and sped to the minories iii nehemiahs voice bade him walk in and turning the doorhandle he saw the tophatted figure sprawled in solitary gloom along a caneless chair reading a newspaper by the twinkle of a rushlight nehemiah sprang up with a bark of joy making his gigantic shadow bow to the visitor from chimneypot to coattail he stretched unchanged and the same celestial rapture illumined his gaunt visage but barstein drew back his own coattail from the attempted kiss where is the gas he asked drily alas the company removed the meter but the gasbrackets what else had we to eat said nehemiah simply barstein in sudden suspicion raised his eyes to the ceiling but a fragment of gaspipe certainly came through it he could not however recall whether the pipe had been there before or not so the young men would not come he said oh yes they came and they read and they ate only they did not pay you should have made it a rulecash down again a fine shade of rebuke and astonishment crossed his lean and melancholy visage and could i oppress a brotherinisrael where had those young men to turn but to me again barstein felt his angelic reputation imperilled he hastened to change the conversation and why do you want to go to bursia he said why shall i want to go to bursia nehemiah replied you said so barstein showed him the letter ah i said i shall sooner go to bursia than to russia always sir asher aaronsberg speaks of sending us back to russia he would said barstein grimly but where is bursia nehemiah shrugged his shoulders shall i know my little rebeccah was drawing a map thereof she won a prize of five pounds with which we lived two months a genial child is my rebeccah ah then the almighty did send you something and do i not trust him said nehemiah fervently otherwise burdened down as i am with a multitude of children you made your own burden barstein could not help pointing out again that look of pain as if nehemiah had caught sight of feet of clay beneath barsteins shining boots be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth nehemiah quoted in hebrew is not that the very first commandment in the bible well then you want to go to turkey said the sculptor evasively i suppose you mean palestine no turkey it is to turkey we zionists should ought to go there to work for palestine are not many of the sultans own officials jews if we can make of them hothearted zionists it was an arresting conception and barstein found himself sitting on the table to discuss it the reverence with which nehemiah listened to his views was touching and disconcerting barstein felt humbled by the celestial figure he cut in nehemiahs mental mirror yet he could not suspect the man of a glozing tongue for of the leaders of zionism nehemiah spoke with if possible greater veneration with an awe trembling on tears his elongated figure grew even gaunter his lean visage unearthlier as he unfolded his plan for the conquest of palestine and barsteins original impression of his simple sincerity was repeated and reenforced presently however it occurred to barstein that nehemiah himself would have scant opportunity of influential contact with ottoman officials and that the real question at issue was how nehemiah his wife and his at least eleven children were to be supported in turkey he mentioned the point nehemiah waved it away and cannot the almighty support us in turkey as well as in england he asked yes even in bursia itself the guardian of israel is not sleepy it was then that the word luftmensch flew into barsteins mind nehemiah was not an earthman in gross contact with solidities he was an airman floating on facile wings through the aether true he spoke of troublesome tribulations but these were mainly dictionary distresses felt most keenly in the rhapsody of literary composition at worst they were mere clouds on the blue they had nothing in common with the fogs which frequently veiled heaven from his own vision never for a moment had nehemiah failed to remember the blue never had he lost his radiant outlook his very pessimism was merely optimism in disguise since it was only a personal pessimism to be remedied by a few frivolous pounds by a new crumb from the hand of providence not that impersonal despair of the scheme of things which gave the thinker such black moments how had nehemiah lived during those first ten years in england who should say but he had had the wild daring to uproot himself from his childhoods home and adventure himself upon an unknown shore and there by hook or crook for better or for worse through vicissitudes innumerable and crises beyond calculation ever on the perilous verge of nothingness he had scraped through the days and the weeks and the years fearlessly contributing perhaps more important items to posterity than the dead stones which were all he the sculptor bade fair to leave behind him welcoming each new child with feasting and psalmody never for a moment had nehemiah lost his robustious faith in life his belief in god man or himself yes even deeper than his own selfrespect was his respect for others an impenetrable idealist he lived surrounded by a radiant humanity by men become as gods with no conscious hyperbole did he address one as angel intellect and goodness were his polestars and what airy courage in his mundane affairs what invincible resilience he had once been a dentist and he still considered himself one before he owned a tablecloth he deemed himself the proprietor of a restaurant he enjoyed alike the pleasures of anticipation and of memory and having nothing glided ever buoyantly between two gilded horizons the superficial might call him shiftless but more profoundly envisaged was he not rather an education in the art of living did he not incarnate the great jewish gospel of the improvident lilies you shall not go to bursia said barstein in a burst of artistic fervour thirteen people cannot possibly get there for fifteen pounds or even twentyfive pounds and for such a sum you could start a small business here nehemiah stared at him gods messenger was all he could gasp then the tall melancholy man raised his eyes to heaven and uttered a hebrew voluntary in which references to the ram whose horns were caught in the thicket to save isaacs life were distinctly audible barstein waited patiently till the pious lips were at rest but what business do you think you he began shall i presume dictation to the angel asked nehemiah with wet shining eyes i am thinking that perhaps we might find something in which your children could help you how old is the eldest i will ask my wife salome he cried the dismal creature trotted in how old is moshele he asked and dont you remember he was twelve last tabernacles nehemiah threw up his long arms merciful heaven he must soon begin to learn his parshah confirmation portion what will it be where is my chumash pentateuch mrs silvermann drew it down from the row of ragged books and nehemiah fluttering the pages and bending over the rushlight became lost to the problem of his future barstein addressed himself to the wife what business do you think your husband could set up here is he not a dentist she inquired in reply barstein turned to the busy peering flutterer would you like to be a dentist again ah but how shall i find achers you put up a sign said barstein one of those cases of teeth i daresay the landlady will permit you to put it up by the front door especially if you take an extra room i will buy you the instruments furnish the room attractively you will put in your newspaperswhy people will be glad to come as to a readingroom he added smiling nehemiah addressed his wife did i not say he was a genteel archangel he cried ecstatically iv barstein was sitting outside a cafe in rome sipping vermouth with rozenoffski the russojewish pianist and schneemann the galicianjewish painter when he next heard from nehemiah he was anxiously expecting an important letter which he had instructed his studioassistant to bring to him instantly so when the man appeared he seized with avidity upon the envelope in his hand but the scrawling superscription at once dispelled his hope and recalled the forgotten luftmensch he threw the letter impatiently on the table oh you may read it his friends protested misunderstanding i can guess what it is he said grumpily here in this classical atmosphere in this southern sunshine he felt out of sympathy with the gaunt godly nehemiah who had doubtless lapsed again into his truly troublesome tribulations not a penny more for the neerdowell let his providence look after him is she beautiful quizzed schneemann barstein roared with laughter his irate mood was broken up nehemiah as a petticoated romance was too tickling you shall read the letter he said schneemann protested comically no no that would be ungentlemanlyyou read to us what the angel says it is i that am the angel barstein laughed as he tore open the letter he read it aloud breaking down in almost hysterical laughter at each eruption of adjectives from the dictionary in distress rozenoffski and schneemann rolled in similar spasms of mirth and the italians at the neighbouring tables though entirely ignorant of the motive of the merriment caught the contagion and rocked and shrieked with the mad foreigners a the minories e right honourable angelical mr leopold barstein i have now the honour to again solicit your genteel genuine sympathical humane philanthropic kind cordial nobility to oblige me at present by your merciful loan of gracious second and propitious favourable aidance in my actually poor indigent position in which i have no earn by my dental practice likewise no help also no protection no recommendation no employment and then the competition is here very violent i was ruined by russia and i have nothing for the celebration of our jewish new year consequentially upon your merciful archangelical donative i was able to make my livelihood by my dental practice even very difficult but still i had my vital subsistence by it till up now but not further for the little while in consequence of it my circumstances are now in the urgent extreme immense need thus i implore your competent well famous goodhearted liberal magnanimous benevolent generosity to respond me in your beneficent relief as soon as possible according to your kind grand clemence of your good ingenuous genteel humanity i wish you a happy new year your obedient servant respectfully nehemiah silvermann dentist and professor of languages but when the reading was finished schneemanns comment was unexpected rosh hashanah so near he said a rush of ghetto memories swamped the three artists as they tried to work out the date of the jewish new year that solemn period of earthly trumpets and celestial judgments why it must be today cried rozenoffski suddenly the trio looked at one another with rueful humour why the ghetto could not even realize such indifference to the heavenly tribunals so busily decreeing their lifeordeath sentences barstein raised his glass heres a happy new year anyhow he said the three men clinked glasses rozenoffski drew out a hundredlire note send that to the poor devil he said oho laughed schneemann you still believe charity delivers from death well i must be saved too and he threw down another hundredlire note to the acutely analytical barstein it seemed as if an old superstitious thrill lay behind schneemanns laughter as behind rozenoffskis donation you will only make the luftmensch believe still more obstinately in his providence he said as he gathered up the new year gifts again will he declare that he has been accorded a good writing and a good sealing by the heavenly tribunal well hasnt he laughed schneemann perhaps he has said rozenoffski musingly qui sa the tug of love the tug of love when elias goldenberg belcovitchs head cutter betrothed himself to fanny fersht the prettiest of the machinists the ghetto blessed the match always excepting sugarman the shadchan whom love matches shocked and goldenbergs relatives who considered fanny flighty and fond of finery that fanny of yours was cut out for a rich mans wife insisted goldenbergs aunt shaking her pious wig he who marries fanny is rich retorted elias pawn your hide but get a bride quoted the old lady savagely as for the slighted marriagebroker he remonstrated almost like a relative but i didnt want a negotiated marriage elias protested a love marriage i could also have arranged for you replied sugarman indignantly but elias was quite content with his own arrangement for fannys glance was melting and her touch transporting to deck that soft warm hand with an engagementring a months wages had not seemed disproportionate and fanny flashed the diamond bewitchingly it lit up the gloomy workshop with its signal of felicity even belcovitch bent over his pressiron sometimes omitted to rebuke fannys badinage the course of true love seemed to run straight to the canopyfanny had already worked the bridegrooms praying shawlwhen suddenly a storm broke at first the cloud was no bigger than a mans handin fact it was a mans hand elias espied it groping for fannys in the dim space between the two machines as fannys fingers fluttered towards it her other hand still guiding the cloth under the throbbing needle elias felt the needle stabbing his heart up and down through and through the very finger that held his costly ring lay in this alien paw gratis the shameless minx ah his relatives were right he snapped the scissors savagely like a dragons jaw fanny what dost thou he gasped in yiddish fannys face flamed her guilty fingers flew back i thought thou wast on the other side she breathed elias snorted incredulously as soon as sugarman heard of the breaking of the engagement he flew to elias his blue bandanna streaming from his coattail if you had come to me he crowed i should have found you a more reliable article however heaven has given you a second helping a wellbuilt wageearner like you can look as high as a greengrocers daughter even i never wish to look upon a woman again elias groaned schtuss said the great marriagebroker three days after the fast of atonement comes the feast of tabernacles the almighty blessed be he who created both light and darkness has made obedient females as well as pleasureseeking jades and he blew his nose emphatically into his bandanna yes but she wont return me my ring elias lamented what sugarman gasped then she considers herself still engaged to you not at all she laughs in my face and she has given you back your promise my promiseyes the ringno but on what ground she says i gave it to her sugarman clucked his tongue tututu better if we had followed our old custom and the man had worn the engagementring not the woman in the workshop elias went on miserably she flashes it in my eyes everybody makes mock oh the jezebel i should summons her it would only cost me more is it not true i gave her the ring sugarman mopped his brow his vast experience was at fault no maiden had ever refused to return his clients ring rather had she flung it in the wooers false teeth this comes of your love matches he cried sternly next time there must be a proper contract next time repeated elias why how am i to afford a new ring fanny was ruinous in cups of chocolate and the pit of the pavilion theatre i should want my fee down said sugarman sharply elias shrugged his shoulders if you bring me the ring i do not get old rings but new maidens sugarman reminded him haughtily however as you are a customer and crying five per cent on the greengrocers daughter he hurried away ere elias had time to dissent from the bargain donning his sealskin vest to overawe the fershts sugarman ploughed his way up the dark staircase to their room his attire was wasted on the family for fanny herself opened the door peace to you he cried i have come on behalf of elias goldenberg it is useless i will not have him and she was shutting the door her misconception wilful or not scattered all sugarmans prepared diplomacies he does not want you he wants the ring he cried hastily fanny indecorously put a finger to her nose the diamond glittered mockingly on it then she turned away giggling but look at this photograph panted sugarman desperately through the closing door surprise and curiosity brought her eyes back she stared at the sheepish features of a frockcoated stranger four pounds a week all the year round head cutter at s cohns said sugarman pursuing this advantage a good old english family benjamin beckenstein is his name and he is dying to step into eliass shoes his feet are too large and she flicked the photograph floorwards with her bediamonded finger but why waste the engagementring pleaded sugarman stooping to pick up the suitor what an idea a new man a new ring and fanny slammed the door impudenceface would you become a jewellery shop the baffled shadchan shrieked through the woodwork he returned to elias brooding darkly well queried elias o your love matches and sugarman shook them away with shuddersome palms then she wont no she wont ah how blessed you are to escape from that daughter of satan the greengrocers daughter now speak me no more matches i risk no more rings i will get you one on the hire system a maiden guard your tongue a ring of course elias shook an obdurate head no i must have the old ring back that is impossibleunless you marry her to get it back stay why should i not arrange that for you leave me in peace heaven has opened my eyes then see how economical she is urged sugarman a maiden who sticks to a ring like that is not likely to be wasteful of your substance you have not seen her swallow stuffed monkeys said elias grimly make an end i have done with her no you have not you can still give yourself a counsel and sugarman looked a conscious sphinx you may yet get back the ring how of course i have the next disposal of it said sugarman yes yes go on tomorrow in the workshop pretend to steal loving glances all day long when shes not looking when she catches you but she wont be looking oh yes she will when she catches you you must blush but i cant blush at will elias protested i know it is hard well look foolish that will be easier for you but why shall i look foolish to make her think you are in love with her after all i should look foolish if i were precisely that is the idea when she leaves the workshop in the evening follow her and as she passes the cakeshop sigh and ask her if she will not eat a stuffed monkey for the sake of peacebeuponhim times but she wont why not she is still in love with stuffed monkeys said elias cynically with you too elias blushed quite easily how do you know i offered her another man and she slammed the door in my face youyou offered elias stuttered angrily only to test her said sugarman soothingly he continued now when she has eaten the cake and drunk a cup of chocolate too for one must play high with such a ring at stake you must walk on by her side and when you come to a dark corner take her hand and say my treasure or my angel or whatever nonsense you modern young men babble to your maidenswith the results you seeand while she is drinking it all in like more chocolate her fingers in yours give a sudden tug and off comes the ring elias gazed at him in admiration you are as crafty as jacob our father heaven has not denied everybody brains replied sugarman modestly be careful to seize the left hand the admiring elias followed the scheme to the letter even the blush he had boggled at came to his cheeks punctually whenever his sheepseyes met fannys he was so surprised to find his face burning that he looked foolish into the bargain they dallied long in the cakeshop elias trying to summon up courage for the final feint he would get a good grip on the ring finger the tugofwar should be brief meantime the couple clinked chocolate cups and smiled into each others eyes the goodfornothing thought elias hotly she will make the same eyes at the next man and he went on gorging her every speculative stuffed monkey increasing his nervous tension her white teeth biting recklessly into the cake made him itch to slap her rosy cheek confectionery palled at last and fanny led the way out elias followed chattering with feverish gaiety gradually he drew up even with her they turned down the deserted fishmongers alley lit by one dull gaslamp eliass limbs began to tremble with the excitement of the critical moment he felt like a footpad hither and thither he peerednobody was about butwas he on the right side of her the right is the left he told himself trying to smile but his pulses thumped and in the tumult of heart and brain he was not sure he knew her right hand from her left fortunately he caught the glitter of the diamond in the gloom and instinctively his robber hand closed upon it but as he felt the warm responsive clasp of those soft fingers that ancient delicious thrill pierced every vein fool that he had been to doubt that dear hand and it was wearing his ring stillshe could not part with it o blundering male ingrate my treasure my angel he murmured ecstatically the yiddish hamlet the yiddish hamlet i the little poet sat in the eastside cafe looking six feet high melchitsedek pinchasby dint of a fivepound note from sir asher aaronsberg in acknowledgement of the dedication to him of the poets songs of zionhad carried his genius to the great new jewry across the atlantic he had arrived in new york only that very march and already a crowd of votaries hung upon his lips and paid for all that entered them again had the saying been verified that a prophet is nowhere without honour save in his own country the play that had vainly plucked at the stagedoors of the yiddish theatres of europe had already been accepted by the leading yiddish theatre of new york at least there were several yiddish theatres each claiming this supreme position but the poet felt that the production of his play at goldwaters theatre settled the question among them it is the greatest play of the generation he told the young socialists and freethinkers who sat around him this friday evening imbibing chocolate it will be translated into every tongue he had passed with a characteristic bound from satisfaction with the ghetto triumph into cosmopolitan anticipations see he added my initials make mpmaster playwright also mud pusher murmured from the next table ostrovsky the socialist leader who found himself almost deserted for the new lion who is this uncombed buncosteerer he calls himself the sweet singer in israel contemptuously replied ostrovskys remaining parasite but look here pinchas interposed benjamin tuch another of the displaced demigods a politician with a delusion that he swayed presidential elections by his prestige in brooklyn you said the other day that your initials made messianic poet and dont they inquired the poet his dantesque if dingy face flushing spiritedly you call yourself a leader and you dont know your a b c there was a laugh and benjamin tuch scowled they cant stand for everything he said nothey cant stand for bowery tough admitted pinchas and the table roared again partly at the rapidity with which this linguistic genius had picked up the local slang but as our pious lunatics think there are many meanings in every letter of the torah went on the pleased poet so there are meanings innumerable in every letter of my name if i am playwright as well as poet was not shakespeare both also you wouldnt class yourself with a lowdown barnstormer like shakespeare said tuch sarcastically my superiority to shakespeare i leave to others to discover replied the poet seriously and with unexpected modesty i discovered it for myself in writing this very play but i cannot expect the world to admit it till the play is produced how did you come to find it out yourself asked witberg the young violinist who was never sure whether he was guying the poet or sitting at his feet it happened most naturallyorder me another cup of chocolate witberg you see when iselmann was touring with his yiddish troupe through galicia he had the idea of acquainting the jewish masses with hamlet and he asked me to make the yiddish translation as one great poet translating anotherand some of those almondcakes witberg well i started on the job and then of course the discovery was inevitable the play which i had not read since my youth and then only in a mediocre hebrew version appeared unspeakably childish in places take for example the ghostthese almondcakes are as stale as sermons command me a creamtart witberg what was i saying the ghost murmured a dozen voices ah yesnow how can a ghost affect a modern audience which no longer believes in ghosts that is true the table was visibly stimulated as though the chocolate had turned into champagne the word modern stirred the souls of these refugees from the old ghettos like a trumpet unbelief if only in ghosts was oxygen to the prisoners of a tradition of three thousand years the poet perceived his moment he laid a blacknailed finger impressively on the right side of his nose i translated shakespeareyes but into modern terms the ghost vanishedhamlets tragedy remained only the internal incapacity of the thinker for the lower activity of action the men of action pricked up their ears the higher activity you mean corrected ostrovsky thought said benjamin tuch has no value till it is translated into action exactly youve got to work it up said colonel klopsky who had large ranching and mining interests out west and with his florid personality looked entirely out of place in these old haunts of his schtuss nonsense said the poet disrespectfully acts are only soldiers thought is the general witberg demurred it isnt much use thinking about playing the violin pinchas my friend said the poet the thinker in music is the man who writes your solos his thoughts exist whether you play them or notand independently of your false notes but you performers are all alikei have no doubt the leading man who plays my hamlet will imagine his is the higher activity but woe be to those fellows if they change a syllable your hamlet sneered ostrovsky since when since i recreated him for the modern world without tinsel and pasteboard since i conceived him in fire and bore him in agony sinceeven the cream of this tart is soursince i carried him to and fro in my pocket as a young kangaroo is carried in the pouch of the mother then iselmann did not produce it asked the heathen journalist who haunted the east side for copy and pronounced pinchas pincuss no i changed his name to eselmann the donkeyman for i had hardly read him ten lines before he brayed out where is the ghost the ghost i said i have laid him he cannot walk on the modern stage eselmann tore his hair but it is for the ghost i had him translated our yiddish audiences love a ghost they love your acting too i replied witheringly but i am not here to consider the tastes of the mob oh i gave the donkeyman a piece of my mind but he didnt take the piece jested grunbitz who in poland had been a badchan marriagejester and was now a zionist editor bah these managers are all menoftheearth once in my days of obscurity i was made to put a besom into the piece and it swept all my genius off the boards ah the donkeymen but i am glad eselmann gave me my hamlet back for before giving it to goldwater i made it even more subtle no vulgar nonsense of fencing and poison at the enda pure mental tragedy for in life the soul alone counts nothis cream is just as sour as the othermy play will be the internal tragedy of the thinker the internal tragedy of the thinker is indigestion laughed the exbadchan youd better be more careful with the creamtarts the heathen journalist broke through the laughter strikes me pincuss youre giving us hamlet without the prince of denmark better than the prince of denmark without hamlet retorted the poet cramming creamtart down his throat in great ugly mouthfuls that is how he is usually played in my version the prince of denmark indeed vanishes for hamlet is a hebrew and the prince of palestine you have made him a hebrew cried mieses a pimply young poet if he is to be the ideal thinker let him belong to the nation of thinkers said pinchas in fact the play is virtually an autobiography and do you call it hamlet still asked the heathen journalist producing his notebook for he began to see his way to a sunday scoop why not true it is virtually a new work but shakespeare borrowed his story from an old play called hamlet and treated it to suit himself why therefore should i not treat shakespeare as it suits me the cat eats the rat and the dog bites the cat he laughed his sniggering laugh if i were to call it by another name some learned fool would point out it was stolen from shakespeare whereas at present it challenges comparison but you discovered shakespeare cannot sustain the comparison said benjamin tuch winking at the company only as the mediaeval astrologer is inferior to the astronomer of today the poet explained with placid modesty the muddleheadedness of shakespeares ideaswhich incidentally is the cause of the muddle of hamlets characterhas given way to the clear vision of the modern how could shakespeare really describe the thinker the elizabethans could not think they were like our rabbis the unexpected digression into contemporary satire made the whole cafe laugh gradually other atoms had drifted toward the new magnet from the remotest corners eyes strayed and ears were pricked up pinchas was indeed a figure of mark with somebody elses frockcoat on his meagre person his hair flowing like a dark cascade under a broadbrimmed dusky hat and his sombre face aglow with genius and cocksureness why should you expect thought from a rabbi said grunbitz you dont expect truth from a tradesman besides only youth thinks that is well said approved pinchas he who is ever thinking never grows old i shall die young like all whom the gods love waiter give mr grunbitz a cup of chocolate thank youbut i dont care for any you cannot refuseyou will pain witberg said the poet simply in the great city around them men jumped on and off electric cars whizzed up and down lifts hustled through lobbies hulloed through telephones tore open telegrams dictated to clacking typists filled life with sound and flurry with the bustle of the markets and the chink of the eternal dollar while here serenely smoking and sipping ruffled only by the breezes of argument leisurely as the philosophers in the colonnades of athens the talkers of the ghetto earnest as their forefathers before the great folios of the talmud made an oriental oasis amid the simoom whirl of the occident and the heathen journalist who had discovered it felt as so often before that here alone in this arid mushroom new york was antiquity was restfulness was romanticism here was the latin quarter of the city of the goths encouraged by the masters good humour young mieses timidly exhibited his new verses pinchas read the manuscript aloud to the confusion of the blushing boy but it is full of genius he cried in genuine astonishment i might have written it myself except that it is so unequala mixture of diamonds and paste like all hebrew literature he indicated with flawless taste the good lines not knowing they were one and all unconscious reproductions from the english masterpieces mieses had borrowed from the library in the educational alliance the acolytes listened respectfully and the beardless blotchyfaced mieses began to take importance in their eyes and to betray the importance he held in his own perhaps i too shall write a play one day he said my m too makes master it may be that you are destined to wear my mantle said pinchas graciously mieses looked involuntarily at the illfitting frockcoat pinchas rose and now mieses you must give me a carfare i have to go and talk to the manager about rehearsals one must superintend the actors ones selfthese pumpkinheads are capable of any crime even of altering ones best phrases radsikoff smiled he had sat still in his corner this most prolific of ghetto dramatists his big furrowed forehead supported on his fist a huge odorous cigar in his mouth i suppose goldwater plays hamlet he said we have not discussed it yet said pinchas airily radsikoff smiled again oh hell pull throughso long as mrs goldwater doesnt play ophelia she play ophelia she would not dream of such a thing she is a saucy soubrette she belongs to vaudeville all right i have warned you you dont think there is really a danger pinchas was pale and shaking the yiddish stage is so moral husbands and wives unfortunately live and play together said the old dramatist drily ill drown her truly before i let her play my ophelia said the poet venomously radsikoff shrugged his shoulders and dropped into american well its up to you the minx pinchas shook his fist at the air but ill manage her if the worst comes to the worst ill make love to her the poets sublime confidence in his charms was too much even for his admirers the mental juxtaposition of the seedy poet and the piquant actress in her frills and furbelows set the whole cafe rocking with laughter pinchas took it as a tribute to his ingenious method of drawing the soubretteserpents fangs he grinned placidly and when is your play coming on asked radsikoff after passover replied pinchas beginning to button his frockcoat against the outer cold if only to oust this ophelia he must be at the theatre instanter has goldwater given you a contract i am a poet not a lawyer said pinchas proudly parchments are for philistines honest men build on the word after all it comes to the same thingwith goldwater said radsikoff drily but hes no worse than the others ive never yet found the contract any manager couldnt slip out of ive never yet met the playwright that the manager couldnt dodge radsikoff indeed divided his time between devising plays and devising contracts every experience but suggested fresh clauses he regarded pinchas with commiseration rather than jealousy i shall come to your first night he added it will be a tribute which the audience will appreciate said pinchas i am thinking that if i had one of these aromatic cigars i too might offer a burntoffering unto the lord there was general laughter at the blasphemy for the sabbath with its privation of fire had long since begun try taking instead of thinking laughed the playwright pushing forward his case action is greater than thought no no no pinchas protested as he fumbled for the finest cigar wait till you see my playyou must all comei will send you all boxes then you will learn that thought is greater than actionthat thought is the greatest thing in the world ii sucking voluptuously at radsikoffs cigar pinchas plunged from the steamheated cheerful cafe into the raw unlovely street still hummocked with an ancient uncleared snowfall he did not take the horsecar which runs in this quarter he was reserving the five cents for a spirituous nightcap his journey was slow for a side street that he had to pass through was like nearly all the side streets of the great city an abomination of desolation a tempestuous sea of frozen dirty snow impassable by all save pedestrians and scarcely by them pinchas was glad of his cane an alpenstock would not have been superfluous but the theatre with its brilliantlylighted lobby and flamboyant posters restored his spirits the curtain was already up and a packed mass filled the house from roof to floor rebuffed by the janitors pinchas haughtily asked for goldwater goldwater was on the stage and could not see him but nothing could down the poet whose head seemed to swell till it touched the gallery this great theatre was his this mighty audience his to melt and fire i will await him in a box he said theres no room said the usher pinchas threw up his head i am the author of hamlet the usher winced as at a blow all his life he had heard vaguely of hamletas a great play that was acted on broadway and now here was the author himself all the instinctive snobbery of the ghetto toward the grand world was excited and yet this seedy figure conflicted painfully with his ideas of the uptown type but perhaps all dramatists were alike pinchas was bowed forward in another instant the theatre was in an uproar a man in a comfortable fauteuil had been asked to accommodate the distinguished stranger and had refused i pay my dollarwhat for shall i go but it is the author of hamlet my money is as good as his but he doesnt pay and i shall give my good seat to a schnorrer sh sh from all parts of the house like water livening not killing a flame from every side came expostulations in yiddish and american this was a free republic the author of hamlet was no better than anybody else goldwater on the stage glared at the little poet at last a compromise was found a chair was placed at the back of a packed box american boxes are constructed for publicity not privacy but the other dozen occupants bulked between him and the house he could see but he could not be seen sullen and mortified he listened contemptuously to the play it was indeed a strange farrago this romantic drama with which the vast audience had replaced the sabbath pieties the homekeeping ritual of the ghetto in their swift transformation to american life confined entirely to jewish characters it had borrowed much from the heroes and heroines of the western world remaining psychologically true only in its minor characters which were conceived and rendered with wonderful realism by the gifted actors and this naturalism was shot through with streaks of pure fantasy so that kangaroos suddenly bounded on in a masque for the edification of a russian tyrant but comedy and fantasy alike were subordinated to horror and tragedy these refugees from the brutality of russia and rumania these inheritors of the wailing melodies of a persecuted synagogue craved morbidly for gruesomeness and gore the happy endings of broadway would have spelled bankruptcy here players and audience made a large family partythe unfailing result of a stable stock company with the parts always cast in the same mould and it was almost an impromptu performance pinchas from his proximity to the stage could hear every word from the prompters box which rose in the centre of the footlights the yiddish prompter did not wait till the players dried up it was his role to read the whole play ahead of them then you are the woman who murdered my mother he would gabble and the actor hearing invented immediately the fit attitude and emphasis spinning out with elocutionary slowness and passion the raw material supplied to him no mechanical crossing and recrossing the stage no punctilious tuition by your stagemanagerall was inspiration and fire but to pinchas this hearing of the play twice overonce raw and once cookedwas maddening the lazybones he murmured not thus shall they treat my lines every syllable must be engraved upon their hearts or i forbid the curtain to go up not that it matters with this fooldramatists words they are inkvomit not literature another feature of the dialogue jarred upon his literary instinct incongruously blended with the yiddish were elementary american expressionsthe first the immigrants would pick up all right sure yes sir say hows the boss goodbye not a cent take the elevated yup nup thats one on you rubberneck a continuous fusillade of such phrases stimulated and flattered the audience pleased to find themselves on such easy terms with the new language but to pinchas the idea of peppering his pure yiddish with such locutions was odious the prince of palestine talking with a twanghow could he permit such an outrage upon his hebrew hamlet hardly had the curtain fallen on the act than he darted through the iron door that led from the rear of the box to the stage jostling the cursing carpenters and pushed aside by the perspiring principals on whom the curtain was rising and rerising in a continuous roar at last he found himself in the little bureau and dressingroom in which goldwater was angrily changing his trousers kloot the actormanagers factotum a bignosed insolent youth sat on the table beside the telephone a peaked cap on his head his legs swinging son of a witch you come and disturb all my house what do you want cried goldwater i want to talk to you about rehearsals i told you i would let you know when rehearsals began but you forgot to take my address as if i dont know where to find you kloot grinned pinchas gets drinks from all the cafe he put in they drink to the health of hamlet said pinchas proudly all right kloots gotten your address goodevening but when will it be i must know we cant fix it to a day theres plenty of money in this piece yet moneybah but merit you fellows are as jealous as the devil me jealous of kangaroos in central park you see giraffesand tortoises too central park has more talent than this scribbler of yours i doubt if theres a bigger peacock than here murmured goldwater ill write you about rehearsals said kloot winking at goldwater but i must know weeks aheadi may go lecturing the great continent calls for me in chicago in cincinnati go by all means said goldwater we can do without you do without me a nice mess you will make of it i must teach you how to say every line teach me goldwater could hardly believe his ears pinchas wavered ii mean the company i will show them the accentthe gesture im a great stagemanager as well as a great poet there shall be no more prompter indeed goldwater raised the eyebrow he was pencilling and how are you going to get on without a prompter very simplea months rehearsals goldwater turned an apoplectic hue deeper than his rouge kloot broke in impishly it is very good of you to give us a month of your valuable time but goldwater was too irate for irony a month he gasped at last i could put on six melodramas in a month but hamlet is not a melodrama said pinchas shocked quite so there is not half the scenery its the scenery that takes time rehearsing not the scenes the poet was now as purple as the player you would profane my divine work by gabbling through it with your pack of parrots here just you come off your perch said kloot youve written the piece we do the rest kloot though only nineteen and at a few dollars a week had a fine careless equality not only with the whole world but even with his employer he was now to his amaze confronted by a superior silence impudentface you are not talking to radsikoff i am a poet and i demand my rights kloot was silent from sheer surprise goldwater was similarly impressed what rights he observed more mildly youve had your twenty dollars and that was too much too much twenty dollars for the masterpiece of the twentieth century in the twentyfirst century you shall have twentyone dollars said kloot recovering make mock as you please replied the poet superbly i shall be living in the fiftyfirst century even poets never diethough alas they have to live twenty dollars too much indeed it is not a dollar a century for the run of the play very well said goldwater grimly give them back we return your play this time it was the poet that was disconcerted no no goldwateri must not disappoint my printer i have promised him the twenty dollars to print my hebrew selections from nietzsche you take your manuscript and give me my money said goldwater implacably exchange would be a robbery i will not rob you keep your bargain see here is the printers letter he dragged from a tailpocket a mass of motley manuscripts and yellow letters and laid them beside the telephone as if to search among them goldwater waved a repudiating hand be not a foolman goldwater the poets carneying forefinger was laid on his nose i and you are the only two people in new york who serve the poetic dramai by writing you by producing goldwater still shook his head albeit a whit appeased by the flattery kloot replied for him your manuscript shall be returned to you by the first dustcart pinchas disregarded the youth but i am willing you shall have only a fortnights rehearsals i believe in you goldwater i have always said the only genius on the yiddish stage is goldwater klostermannbah he produces not so badly but act my grandmothers hen has a better stage presence and there is davidoffa voice like a frog and a walk like a spider and these charlatans i only heard of when i came to new york but you goldwateryour fame has blown across the atlantic over the carpathians i journeyed from cracow expressly to collaborate with you then why do you spoil it all asked the mollified manager it is my anxiety that europe shall not be disappointed in you let us talk of the cast it is so early yet the early bird catches the worm but all our worms are caught grinned kloot we keep our talent pinned on the premises i know i know said pinchas paling he saw mrs goldwater tripping on saucily as ophelia but we dont give all our talent to one play the manager reminded him no of course not said pinchas with a breath of hope we have to use all our people by turns we divide our forces with myself as hamlet you will have a cast that should satisfy any author do i not know it cried pinchas were you but to say your lines leaving all the others to be read by the prompter the house would be spellbound like moses when he saw the burning bush that being so said goldwater you couldnt expect to have my wife in the same cast no indeed said pinchas enthusiastically two such tragic geniuses would confuse and distract like the sun and the moon shining together goldwater coughed but ophelia is really a small part he murmured it is pinchas acquiesced your wifes tragic powers could only be displayed in hamlet if like another equally celebrated actress she appeared as the prince of palestine himself heaven forbid my wife should so lower herself said goldwater a decent jewish housewife cannot appear in breeches that is what makes it impossible assented pinchas and there is no other part worthy of mrs goldwater illustration you compare my wife to a kangaroo it may be she would sacrifice herself said the manager musingly and who am i that i should ask her to sacrifice herself replied the poet modestly fanny wont sacrifice ophelia kloot observed drily to his chief you hear said goldwater as quick as lightning my wife will not sacrifice ophelia by leaving her to a minor player she thinks only of the play it is very noble of her but she has worked so hard pleaded the poet desperately she needs a rest my wife never spares herself pinchas lost his head but she might spare ophelia he groaned what do you mean cried goldwater gruffly my wife will honour you by playing ophelia that is ended he waved the makeup brush in his hand no it is not ended said pinchas desperately your wife is a comic actress you just admitted she was tragic it is heartbreaking to see her in tragedy said pinchas burning his boats she skips and jumps rather would i give ophelia to one of your kangaroos you lowdown monkey goldwater almost flung his brush into the poets face you compare my wife to a kangaroo take your filthy manuscript and begone where the pepper grows well fanny would be rather funny as ophelia put in kloot pacifyingly and to make your wife ridiculous as ophelia added pinchas eagerly you would rob the world of your hamlet i can get plenty of hamlets any scribbler can translate shakespeare perhaps but who can surpass shakespeare who can make him intelligible to the modern soul mr goldwater cried the callboy with the patness of a reply the irate manager bustled out not sorry to escape with his dignity and so cheap a masterpiece kloot was left with swinging legs dominating the situation in idle curiosity and with the simplicity of perfectly bad manners he took up the poets papers and letters and perused them as there were scraps of verse amid the mass pinchas let him read on unrebuked you will talk to him kloot he pleaded at last you will save ophelia the bignosed youth looked up from his impertinent inquisition rely on me if i have to play her myself but that will be still worse said pinchas seriously kloot grinned how do you know youve never seen me act the poet laid his finger beseechingly on his nose you will not spoil my play you will get me a maidenly ophelia i and you are the only two men in new york who understand how to cast a play you leave it to me said kloot i have a wife of my own what shrieked pinchas dont be alarmedill coach her shes just the age for the part mrs goldwater might be her mother but can she make the audience cry you bet a regular onion of an ophelia but i must see her rehearse then i can decide of course and you will seek me in the cafe when rehearsals begin that goes without saying the poet looked cunning but dont you say without going how can we rehearse without you you shouldnt have worried the boss well call you even if its the middle of the night the poet jumped at kloots hand and kissed it protector of poets he cried ecstatically and you will see that they do not mutilate my play you will not suffer a single hair of my poesy to be harmed not a hair shall be cut said kloot solemnly pinchas kissed his hand again ah i and you are the only two men in new york who understand how to treat poesy sure kloot snatched his hand away goodbye pinchas lingered gathering up his papers and you will see it is not adulterated with american in zion they do not say sure or lend me a nickel i guess not said kloot goodbye all the same you might lend me a nickel for carfare kloot thought his departure cheap at five cents he handed it over the poet went an instant afterwards the door reopened and his head reappeared the nose adorned with a pleading forefinger you promise me all this havent i promised but swear to me will you goif i swear yup said pinchas airing his american and you wont come back till rehearsals begin nup then i swearon my fathers and mothers life pinchas departed gleefully not knowing that kloot was an orphan iii on the very verge of passover pinchas lying in bed at noon with a cigarette in his mouth was reading his morning paper by candlelight for he tenanted one of those innumerable dark rooms which should make new york the photographers paradise the yellow glow illumined his prophetic and unshaven countenance agitated by grimaces and sniffs as he critically perused the paragraphs whose hebrew letters served as the channel for the mongrel yiddish and american dialect in which congressman sweater and suchlike crudities of today had all the outer oriental robing of the old testament suddenly a strange gurgle spluttered through the cigarette smoke he read the announcement again the yiddish hamlet was to be the passover production at goldwaters theatre the author was the worldrenowned poet melchitsedek pinchas and the music was by ignatz levitsky the worldfamous composer worldfamous composer indeed cried pinchas to his garret walls who ever heard of ignatz levitsky and who wants his music the tragedy of a thinker needs no caterwauling of violins does goldwater imagine i have written a melodrama at most will i permit an overtureor the cymbals shall clash as i take my call he leaped out of bed even greater than his irritation at this intrusion of levitsky was his joyful indignation at the imminence of his play the dogs the liars the first night was almost at hand and no sign had been vouchsafed to him he had been true to his promise he had kept away from the theatre but goldwater but kloot ah the godless gambler with his parents lives with such ghouls hovering around the hebrew hamlet who could say how the masterpiece had been mangled line upon line had probably been cut nay who knew that a whole scene had not been shorn away perhaps to give more time for that miserable music he flung himself into his clothes and taking his cane hurried off to the theatre breathless and breakfastless orchestral music vibrated through the lobby and almost killed his pleasure in the placards of the yiddish hamlet he gave but a moment to absorbing the great capital letters of his name a dash at a swingingdoor and he faced a glowing crowded stage at the end of a gloomy hall goldwater limelit occupied the centre of the boards hamlet trod the battlements of the tower of david and gazed on the cupolas and minarets of jerusalem with a raucous cry half anger half ecstasy pinchas galloped toward the fiddling and banging orchestra a harmless sweeper in his path was herself swept aside but her fallen broom tripped up the runner he fell with an echoing clamour to which his clattering cane contributed and clouds of dust arose and gathered where erst had stood a poet goldwater stopped dead cant you sweep quietly he thundered terribly through the music ignatz levitsky tapped his baton and the orchestra paused it is i the author said pinchas struggling up through clouds like some pagan deity hamlets face grew as inky as his cloak and what do you want what do i want repeated pinchas in sheer amaze kloot in his peaked cap emerged from the wings munching a sandwich sure theres shakespeare he said ive just been round to the cafe to find you got this sandwich there but thisthis isnt the first rehearsal stammered pinchas a jot appeased the first dressrehearsal kloot replied reassuringly we dont trouble authors with the rough work they stroll in and put on the polish wont you come on the stage unable to repress a grin of happiness pinchas stumbled through the dim parterre barking his shins at almost every step arrived at the orchestra he found himself confronted by a chasm he wheeled to the left to where the stagebox shrouded in brown holland loomed ghostly no said kloot that doors got stuck you must come round by the stagedoor pinchas retraced his footsteps barking the smooth remainder of his shins he allowed himself a palpitating pause before the lobby posters his blood chilled not only was ignatz levitsky starred in equal type but another name stood out larger than either ophelia fanny goldwater his wrath reflaming he hurried round to the stagedoor he pushed it open but a gruff voice inquired his business and a burly figure blocked his way i am the author he said with quiet dignity authors aint admitted was the simple reply but goldwater awaits me the poet protested i guess not mr kloots orders cant have authors monkeying around here as he spoke goldwaters voice rose from the neighbouring stage in an operatic melody and reduced pinchass brain to chaos a despairing sense of strange plots and treasons swept over him he ran back to the lobby the doors had been bolted he beat against them with his cane and his fists and his toes till a tall policeman persuaded him that home was better than a martyrs cell life remained an unintelligible nightmare for poor pinchas till the first nightand the third actof the yiddish hamlet he had reconciled himself to his extrusion from rehearsals they fear i fire ophelia he told the cafe but a final blow awaited him no ticket reached him for the premiere the boxes he had promised the cafe did not materialize and the necessity of avoiding that haunt of the invited cost him several meals but that he himself should be refused when he tried to pass in on his facethat authors should be admitted neither at the stage door nor at the public doorthis had not occurred to him as within the possibilities of even theatrical humanity pigs pigs pigs he shrieked into the box office you and goldwater and kloot pigs pigs pigs i have indeed cast my pearls before swine but i will not be beholden to themi will buy a ticket were sold out said the boxoffice man adding recklessly get a move on you other people want to buy seats you cant keep me out its conspiracy he darted within but was hustled as rapidly without he ran back to the stagedoor and hurled himself against the burly figure he rebounded from it into the sidewalk and the stagedoor closed upon his humiliation he was left cursing in choice hebrew it was like the maledictions in deuteronomy only brought up to date by dynamite explosions and automobile accidents wearying of the waste of an extensive vocabulary upon a blank door pinchas returned to the front the lobby was deserted save for a few strangers his play had begun and hehe the god who moved all this machineryhe whose divine fire was warming all that great house must pace out here in the cold and dark not even permitted to loiter in the corridors but for the rumblings of applause that reached him he could hardly have endured the situation suddenly an idea struck him he hied to the nearest drugstore and entering the telephone cabinet rang up goldwater hello there came the voice of kloot who are you pinchas had a vivid vision of the bignosed youth in his peaked cap sitting on the table by the telephone swinging his legs but he replied craftily in a disguised voice you goldwater no goldwaters on the stage pinchas groaned but at that very instant goldwaters voice returned to the bureau ejaculating complacently theyre loving it kloot theyre swallowing it like icecream soda pinchas tingled with pleasure but all kloot replied was youre wanted on the phone hello called goldwater hello replied pinchas in his natural voice may a sudden death smite you may the curtain fall on a gibbering epileptic cant hear said goldwater speak plainer i will speak plainer swinehead never shall a work of mine defile itself in your dirty dollarfactory i spit on you he spat viciously into the telephone disk your father was a meshummad apostate and your mother but goldwater had cut off the connection pinchas finished for his own satisfaction an irish firewoman that was worth ten cents he muttered as he strode out into the night and patrolling the front of the theatre again or leaning on his cane as on a sword he was warmed by the thought that his venom had pierced through all the actormanagers defences at last a change came over the nightmare striding from the envied illuminated within appeared the heathen journalist notebook in hand at sight of the author he shied must skedaddle pincuss he said apologetically if were to get anything into tomorrows paper your people are so durned slownearly eleven and only two acts over youll have to brisk em up a bit goodbye he shook the poets hand and was off with an inspiration pinchas gave chase he caught the journalist just boarding a car got your theatre ticket he panted what for give it me the journalist fumbled in his waistcoat pocket and threw him a crumpled fragment what in thunder he began and then to pinchass relief the car removed the querist for the moment the poet was feeling only the indignity of the position and the heathen journalist as trumpeter of his wrongs and avenger of the muses had not occurred to him he smoothed out the magic scrap and was inside the suffocating closepacked theatre before the disconcerted janitor could meet the new situation pinchas found the vacated journalistic chair in the stagebox he was installed therein before the managerial minions arrived on ejection bent this is my house screamed pinchas i stay here let me beswine serpents behemoth sh came in a shower from every quarter sit down there turn him out the curtain was going up pinchas was saved but only for more gruesome torture the third act began hamlet collogued with the queen the poet pricked up his ears whose language was this certainly not shakespeares or his superiors angels and ministers of grace defend him this was only the illiterate jargon of the hack playwright with its peppering of the phrases of hester street you have too many dead flies on you hamlets mother told him youll get left but the nightmare thickened hamlet and his mother opened their mouths and sang their songs were light and gay and held encore verses to reward the enthusiastic the actors like the audience were leisurely here midnight and the closure were not synonymous when there were no more encore verses ignatz levitsky would turn to the audience and bow in acknowledgment of the compliment pinchass eyes were orbs straining at their sockets froth gathered on his lips mrs goldwater bounded on fantastically mad her songs set to comic airs the great house received her in the same comic spirit instead of rue and rosemary she carried a rustling green lulovthe palmbranch of the feast of tabernaclesand shook it piously toward every corner of the compass at each shake the audience rolled about in spasms of merriment a moment later a white gliding figure moving to the measure of the cakewalk keyed up the laughter to hysteria it was the ghost appearing to frighten ophelia his sepulchral bass notes mingled with her terrorstricken soprano this was the last straw the ghostthe ghost that he had laid forever the ghost that made melodrama of this tragedy of the thinkerwas risen again and cakewalking unperceived in the general convulsion and cachinnation pinchas leaped to his feet and seeing scarlet bounded through the iron door and made for the stage but a hand was extended in the nick of timethe hand he had kissedand pinchas was drawn back by the collar you dont take your call yet said the unruffled kloot let me go i must speak to the people they must learn the truth they think me melchitsedek pinchas guilty of this tohubohu my sun will set i shall be laughed at from the hudson to the jordan hush hush you are interrupting the poesy who has drawn and quartered my play speak ive only arranged it for the stage said kloot unabashed you gasped the poet you said i and you are the only two men who understand how to treat poesy you understand pushcarts not poesy hissed the poet you conspire to keep me out of the theatrei will summons you we had to keep all authors out suppose shakespeare had turned up and complained of you shakespeare would have been only too grateful hush the boss is going on from the opposite wing hamlet was indeed advancing pinchas made a wild plunge forward but kloots grasp on his collar was still carefully firm whos mutilating the poesy now kloot frowned angrily from under his peaked cap youll spoil the scene peace liar you promised me your wife for ophelia kloots frown relaxed into a smile sure the first wife i get you shall have pinchas gnashed his teeth goldwaters voice rose in a joyous roulade i think you owe me a carfare said kloot soothingly pinchas waved the rejoinder aside with his cane why does hamlet sing he demanded fiercely because its passover said kloot you are a greener in new york otherwise you would know that it is a tradition to have musical plays on passover our audiences wouldnt stand for any other youre such an unreasonable cuss why else did we take your hamlet for a passover play but hamlet isnt a musical play yes it is how about ophelias songs that was what decided us of course they needed eking out but hamlet is a tragedy gasped pinchas sure said kloot cheerfully they all die at the end our audiences would go away miserable if they didnt you wait till theyre dead then you shall take your call take my call for your play theres quite a lot of your lines left if you listen carefully only you dont understand stage technique oh im not grumbling were quite satisfied the idea of adapting hamlet for the yiddish stage is yours and its worth every cent we paid a storm of applause gave point to the speakers words and removed the last partition between the poets great mind and momentary madness what here was that ape of a goldwater positively wallowing in admiration while he the mighty poet had been cast into outer darkness and his work mocked and crucified he put forth all his might like samson amid the philistines and leaving his coatcollar in kloots hand he plunged into the circle of light goldwaters amazed face turned to meet him cutter of lines the poets cane slashed across hamlets right cheek near the right eye perverter of poesy it slashed across the left cheek near the left eye the prince of palestine received each swish with a yell of pain and fear and the everready kloot dropped the curtain on the tragic scene such hubbub and hullabaloo as rose on both sides of the curtain yet in the end the poet escaped scotfree goldwater was a coward kloot a sage the same prudence that had led kloot to exclude authors saved him from magnifying their importance by police squabbles besides a clever lawyer might prove the exclusion illegal what was done was done the dignity of the hero of a hundred dramas was best served by private beefsteaks and a rumoured version irrefutable save in a court of law it was bad enough that the heathen journalist should supply so graphic a picture of the midnight melodrama coloured even more highly than goldwaters eyes kloot had been glad that the journalist had left before the episode but when he saw the account he wished the scribe had stayed he wont play hamlet with that pair of shiners pinchas prophesied early the next morning to the supping cafe radsikoff beamed and refilled pinchass glass with champagne he had carried out his promise of assisting at the premiere and was now paying for the poets supper youre the first playwright goldwater hasnt managed to dodge he chuckled ah said the poet meditatively action is greater than thought action is the greatest thing in the world the converts the converts i as he sat on his hard stool in the whitewashed workshop on the bowery clumsily pasting the flamboyant portrait on the boxes of the yvonne rupert cigar he wondered dullyafter the first flush of joy at getting a job after weeks of hungerat the strange fate that had again brought him into connection however remote with stageland for even to elkan mandle with his ghetto purview yvonne ruperts fame both as a parisian star and the queen of american advertisers had penetrated ever since she had summoned a jewish florist for not paying her for the hundred and eleven bouquets with which a single weeks engagement in vaudeville had enabled her to supply him the journals had continued to paragraph her amusing selfpuffing adventures not that there was much similarity between the new york star and his little actress of the humble yiddish theatre in london save for that aureole of fluffy hair which belonged rather to the genus than the individual but as the great yvonnes highlycoloured charms went on repeating themselves from every boxcover he manipulated at seventyfive cents a hundred the face of his own gittel grew more and more vivid till at last the whole splendid shameful past began to rise up from its desolate tomb he even lived through that prologue in the ghetto garret when as benevolent mastertailor receiving the highest class work from s cohns in the holloway road he was called upstairs to assist the penniless polish immigrants there she sat the witching shedevil perched on the rickety table just contributed to the home a piquant darkeyed yet goldenhaired mite of eleven calm and comparatively spruce amid the wailing litter of parents and children settle this among yourselves she seemed to be saying when the chairs are here i will sit on them when the table is laid i will draw to when the pious philanthropist provides the fire i will purr on the hearth ah he had come forward as the pious philanthropistpious enough then heaven knew why had satan thrown such lures in the way of the reputable employer the treasurer of the gates of mercy synagogue with children of his own and the best wife in the world did he not pray every day to be delivered from the satan mekatrig had he not meant it for the best when he took her into his workshop it was only when at the age of sixteen gittel goldstein left the whirring machineroom for the more lucrative and laurelled position of heroine of goldwaters london yiddish theatre that he had discovered how this whimsical coquettish creature had insinuated herself into his very being ah madness madness that flight with her to america with all his savings that desertion of his wife and children but what delicious delirium that one year in new york prodigal reckless ere with the disappearance of his funds she too disappeared and now here he wasafter nigh seven apathetic years in which the need of getting a living was the only spur to living onglad to take a womans place when female labour struck for five cents more a hundred the old bitter tears came up to his eyes blurring the cheerless scene the shabby men and unlovely women with their red pastepots the medley of bare and coloured boxes the long shelf of twineballs and as he wept the vain salt drops moistened the pictures of yvonne rupert ii she became an obsession this francoamerican singer and dancer as he sat pasting and pasting caressing her pictured face with sticky fingers there were brief intervals of freedom from her image when he was edging and backing or when he was lining the boxes with the plain paper but yvonne came twice on every boxonce in large on the inside once in small on the outside with a gummed projection to be stuck down after the cigars were in he fell to recalling what he had read of herthe convent education that had kept her chaste and distinguished beneath all her stage deviltry the long lenten fasts she endured as brought to light by the fishmongers bill she disputed in open court the crucifix concealed upon her otherwise not too reticent person the adorable french accent with which she enraptured the dudes the palatial private car in which she traversed the states with its little chapel giving on the bathroom the swashbuckling marquis de st roquiere who had crossed the channel after her and the maid he had once kidnapped in mistake for the mistress the diamond necklace presented by the rajah of singapuri stolen at a soiree in san francisco and found afterwards as single stones in a low hockshop in new orleans and despite all this glitter of imposing images a subconscious thought was forcing itself more and more clearly to the surface of his mind that aureole of golden hair those piquant dark eyes the yvonne the cheap illustrated papers had made him familiar with had lacked this revelation of colour but no the idea was insane this scintillating celebrity his lost gittel bah misery had made him childish goldwater had indeed blossomed out since the days of his hired hall in spitalfields but his fame remained exclusively yiddish and eastside but gittel how could that obscure rushlight of the london ghetto theatre have blazed into the star of paris and new york this lentkeeping demoiselle the little polish jewess who had munched passover cake at his table in the faroff happy days this gilded idol the impecunious gittel he had caressed you ever seen this yvonne rupert he inquired of his neighbour a pockmarked spectacled young woman who as recordbreaker of the establishment had refused to join the strike of the mere hundredandfifty a day the young woman swiftly drew a knife from the wooden pail beside her and deftly scraped at a rough hinge as she replied no but i guess shes the actress who gets all the flowers and wont pay for em he saw she had mixed up the two lawsuits but the description seemed to hit off his gittel to the life yes gittel had always got all the flowers of life and dodged paying ah she had always been diabolically clever unscrupulously ambitious who could put bounds to her achievement she had used him and thrown him awaywithout a word without a regret she had washed her hands of him as lightheartedly as he washed his of the dirty sticky days paste what other pious philanthropist had she found to replace him whither had she fled why not to paris that her theatric gifts might receive training this chic this witchery with which reputation credited herhad not gittel possessed it all had not her heroines enchanted the ghetto oh but this was a wild daydream insubstantial as the smokewreaths of the yvonne rupert cigar iii but the obsession persisted in his miserable attic off hester streetthat recalled the attic he had found her in though it was many stories nearer the skyhe warmed himself with gittels image smiling lightdarting voluptuous night and sleep surrendered him to grotesque combinationsgittel goldstein smoking cigarettes in a bathroom yvonne rupert playing yiddish heroines in a little chapel in the clear morning these absurdities were forgotten in the realized absurdity of the initial identification but a forenoon at the pastingdesk brought back the haunting thought at noon he morbidly expended his lunchdime on an yvonne rupert cigar and smoked it with a semiinsane feeling that he was repossessing his gittel certainly it was delicious he wandered into the boxmaking room where the man who tended the witty naildriving machine was seated on a stack of mexican cedarwood eating from a package of sausage and scrapple that sent sobering whiffs to the reckless smoker you ever seen this yvonne rupert he asked wistfully might as well ask if id smoked her cigar grumbled the nailer through his mouthfuls but theres a gallery at webster and dixies suer i guess ill go some day just for curiosity but the great yvonne he found was flaming in her provincial orbit so he must needs wait meantime on a saturday night with a dirty twodollar bill in his pocket and jingling some odd cents he lounged into the restaurant where the young russian bloods assembled who wrote for the yiddish labour papers and knew it all he would draw them out about yvonne rupert he established himself near a table at which longhaired longfingered freethinkers were drinking chocolate and discussing lassalle ah but the way he jumped on a table when only a schoolboy to protest against the masters injustice to one of his schoolfellows how the divine fire flamed in him they talked on these clamorous sceptics amplifying the lassalle legend broidering it with messianic myths with the same fantastic oriental invention that had illuminated the plain pentateuch with imaginative vignettes and transfiguring the dry abstractions of socialism with the same passionate personalization he listened impatiently he had never been caught by socialism even at his hungriest he had once been an employer himself and his point of view survived they talked of the woman through whom lassalle had met his death one of them had seen her on the american stagea bouncing burlesque actress like yvonne rupert he ventured to interpose yvonne rupert they laughed ah if yvonne had only had such a snap cried melchitsedek pinchas to have jilted lassalle and been died for what an advertisement it would have been on the bill agreed the table he asked if they thought yvonne rupert clever off the stage theres nothing to her on said pinchas the table roared as if this were a good joke i dare say she would play my ophelia as well as mrs goldwater pinchas added zestfully they say she has a yiddish accent elkan ventured again the table roared louder i have heard of yiddishdeutsch cried pinchas never of yiddishfrancais elkan mandle was frozen by his disappointment he knew that he had been hoping to meet gittel againthat his resentment was dead iv but the hope would not die he studied the theatrical announcements and when yvonne rupert once again flashed upon new york he set out to see her but it struck him that the remote seat he could affordfor it would not do to spend a weeks wage on the mere chancewould be too far off for precise identification especially as she would probably be theatrically transmogrified no a wiser as well as a more economical plan would be to meet her at the stagedoor as he used to meet gittel he would hang about till she came it was a long ride to the variety theatre and the weather being sloppy there was not even standingroom in the car every foot of which as it plunged and heaved shiplike through the watery night was a suffocating jam of human beings wedged on the seats or clinging tightly to the overhead straps or swarming like stuck flies on the fore and hind platforms the squeeze and smell intensified by the shovings and writhings of damp passengers getting in and out or by the desperate wriggling of the poor patient collector of fares boring his way through the very thick of the soldered mass elkan alighted with a headache glad even of the cold rain that sprinkled his forehead the shining carriages at the door of the theatre filled him for once with a bitter revolt but he dared not insinuate himself among the whitewrapped scented women and elegant cloaked men though he itched to enter the portico and study the pictures of yvonne rupert of which he caught a glimpse he found his way instead to the stagedoor and took up a position that afforded him a complete view of the comers and goers if only partial shelter from the rain but the leaden hours passed without her with endless fevers of expectation heats followed by chills the performers came and went mostly on foot and strange nondescript men and women passed too through the jealouslyguarded door he was drenched to the skin with accumulated drippings ere a smart brougham drove up a smart groom opened an umbrella and a smartan unimaginably smartgittel goldstein alighted yes the incredible was true beneath that coquettish veil under the aureole of hair gleamed the piquant eyes he had kissed so often he remained petrified an instant dazed and staring she passed through the door the groom held open the doorkeeper from his pigeonhole handed her some letters yes he knew every trick of the shoulders every turn of the neck she stood surveying the envelopes as the groom let the door swing back and turned away he rushed forward and pushed it open again gittel he cried chokingly gittel she turned with a quick jerk of the head and in her flushed startled face he read consciousness if not recognition the reek of her old cherryblossom smote from her costlier garments kindling a thousand passionate memories knowest thou me not he cried in yiddish in a flash her face doubly veiled was a haughty stare who is zis person she asked the doorkeeper in her charming frenchenglish he reverted to english i am elkan your own elkan ah the jostle of sweet and bitter memories so near so near again the same warm seductive witch he strove to take her daintilygloved hand she shrank back shudderingly and thrust open the door that led to the dressingrooms beside the stage ze man is mad lunatic and she disappeared with that delicious shrug of the shoulders that had captivated the states insensate fury overcame him what this creature who owed all this glory to his dragging her away from the london ghetto theatre this heartless brazen minx who had been glad to nestle in his arms was to mock him like this was to elude him again he made a dash after her the doorkeeper darted from his little room but was hurled aside in a swift mad tussle and elkan after a blind bloodred instant found himself blinking and dripping in the centre of the stage facing a great roaring audience tier upon tier then he became aware of a pair of eccentric comedians whose scene he had interrupted and who had not sufficient presence of mind to work him into it so that the audience which had laughed at his headlong entrance now laughed the louder over its own mistake but its delightful moment of sensational suspense was brief in a twinkling the doorkeepers vengeful hands were on the intruders collar i want yvonne rupert shrieked elkan struggling she is minemine she loved me once a vaster wave of laughter swept back to him as he was hauled off to be handed over to a policeman on a charge of brawling and assaulting the doorkeeper v as he lay in his cell he chewed the cud of revenge yes let them take him before the magistrate it was not he that was afraid of justice he would expose her the false catholic the shecat a pretty convert another man would have preferred to blackmail her he told himself with righteous indignation especially in such straits of poverty but hethe thought had scarcely crossed his mind he had not even thought of her helping him only of the joy of meeting her again in the chill morning after a sleepless night he had a panicstricken sense of his insignificance under the crushing weight of law and order all the strength born of bitterness oozed out as he stood before the magistrate rigidly and heard the charge preferred he had a despairing vision of yvonne rupert mocking inaccessible even before he was asked his occupation in a cigarbox factory he replied curtly ah you make cigarboxes no not exactly i paste paste what he hesitated pictures of yvonne rupert on the boxes ah then it is the yvonne rupert cigar yes he had divined the courts complacent misinterpretation ere he saw its smile the facile theory that brooding so much over her fascinating picture had unhinged his brain from that moment a hardness came over his heart he shut his lips grimly what was the use of talking whatever he said would be discredited on this impish theory and even without it how incredible his story how irrelevant to the charge of assaulting the doorkeeper i was drunk was all he would say he was committed for trial and having no one to bail him out lingered in a common cell with other reprobates till the van brought him to the law court and he came up to justice in an elevator under the rebuking folds of the stars and stripes a fortnights more confinement was all that was meted out to him but he had already had time enough to reflect that he had given yvonne rupert one of the best advertisements of her life it would have enhanced the prisoners bitterness had he known as the knowing world outside knew that he was a poor devil in yvonne ruperts pay and that new york was chuckling over the original and ingenious dodge by which she had again asserted her sovereignty as an advertiserdelicious immense vi short as his term of imprisonment was it coincided much to his own surprise with the jewish penitential period and the day of atonement came in the middle a wealthy jewish philanthropist had organized a prison prayerservice and elkan eagerly grasped at the break in the monotony several of the prisoners who posed as jews with this same motive were detected and reprimanded but elkan felt with the new grim sense of humour that meditation on yvonne rupert and the world she fooled was developing in him that he was as little of a jew as any of them this elopement to america had meant a violent break with his whole religious past not once had he seen the inside of an american synagogue gittel had had no use for synagogues he entered the improvised prayerroom with this ironic sense of coming back to judaism by the christian prison door but the service shook him terribly he forgot even to be amused by the one successful impostor who had landed himself in an unforeseen deprivation of rations during the whole fast day the passionate outcries of the oldfashioned chazan the solemn peals and tremolo notes of the cornet which had once been merely aesthetic effects to the reputable mastercutter were now surcharged with doom and chastisement the very sight of the hebrew books and scrolls touched a thousand memories of home and innocence ah god how he had sinned forgive us now pardon us now atone for us now he cried smiting his breast and rocking to and fro his poor deserted wife and children how terrible for haigitcha to wake up one morning and find him gone as terrible as for him to wake up one morning and find gittel gone ah god had indeed paid him in kind eye for eye tooth for tooth the philanthropist himself preached the sermon god could never forgive sins till the sinner had first straightened out the human wrongs ah true true if he could only find his family again if he could try by love and immeasurable devotion to atone for the past then again life would have a meaning and an aim poor poor haigitcha how he would weep over her and cherish her and his children they must be grown up yankely must be quite a young man yes he would be seventeen by now and rachel that pretty clinging cherub in all those years he had not dared to let his thoughts pause upon them his past lay like a misty dream behind those thousand leagues of ocean but now it started up in all the colours of daylight warm appealing yes he would go back to his dear ones who must still crave his love and guidance he would plead and be forgiven and end his days piously at the sacred hearth of duty forgive us now pardon us now atone for us now if only he could get back to old england he appealed to the philanthropist and lied amid all his contrition it was desperation at the severance from his wife and children that had driven him to drink lust of gold that had spurred him across the atlantic now a wiser and sadder man he would be content with a modicum and the wife of his bosom vii he arrived at last with a few charity coins in his pocket in the familiar spitalfields alley guarded by the three iron posts over which he remembered his yankely leaping his heart was full of tears and memories ah there was the butchers shop still underneath the old apartment with the tin labels stuck in the kosher meat and there was gideon the fat genial butcher flourishing his great carvingknife as of yore though without that ancient smile of brotherly recognition gideons frigidity chilled him it was an inauspicious omen a symptom of things altered irrevocable does mrs mandle still live here he asked with a horrible heartsinking yes first floor said gideon staring ah how his heart leapt up again haigitcha his dear haigitcha he went up the everopen dusty staircase jostling against a spruce handsome young fellow who was hurrying down he looked back with a sudden conviction that it was his son his heart swelled with pride and affection but ere he could cry yankely the young fellow was gone he heard the whirr of machines yes she had kept on the workshop the wonderful creature though crippled by his loss and the want of capital doubtless s cohns kindhearted firm had helped her to tide over the crisis ah what a blackguard he had been and she had brought up the children unaided dear haigitcha what madness had driven him from her side but he would make amendsyes he would make amends he would slip again into his own niche take up the old burdens and the old delightsperhaps even be again treasurer of the gates of mercy he knocked at the door haigitcha herself opened it he wanted to cry her name but the word stuck in his throat for this was not his haigitcha this was a new creature cold stern tragic prematurely aged framed in the sombre shadows of the staircase and in her eyes was neither rapture nor remembrance what is it she asked i am elkan dont you know me she stared with a little gasp and a heaving of the flat breasts then she said icily and what do you want i am come back he muttered hoarsely in yiddish and where is gittel she answered in the same idiom the needles of the whirring machines seemed piercing through his brain so london knew that gittel had been the companion of his flight he hung his head i was only with her one year he whispered then go back to thy dungheap she shut the door he thrust his foot in desperately ere it banged to haigitcha he shrieked let me come in forgive me forgive me it was a tugofwar he forced open the door he had a vision of surprised hands stopping their machines of a beautiful startled girl holding the ends of a halflaid tableclothhis rachel oh his rachel open the window one of you panted haigitcha her shoulders still straining against the door call a policemanthe man is drunk he staggered back his pressure relaxed the door slammed this repetition of his yvonne rupert experience sobered him effectually what right indeed had he to force himself upon this woman upon these children to whom he was dead so might a suicide hope to win back his place in the old life life had gone on without himhad no need of him ah what a punishment god had prepared for him closed doors to the past closed doors everywhere and this terrible sense of exclusion had not now the same palliative of righteous resentment with yvonne rupert the splendidflaming vicious ingrate he had felt himself the sinned against but before this wifewidow this dutiful hardworking tragic creature he had nothing but selfcontempt he tottered downstairs how should he even get his breadhe whose illfame was doubtless the gossip of the ghetto if he could only get hold of gideons carvingknife viii but he did not commit suicide nor did he starve there is always one last refuge for the failures of the ghetto and elkans easy experience with the jewish philanthropist had prepared the way for dealings with the christian today the rev moses elkan the converted jew preaches eloquently to his blind brethren who never come to hear him for he has found the light exeter halls exposition of the jewish prophecies has opened his eyes and though his foes have been those of his own household yet remembering the terrible text he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me he has taken up his cross and followed after christ alone and even if the good souls for whose thousands of pounds he is the annual interest should discover his true pastthrough this talebearer or anotheris there not but the more joy over the sinner that repenteth duties neglected deadly sins trailing in the actual world their unchangeable irreversible consequencesall this is irrelevant he has found the light and so while haigitcha walks in darkness yvonne prays in her chapel and elkan preaches in his church holy wedlock holy wedlock i when schneemann the artist returned from rome to his native village in galicia he found it humming with gossip concerning his paternal grandmother universally known as the bube yenta it would seem that the giddy old thing hobbled home from synagogue conversing with yossel mandelstein the hunchback and sometimes even offered the unshapely septuagenarian her snuffbox as he passed the door of her cottage more than one village censor managed to acquaint the artist with the flirtation ere he had found energy to walk the muddy mile to her dwelling even his own mother came out strongly in disapproval of the ancient dame perhaps the remembrance of how fanatically her motherinlaw had disapproved of her married head for not being shrouded in a pious wig lent zest to her tongue the artist controlled his facial muscles having learnt tolerance and bohemianism in the eternal city old blood will have its way he said blandly yes old bloods way is sometimes worse than young bloods said frau schneemann unsmiling you must not forget that yossel is still a bachelor yes and therefore a sinner in israeli remember quoth the artist with a twinkle how all this would amuse his bachelor friends leopold barstein and rozenoffski the pianist make not mock tis high time you too should lead a maiden under the canopy i am so shythere are few so forward as grandmother heaven be thanked said his mother fervently when i refused to cover my tresses she spoke as if i were a brazen epicurean but i had rather have died than carry on so shamelessly with a man to whom i was not betrothed perhaps they are betrothed we betrothed to yossel may his name be blotted out why what is wrong with yossel moses mendelssohn himself had a hump who speaks of humps have you forgotten we are of rabbinic family her son had quite forgotten it as he had forgotten so much of this naive life to which he was paying a holiday visit ah yes he murmured but yossel is pioussurely a vision of the psalmdroners and prayershriekers in the little synagogue among whom the hunchback had been conspicuous surged up vividly he may shake himself from dawnservice to nightservice he will never shake off his father the innkeeper said frau schneemann hotly if i were in your grandmothers place i would be weaving my shroud not thinking of young men but shes thinking of old men you said compared with her he is youngshe is eightyfour he is only seventyfive well they wont be married long he laughed frau schneemann laid her hand on his mouth heaven forbid the omen she cried tis bringing a bilbul scandal upon a respectable family i will go and talk to her he said gravely indeed i ought to have gone to see her days ago and as he trudged to the other end of the village towards the cottage where the lively old lady lived in selfsufficient solitude he was full of the contrast between his mothers mental world and his own people live in their own minds and not in streets or fields he philosophized ii through her diamondpaned window he saw the wrinkled whitecapped old creature spinning peacefully at the rustic chimneycorner a pure cloistral crone it seemed profane to connect such a figure with flirtationthis was surely the very virgin of senility what a fine picture she made too why had he never thought of painting her yes such a picture of the spinster would be distinctly interesting and he would put in the kesubah the marriage certificate that hung over the mantelpiece in ironical reminder of her days of bloom he unlatched the doorhe had never been used to knock at grannies door and the childish instinct came back to him guten abend he said she adjusted a pair of horn spectacles and peered at him guten abend she murmured you dont remember mevroomkely he used the old childish diminutive of abraham though he had almost forgotten he owned the name in full vroomkely she gasped almost overturning her wheel as she sprang to hug him in her skinny arms he had a painful sense that she had shrunk back almost to childish dimensions her hands seemed trembling as much with decay as with emotion she hastened to produce from the wellknown cupboard homemade kuchen and other dainties of his youth with no sense of the tragedy that lay in his no longer being tempted by them and how goes your trade she said they say you have never been slack they must build many houses in rome her notion that he was a housepainter he hardly cared to contradict especially as picturepainting was contrary to the mosaic dispensation oh i havent been only in rome he said evasively i have been in many lands fire came into her eyes and flashed through the big spectacles you have been to palestine she cried no only as far as egypt why i thought you might have brought me a clod of palestine earth to put in my grave the fire died out of her spectacles she sighed and took a consolatory pinch of snuff dont talk of gravesyou will live to be a hundred and more he cried but he was thinking how ridiculous gossip was it spared neither age nor sexlessness not even this shrivelled ancient who was meditating on her latter end suddenly he became aware of a shadow darkening the doorway at the same instant the fire leapt back into his grandmothers glasses instinctively almost before he turned his head he knew it was the hero of the romance yossel mandelstein looked even less of a hero than the artist had remembered there had been something wistful and pathetic in the hunchbacks expression some hint of inner eager fire but thisif he had not merely imagined itseemed to have died of age and hopelessness he used crutches too to help himself along with so that he seemed less the hunchback of yore than the conventional contortion of time and but for the familiar earlocks pendent on either side of the fur cap but for the great hooked nose and the small chin hidden in the big beard the artist might have doubted if this was indeed the yossel he had sometimes mocked at in the crude cruelty of boyhood yossel propped on his crutches was pulling out a mouldering blackcovered book from under his greasy caftan i have brought you back your chovoth halvovoth he said in the vivid presence of the actual romance the artist could not suppress the smile he had kept back at the mere shadowy recital in rome he himself had not infrequently called on young ladies by way of returning books to them it was true that the books he returned were not hebrew treatises but he smiled again to think that the name of yossels volume signified the duties of the heart the bube yenta received the book with thanks and a moment of embarrassment ensued only slightly mitigated by the offer of the snuffbox yossel took a pinch but his eyes seemed roving in amaze less over the stranger than over the bespread table as though he might unaccountably have overlooked some sacred festival that two are company and three none seemed at this point a proverb to be heeded and without waiting to renew the heros acquaintance the artist escaped from the idyllic cottage let the lover profit by the pastry for which he himself was too old so the gossips spoke the truth he thought his amusement not unblended with a touch of his mothers indignation surely if his grandmother wished to cultivate a grand passion she might have chosen a more sightly object of devotion not that there was much to be said for yossels taste either when after seventyfive years of celibacy the fascinations of the other sex began to tell upon him he might at least have succumbed to a less matriarchal form of femininity but perhaps his grandmother had fascinations of another order perhaps she had money he put the question to his mother certainly she has money said his mother vindictively she has thousands of gulden in her stocking twenty years ago she could have had her pick of a dozen welltodo widowers yet now that she has one foot in the grave madness has entered her soul and she has cast her eye upon this pauper but i thought his father left him his inn said the artist his innyes his senseno yossel ruined himself long ago paying too much attention to the talmud instead of his business he was always a schlemihl but can one pay too much attention to the talmud that is a strange saying for a rabbis daughter king solomon tells us there is a time for everything returned the rabbis daughter yossel neglected what the wise king said and so now he comes trying to wheedle your poor grandmother out of her money if he wanted to marry why didnt he marry before eighteen as the talmud prescribes he seems to do everything at the wrong time laughed her son do you suppose by the way that king solomon made all his thousand marriages before he was eighteen make not mock of holy things replied his mother angrily the monetary explanation of the romance he found was the popular one in the village it did not however exculpate the grandame from the charge of forwardness since if she wished to contract another marriage it could have been arranged legitimately by the shadchan and then the poor marriagebroker who got little enough to do in this godforsaken village might have made a few gulden out of it beneath all his artistic perception of the humours of the thing schneemann found himself prosaically sharing the general disapprobation of the marriage really when one came to think of it it was ridiculous that he should have a new grandfather thrust upon him and such a grandfather perhaps the bube was indeed losing her reason or was it he himself who was losing his reason taking seriously this parochial scandal and believing that because a doddering hunchback of seventyfive had borrowed an ethical treatise from an octogenarian a marriage must be on the tapis yet on more than one occasion he came upon circumstances which seemed to justify the popular supposition there could be no doubt for example that when at the conclusion of the synagogue service the feminine stream from the womens gallery poured out to mingle with the issuing males these two atoms drifted together with unnatural celerity it appeared to be established beyond question that on the preceding feast of tabernacles the bube had lent and practically abandoned to the hunchbacks use the ritual palmbranch he was too poor to afford of course this might only have been gratitude inasmuch as a fortnight earlier on the solemn new year day when by an untimely decree the grandmother lay ill abed yossel had obtained possession of the shofar and leaving the synagogue had gone to blow it to her he had blown the holy hornwith due regard to the proprietiesin the downstairs room of her cottage so that she above had heard it and having heard it could breakfast it was a performance that charity reasonably required for a disabled fellowcreature and yet what medieval knight had found a more delicate way of trumpeting his mistresss charms besides how had yossel known that the heroine was ill his eye must have roved over the womens gallery and disentangled her absence even from the huddled mass of weeping and swaying womanhood one day came the crowning item of evidence the grandmother had actually asked the village postman to oblige her by delivering a brown parcel at yossels lodgings the postman was not a child of the covenant but yossels landlady was and within an hour all jewry knew that yenta had sent yossel a phylacteriesbagthe very symbol of love offered by a maiden to her bridegroom could shameless passion further go iii the artist at least determined it should go no further he put on his hat and went to find yossel mandelstein but yossel was not to be found so easily and the artists resolution strengthened with each false scent yossel was ultimately run to earth or rather to heaven in the beth hamedrash where he was shaking himself studiously over a babylonian folio in company with a motley assemblage of youths and greybeards equally careless of the demands of life the dusky home of holy learning seemed an awkward place in which to broach the subject of love in a whisper he besought the oscillating student to come outside yossel started up in agitation ah your grandmother is dying he divined with what seemed a lovers inaccuracy i will come and pray at once no no she is not dying said schneemann hastily adding in a grim murmur unless of love oh then it is not about your grandmother nothat is to say yes it seemed more difficult than ever to plunge into the delicate subject to refer plumply to the courtship would especially if it were not true compromise his grandmother and incidentally her family yet on the other hand he longed to know what lay behind all this philandering which in any case had been compromising her and he felt it his duty as his grandmothers protector and the representative of the family to ask yossel straight out whether his intentions were honourable he remembered scenes in novels and plays in which undesirable suitors were tackled by champions of conventionscenes in which they were even bought off and started in new lands would not yossel go to a new land and how much would he want over and above his fare he led the way without you have lived here all your life yossel have you not he said when they were in the village street where else shall a man live answered yossel but have you never had any curiosity to see other parts would you not like to go and see vienna a little gleam passed over yossels dingy face no not viennait is an unholy placebut prague prague where there is a great rabbi and the old old underground synagogue that god has preserved throughout the generations well why not go and see it suggested the artist yossel stared is it for that you tore me away from my talmud nno not exactly for that stammered schneemann only seeing you glued to it gave me the idea what a pity it was that you should not travel and sit at the feet of great rabbis but how shall i travel to them my crutches cannot walk so far as prague oh id lend you the money to ride said the artist lightly but i could never repay it you can repay me in heaven you can give me a little bit of your gan iden paradise yossel shook his head and after i had the fare how should i live here i make a few gulden by writing letters for people to their relatives in america in prague everybody is very learned they dont need a scribe besides if i cannot die in palestine i might as well die where i was born but why cant you die in palestine cried the artist with a new burst of hope you shall die in palestine i promise you the gleam in yossels face became a great flame of joy i shall die in palestine he asked ecstatically as sure as i live i will pay your fare the whole way secondclass for a moment the dazzling sunshine continued on yossels face then a cloud began to pass across it but how can i take your money i am not a schnorrer schneemann did not find the question easy to answer the more so as yossels eagerness to go and die in palestine seemed to show that there was no reason for packing him off however he told himself that one must make assurance doubly sure and that even if it was all empty gossip still he had stumbled upon a way of making an old man happy there is no reason why you should take my money he said with an artistic inspiration but there is every reason why i should buy to myself the mitzvah good deed of sending you to jerusalem you see i have so few good deeds to my credit so i have heard replied yossel placidly a very wicked life it is said you lead at rome most true said the artist cheerfully it is said also that you break the second commandment by making representations of things that are on sea and land i would the critics admitted as much murmured the artist your grandmother does not understand she thinks you paint houseswhich is not forbidden but i dont undeceive herit would pain her too much the loverlike sentiment brought back the artists alarm when will you be ready to start he said yossel pondered but to die in palestine one must live in palestine he said i cannot be certain that god would take my soul the moment i set foot on the holy soil the artist reflected a moment but scarcely felt rich enough to guarantee that yossel should live in palestine especially if he were an unconscionably long time adying a happy thought came to him but there is the chalukah he reminded yossel but that is charity noit is not charity it is a sort of university endowment it is just to support such old students as you that these sums are sent from all the world over the prayers and studies of our old men in jerusalem are a redemption to all israel and yours would be to me in particular true true said yossel eagerly and life is very cheap there i have always heard then it is a bargain slipped unwarily from the artists tongue but yossel replied simply may the blessings of the eternal be upon you for ever and for ever and by the merit of my prayers in jerusalem may your sins be forgiven the artist was moved surely he thought struggling between tears and laughter no undesirable lover had ever thus been got rid of by the head of the family not to speak of an undesirable grandfather iv the news that yossel was leaving the village bound for the holy land produced a sensation which quite obscured his former notoriety as an aspirant to wedlock indeed those who discussed the new situation most avidly forgot how convinced they had been that marriage and not death was the hunchbacks goal how yossel had found money for the great adventure was not the least interesting ingredient in the cup of gossip it was even whispered that the grandmother herself had been tapped her skittish advances had been taken seriously by yossel he had boldly proposed to lead her under the canopy but at this point it was said the old lady had drawn backshe who had led him so far was not to be thus led women are changeable it is known and even when they are old they do not change but yossel had stood up for his rights he had demanded compensation and his fare to palestine was a concession for his injured affections it was not many days before the artist met persons who had actually overheard the bargaining between the bube and the hunchback meantime yossels departure was drawing nigh and all those who had relatives in palestine besieged him from miles around plying him with messages benedictions and even packages for their kinsfolk and conversely there was scarcely a jewish inhabitant who had not begged for clods of palestine earth or bottles of jordan water so great indeed were the demands that their supply would have constituted a distinct invasion of the sovereign rights of the sultan and dried up the jordan with his grandmothers future thus off his mind the artist had settled down to making a picture of the ruined castle which he commanded from his bedroom window but when the through ticket for jerusalem came from the agent at vienna and he had brazenly endured yossels blessings for the same his artistic instinct demanded to see how the bube was taking her heros desertion as he lifted the latch he heard her voice giving orders and the door opened not on the peaceful scene he expected of the spinster at her ingle nook but of a bustling and apparently rejuvenated old lady supervising a packing menial the greatest shock of all was that this menial proved to be yossel himself squatted on the floor his crutches beside him almost as in guilty confusion the hunchback hastily closed the sheet containing a huddle of articles and tied it into a bundle before the artists chaotic sense of its contents could change into clarity but instantly a flash of explanation came to him aha grandmother he said i see you too are sending presents to palestine the grandmother took snuff uneasily yes it is going to the land of israel she said as the artist lifted his eyes from the two amorphous heaps on the flooryossel and his bundlehe became aware of a blank in the familiar interior why where is the spinningwheel he cried i have given it to the widow rubensteini shall spin no more and i thought of painting you as a spinster he murmured dolefully then a white patch in the darkened wood over the mantelpiece caught his eye why your marriage certificate is gone too yes i have taken it down to give to the widow rubenstein what an idea said his grandmother seriously it is in the bundle you are sending it away to palestine the grandmother fumbled with her spectacles and removing them with trembling fingers blinked downwards at the bundle yossel snatched up his crutches and propped himself manfully upon them your grandmother goes with me he explained decisively what the artist gasped the grandmothers eyes met his unflinchingly they had drawn fire from yossels and why should i not go to palestine too she said but you are so old the more reason i should make haste if i am to be luckier than moses our master she readjusted her spectacles firmly but the journey is so hard yossel has wisdom he will find the way while alive as easily as others will roll thither after death youll be dead before you get there said the artist brutally ah no god will not let me die before i touch the holy soil you too want to die in palestine cried the amazed artist and where else shall a daughter of israel desire to die ah i forgotyour mother was an epicurean with godless tresses she did not bring you up in the true love of our land but every day for seventy years and more have i prayed the prayer that my eyes should behold the return of the divine glory to zion that mercy i no longer expect in my own days inasmuch as the sultan hardens his heart and will not give us back our land not though moses our master appears to him every night and beats him with his rod but at least my eyes shall behold the land of israel amen said yossel still propped assertively on his crutches the grandson turned upon the interrupter but you cant take her with you why not said yossel calmly schneemann found himself expatiating upon the responsibility of looking after such an old woman it seemed too absurd to talk of the scandal that was left for the grandmother to emphasize would you have me arrive alone in palestine she interposed impatiently think of the talk it would make in jerusalem and should i even be permitted to land they say the sultans soldiers stand at the landingplace like the angels at the gates of paradise with swords that turn every way but yossel is cunning in the customs of the heathen he will explain to the soldiers that he is an austrian subject and that i am his frau what pass you off as his frau who speaks of passing off he could say i was his sister as abraham our father said of sarah but that was a sin in the sight of heaven and therefore as our sages explain it is simpler to be married yossel interrupted married echoed the artist angrily the witnesses are coming to my lodging this afternoon yossel continued calmly dovidel and yitzkoly from the beth hamedrash they think they are only coming to a farewell glass of brandy chuckled the grandmother but they will find themselves at a secret wedding and tomorrow we shall depart publicly for trieste yossel wound up calmly but this is too absurd the artist broke in i forbid this marriage a violent expression of amazement overspread the ancient dames face and the tone of the faraway years came into her voice silence vroomkely or ill smack your face do you forget you are talking to your grandmother i think mr mandelstein forgets it the artist retorted turning upon the heroic hunchback do you mean to say you are going to marry my grandmother and why not asked yossel is there a greater lover of god in all galicia hush yossel i am a great sinner but her old face was radiant she turned to her grandson dont be angry with yosselall the fault is mine he did not ask me to go with him to palestine it was i that asked him do you mean that you asked him to marry you it is the same thing there is no other way how different would it have been had there been any other woman here who wanted to die in palestine but the women nowadays have no fear of heaven they wear their hair unshornthey yes yes so you asked yossel to marry you asked prayed as one prays upon atonement day for two years i prayed to him but he always refused then why began the artist yossel is so proud it is his only sin oh yenta protested yossel flushing i am a very sinful man yes but your sin is all in a lump the bube replied your iniquity is like your uglinesssome people have it scattered all over but you have it all heaped up and the heap is called pride never mind his pride put in the artist impatiently why did he not go on refusing you i am coming to that only you were always so impatient vroomkely when i was cutting you a piece of kuchen you would snatch greedily at the crumbs as they fell you see yossel is not made of the same clay as you and i by an oversight the almighty sent an angel into the world instead of a man but seeing his mistake at the last moment the allhigh broke his wings short and left him a hunchback but when yossels father made a match for him with leah the rich cornfactors daughter the silly girl when she was introduced to the bridegroom could see only the hump and scandalously refused to carry out the contract and yossel is so proud that ever since that day he curled himself up into his hump and nursed a hatred for all women how can you say that yenta yossel broke in again why else did you refuse my money the bube retorted twice ten twenty times i asked him to go to palestine with me but obstinate as a pig he keeps grunting i cantive got no money sooner than i should pay his fare hed have seen us both die here the artist collapsed upon the bundle astonishment anger and selfridicule made an emotion too strong to stand under so this was all his machiavellian scheming had achievedto bring about the very marriage it was meant to avert he had dug a pit and fallen into it himself all this would indeed amuse rozenoffski and leopold barstein he laughed bitterly nay it was no laughing matter said the bube indignantly for i know well how yossel longed to go with me to die in jerusalem and at last the allhigh sent him the fare and he was able to come to me and invite me to go with him here the artist became aware that yossels eyes and lips were signalling silence to him as if forsooth one published ones good deeds he had yet to learn on whose behalf the hunchback was signalling so you came into a fortune he asked yossel gravely yossel looked the picture of misery the bube unconsciously cut through the situation a wicked man gave it to him she explained to pray away his sins in jerusalem indeed murmured the artist anyone you know heaven has spared her the pain of knowing him ambiguously interpolated her anxious protector i dont even know his name added the bube yossel keeps it hidden one must not shame a fellowman yossel urged the sin of that is equal to the sin of shedding blood the grandmother nodded her head approvingly it is enough that the allhigh knows his name but for such an epicurean much praying will be necessary it will be a long work and your first prayer yossel must be that you shall not die very soon else the labourer will not be worthy of his hire yossel took her yellow withered hand as in a lovers clasp be at peace yenta he will be redeemed if only by your merits are we not one elijahs goblet elijahs goblet i aaron ben amram removed from the great ritual dish the roasted shankbone of lamb symbolic residuum of the paschal sacrifice and the roasted egg representative of the ancient festivaloffering in the temple and while his wife and children held up the dish which now contained only the bitter herbs and unleavened cakes he recited the chaldaic prelude to the sederthe long domestic ceremonial of the passover evening this is the bread of affliction which our fathers ate in the land of egypt let all who are hungry come in and eat let all who require come in and celebrate the passover this year here next year in the land of israel this year slaves next year sons of freedom but the polish physician showed nothing of the slave whitebearded clad in a long white robe and a white skullcap and throned on white pillows he made rather a royal figure indeed for this night of nights conceived of himself as king and his wife as queen but queen golda despite her silk gown and flowery cap did not share her consorts majestic mood still less the rosy happiness of the children who sat round this fascinating board her heart was full of a whispering fear that not all the brave melodies of the father nor all the quaint family choruses could drown all very well for the little ones to be unconscious of the hovering shadow but how could her husband have forgotten the horrors of the blood accusation in the very year he had led her under the canopy and surely he knew as well as she that the dreadful legend was gathering again that the slowlygrowing jewhatred had reached a point at which it must find expression that the pritzim nobles in their great houses and the peasants behind their high palings alike sulked under the burden of debts indeed had not the passover market hummed with the old old story of a lost christian child not murdered yet thank god nor even a corpse but still if a boy should be found with signs of violence upon him at this season of the paschal sacrifice when the greek church brooded on the crucifixion o god of abraham guard us from these fiends unchained but the first part of the elaborate ritual pleasantly punctuated with cups of raisin wine passed peacefully by and the evening meal mercifully set in the middle was reached to the childrens vast content they made wry humorous mouths each jest endeared by annual repetition over the horseradish that typified the bitterness of the egyptian bondage and ecstatic grimaces over the soft sweet mixture of almonds raisins apples and cinnamon vaguely suggestive of the bondsmens mortar they relished the eggs sliced into salt water and thenthe symbols all duly swallowedsettled down with more prosaic satisfaction to the merely edible meats and fishes though even to these the special passover plates and dishes and the purified knives and forks lent a new relish by this time golda was sufficiently cheered up to meditate her annual theft of the afkuman that segment of passover cake under aarons pillow morsels of which distributed to each as the final food to be tasted that night replaced the final mouthful of the paschal lamb in the ancient palestinian meal ii but elijahs goblet stood in the centre of the table untasted every time the ritual cupdrinking came round the children had glanced at the great silver goblet placed for the prophet of redemption alas the brimming raisin wine remained ever at the same level they found consolation in the thought that the great moment was still to comethe moment of the third cup when mother throwing open the door father would rise holding the goblet on high and sonorously salute an unseen visitor true in other years though they had almost heard the rush of wings the great shining cup had remained full and when it was replaced on the white cloth a vague resentment as at a spurned hospitality had stirred in each youthful breast but many reasons could be found to exculpate elijahnot omitting their own sinsand now when ben amram nodded to his wife to open the door expectation stood on tiptoe credulous as ever and the young hearts beat tattoo but the mothers heart was palpitating with another emotion a faint clamour in the polish quarter at the back as she replaced the samovar in the kitchen had recalled all her alarms and she merely threw open the door of the room but ben amram was not absentminded enough to be beguiled by her air of obedient alacrity besides he could see the shut streetdoor through the strip of passage he gestured towards it now she feigned laziness oh never mind david open the streetdoor the eldest boy sprang up joyously it would have been too bad of mother to keep elijah on the doorstep no no david golda stopped him it is too heavy he could not undo the bolts and bars you have barred it ben amram asked and why not in this season you know how the heathen go mad like streetdogs pooh they will not bite us but aaron you heard about the lost christian child i have saved many a christian child golda they will not remember that but i must remember the ritual and he made a movement no no aaron listen the shrill noises seemed to have veered round towards the front of the house he shrugged his shoulders i hear only the goats bleating she clung to him as he made for the door for the sake of our children do not be so childish yourself my crown but i am not childish hark he smiled calmly the door must be opened her fears lent her scepticism it is you that are childish you know no prophet of redemption will come through the door he caressed his venerable beard who knows i know it is a destroyer not a redeemer of israel who will come listen ah god of abraham do you not hear unmistakably the howl of a riotous mob was approaching mingled with the reedy strains of an accordion down with the zhits death to the dirty jews god in heaven she released her husband and ran towards the children with a gesture as of seeking to gather them all in her arms then hearing the bolts shot back she turned with a scream are you mad aaron but he holding her back with his gaze threw wide the door with his left hand while his right upheld elijahs goblet and over the ululation of the unseen mob and the shrill spasms of music rose his hebrew welcome to the visitor baruch habaa hardly had the greeting left his lips when a wild flying figure in a rich furred coat dashed round the corner and almost into his arms halfspilling the wine in gods name reb aaron panted the refugee and fell halfdead across the threshold the physician dragged him hastily within and slammed the door just as two moujiksdrunken leaders of the chaselurched past the mother who had sprung forward at the sound of the fall frenziedly shot the bolts and in another instant the hue and cry tore past the house and dwindled in the distance ben amram raised the white bloody face and put elijahs goblet to the lips the strange visitor drained it to the dregs the clustered children looking on dazedly as the head fell back it caught the light from the festive candles of the passover board the face was bare of hair even the side curls were gone maimon the meshummad cried the mother shuddering back you have saved the apostate did i not say the door must be opened replied ben amram gently then a smile of humour twitched his lips and he smoothed his white beard maimon is the only jew abroad tonight and how were the poor drunken peasants to know he was baptized despite their thrill of horror at the traitor david and his brothers and sisters were secretly pleased to see elijahs goblet empty at last iii next morning the passover liturgy rang jubilantly through the vast crowded synagogue no violence had been reported despite the passage of a noisy mob the ghetto then was not to be laid waste with fire and sword and the worshippers within the mossgrown turreted quadrangle drew free breath and sent it out in great shouts of rhythmic prayer as they swayed in their fringed shawls with quivering hands of supplication the ark of the law at one end of the great building overbrooded by the ten commandments and the perpetual light stood open to mark a supreme moment of devotion ben amram had been given the honour of uncurtaining the shrine and its richly clad scrolls of all sizes with their silver bells and pointers stood revealed in solemn splendour through the ornate grating of their gallery the gailyclad women looked down on the rocking figures while the gracenotes of the cantor on his central dais and the harmoniously interjected poms of his male ministrants flew up to their ears as though they were indeed angels on high suddenly over the blended passion of cantor and congregation an ominous sound broke from withoutthe complex clatter of cavalry the curt ring of military orders the swaying figures turned suddenly as under another wind the womens eyes grew astare and ablaze with terror the great doors flew open andoh awful incredible sighta squadron of cossacks rode slowly in two abreast with a heavy thud of hoofs on the sacred floor and a rattle of ponderous sabres their black conical caps and long beards their great sidebuttoned coats and pockets stuffed with protrusive cartridges their prancing horses their leaded knouts struck a bloodcurdling discord amid the prayerful whitewrapped figures the rumble of worship ceased the cantor suddenly isolated was heard soaring ecstatically then he too turned his head uneasily and his roulade died in his throat halt the officer cried the moving column froze its bristling length stretched from the central platform blocking the aisle and the courtyard echoed with the clanging hoofs of its rear which backed into the school and the poorhouse the shamash beadle was seen to front the flamboyant invaders why does your excellency intrude upon our prayers to god the congregation felt its dignity return who would have suspected red judah of such couragesuch apt speech why the very rabbi was petrified the elders of the kahal stood dumb ben amram himself their spokesman to the government whose prayingshawl was embroidered with a silver band and whose coat was satin remained immovable between the pillars of the ark staring stonily at the brave beadle first of all for the boys blood the words rang out with military precision and the speakers horse pawed clangorously as if impatient for the charge the men grew deathpale the women wrung their hands ai vai they moaned woe woe what boy what blood said the shamash undaunted dont palter you rascal you know well that a christian child has disappeared the aged rabbi stimulated by the shamash uplifted a quavering voice the child will be found of a suretyif indeed it is lost he added with bitter sarcasm and surely your excellency cannot require the boys blood at our hands ere your excellency knows it is indeed spilt you misunderstand me old dogor rather you pretend to old fox the boys blood is hereit is kept in this very synagogueand i have come for it the shamash laughed explosively oh excellency the synagogue hysterically tense caught the contagion of glad relief it rang with strange laughter there is no blood in this synagogue excellency said the rabbi his eyes atwinkle save what runs in living veins we shall see produce that bottle beneath the ark that the shamash grinnedalmost indecorously that is the consecration winered as my beard quoth he ha ha the red consecration wine repeated the synagogue in a happy buzz and from the womens gallery came the same glad murmur of mutual explanation we shall see repeated the officer with iron imperturbability and the happy hum died into a cold heartfaintness fraught with an almost incredulous apprehension of some devilish treachery some mock discovery that would give the ghetto over to the frenzies of fanatical creditors nay to the vengeance of the law the officers voice rose again let no one leave the synagogueman woman or child kill anyone who attempts to escape the screams of fainting women answered him from above but impassively he urged his horse along the aisle that led to the ark its noisy hoofs trampled over every heart springing from his saddle he opened the little cupboard beneath the scrolls and drew out a bottle hideously red consecration wine eh he said grimly what else excellency stoutly replied the shamash who had followed him a savage laugh broke from the officers lips drink me a mouthful as the shamash took the bottle with a fearless shrug of the shoulders every eye strained painfully towards him save in the womens gallery where many covered their faces with their hands every breath was held keeping the same amused incredulous face red judah gulped down a draught but as the liquid met his palate a horrible distortion overcame his smile his hands flew heavenwards dropping the bottle and with a hoarse cry mercy o god he fell before the ark foaming at the mouth the red fluid spread in a vivid pool hear o israel a raucous cry of horror rose from all around and was echoed more shrilly from above almighty father the jewhaters had worked their fiendish trick now the men were become as the women shrieking wringing their hands crying ai vai gewalt the rabbi shook as with palsy satan satan chattered through his teeth but ben amram had moved at last and was stooping over the scarlet stain a soldier should know blood excellency the physician said quietly the officers face relaxed into a faint smile a soldier knows wine too he said sniffing and indeed the spicy reek of the consecration wine was bewildering the nearer bystanders your excellency frightened poor judah into a fit said the physician raising the beadles head by its long red beard his excellency shrugged his shoulders sprang to his saddle and cried a retreat the cossacks unable to turn in the aisle backed cumbrously with a manifold thudding and rearing and clanking but ere the congregation had finished rubbing their eyes the last conical hat and leaded knout had vanished and only the tarry reek of their boots was left in proof of their actual passage a deep silence hung for a moment like a heavy cloud then it broke in a torrent of ejaculations but ben amrams voice rang through the din brethren he rose from wiping the frothing lips of the stricken creature and his face had the fiery gloom of a seers and the din died under his uplifted palm brethren the lord hath saved us blessed be the name of the lord for ever and ever the rabbi began the phrase and the congregation caught it up in thunder but hearken how last night at the seder as i opened the door for elijah there entered maimon the meshummad twas he quaffed elijahs cup there was a rumble of imprecations a pretty elijah cried the rabbi nay but god sends the prophet of redemption in strange guise the physician said listen maimon was pursued by a drunken mob ignorant he was a deserter from our camp when he found how i had saved him and dressed his bleeding face when he saw the spread passover table his childsoul came back to him and in a burst of tears he confessed the diabolical plot against our community hatched through his instrumentality by some desperate debtors how having raised the cry of a lost child they were to have its blood found beneath our holy ark as in some mystic atonement and while you all lolled joyously at the seder table a bottle of blood lay here instead of the consecration wine like a bomb waiting to burst and destroy us all a shudder of awe traversed the synagogue but the guardian of israel who permits us to sleep on passover night without nightprayer neither slumbers nor sleeps maimon had bribed the shamash to let him enter the synagogue and replace the consecration wine red judah it was like the growl of ten thousand tigers some even precipitated themselves upon the writhing wretch back back cried ben amram the almighty has smitten him vengeance is mine saith the lord quoted the rabbi solemnly hallelujah shouted a frenzied female voice and hallelujah the men responded in thunder red judah had no true belief in the god of israel the physician went on may he be an atonement for us all interrupted the cantor amen growled the congregation for a hundred roubles and the promise of personal immunity red judah allowed maimon the meshummad to change the bottles while all israel sat at the seder it was because the mob saw the meshummad stealing out of the synagogue that they fell upon him for a pious jew behold brethren how the almighty weaves his threads together after the repentant sinner had confessed all to me and explained how the cossacks were to be sent to catch all the community assembled helpless in synagogue i deemed it best merely to get the bottles changed back again the false bottle contained only bullocks blood but it would have sufficed to madden the multitude since it is i who have the blessed privilege of supplying the consecration wine it was easy enough to give maimon another bottle and armed with this he roused the shamash in the dawn pretending he had now obtained true human blood a rouble easily procured him the keys again and when he brought me back the bullocks blood i awaited the sequel in peace praise ye the lord for he is good sang the cantor carried away for his mercy endureth for ever replied the congregation instinctively i did not foresee the shamash would put himself so brazenly forward to hide his guilt or that he would be asked to drink but when the epikouros atheist put the bottle to his lips expecting to taste blood and found instead good red wine doubtless he felt at once that the god of israel was truly in heaven that he had wrought a miracle and changed the blood back to wine and such a miracle god wrought verily cried the rabbi grasping the physicians hand while the synagogue resounded with cries of may thy strength increase and the gallery heaved frantically with blessings and congratulations what wonder the physician wound up as he bent again over the ghastly head with its pious ringlets writhing like red snakes that he fell stricken by dread of the almightys wrath and while men were bearing the convulsive form without the cantor began to recite the grace after redemption and then the happy hymns rolled out and the choristers cried pom and a breath of jubilant hope passed through the synagogue the mighty hand and the outstretched arm which had redeemed israel from the egyptian bondage were still hovering over them nor would the prophet elijah for ever delay to announce the ultimate messiah the hirelings the hirelings i crowded as was the steamer with cultured americans invading europe few knew that rozenoffski was on board or even that rozenoffski was a pianist the name casually seen on the passengers list conveyed nothing but a strong russian and a vaguer semitic flavour and the mere outward man despite a leonine head was of insignificant port and somewhat shuffling gait and drew scarcely a second glance he would not have had it otherwise he told himself as he paced the almost deserted deck after dinnerit was a blessing to escape from the perpetual adulation of musicsick matrons and schoolgirlsbut every wounded fibre in him was yearning for consolation after his american failure not that his fellowpassengers were aware of his failure he had not put himself to the vulgar tests his american expedition had followed the lines recommended to him by friendly connoisseursto come before the great public if at all only after being launched by great hostesses at small parties to which end he had provided himself with unimpeachable introductions to unexceptionable ladies from irresistible personalitiesa german grand duke a bulgarian ambassador countesses both french and italian and even a belgian princess but to his boundless amazementfor he had always heard that americans were wax before titlesnot one of the social leaders had been of the faintest assistance to him not even the owner of the chicago palace to whom he had been recommended by the belgian princess he had penetrated through one or two esoteric doors only to find himself outside them again not once had he been asked to play it was some weeks before it even dawned upon the minor prophet of european musicrooms that he was being shut out still longer before it permeated to his brain that he had been shut out as a jew those barbarous americans so far behind europe after all had they not even discovered that art levels all ranks and races poor bourgeois moneymongers with their mushroom civilization it was not even as if he were really a jew did they imagine he wore phylacteries or earlocks or what his few childish years in the russian palewhat were they to the long years of european art and european culture and even if in rome or paris he had foregathered with jews like schneemann or leopold barstein it was to the artist in them he had gravitated not the jew did these yankee ignoramuses suppose he did not share their aversion from the gaberdine or the three brass balls oh the narrowsouled antisemites the decksteward stacked the chairs piled up the forgotten rugs and novels tidying the deck for the night but still the embittered musician tramped to and fro under the silent stars only from the smokingroom where the amateur auctioneer was still hilariously selling the numbers for a sweepstake came sounds in discord with the solemnity of sky and sea and the artist was newly jarred at this vulgar gaiety flung in the face of the spacious and starry mystery of the night and these jocose heavyjowled smokesoused gamblers were the americans whose drawingrooms he would contaminate he recalled the only party to which he had been askedto meet the bright lightsand which to his amazement turned out to be a quasipublic entertainment with the guests seated in rows in a hall and himselfwith the other bright lightsplanted on a platform and made to perform without a fee the mean vulgarians but perhaps it was better they had left him untainted with their dollarsbetter comparatively poor though he was that america should have meant pure loss to him he had at least kept the spiritual satisfaction of despising the despiser the dignity of righteous resentment the artists pride in the profitless and this riot of ugliness and diamonds and thirdrate celebrities was the fashionable society to which forsooth the jew could not be permitted access the aroma of an expensive cigar wafted towards him and the face between whose prominent teeth it was stuck loomed vividly in the glare of an electric light rozenoffski recognised those teeth he had seen countless pictures and caricatures of them for did they not almost hold the globe in their grip this then was the notorious multimillionaire the napoleon in dollars as a wit had summed him up and the first sight of andrew p wilhammer almost consoled the player for his poverty who even for an imperial income would bear the burden of those grotesque teeth protruding like a sample of wares in a dentists showcase but as the teeth came nearer and the great rubicund face bore down upon him the prominence of the notorious incisors affected him less than their carnivorous capacityhe felt himself almost swallowed up by this monstrous beast of prey so admirably equated to our small day of large things to that environment in which he poor degenerate artist was but a little singingbird the longforgotten word rishus came suddenly into his mindwas not the mans antisemitism as obtruded as his teethrishus that wicked malice which to a persecuted people had become almost a synonym for christianity he had left the thought behind him as he had left the hebrew word while he went sailing up into the rosy ether of success and rishus had sunk into the mere panicword of the ghettos stunted brood shrinking and quivering before phantasms sinuously gliding through a misunderstood world if it was not indeed rather a word conveniently cloaking from themselves a multitude of their own sins but now as incarnated in this millionaire mammoth the shadowy word took on a sudden solidity to which his teeth gave the necessary tearing and rending significance yes in very soothhe remembered it suddenlywas it not this mans wife on whom he had built his main hopes was she not the leader of musical america to whom the belgian princess had given him the scented and crested note of introduction which was to open to him all doors and all ears was it not in her marvellous marble musicroomone of the boasts of chicagothat he had mentally seen himself enthroned as the lord of the feast and instead of these olympian visions lo a typewritten note to clench his fist overa note from a secretary regretting that the state of mrs wilhammers health forbade the pleasure of receiving a maestro with such credentials rishusrishus indubitable ii turning with morbid interest to look after the retreating millionaire he found him in converse with a feminine figure at the open door of a deckcabin could this be the great she the arbitress of art he moved nearer why this was but a girlnay unless his instinct was at fault a jewish girla glorious young jewess of that radiant redhaired type which the russian pale occasionally flowered with what was she doing with this christian colossus he tried vainly to see her left hand the mere possibility that she might be mrs wilhammer shocked his semitic instinct wilhammer disappeared withinthe relation was obviously intimatebut the girl still stood at the door a brooding magical figure almost a sense of brotherhood moved him to speak to her but he conquered the abnormal and incorrect impulse contenting himself to walk past her with a sideglance while at the end of the deckpromenade instead of returning on his footsteps he even arched his path round to the windy side after some minutes of buffeting he returned chilled to his prior pacing ground she was still there but had moved under the same electric light which had illuminated wilhammers face and she was reading a letter as his walk carried him past her he was startled to see tears rolling down those radiant cheeks a slight exclamation came involuntarily from him the girl even more startled to be caught thus relaxed her grip of the lettera puff of wind hastened to whirl it aloft rozenoffski grasped at it desperately but it eluded him and then descending sailed sternwards he gave chase stumbling over belated chairs and deckquoits but at last it was safe in his clutch and as he handed it to the agitated owner whom he found at his elbow he noted with a thrill that the characters were cursive hebrew how can i zank you sir her teutonictouched american gave him the courage to reply gallantly in german by letting me help you more seriously ach mein herrshe jumped responsively into germanit was for joy i was crying not sorrow as her american was germanic so was her german like the yiddish of his remote youth and this adding to the sweetness of her voice dissolved the musicians heart within his breast he noted now with satisfaction that her fingers were bare of rings then i am rejoiced too he ventured to reply she smiled pathetically and began to walk back towards her cabin with us jews she said tears and laughter are very close us jews he winced a little it was so long since he had been thus classed to his face by a stranger but perhaps he had misinterpreted her phrase it was her way of referring to her race not necessarily to his it is a beautiful night he murmured uneasily but he only opened wider the floodgates of racefeeling yes she replied simply and such a heaven of stars is beginning to arise over the night of israel is it not wonderfulthe transformation of our people when i left russia as a girlso young she interpolated with a sad smile that i had not even been marriedi left a priestridden paralysed people a cringing cowering contorted peoplei shall never forget the panic in our synagogue when a troop of cossacks rode in with a bogus bloodaccusation now it is a people alive with ideas and volitions the young generation dreams noble dreams and what is stranger dies to execute them our bund is the soul of the russian revolution our selfdefence bands are bringing back the days of judas maccabaeus in the olden times of massacre our people fled to the synagogues to pray now they march to the fight like men they had arrived at her door and she ended suddenly the musician fascinated feared she was about to fade away within but jews cant fight he cried halfincredulous half to arrest her not fight she held up the hebrew letter they have scouts ambulance corps orderlies surgeons everythingmy cousin david ben amram who is little more than a boy was told off to defend a large threestory house inhabited by the families of factorylabourers who were at work when the pogrom broke out the poor frenzied women and children had barricaded themselves within at the first rumour and hidden themselves in cellars and attics my cousin had to climb to their defence over the neighbouring tiles and through a window in the roof soon the house was besieged by police troops and hooligans in devilish league with his one browning revolver david held them all at bay firing from every window of the house in turn so as to give the besiegers an impression of a large defensive force at last his cartridges were exhaustedto procure cartridges is the greatest difficulty of our selfdefence corpsthey began battering in the big frontdoor david seeing further resistance was useless calmly drew back the bolts to the mobs amaze and as it poured in he cried back back they have bombs and rushed into the street as if to escape the explosion the others followed wildly and in the panic david ran down a dark alley and disappeared in search of a new post of defence though the door stood open and the cowering inhabitants were at their mercy the assailants afraid to enter remained for over an hour at a safe distance firing at the house till it was riddled with bullets they counted nearly two hundred the next day embedded in the walls or strewn about the rooms and not a thing had been stolennot a hooligan had dared enter but david is only a type of the young generationthere are hundreds of davids equally ready to take the field against goliath and shall i not rejoice shall i not exult even unto tears her eyes glowed and the musician was kindled to equal fire it seemed to him less a girl who was speaking than truth and purity and some dead muse of his own the pale that i left she went on was truly a prison but nownow it will be the forgingplace of a regenerated people oh i am counting the days till i can be back you are going back to russia he gasped he had the sensation of cold steel passing through his heart the pogroms which had been as remote to him as the squabbles of savages in central africa became suddenly vivid and near and even vivider and nearer that greater dangerthe heroic cousin david how can i live away from russia at such a moment she answered quietly who or what needs me in america but to be massacred he cried incoherently she smiled radiantly to live and die with my own people the fire in his veins seemed upleaping in a sublime jet he was like to crying thy people shall be my people but all he found himself saying was you must not you must not what can a girl like you do a bell rang sharply from the cabin i must go to my mistress gute nacht mein herr his flame sank to sudden ashes only mrs wilhammers hireling iii the wind freshened towards the middle of the night and rozenoffski rocking in his berth cursed his encounter with the redhaired romanticist who had stirred up such a pother in his brain that he had not been able to fall asleep while the water was still calm not that he suffered physically from the sea he was merely afraid of it the shuddering and groaning of the ship found an echo in his soul he could not shake off the conviction that he was doomed to drown at intervals during the tedious night he found forgetfulness in translating into sound his sense of the mystic masterless waste in which the continents swim like islands but music was soon swallowed up in terror no he sighed with a touch of selfmockery when i am safe on shore again i shall weave my symphony of the sea sleep came at last but only to perturb him with a jewish joan of arc whoturned admiralrecaptured zion from her battleship to the sound of psalms droned by his dead grandfather and though he did not see her the next day and was indeed rather glad not to meet a ladys maid in the unromantic daylight the restlessness she had engendered remained replacing the settled bitterness which was all he had brought back from america in the afternoon this restlessness drove him to the piano in the deserted dininghall and his fever sought to work itself off in a fury of practice but the inner turbulence persisted and the new thoughts clung round the old music he was playing schumanns fantasiestuecke but through the stormy passion of in der nacht he saw the red hair of the heroic jewess and into the wistful questioning warum insinuated itself not the worldquestion but the jewish questionthe sad unending jewish questionsurging up again and again in every part of the globe as schumanns theme in every part of the pianothe same haunting musical figure never the same notes exactly yet essentially always the same the wistful questioning warum why all this ceaseless sorrow this footsore wandering this rootless life this eternal curse suddenly he became aware that he was no longer aloneforms were seated at the tables on the fixed diningchairs though there was no meal but his music and as he played on with swift sidepeeps other fellowpassengers entered into his consciousness some standing about others hovering on the stairs and still others stealing in on reverent tiptoe and taking favourable seats his breast filled with bitter satisfaction so they had to come the arrogant americans they had to swarm like rats to the pied piper he could draw them at will the haughty heathendraw them by the magic of his fingertouch on pieces of ivory lo they were coming more and more of them through the corner of his eye he espied the figures drifting in from the corridors peering in spellbound at the doors with a great crash on the keys he shook off his morbid mood and plunged into scarlattis sonata in a his fingers frolicking all over the board bent on a dominating exhibition of technique as he stopped there was a storm of handclapping rozenoffski gave a masterly start of surprise and turned his leonine head in dazed bewilderment was he not then alone gott im himmel he murmured and furiously banging down the pianolid stalked from these presumptuous mortals who had jarred the artists soliloquy but the next afternoon found him again at the public piano devoting all the magic of his genius to charming a contemptible christendom he gave them beethoven and bach paradies and tschaikowski unrolled to them the vast treasures of his art and memory and very soon lo the christian rats were pattering back again only more wisely and cautiously they came crawling from every part of the ships compass newcomers were warned whisperingly to keep from applause in vain an enraptured greenhorn shouted encore the musician awoke from his trance stared dreamily at the philistines then as the presence of listeners registered itself upon his expressive countenance he rose againbut this time as more in sorrow than in angerand stalked sublimely up the swarming stairs it became a tradition to post guards at the doors to warn all comers as to the habits of the great unknown who could only beat his music out if he imagined himself unheard scouts watched his afternoon advance upon the piano in an empty hall and the word was passed to the little army of musiclovers silently the rats gathered scurrying in on noiseless paws stealing into the chairs swarming about the doorways pricking up their ears in the corridors and through the awful hush rose the masters silvery notes in rapturous selfoblivion till the day began to wane and the stewards to appear with the teacups and the larger his audience grew the fiercer grew his resentment against this complacent christendom which took so much from the jew and gave so little shylocks he would mutter between his clenched teeth as he playedshylocks all iv with no less punctuality did rozenoffski pace the silent deck each night in the hope of again meeting the redhaired jewess he had soon recovered from her menial office indeed the paradox of her position in so antisemitic a household quickened his interest in her he wondered if she ever listened to his playing or had realized that she had entertained an angel unawares but three nights passed without glimpse of her nor was her mistress more visible the wilhammers kept royally to themselves in their palatial suite though the husband sometimes deigned to parade his fangs in the smokingroom where with the luck of the rich he won heavily in the pools it was not till the penultimate night of the voyage that rozenoffski caught his second glimpse of his redhaired muse he had started his nocturnal pacing much earlier than usual for the inevitable concert on behalf of marine charities had sucked the loungers from their steamerchairs he had himself of course been approached by the programmeorganizer a bouncing actress from frisco with an irresistible air but he had defeated her hopelessly with the mysterious sarcasm to meet the bright lights and his reward was to have the deck and the heavens almost to himself and presently to find the stars outgleamed by a girls hair yes there she was gazing pensively forth from the cabin window he guessed the mistress was out for oncepresumably at the concert his heart beat faster as he came to a standstill yet the reminder that she was a ladys maid brought an involuntary note of condescension into his voice i hope mrs wilhammer hasnt been keeping you too imprisoned he said she smiled faintly not so close as neptune has kept her ill he said with a shade of malicious satisfaction it is curious and even consoling to see the limitations of croesus she replied but she is luckyshe just recovered in time in time for what cant you hear indeed the shrill notes of an amateur soprano had been rending the air throughout but they had scarcely penetrated through his exaltation he now shuddered do you mean it is she singing the girl laughed outright she sing no no she is a sensitive receiver she receives she gives out nothing she exploits her soul as her husband exploits the globe there isnt a sensation or an emotion she denies herselfunless it is painful it was to escape the concert that she has left her couchand sought refuge in a friends cabin you see here sound travels straight from the dininghall and a false note she says gives her nerveache then she cant return till the close of the concert he said eagerly wont you come outside and walk a bit under this beautiful moon she came out without a word with the simplicity of a comrade yes it is a beautiful night she said and very soon i shall be in russia but is mrs wilhammer going to russia then he asked with a sudden thought wondering that it had never occurred to him before of course not i only joined her for this voyage i have to work my passage you see and providence on the eve of sailing robbed mrs wilhammer of her maid oh he murmured in relief his redhaired muse was going back to her social pedestal but you must have found it humiliating he said humiliating she laughed cheerfully why more than manicuring her the muse shivered again on the pedestal manicuring he echoed in dismay sure she laughed in american when after a course of starvation and medicine at berne university i found i had to get a new degree for america you are a doctor he interrupted and therefore peculiarly serviceable as a shipmaid she smiled again and her smile in the moonlight reminded him of a rippling passage of chopin prosaic enough however was what she went on to tell him of her struggle for life by day and for learning by night of course i could only attend the night medical school i lived by lining cloaks with fur my bed was the corner of a room inhabited by a whole family a wouldbe graduate could not be seen with bundles for fetching and carrying the work my good landlady extorted twenty cents to the dollar when the fur season was slack i cooked in a restaurant worked a typewriter became a hello girlat a telephone you knowreported murder casesanything everything manicuring he recalled tenderly manicuring she repeated smilingly and you ask me if it is humiliating to wait upon an artistic seasick lady artistic he sneered his heart was full of pity and indignation as surely as seasick she rejoined laughingly why are you prejudiced against her he flushed prejprejudiced he stammered why should i be prejudiced from all i hear its she thats prejudiced its a wonder she took a jewess into her service wheres the wonder dont the southerners have negro servants she asked quietly his flush deepened you compare jews to negroes i apologize to the negroes the blacks have at least liberia there is a black president a black parliament we have nothing nothing we again that ambiguous plural but he still instinctively evaded coclassification nothing he retorted i should have said everything every gift of genius that nature can shower from her cornucopia jewish geniuses her voice had a stinging inflection dont talk to me of our geniuses it is they that have betrayed us every other people has its great men but our great menthey belong to every other people the world absorbs our sap and damns us for our putrid remains our best must pipe alien tunes and dance to the measures of the heathen they build and paint they write and legislate but never a song of israel do they fashion nor a picture of israel nor a law of israel nor a temple of israel bah what are they but hirelings again the passion of her patriotism uplifted and enkindled him yes it was true he too was but a hireling but he would become a master he would go backback to the ghetto and this noble jewess should be his mate thank god he had kept himself free for her but ere he could pour out his soul the bouncing san franciscan actress appeared suddenly at his elbow risking a last desperate assault discharging a pathetic tale of a comedian with a cold rozenoffski repelled the attack savagely but before he could exhaust the enemys volubility his redhaired companion had given him a friendly nod and smile and retreated into her shrine of duty v he spent a sleepless but happy night planning out their future together her redemption from her hireling status their joint work for their people he was no longer afraid of the sea he was afraid of nothingnot even of the pogroms that awaited them in russia russia itself became dear to him againthe beautiful land of his boyhood whose birds and whispering leaves and waters had made his earliest music but dearer than all resurged his jewish memories when he went almost mechanically to the piano on the last afternoon all these slumbering forces wakened in him found vent in a rhapsody of synagogue melody to which he abandoned himself for once forgetting his audience when gradually he became aware of the incongruity it did but intensify his inspiration let the heathen rats wallow in hebrew music but soon all selfconsciousness passed away again drowned in his deeper self it was a strange fantasia that poured itself through his obedient fingers it held the wistful chants of ancient ritual the festival roulades and plaintive yearnings of melodious cantors the singsong augmentation of talmudstudents oscillating in airless studyhouses the long melancholy drone of psalmsingers in darkening sabbath twilights the rustle of palmbranches and sobbings of penitence the longdrawn notes of the rams horn pealing through the terrible days the passionate proclamation of the unity storming the gates of heaven and fused with these merely physical memories there flowed into the music the peace of sabbath evenings and shining candles the love and wonder of childhoods faith the fantasy of rabbinic legend the weirdness of penitential prayers in raw winter dawns the holy joy of the promised zion when god would wipe away the tears from all faces there were tears to be wiped from his own face when he ended and he wiped them brazenly unresentful of the frenzied approval of the audience which now let itself go out of storedup gratitude and because this must be the last performance all his vanity his artistic posing was swallowed up in utter sincerity he did not shut the piano he sat brooding a moment or two in tender reverie suddenly he perceived his redhaired muse at his side ah she had discovered him at last knew him simultaneously for the genius and the patriot was come to pour out her soul at his feet but why was she mute why was she tendering this scented letter was it because she could not trust herself to speak before the crowd he tore open the delicate envelope himmel what was this would the maestro honour mrs wilhammer by taking tea in her cabin he stared dazedly at the girl who remained respectful and silent did you not hear what i was playing he murmured oh yesa synagogue medley she replied quietly they publish it on the east side nicht wahr east side he was outraged i know nothing of east side her absolute unconsciousness of his spiritual tumult her stolidity before this spectacle of his triumphant genius her matteroffact acceptance of his racial affinity her refusal to be impressed by the heroism of a hebrew pianoforte solo all she said and did not say jarred upon his quivering nerves chilled his high emotion will you say i shall have much pleasure he added coldly the redhaired maid nodded and was gone rozenoffski went mechanically to his cabin scarcely seeing the worshippers he plodded through presently he became aware that he was changing his linen brushing his best frockcoat thrilling with pleasurable excitement anon he was tapping at the wellknown door a voiceof another sweetnesscried come and instantly he had the sensation that his touch on the handle had launched upon him as by some elaborate electric contrivance a tall and beautiful american a rustling teagown a shimmer of rings a reek of patchouli and a flood of compliment so delightful of you to comei know you men of genius are farouchesit was awfully insolent of me i know but you have forgiven me havent you the pleasure is mine gracious lady he murmured in german ach so you are a german she replied in the same tongue i thought no american or englishman could have so much divine fire you see mein herr i do not even know your nameonly your genius every afternoon i have lain here lapped in your music but i might never have had the courage to thank you had you not played that marvellous thing just nowsuch delicious heartbreak such adorable gaiety and now and then the thunder of the gods im afraid youll think me very ignorantit wasnt grieg was it he looked uncomfortable nothing so good i feara mere impromptu of my own your own she clapped her jewelled hands in girlish delight oh where can i get it east side some mocking demon tried to reply but he crushed her down and replied uneasily you cant get it it just came to me this afternoon it cameand it has gone what a pity but she was visibly impressed by this fecundity and riotous extravagance of genius i do hope you will try to remember it impossibleit was just a mood and to think of all the other moods i seem to have missed why have i not heard you in america he grew red ii havent been playing there he murmured you see im not much known outside a few european circles then summoning up all his courage he threw down his name rozenoffski like a bomb and the red of his cheeks changed to the pallor of apprehension but no explosion followed save of enthusiasm evidently the episode so lurid to his own memory had left no impress on hers oh but america must know you herr rozenoffski you must promise me to come back in the fall give me the glory of launching you and seeing the cloud on his face she cried you must you must you must clapping her hands at each must he hesitated distracted between rapture and anxiety lest she should remember you have never heard of me of course she persisted humbly but positively everybody has played at my house in chicago ach so he muttered had he perhaps misinterpreted and magnified the attitude of these americans was it possible that mrs wilhammer had really been too ill to see him she looked frail and feverish behind all her brilliant beauty or had she not even seen his letter had her secretary presumed to guard her from semitic invaders or was she deliberately choosing to forget and forgive his jewishness in any case best let sleeping dogs lie he was being sought it would be the silliest of social blunders to recall that he had already been rejected it is years since chicago had a real musical sensation pleaded the temptress im afraid my engagements will not permit me to return this autumn he replied tactfully do you take sugar she retorted unexpectedly then as she handed him his cup she smiled archly into his eyes you cant shake me off you know i shall follow you about europeto all your concerts when he left herafter inscribing his autograph his permanent munich address and the earliest possible date for his chicago concert in a dainty diary brought in by her redhaired maidhis whole being was swelling expanding he had burst the coils of this narrow tribalism that had suddenly retwined itself round him he had got back again from the fusty conventicles and the sunless ghettosback to spacious salons and radiant hostesses and the great free life of art he drew deep breaths of seaair as he paced the deck strewn so thickly with pleasant passengers to whom he felt drawn in a renewed sense of the human brotherhood rishus forsooth samooborona samooborona i milovka was to be the next place reddened on the map of holy russia the news of the projected jewish massacre in this little polish town travelled to the samooborona selfdefence headquarters in southern russia through the indiscretion of a village pope who had had a drop of blood too much it appeared that milovka though remote from the great centres of disturbance had begun to seethe with political activity and even to publish a newspaper so that it was necessary to show by a firstclass massacre that true russian men were still loyal to god and the czar milovka lay off the pogrom route and had not of itself caught the contagion careful injection of the virus was necessary moreover the town was twothirds jewish and consequently harder to fever with the lust of jewish blood but in revenge the pogrom would be easier the jewish quarter formed a practically separate town no asking of dvorniks janitors to point out the jewish apartments no arming ones self with photographs of the victims one had but to run amuck among these low wooden houses the humblest of which doubtless oozed with inexhaustible subterranean wealth david ben amram was hurriedly despatched to milovka to organize a local selfdefence corps he carried as many pistols as could be stowed away in a violincase which with a musicroll holding cartridges was an obtrusive feature of his luggage the winter was just beginning but mildly the sun shone over the broad plains and as davids train carried him towards milovka his heart swelled with thoughts of the maccabean deeds to be wrought there by a regenerated young israel but the journey was long towards the end he got into conversation with an old russian peasant who so far from sharing in the general political effervescence made a long lament over the good old days of serfdom then one had not to thinkone ate and drank now it is all toil and trouble but you were whipped at your lords pleasure david reminded him he was a nobleman retorted the peasant with dignity david fell silent the jew too had grown to kiss the rod but it was not even a noblemans rod any moujik any hooligan could wield it but thank heaven this breed of jew was passing awaykilled by the pogroms it was their one virtue at the station he hired a ramshackle droshky and told his jewish driver to take him to the best inn seated astride the oldfashioned bench of the vehicle and grasping his violincase like a loving musician as they jolted over the rough roads he broached the subject of the jewish massacres be commented the driver shrugging his shoulders we are in goluth exile he spoke with resignation but not with apprehension and david perceived at once that milovka would not be easy to arouse as every man thought every other man mortal so milovka regarded the massacres as a terrible realityfor other towns it was no longer even shocked kishineff had been a horror almost beyond belief but jewmassacres had since become part of the natural order which babes were born into ii the landlord shook his head all our rooms are full david still hugging his violincase looked at the dirty mustardsmeared tablecloth on the long table and at the hosts brats playing on the floor if this was the best what in heavens name awaited him elsewhere for how long he asked the landlord shrugged his shoulders like the driver am i the allknowing he wore a black velvet cap but not with the apex that would have professed piety its square cut indicated to the younger generation that he was a man of the world in touch with the times to the old its material and hue afforded sufficient guarantee of ritual orthodoxy he was a true host the friend of all who eat and drink but how many rooms have you inquired david and how many shall i have but one protested the landlord only one room david turned upon the driver and you said this was the best inn i suppose its your brotherinlaws and what do i make out of it if it is answered the driver you see he cant take you then why did you bring me because there is no room anywhere else either what david stared law of moses corroborated the landlord goodhumouredly youve just come at the recruiting the young men have flocked here from all the neighbouring villages to draw their numbers there are heathen peasants in all the jewish innseating kosher he added with a chuckle david frowned but he reflected instantly that if this was so the pogrom would probably be postponed till the christian conscripts had been packed off to their regiments or the lucky ones back to their villages he would have time therefore to organize his jewish corps yes he reflected in grim amusement russia and he would be recruiting simultaneously still where was he to sleep you can have the lezhanka said the host following his thoughts david looked ruefully at the high stove well there were worse beds in winter than the top of a stove and perhaps to bestow himself and his violin in such very public quarters would be the safest way of diverting police attention conspirators please copy he thought with a smile anyhow he was very tired he could refresh himself here the day was yet young time enough to find a better lodging bring in the luggage he said resignedly tea said the host hovering over the samovar havent you a drop of vodka the landlord held up hands of horror monopolka monopoly he cried havent they left any jewish licenses asked david not unless one mixed holy water with the vodka like the baptized benjamin said the landlord with grim humour he added hastily but his inn is even fuller than mine four beds in the room it appeared that the dinner was already over and david could obtain nothing but halfwarmed remains however hunger and hope gave sauce to the miserable meal and he profited by the absence of custom to pump the landlord anent the leading citizens but you will not get violin lessons from any of them his host warned him tinowitz the cornfactor has daughters who are said to read christian storybooks but is it likely he will risk their falling in love with a young man whose hair and clothes are cut like a christians not that i share his prejudices of course i have seen the great world and understand that it is possible to carry a handkerchief on the sabbath and still be a good man i havent come to give lessons in music said david bluntly but in shooting shooting the landlord stared arent you a jew then sir i beg your pardon his voice had suddenly taken on the same ring as when he addressed the poritz polish nobleman his oleaginous familiarity was gone salachti i have forgiven said david in hebrew and laughed at the mans bemused visage dont you think considering what has been happening it is high time the jews of milovka learned to shoot the landlord looked involuntarily round the room for a possible spy guard your tongue he murmured terrorstricken david laughed on you my friend shall be my first pupil god forbid and i must beg you to find other lodgings david smiled grimly at this first response to his mission i dare say i shall find another stove he said cheerfullyat which the landlord who had never in his life taken such a decisive step began to think he had gone too far you will take the advice of a man who knows the world he said in a tone of compromise and throw all those crazy notions into the river where you cast your sins at new year a young finelooking man like you why i can find you a shidduch marriage that will keep you in clover the rest of your life ha ha ha how do you know im not married married men dont go shooting so lightheartedly come let me take you in hand my commission is a very small percentage of the dowry ah so youre a regular shadchan marriagebroker and how else should i live do you think i get fat on this inn but people stay here from all towns around i get to know a great circle of marriageable parties i can show you a much larger stock than the ordinary shadchan but i am so link irreligious nu let your earlocks growthe dowry grows with them mine host had quite recovered his greasy familiarity i cant wait for my locks to grow said david with a sudden thought but if you care to introduce me to tinowitz you will not fail to profit by it if the thing turns out well the landlord rubbed his hands now you speak like a sage iii tinowitz read the landlords hebrew note and surveyed the suitor disapprovingly and disapproval did not improve his facea face in whose grotesque features david read a possible explanation of his surplus stock of daughters i cannot say i am very taken with you the cornfactor said nor is it possible to give you my youngest daughter i have other plans even the eldest david waved his hand i told my landlord as much am i a talmudsage that i should thus aspire forgive and forget my chutzpah impudence but the eldestperhapswith a smaller dowry to tell the truth panie tinowitz it was the landlord who turned my head with false hopes i came here not to promote marriages but to prevent funerals the cornfactor gasped funerals a pogrom is threatened open not your mouth to satan reprimanded tinowitz growing livid if you prefer silence and slaughter said david with a shrug it is impossiblehere and why not here as well as in the six hundred and thirtyeight other towns in those towns there must have been bad blood here jew and russian live together like brothers cain and abel were brothers there were many peaceful years while cain tilled the ground and abel pastured his sheep the biblical reference was more convincing to tinowitz than a wilderness of arguments then what do you propose came from his white lips to form a branch of the samooborona you must first summon a meeting of householders what for for a general committeeand for the expenses but how can we hold a meeting the police theres the synagogue profane the synagogue did not the jews always fly to the synagogue when there was danger yes but to pray we will pray by pistol guard your tongue guard your daughters the uppermost will guard them the uppermost guards them through me as he feeds them through you for the last time i ask you will you or will you not summon me a meeting of householders you rush like a wild horse i thank heaven you will not be my soninlaw tinowitz ended by demanding time to think it over david was to call the next day when after a sleepless night on the stove he betook himself to the cornfactors house he found it barred and shuttered the neighbours reported that tinowitz had gone off on sudden business taking his wife and daughters with him for a little jaunt iv the flight of tinowitz brought two compensations however david was promoted from the stove to the bedroom for the lodger he replaced had likewise departed hurriedly and when it transpired that the landlord had betrothed this young man to the second of the tinowitz girls david divined that the cornfactor had made sure of a soninlaw his other compensation was to find in the remaining bed a strapping young jew named ezekiel leven who had come up from an outlying village for the military lottery and who proved to be a carl after his own heart half the night the young heroes planned the deeds of derringdo they might do for their people ezekiel leven was indeed an ideal lieutenant for he belonged to one of the rare farming colonies and was already handy with his gun he had even some kinsfolk in milovka and by their aid the rabbi and a few householders were hurriedly prevailed upon to assemble in the bedroom on a business declared important ezekiel himself must unfortunately be away at the drawing but he promised to hasten back to the meeting each member strolled in casually ordered a glass of tea and drifted upstairs the landlord uneasily sniffing peril and profit and dismally apprehending pistol lessons left the inn to his wife and stole up likewise to the fateful bedroom here after protesting fearfully that they would ruin him by this conspirative meeting he added that he was not out of sympathy with the times and volunteered to stand sentinel accordingly he was posted at the ragged windowcurtain where with excess of caution he signalled whenever he saw a christian in uniform or no at every signal davids oratory ceased as suddenly as if it had been turned off at the main and the gaberdined figures distributed over the two beds and the one chair gripped one another nervously but david was used to oratory under difficulties he lived on the same terms with the police as the most desperate criminals and a foreigner who should have witnessed the secret meetings at which tactics were discussed arms distributed scouts despatched and nightwatches posted would have imagined him engaged in a rebellion instead of in an attempt to strengthen the forces of law and order he had come to milovka he explained to warn them that the black hundreds were soon to be loosed upon the jewish quarter but no longer must the jew go like a lamb to the shambles too long when smitten had he turned the other cheek only to get it smitten too they must defend themselves he was there to form a branch of the samooborona browning revolvers must be purchased the woodchoppers must be organized as a column of axebearers there would be needed also an ambulance corps with bandages dressings etc the shudder at the first mention of the pogrom was not so violent as that which followed the mention of bandages each man felt warm blood trickling down his limbs to what end then had he escaped the conscription the landlord at the window wiped the cold beads off his brow and was surprised to find his hand not scarlet brethren koski the timbermerchant burst out this is a haman in disguise to hold firearms is the surest way of provoking i dont say you shall hold firearms david interrupted it is your young men who must defend the town but the kahal congregation must pay the expensessay ten thousand roubles to start with ten thousand roubles for a few pistols cried mendel the horsedealer it is a swindle david flushed we have to buy three pistols for every one we get safely into the town but one revolver may save ten thousand roubles of property not to mention your life it will end our lives not save them persisted the timbermerchant this is a plot to destroy us a growl of assent burst from the others my friends said david quietly a plot to destroy you has already been hatched the question is are you going to be destroyed like rats or like men pooh said the horsedealer this is not the first time we have been threatened if not with death at least with extra taxes but we have always sent shtadlonim ambassadors we will make a collection and the president of the kahal shall go at once to the governor and present it to himhere mendel winkedto enable him to take measures against the pogrom the governor is in the plot said david he can be bought out said the timbermerchant pogroms are more profitable than presents rejoined david drily let us rather prepare bombs a fresh shudder traversed the beds and the chairs and agitated the windowcurtain bombs presents burst forth the old rabbi these are godless instruments we are in the hands of the holy oneblessed be he the shomer guardian of israel neither slumbereth nor sleepeth neither does the shochet slaughterer of israel said david savagely hush epicurean came from every quarter at this grim jest for the shomer and the shochet are the official twain of ritual butchery the landlord seeing how the tide was turning added brazen marshallik buffoon i will appoint a day of fasting and prayer concluded the rabbi solemnly a breath of reassurance wafted through the room and i rabbi said guetels the grocer will supply the synagogue with candles to equal in length the graves of all your predecessors may thy strength increase guetels came the universal gratitude and the landlord at the windowcurtain drew a great sigh of relief still gentlemen he said if i may intrude my humble opinionreb mendels advice is also good god is of course our only protection but there can be no harm in getting lehavdil not to compare them the governors protection too true true and the faces grew still cheerier in gods name wake up david burst forth in samooborona lies your only salvation give the money to us not to the governor we can meet and practise in your talmudtorah hall the holy hall of study gasped the rabbi given over to unlawful meetings the hooligans will meet there if you dont said david grimly dont you see it is the safest place for us the police associate it only with learned weaklings hush haman said the timbermerchant and rose to go davids voice changed to passion memories of things he had seen came over him as in a red mist an old man scalped with a sharp ladle a whitehot poker driven through a womans eye a babys skull ground under a true russians heel bourgeois he thundered i will save you despite yourselves the landlord signalled in a frenzy but david continued recklessly will you never learn manli they flung themselves upon him in a panic and held him handgagged and struggling upon the bed suddenly a new figure burst into the room there was a bloodfreezing instant in which all gave themselves up for lost their grip on david relaxed then the mist cleared and they saw it was only ezekiel leven blessed art thou who comest cried david jumping to his feet you and i ezekiel will save milovka alas ezekiel groaned i drew a low numberi go to fight for russia v fifteen thousand roubles were soon collected for the governor but even before they were presented to him the rabbi in mortal terror of that firebrand of a david had rushed to inquire whether selfdefence was legal and might the talmudtorah hall be legitimately used for drilling sharp came an order that jews found with firearms or in conclave for nonreligious purposes should be summarily shot and so when the shtadlonim arrived with the fifteen thousand roubles the governor was able to point out severely that if a pogrom did occur they would have only themselves to blame the jews of milovka had begun to carry pistols like revolutionaries they planned illegal assemblies in halls was it to be wondered at if the league of true russians grew restive however he would do his best with these inadequate roubles to have extra precautions taken but let them root out the evil weeds that had sprung up in their midst else even his authority might be overborne by the righteous indignation of the loyal children of the little father tremblingly the ambassadors crept back with their empty moneybags poor david now found it impossible to get anybody to a meeting his landlord had forbidden any more gatherings in the inn and his original audience would have called as a deputation upon david to beg him to withdraw from the town but that might have been considered a conspirative meeting so one of the ambassadors was sent to inform the landlord instead dont you think ive already ordered him off my premises but he is still here alas he threatens to shoot meor anybody who massers informs said the poor landlord the ambassador shivered as if i would betray a brotherinisrael added the landlord reproachfully no noof course not said the ambassador these fellows are best left alone they wear fuses under their waistcoats instead of tsitsith ritual fringes let us hope however a sudden death may rid us of him amen said the landlord fervently not that david had any reason for clinging to so squalid a hostel but his blood was up and he took a malicious pleasure in inflicting his perilous presence upon his prudential host reduced now to buttonholing individuals he consoled himself with the thought that the population was best tackled by units one fool or coward was enough to infect or betray a whole gathering still intent on the sinews of war he sallied out after breakfast and approached erbstein the banker erbstein held up his hands but ive just given a thousand roubles to guard us from a pogrom that was for the governor give me only a hundred for selfdefence the banker puffed tranquilly at his big cigar but our rights are bound to come in the end we can only get them gradually full rights now are nonsenseimpossible it is bad tactics to ask for what you cannot get only in common with russia can our emancipation i am not talking of our rights but of our lives david grew impatient being a banker erbstein never listened though he invariably replied his success in finance had made him an authority upon religion and politics trust the octobrists he said cheerily id rather trust our revolvers the bankers cigar fell from his mouth an anarchist like my nephew simon david began to realize the limitations of the financial intellect he saw that to get ideas into bankers brains is even more difficult than to get cheques from their pockets still there was that promising scapegrace simon he hurried out on his scent and ran him to earth in a cosy house near the town gate simon practised law it appeared and his surname was rubensky the young barrister informed of his uncles accusation of anarchism laughed contemptuously bourgeois every idea that makes no money he calls anarchy as a matter of fact im the exact opposite of an anarchist im a socialist i belong to the pps were not even revolutionary like the srs im afraid im a great ignoramus said david i dont even know what all these letters stand for simon rubensky looked pityingly as at a bourgeois srs are the silly social revolutionists i belong to the polish party of socialism ah said david with an air of comprehension and i belong to the jewish party of selfdefence i hope youll join it too the young lawyer shook his head a separate jewish party no no that would be putting back the clock of history the nonisolation of the jew is an unconditional historic necessity our emancipation must be worked out in common with russias oh then you agree with your uncle with that bourgeois never but we are poles of the mosaic faithjewish poles not polish jews the hooligans are murdering both impartially and the intellectuals equally rejoined simon but the intellectuals will triumph over the reactionaries said david passionately and then both will trample on the jews didnt the hungarian jews join kossuth and yet after hungarys freedom was won simons wife and sister here entered the room and he introduced david smilingly as a ghetto reactionary the young womensoberclad students from a swiss universityopened wide shocked eyes so young too simons wife murmured wonderingly would you have me stand by and see our people murdered certainly she said rather than see the zeitgeist set back the unconditional historic necessity will carry us on of itself towards a better social state there you go with your marx and your hegel cried simons sister i object to your historic materialism with fichte i assert she is an sr simon interrupted her to explain ah said david not a pps like you and your wife simon did you tell him i was a pps inquired his wife indignantly no no of course not a ghetto reactionary does not understand modern politics my wife is an sd i regret to say but i have heard of social democrats said david triumphantly simons sister sniffed of course because they are a bourgeois partyrisking nothing waiting passively till the revolution drops into their hands the name of bourgeois would be better applied to those who include the landed peasants among their forces said simons wife angrily if i might venture to suggest said david soothingly all these differences would be immaterial if you joined the samooborona i could make excellent use of you ladies in the ambulance department outrageous cried simon angrily our place is shoulder to shoulder with our fellowpoles simons sister intervened gently perhaps the mention of ambulances had awakened sympathy in her sr soul you ought to look among your own party she said my party the ghetto reactionarieszionists territorialists itoists or whatever they call themselves nowadays are there any here cried david eagerly one heard of nothing else cried simon bitterly fortunately when the police found they werent really emigrating to zion or uganda the meetings were stopped david eagerly took down names simon particularly recommended two young men grodsky and lerkoff who had at least the grace of socialism but grodsky david found had his own panacea only the sss he said can save israel what are sss david asked socialistes sionistes but cant there be socialism outside zion of course we have evolved from zionism the unconditional historic necessity is for a land but not for a particular land our minsk members already call themselves stssocialist territorialists but while awaiting your territory there are the hooligans david reminded him simon rubensky thought you would be a good man for the selfdefence corps join rubensky a pps never will i associate with a bourgeois like that he isnt joining the ss hesitated i must consult my fellowmembers i must write to headquarters letters do not travel very quickly or safely nowadays but party discipline is everything urged grodsky david left him and hunted up lerkoff who proved to be a doctor i want to get together a samooborona branch he explained herr grodsky has half promised that bourgeois cried lerkoff in disgust we can have nothing to do with traitors like that why are they traitors david asked all territorialists are traitors we poali zion must jealously guard the sacred flame of socialism and nationality since only in palestine can our social problem be solved why only in palestine inquired david mildly the pz glared palestine is an unconditional historic necessity the attempt to form a jewish state elsewhere can only result in failure and disappointment do you not see how the folkinstinct leads them to palestine no less than four thousand have gone there this year and a hundred and fifty thousand to america how about that folkinstinct oh these are the mere bourgeois i see you are an americanist assimilator i am no more an aa than i am a zz said david tartly adding with a smile if there is such a thing as a zz would to heaven there were not said lerkoff fervently it is these miserable zionizionists with their incapacity for political concepts who milovka amid all its medievalism possessed a few incongruous telephones and one of these now started ringing violently in dr lerkoffs study ah he exclaimed talk of the devil there is a man who combines all the worst qualities of the zzs and the mizrachi he also imagines he has a throat disease due to swallowing flecks of the furs he deals in after which harangue he collogued amiably with his patient and said he would come instantly hasnt he the disease then asked david he has no disease except too much vanity and too much money while you cure him of the first i should like to try my hand at the second said david laughingly oh ill introduce you if you let me off you i dont ask for money but your medical services would be invaluable milovka is in danger milovka to the deuce cried lerkoff our future lies not in russia i talk of our present do let me appoint you army surgeon next yearin jerusalem replied the doctor airily vi lerkoff asked david to wait in another room while he saw herr cantberg professionally there was an ark with scrolls of the law in the room betiding a piety and a purse beyond the normal presently lerkoff reappeared chuckling he knows all about you you infamous rascal he said you have told him he told me he always knows everything you are a baptized police spy posing as a pps i suppose hes heard of your visit to herr rubensky but i shall undeceive him not if you want his money such a blow to his vanity would cost you dear go in i did not tell him you were the young man he was telling me of i must fly the p z shook davids hand dont forget hes the bourgeois type of zionist his object is not to create the future but to resurrect the dead past and mine is to keep alive the living present wont you but the doctor was gone the mizrachi zz proved unexpectedly small in stature and owllike in expression but his be seated sirbe seated what can i do for you had the grand manner it evoked a resentful chord in david it is something i propose to do for you he said bluntly milovka is in danger it is indeed said the mzz when men like dr lerkoff in whose company i was sorry to see you command a hearing it is in deadly danger an excellent physician but you know the talmudical saying hell awaits even the best of physicians and he calls himself a zionist bah hes more dangerous than that young renegade spy who dubs himself pps but he seems very zealous for zion said david uneasily herr cantberg shook his head dolefully hed introduce vaccination and seruminsertions instead of the grand old laws as if any human arrangement could equal the wisdom of sinai and he actually scoffs at the restoration of the sacrifices but do you propose to restore them david was astonished the owls eyes shone what have we sacrificed ourselves for all these centuries if not for the sacrifices what has sanctified and illumined the long night of our exile except a vision of the high priest in his jewelled breastplate officiating again at the altar of our holy temple now at last the vision begins to take shape the hope of israel begins to shine again like a rosy cloud like a crescent moon like a star in the desert like a lighthouse over lonely seas the telephone impolitely interrupted him his fine frenzy disregarded the ringing but it jangled his metaphors but alas our people do not see clearly he broke off false prophets colossally vainmay their names be blotted outconfuse the foolish crowd but the wheat is being sifted from the chaff the fine flour from the bran the edible herbs from the evil weeds and soon my people will see again that only i the telephone insisted on a hearing having refused to buy furs at the price it demanded he resumed territorialist traitors mislead the masses but in so far as they may bring relief to our unhappy people i wish them godspeed but what relief can they bring put in david impatiently without selfdefence most true they will but kill off a few hundred people with fever and famine on some savage shore but let them it will all be to the glory of zionism how so david asked amazed it will show that the godless ideals of materialists can never be realized that only in its old home can israel again be a nation then will come the moment for me to arise but the english came from denmark and theyre nation enough the owl blinked angrily we are the chosen peopleno historic parallel applies to us as the dove returned to the ark as the swallow returns to the lands of the spring as the tide returns to the sands as the stars yes yes i know said david but where is there room in palestine for the russian jews where was there room in the temple for the millions who came up at passover retorted herr cantberg crushingly the telephone here interposed offering the furs cheaper a godless bundist the owl explained between the deals a bundist david pricked up his ears from the bravest revolutionary party in russia he could surely cull a recruit or two who is he the owl tried to look noble producing only a twinkle of cunning oh i cant betray him after all hes a brotherinisrael not that he behaves as such opposing our candidate for the duma three hundred and thirteen roubles he told the telephone sternly not a kopeck more eh what hes rung off the bloodsucker he rang him up again david made a note of the number but what have you zionists to do with the parliament in russia he inquired of the owl but the owl was haggling with the telephone three hundred and fifteen what do you want to skin me like your martins and sables you are busy interposed david fretting at the waste of his day i shall take the liberty of calling again a telephonebook soon betrayed the bundists shop and david hurried off to enlist him the shopkeeper proved however so corpulent and bovine that davids heart sank but he began bluntly i know youre a bundist a what said the furdealer david smiled oh you neednt pretend with me im a fighter myself he let a revolver peep out of his hippocket help gewalt cried the furdealer a beardless youth came running out of the back room david laughed herr cantberg told me that you were a bundist he explained to the shopkeeper and i came to meet a kindred spirit but i was warned herr cantberg is always wrong goodmorning stop cried the youth go in reb yitzchok let me deal with this fireeater and as the corpulent man retired with an improbable alacrity he continued gravely this time herr cantberg was not more than a hundred versts from the truth david smiled you are the bundist hush here i am the soninlaw i study talmud and eat kest free food what news from warsaw i want both you and your fatherinlaw said david evasivelyhis money and your muscles he gives no money to the cause save unwillingly what i squeeze out of cantberg the youth permitted himself his first smile when he deals with that bourgeois at the telephone i always egg him on to stand out for more and more and my profit is half the extra roubles we extort but as for myself my life of course is at the disposal of headquarters david was moved by this refreshing simplicity he felt a little embarrassment in explaining that headquarters to him meant samooborona not bund the youths countenance changed completely defend the jews he cried contemptuously what have we to do with the jewish bourgeoisie the bund is exclusively jewish is it not merely because we found the rest of the revolutionary body too clumsy for words it was always getting caught its printingpresses exhumed its leaders buried so we split off the better to help our fellowworkingmen but we are a labour party not a jewish party we have the whole russian revolution on our shoulders how can we throw away our lives for the capitalists of the milovka ghetto then there are the elections at handi have to work for the left ah here come some of our bourgeois ask them if you like i will keep my fatherinlaw out of the shop two men in close confabulation strolled in a third disconnected but on their heels with five jews the concourse soon became a congress one of the couple turned out to be a progressive pole he mistook david for a zionist and denounced him for a foreigner we of the ppp he said will peacefully acquire equal rights with our fellowpolesnay we shall be allowed to become poles ourselves but you zionists are less citizens than strangers and if you were logical you would all wheres your own logic interrupted the disconnected man why dont you join the ppn at once the progressive pole frowned the nationalists they are antisemites id as soon join the league of true russian men and do you trust the ppp his companion asked him i tell you nathan that only in the progressive democratic party with its belief in the equality of all nationalities if you want a party free from antisemites david intervened desperately you must join the samoo i fear you will get no recruits here interrupted the bundist not unkindly he added with a sneer these gentlemen of the ppp and the ppn and the ppd are all good poles good poles echoed david no less bitterly and the poles voted en bloc to keep every jewish candidate out of the duma even so we must be better poles than they sublimely replied the member of the ppp we are joining even the clerical parties of the right for the good of our country and now that the party of national concentration go to the labour parties advised the pd there you may perchance find sturdy young men with the necessary ghetto taint of the four great labour parties he proceeded to recommend the psd as the most promising for davids purposes not the bolshewiki faction he added but the menshewiki recruits might also be found in the proletariat or the pps no ive tried the pps said david but at any rate gentlemen since you must all see that the defence of our own lives is no undesirable object a little contribution to our funds a violent chorus of protest broke out it was scarcely credible that only four men were speaking all explained elaborately that they had their own party funds and what a tax it was to run their candidates for the duma not to mention their party organ you see said the bundist your only chance lies with the men of no party who have only their own bourgeois pleasures are there such asked david eagerly a universal laugh greeted this inquiry alas too many everybody told him our people are such individualists but where are these individualists cried david desperately as if in answer the bovine proprietor encouraged by the laughter crept in again you still here he murmured to david taken aback yes but if youll give me a subscription for jewish selfdefence jewish emancipation cried the furdealer why didnt you say so at first he put his hand in his pocket thats my partyor rather the national group in it the antizionist faction the stern bundist laughed no he doesnt mean hes a je even of the other faction his fatherinlaw took his hand out of his pocket david cast a rebuking glance at the bundist why did you interfere perhaps my way may prove the shortest to jewish emancipation his hearers smiled a superior smile and the furdealer shook his head i belong also to the promotion of education partyi am for peaceful methods he announced so i perceived said david drily to be rid of him the bundist gave him the address of a man who kept aloof from polish politicsa bourgeois cousin of his belchevski by name who might just as well be killed off in the samooborona but even belchevski turned out to be a territorialist david imprudently told him he had seen his fellowterritorialist grodsky who had half promised associate with a brainless bumptious platformscreamer he screamed hes worse than the hysterical zionists it is a territory we need not socialism i agree but even more do we need selfdefence the only selfdefence is to leave russia for a land of our own five and a quarter million of us why if two shipsone from libau for the north and one from odessa for the southsailed away every week each bearing two thousand passengers it would take over a quarter of a century and by that time a new generation of us would have grown up the territorialist looked uneasy besides david continued what new country could receive us at the rate of two hundred thousand a year it would be a cemetery not a country the territorialist smiled disdainfully why didnt you say at first you were a bourgeois the unconditional historic necessity which has created the ito may drive at what pace it will enough that as soon as our autonomous land is ready to receive us i intend to be in the first shipload have you this land then not yet weve only had time to draw up the constitution no socialism as that idiot grodsky imagines but democracy hereditary privileges will be abol but what land is there surely there are virgin lands even the virgin lands are betrothed said david and if there was one still without a lord and master it would probably be a very ugly and sickly virgin and anyhow it will be a long wooing so in the meantime let me teach you to fire a pistol with all my heartbut merely to shoot wild beasts that is all i am asking for said david grimly encouraged by this semisuccess david boldly called upon a teamerchant quite unknown to him and asked for a subscription to buy revolvers the teamerchant who was a small stout man with a black cap of dubious cut protested vehemently against such materialistic measures let them put their trust in cultur to talk hebrewtherein lay israels real salvation let little children once again lisp in the language of isaiah and hoseathat was true zionism then dont you want the holy land asked the astonished david merely as a centre of cultur merely as a university where herbert spencer may be studied in the tongue of the psalmist all the rest is bourgeois zionism political zionism economic zionism pah mere tawdry imitations of heathen politics then you agree with the chovevi zionists not at all zion is less a place than a state of mind we want culturenot agriculture we want the evolutionary efflorescence of israels inner personality david fled only to stumble upon a nationalist who declared that zionism was a caricature of true nationalism and territorialism a cheap philanthropic substitute for it then why not join in the selfdefence of our nation david asked i willwhen we are on our own soil your corps is a mere mockery of the military concept david found no more comfort in his interview with the member of the laer who was convinced that only in the league for the advancement of equal rights lay the jews true security it was the one party whose success was sure the only one based upon an unconditional historic necessity davids morning was not however to pass without the discovery of a man of no party and strangely enough he owed his find to the headache these innumerable parties caused him for going into a chemists shop for a powder he was served by a redbearded jew whose genial face emboldened him to solicit a stock of bandages and antisepticsin view of a possible pogrom but the pogroms are over cried the chemist they were but the expiring agonies of the old order the reign of love is at hand the brotherhood of man is beginning and all races and creeds will henceforth live at peace under the new religion of science davids headache rose again triumphant over the powder even a partisan would be easier to convince than this sort of seer why a pogrom is planned for milovka impossible europe would not permit it america would prohibit it did you not see the protest even in the australian parliament look on your calendar we have reached the twentieth century even according to the christian calculation david returned hopelessly to his inn here he saw a burly jew warming himself at the great stove before even ordering dinner he made a last desperate attempt to save his morning me join a jewish selfdefence the burly jew laughed loud and heartily why im a true believer a meshummad david gasped modern as he was the hereditary horror at the baptized apostate overcame him yesim safe enough the convert laughed ive taken the coldwater cure besides im the censor of milovka eh david looked like a trapped animal the censor smiled on dont scowl at me like the other pious zanies after all youre an enlightened young mana violinist they tell me you cant take your judaism any more seriously than i take my baptism comehave a glass of vodka then you wont inform david breathed not unless you publish seditious yiddish keep your pistols out of print if my own skin is safe that doesnt mean im made of stone like these tartar devils landlord the vodka well drink confusion to them ii have none stammered the landlord i havent the right there are no rights in russia said the censor goodhumouredly the landlord furtively produced a big bottle but the idea of asking me to join the selfdefence chuckled the burly jew you might as well ask me to play the violin he added with a wink david felt this was the first really sympathetic hearer he had met that morning vii the vodka and a good threecourse dinner plotki for fish lockschen for soup and zrazy for joint brought david new courage and again he sallied out to recruit this time he sought the marketplacea badlypaved square bordered with small houses and congested with stalls and a grey kaftaned crowd amid which gleamed the blue blouses of the ungodly younger generation he had hitherto addressed himself to the classeshe would hear the voice of the people on every side the voice babbled of the dumababbled happily as though the word was a new religious charm or a witchs incantation crude political conversations broke out amid all the business of the mart he had only to listen to know how he would be answered a blacksmith buying a new hammer stayed to argue with the vendor we must put our trust in the constitutional democrats and why in the cadets give me the democrats nay we must put our trust only in the czar this came from the rabbis wife who was cheapening fish at the next stall for shame rebbitzin put not your trust in princes the bystanders hushed down the textquotera fuzzyheaded butcherboy miserable monarchists he sneered we jews will have no peace till the republicans a republic without socialism interrupted a girl with a laundry basket what goods that wait till the nss the drs are the only interrupted a phylacterypedlar and who but the labour group promises equal rights to all nationalities interrupted a girl in spectacles trust the trudowaja to the devil with the labour parties said an oldclo man look how the bundists have betrayed us first they were bone of our bone now it is they who by their recklessness provoke the pogroms the blacksmith brought his hammer down upon the stall there is only one party to trust and thats the cds he repeated bourgeois simultaneously hissed the republican youth and the socialist lass my children it was the bland voice of moses the shamash beadle violence leads to naught even the viborg manifesto was a mistake as a member of the party of peaceful regeneration peaceful regeneration shouted the blacksmith a jew ally himself with the reactionary right with the a cossack galloped recklessly among the serried stalls the jews scattered before him like dogs the member of the ppr crawled under a barrow even the blacksmith froze up david drew the moral when the cossack had disappeared peaceful regeneration he cried there will be no regeneration for you till you have the courage to leave russian politics alone and to fight for yourselves ah youre a maximalist said the beadle no i am only a minimalist i merely want the minimumthat we save our own lives it was asking too little the poor russian jews like the rich russian jews were largely occupied in saving the world or at least holy russia crushed by such an excess of christianity david wandered round the marketplace looking into the bordering houses in one of the darkest and dingiest sat a cobbler tapping at shoes surrounded by sprawling children peace be to you called david peace have i always rejoined the cobbler cheerily david looked at the happy dirty children he had seen their like torn limb from limb but have you thought of the danger of a pogrom he said i have heard whispers of it said the cobbler but we chassidim have no fear our wonderrabbi who has power over all the spheres will utter a word and illustration the jews scattered before him like dogs a tsaddik wonderrabbi was killed in the last pogrom said david brutally you must join a selfdefence band the cobbler ceased to tap what go for a soldier when the rebbe caused me to draw a high number our soldiering is not for russia but to save us from russia we must all join together me join the misnagdim cried the cobbler in horror never will i join with those who deny the masterofthename david sighed suddenly he perceived a stalwart jew lounging at a neighbouring door he moved towards him and broached the subject afresh the lounger shook his head you may persuade that foolish chassid said he but you cannot expect the rest of us to join with these heretics these godless dancing dervishes who are capable even of saying the afternoon prayer in the evening in the next house lived a maskil intellectual who looked up from his hebrew newspaper to ask how he could be associated with a squad of young ignoramuses his neighbour was a karaite drifted here from another community the karaite pointed out that selfdefence was unnecessary in his case as his sect was scarcely regarded by the authorities as jewish there were other motley jews living round the marketplacea lithuanian who refused to cooperate with the polish sweettooths and who was in turn stigmatized by a pole as peelbarley in scarification of his reputedly stingy diet a man from odessa dismissed them both as crossheads it was impossible to unite such mutually superior elements again weary and heartsick he returned towards the inn viii but his way was blocked by a turbulent stream of jewish boys pouring out of the primary school they seemed to range in years between eight and twelve but even the youngest face wore a stamp of age and though the air vibrated with the multiplex chatter which accompanies the exodus of cramped and muted pupils the normal elements of joyousness of horseplay of individual freakishness were absent it was a common agitation that loosed all these little tongues and set all these little ears listening to the passionate harangues of ringleaders instead of hurrying home the schoolboys lingered in knots round their favourite orators a premature gravity furrowed all the childish foreheads with one of these orators david dimly felt familiar and after listening for a few minutes to the lads tirade against the autocracy of the school director and the bureaucratic methods of the inspector it dawned upon him that the little demagogue was his own landlords son hullo kalman he cried in surprise hullo comrade replied the boy graciously so youre a revolutionary eh said david smiling all my class belongs to the junior bund replied the boy gravely then youre not so peaceful as papa the lads aplomb and dignity deserted him he blushed furiously and hung his head in shame of his moderate parent never mind comrade kalman said another boy slapping his shoulder consolingly weve all got some shady relative or another a shrill burst of applause relieved the painful situation turning his head david found all the childish eyes converged upon a single figure a bulgingheaded lad who had sprung into a sudden position of eminenceupon an eggbox he was clothed in the blue blouse of radicalism and irreligion and the faint down upon his upper lip suggested that he must be nearing fifteen comrades he was crying in my youth i myself was head boy at this school of yours but even in those old days there was the same brutal autocracy your only remedy is a general strike you must join the syndical anarchists more shrill cheers greeted this fiery counsel the members of the junior bund waved their satchels frenziedly only the landlords son stood mute and frowning you dont agree with him said david no answered the little bundist gravely i follow comrade berl but this fellow is popular because he was expelled from the warsaw gymnasium as a suspect you must strike repeated the juvenile agitator a strike is the only way of impressing the proletarian psychology you must all swear to attend school no more till your demands are granted we swear came from all sides in a childish treble but the frown on the brow of the landlords son grew darker it is well comrades said the orator your success will be a lesson to your elders too only by applying the marxian philosophy of history can we upset the bourgeois weltanschauung the landlords son reached the roof of the eggbox with one angry bound and stood beside the agitator marx is an old fogey he shouted whats the good of a passive strike let us make a demonstration against the director let us who told you that sneered the orator comrade berl or comrade schmerl the boy missed the sarcasm of the rhyme you know schmerls a mere milkblooded attainer he said angrily believe me was the soothing reply even beyond the five freedoms the boycott is a better attainer than the bomb traitor bourgeois and a third boy jumped upon the eggbox he had red hair and flaming eyes if russia is to be saved he shrieked it will be neither by the fivefold formula of freedom nor by the fourfold suffrage but by the integralists who alone maintain the purity of the social revolutionary programme as it was before the party degenerated into maximalists and mini here the eggbox collapsed under the weight of the three orators and they sprawled in equal ignominy but the storm was now launched a score of the schoolboys burst into passionate abstract discussion the unity necessary to the school strike was shattered into fragments david ploughed his way sadly through the mimetic mob of youngsters who were yet not all apes and parrots he reflected just as jewry had always had its boy rabbis its infant phenomenons of the pulpit prodigies of eloquence and holy learning so it now had its precocious politicians and its premature sociologists he was tempted for a moment to try his recruiting spells upon the juvenile integralist whose red hair reminded him of his girl cousins but it seemed cruel to add to the lads risks besides had not the boy already proclaimedlike his seniorsthat russia not jewry was to be saved it was an hour of no custom when he got back to the inn so that he was scarcely surprised to find host and hostess alike invisible he sat down and began to write a melancholy report to headquarters but a mysterious and persistent knocking prevented any concentration upon his task presently he threw down his pen and went to find out what was the matter the noises drew him downwards the landlord alarmed at the footsteps blew out his light its only i said david the landlord relit the candle david saw a cellar strewn with iron bars instruments boxes and a confused heap of stones ah hiding the vodka said david with a smile no we are widening and fortifying the cellaralso provisioning the loft samooborona said david preciselyand a far more effective form than yours my young hothead perhaps you are right said david wearily he went back to his report he was glad to think that the little bundist had an extra chance after all he had achieved something he would save some lives perhaps he would end by preaching the landlords waypassive samooborona was better than none ix but the report refused to write itself it was too dismal to confess he had not collected a kopeck or one recruit he picked up a greasy fragment of a russian newspaper and read with a grim smile that the octobrists had excluded jews from their meetings that reminded him of erbstein the banker who had bidden him put his trust in them would the banker be more susceptible now under this disillusionment alas the question was could a banker be disillusioned to be disillusioned is to admit having been mistaken and bankers like popes were infallible david bethought himself instead of the owlish mizrachi his visit to whom had been left unfinished he threw down his pen and repaired again to the house with the ark and the telephone but as he reached cantbergs door it opened suddenly and a young man shot out never father he was shriekingnever do i enter this house again and he banged the door upon the owl and rushed into davids arms i beg your pardon he said it is my fault murmured david politely i was just going to see your father youll find him in a fiendish temper he cannot argue without losing it i hope youve not had a serious difference hes such a bigoted zionisthe cannot understand that zionism is ein ueberwundener standpunkt i know ah said the young man eagerly then you can understand how i have suffered since i evolved from zionism what are you now if i may ask the only thing that a selfrespecting jew can bea sejmist of course a jewish party asked david eagerly after all the enthusiasm for russian politics and world politics he was now pleased with even this loquacious form of selfdefence come and have a glass of tea i will tell you all about it said the young man soothed by the prospect of airing his theories we will go to friedmans innthe university club we call it because the intellectuals generally drink there with pleasure said david sniffing the chance of recruits but before we talk of your party i want to ask whether you can join me in a branch of the samooborona the young mans face grew overclouded our party cannot join any other he said but mine isnt a partya corps not a party no but you have a committee yesbut only and branches naturally but simply and a partychest the money is only and conferences of course but merely and you read referats not unless surely you are a party i tell you no i want all parties i am sorry but im too busy just now to consider anything else our partyday falls next week and theres infinite work to be done work cried david desperately what work there will be many great speeches i myself shall not speak beyond an hour but that is merely impromptu in the debate our referatspeakers need at least two hours apiece we did not get through our last session till five in the morning and there were scenes i tell you but what is there to discuss what is there to discuss the sejmist looked pityingly at david the great question of the duma elections for one thing to boycott or not to boycott and if not which candidates shall we support then there is the question of jewish autonomy in the russian parliamentthat is our great principle moreover as a comparatively new party we have yet to thresh out our relations to all the existing parties with which shall we form blocs in the elections while most are dangerous to the best interests of the jewish people and opposed to the evolution of historic necessity with some we may be able to cooperate here and there where our work intersects what work david insisted again doesnt our name tell you we are the vozrozhdeniethe resurrectionistsour work is an unconditional historic necessity springing from the evolution of the door of the inn arrested the sejmists harangue as he pushed it open a babel of other voices made continuance impossible the noise came entirely from a party of four huddled in a cloud of cigarettesmoke near the stove in one of the four david recognised the teamerchant of the morning but the teamerchant seemed to have no recollection of david he was still expatiating upon the individuality of israel which it appeared was an essence independent of place and time he nodded however to the young sejmist observing ironically behold the dreamer cometh i a dreamer forsooth the young man was vexed to be derided before his new acquaintance it is you achadhaamists who must wake up the teamerchant smiled with a superior air the vozrozhdenie would do well to study achadhaams philosophy then they would understand that their strivings are bound to lead to selfconstriction not selfexpression you were saying that too werent you witsky witsky who was a young lawyer demurred what i said was he explained to the sejmist that in your search for territorialproletariat practice you sejmists have altogether lost the theory conversely the sss have sacrificed territorial practice to their territorial theory in our party alone do you find the synthesis of the practical and the ideal it alone may i ask whom you speak for intervened david the newest jewish social democratic artisan party of russia replied witsky proudly are you the newest inquired david drily and the best if we desire palestine as the scene of our social regeneration it is because the unconditional historic necessity the sejmist interrupted sadly i see that our conference will have to decide against relations with you pooh the sdas will only be the stronger for isolation have we not of ourselves severed our relations with the dks in the evolution of the forces of the people it is not right witsky that you should mislead a stranger put in his sallow spectacled neighbour or perhaps you misconceive the genetic moments of your own programme what evolution is clearly leading to is a jewish autonomous party in parliament but we also say began the other two the sallow spectacled man waved them down wearily who but the pnds are the synthesis of the historic necessities we subsume the conservative elements of the spojnia narodowa national league and of the party of real politics with the reform elements of the democratic league and the progressive democrats consequently but the true polish party began witsky the kolo polskie polish ring is half antisemitic began the sejmist the three were talking at once through the chaos a thin piping voice penetrated clearly it came from the fourth member of the groupa cleanshaven ugly man who had hitherto remained silently smoking as a philosophic critic who sympathizes with all parties he said allow me to tell you friend witsky that your programme needs unification it starts as economic and then becomes dualisticfirst inductive then deductive moj panie drogi my dear sir intervened david if you sympathize with all parties you will join a corps for the defence of them all you forget the philosophic critic equally disagrees with all parties david lost his temper at last gentlemen he shouted ironically one may sit and make smokerings till the messiah comes but i assure you there is only one unconditional historic necessity and that is samooborona and without drinking his teawhich indeed the resurrectionist had forgotten to orderhe dashed into the street x he was but a youth driven into action by hellish injustice he had hitherto taken scant notice of all these parties that had sprung up for the confusion of his peoplethese hybrid kaleidoscopic combinations of russian and jewish politicsbut as he fled from the philosophers through the now darkening streets his every nerve quivering it seemed to him as if the alphabet had only to be thrown about like dice to give always the name of some party or other he had a nightmare vision of bristling sects and pullulating factions each with its councils federations funds conferences partydays agenda referats pressorgans each differentiating itself with meticulous subtlety from all the other parties each defining with casuistic minuteness its relation to every contemporary problem each equipped with inexhaustible polyglot orators speechifying through tumultuous nights well it could not be helped in the terrible nebulous welter in which his people found themselves it was not unnatural that each man should grope towards his separate ray of light the russian too was equally bewildered and perhaps all this profusion of theories came in both from the same lack of tangibilities both peoples possessed nothing perhaps indeed the ultimate salvation of the jews lay in identifying themselves with russia but then who could tell that the patriots who welcomed them today as coworkers would not reject them when the cause was won perhaps there was no hope outside preserving their own fullest identity poor bewildered russian jew caught in the bewilderments both of the russian and the jew and tangled up inextricably in the double confusion of interlacing coils the parties then were perhaps inevitable he must make his account with them how if he formed a secret samooborona committee composed equally of representatives of all parties but then how could he be sure of knowing them all he might offend one by omitting or miscalling it they formed and reformed like clouds on the blue a new party too might spring up overnight he might give deadly affront by ignoring this jonahs gourd even as he thus mused there came to him the voices of two young men the one advocating a ppla new party of popular libertythe other insisting that the new volksgruppe of all antizionist parties was an unconditional historic necessity he groaned it seemed to him as he stumbled blindly through the illpaved alleys that a plague of doctors of philosophy had broken out over the pale doctrinaires spinning pure logic from their vitals and fighting bitterly against the slightest deviation from the pattern of their webs but the call upon israel was for action was it he wondered with a flash of sympathy that israel was too great for action too sophisticated a people for so primitive and savage a function too set in the moulds of an ancient scholastic civilization so that even when action was attempted it was turned and frozen into philosophy or was it rather that eighteen centuries of poring over the talmud had unfitted them for action not merely because the habit of applying the whole brainforce to religious minutiae led to a similar intellectualization of contemporary problemsof the vast new material suddenly opened up to their sharpened brainsbut also because many of these religious problems related only to the time when israel and his temple flourished in palestine the academic leisure and scrupulous discrimination that might be harmlessly devoted to the dead past had been imported into the burning presentinto things that mattered for life or death yes the new generation chopped the logic of zionism or socialism as the old argued over the ritual of burntofferings whose smoke had not risen since the year of the christian era or over the decisions of babylonian geonim no stone of whose city remained standing the men of today had merely substituted for the world of the past the world of the future and so there had arisen logicallyperfect structures of zionism without zion jewish socialism without a jewish social order labour parties without votes or parliaments the habit of actualities had been lost what need of them when concepts provided as much intellectual stimulus would israel never return to reality never find solid ground under foot never look eye to eye upon life but as the last patch of sunset faded out of the strip of wintry sky david suddenly felt infinitely weary of reality a great yearning came over him for that very unreality that very dead past in which pious jewry still lived its happiest hours oh to forget the parties the jangle of politics and philosophies the tohubohu of his unhappy day he must bathe his soul in an hours peace he would go back like a child to the familiar studyhouse of his youth to the beth hamedrash where the greybeards pored over the great wormeaten folios and the youths rocked in their expository incantations there lay the magic world of fantasy and legend that had been his peoples true home that had kept them sane and cheerful through eighteen centuries of tragedya watertight world into which no drop of outer reality could ever trickle there lay zion and the jordan the temple and the angels there the patriarchs yet hovered protectively over their people perhaps the milovka studyhouse boasted even cabbalists starving themselves into celestial visions and graduating for the divine kiss how infinitely restful after the milovka marketplace no more for that day at least would he prate of selfdefence and the horrible modern he asked the way to the beth hamedrash how fraternally the sages and the youths would greet him they would inquire in the immemorial formula what town comest thou from and when he told them they would ask concerning its rabbi and what news there was and news david remembered with a tearful smile meant new interpretations of texts yes this was all the news that ever ruffled that peaceful world man lived only for the holy law the world had been created merely that the law might be studied new lights upon its words and letters were the only things that could matter to a sensible soul time and again he had raged against the artificiality of this quietist cosmos accusing it of his peoples paralysis but tonight every fibre of him yearned for this respite from the harsh reality he rummaged his memory for newsfor theological ingeniosities textual wiredrawings that might have escaped the lore of milovka and as one who draws nigh to a great haven he opened the door of the beth hamedrash and murmuring peace be to you dropped upon a bench before an open folio whose commentaries and supercommentaries twined themselves lovingly in infinite convolutions round its holy text immediately he was surrounded by a buzzing crowd of youths and ancients which party are you of they clamoured eagerly xi the pogrom arrived but it arrived in a new form for which even david was unprepared perhaps in consequence of the rabbis warning to the governor selfdefence was made ridiculous no machiavellian paraphernalia of agents provocateurs no hooligans with false grey beards masquerading as jewish rioters or blasphemers artillery was calmly brought up against the jewish quarter as though milovka were an enemys town as the shells began to burst over the closepacked houses david felt grimly that an economic providence had saved him from wasting his time in training pistoliers the whitefaced landlord wringing his hands and saying his vidui deathbed confession offered him and his violincase a place in the cellar but he preferred to climb to the roof from which with the aid of a small glass he had a clear view of the cordon drawn round the doomed quarter a ricocheting cannonball crashed through the chimneypots at his side but he did not budge his eyes were glued upon a figure he had espied amid the cannon it was ezekiel leven his whilom lieutenant with whom he had dreamed of maccabean deeds the new conscript in the uniform of an artilleryman was carefully taking sight with a gatling gun poor ezekiel david cried yours is the most humorous fate of all but have you forgotten there is still one form of samooborona left and with an ironic laugh he turned his pistol upon himself the great guns boomed on hour after hour when the bombardment was over the peace of the devil lay over the ghetto of milovka silent were all the fiery orators of all the letters of the alphabet silent the polish patriots and the lovers of
