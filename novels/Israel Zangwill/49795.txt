with herbert at a little table all was very still save for the eternal monotone of the sea something in the scene thrilled him with a sense of restful kinship the master proem despite its long stretch of winter in which may might wed december in no incompatible union twas a happy soil this acadia a country of good air and great spaces twothirds of the size of scotland with a population that could be packed away in a corner of glasgow a land of green forests and rosy cheeks a land of milk and molasses a land of little hills and great harbors of rich valleys and lovely lakes of overflowing rivers and oversurging tides that with all their menace did but fertilize the meadows with red silt and alluvial mud a land over which france and england might well bicker when first they met oversea a land which if it never reached the restless energy of the states never retained the old world atmosphere that long lingered over new england villages save here and there in some rare acadian settlement that dreamed out its life in peace and prayer among its willowtrees and in the shadows of its orchards at minudie at clare in annapolis county where the goodly apples grew lay such fragments of old france simple communities shutting out the world and time marrying their own tilling their good dyke land and picking up the shad that the retreating tide left on the exposed flats listening to the angelus and baring their heads as some church procession passed through the drowsy streets they had escaped the great expulsion nor had joined in the exodus of evangeline and sprinkled about the country were compatriots of theirs who had drifted back when the times grew more sedate but for the most part it was the saxon that profited by the labors of the pioneer gaul repairing the tumbledown farms and the dilapidated dykes possessing himself of embanked marsh lands and replanting the plumtrees and the quinces his predecessor had naturalized for the revolt of the states against britain sent thousands of american loyalists flocking into this new scotland which thus became a colony of new england scots themselves flowed in from auld scotland and the german came to sink himself in the briton and a band of irish adventurers under the swashbuckling colonel mcnutt arrived with a grant of a million acres that they were not destined to occupy the acadian repose had fled forever the sparse indian hastened to make himself scarcer conscious there was no place for him in the new order and disappearing deliciously in hogsheads of rum the virgin greenwood rang with axes startling the bear and the moose crash down went pine and beech hemlock and maple their stumps alone left to rot and enrich the fields crashthud the weasel grew warier the astonished musquash vanished in eddying circles bridges began to span the rivers where the beaver built its dams in happy unconsciousness of the tall cylinder that was about to crown civilization the caribou and the silver fox pressed inland to save their skins the snare was set in the wildwood and the crack of the musket followed the ring of the axe the mackerel and the herring sought destruction in shoals and the seines brimmed over with salmon and alewives and gaspereux the wild land that had bloomed with goldenrod and violets was tamed with crops and plump sheep and fat oxen pastured where the wild strawberry vine had trailed or the bullfrog had croaked under the alders a sturdy ingenious race the fathers of the new settlement loving work almost as much as they feared god turning their hand to anything and opening it wide to the stranger they raised their own houses and fashioned their own tools and shod their own horses and later built their own vessels and even sailed them to the great markets laden with the produce of their own fields and the timber from their own sawmills there were women in this workaday paradiseshapely gentle creatures whose hands alone were rough with field and housework women who span and sang when the winter nightwinds whistled round the settlement the dramas of love and grief began to play themselves out where the raccoon and the chickadee had fleeted the golden hours in careless living children came to make the rafters habitable and death to sanctify them with memories the air grew human with the smoke of hearths the forest with legends and histories and as houses grew into homes and villages into townships church and state arose where only faith and freedom had been the sons and heirs of the fathers did not always cling to the tradition of piety and perseverance the bluenose grew apathetic content with the fatness of the day or if he exerted himself it was too often to best a neighbor the great magnets of new york and boston drew off or drew back all that was iron in the race and amid these homely emotions of yeomen amid the crude pieties or impieties of homespun souls amid this sane hearty intercourse with realities or this torpor of sluggish spirits was born ever and anon a gleam of fantasy of imagination bizarre transfiguring touching things with the glamour of dream blind instinctsblinder still in their lonelinessyearned towards light beautiful emotions stirred in dumb souls emotions that mayhap turned to morbid passion in the silence and solitude of the woods where character may grow crabbed and gnarled as well as sound and straight for whereas to most of these human creatures begirt by the glory of sea and forest the miracles of sunrise and sunset were only the familiar indications of a celestial timepiece and the starry heaven was but a leaky ceiling in their earthly habitation there was here and there an eye keen to note the play of light and shade and color the glint of wave and the sparkle of hoarfrost and the spume of tossing seas the gracious fairness of cloud and bird and blossom the magic of sunlit sails in the offing the witchery of white winters and all the changing wonder of the woods a soul with scanty selfconsciousness at best yet haply absorbing nature to give it back one day as art ah but to see the world with other eyes than ones fellows yet express the vision of ones race its subconscious sense of beauty is not all a covetable dower the islands of acadia are riddled with pits where men have burrowed for captain kidds treasure and found nothing but holes the deeper they delved the deeper holes they found whoso with blood and tears would dig art out of his soul may lavish his golden prime in pursuit of emptiness or striking treasure find only fairy gold so that when his eye is purged of the spell of morning he sees his hand is full of withered leaves book ichapter i solitude matt matt whats thet thar noise matt opened his eyes vaguely shaking off his younger brothers frantic clutch its ony the frost he murmured closing his eyes again go to sleep billy since the sled accident that had crippled him for life billy was full of nervous terrors and the night had been charged with mysterious noises within the lonely wooden house weatherboards and beams cracked without twigs snapped and branches crashed at times billy heard reports as loud as pistolshots one of these shots meant the bursting of the washbasin on the bedroom bench matt having forgotten to empty its contents which had expanded into ice matt curled himself up more comfortably and almost covered his face with the blanket for the cold in the stoveless attic was acute in the gray halflight the rough beams and the quilts glistened with frozen breaths the little square windowpanes were thickly frosted and below the crumbling rime was a thin layer of ice left from the day before solid up to the sashes and leaving no infinitesimal dot of clear glass for there was nothing to thaw it except such heat as might radiate through the bricks of the square chimney that came all the way from the cellar through the centre of the flooring to pop its head through the shingled roof matt billy was nudging his brother in the ribs again hullo grumbled the boy thet thar aint the frost hark tis i tell ye dont you hear the pop pop pop not thet tother downstairs oh thets the wind i reckon no its some un screamin matt raised himself on his elbow and listened why you gooney its ony mother rowin harriet he said reassuringly and snuggled up again between the blankets the winter though yet young had already achieved a reputation blustrous north winds had driven inland felling the trees like lumbermen in the annapolis basin myriads of herrings surprised by jack frost before their migratory instinct awoke had been found frozen in the weirs and the great salt tides overflowing the high dykes had been congealed into a chocolate sea that when the liquid water beneath ran back through the sluices lay solid on the marshes by the shores of the basin of minas seabirds flapped ghostlike over amber icecakes whose mudstreaks under the kiss of the sun blushed like dragons blood snow had fallen heavily whitening the evergreen hemlocks and through the shapeless landscape halfburied oxen had toiled to clear the blurred roads bordered by snowdrifts till the three familiar tracks of hoofs and sleighrunners came in sight again the stage to truro ploughed its way along with only dead freight on its roof and a furred animal or two vaguely human shivering inside sometimes the mail had to travel by horse and sometimes it altogether disappointed billy and his brothers and sisters of the excitement of its passage for the stage road ran by the small clearing in the centre of which their house and barn had been builta primitive gabled house like a noahs ark ugliness unadorned and a cheap log barn of the leanto type with its cracks corked with moss and a roof of slabs jack frost might stop the mail but he could not stop the gayeties of the season wooden frolics and quiltingparties and candypullings and infares and baptist revivalmeetings had been as frequent as ever and part of matts enjoyment of his couch was a delicious sense of oversleeping himself legitimately for even his mother could hardly expect him to build the fire at five when he had only returned from deacon haileys muddin frolic at two he saw himself coasting down the white slopes in his handsled watching the wavering radiance of the northern lights that paled the moon and the stars and wishing his mother would not spoil the afterglow of the nights pleasure and the poetic silence of the woods by grumbling about his grownup sister harriet who had deserted them for an earlier escort home he felt himself well rewarded for his afternoons labor in loading marsh mud for the topdressing of deacon haileys fields and a sudden remembrance of how his mother had been rewarded for helping mrs hailey to prepare the feast made him nudge billy in his turn cheer up billy weve brought back a basket o goodies theres plumcake doughnuts its gettin worst said billy hark matt mumbled impatiently and redirected his thoughts to the muddin frolic the images of the night swept before him with almost the vividness of actuality he lost himself in memories as though they were realities and every now and then a dash of sleep streaked these waking visions with the fantasy of dream my how the fiddle shrieks runs the boys reminiscence why dont ole jupe do his tunin to home the pesky nigger were all waitin for the reelthe fours are all made up ruth hailey and me hev took the floor ruth looks jest great with thet white frock an the pink sash thets a fact hooraythe devil among the tailorsla lalla lalla lalla lalla flipflop he hears the big winter topboots thwack the threshingfloor keep it up whoop faster ever faster oh the joy of life now he is swinging ruth in his arms oh the merrygoround the long rows of candles pinned by forks to the barn walls are guttering in the wind of the movement the horses tied to their mangers neigh in excitement from between their stanchions the mildeyed cows gaze at the dancers perking their nave noses and tranquilly chewing the cud a bat thawed out of his winter nap by the heat of the temporary stove flutters drowsily about the candles and the odors of the stable and of the packed hay mingle with the scents of the ballroom matts exhaustive eye though never long off pretty ruths face takes in even the grains of wheat that gild many a tousled head of swain or lass as the shaking of the beams dislodges the unthreshed kernels in the mow under the eaves and keener even than the eye of his collie sprat notes the mice that dart from their holes to seize the fallen drops of tallow but perhaps sprat is only lazy for he will not vacate his uncomfortable snuggery under the stove though he has to shift his carcass incessantly to escape the jets of tobaccojuice constantly squirted in his direction it serves him right thinks his young master for persisting in coming though for the matter of that the creature having superintended the mudhauling has more right to be present than bully preep wonder why sister harriet lets him dance with her so ofn the panorama of his thought proceeds what kin she see in the skunk fur lan sakes i told her bout

fact not a wife id rather stab myself than go on livin with you for a moment or two matt listened in silent torture the frequency of these episodes had made him resigned but not callous now harriets sobs were added to the horror of the altercation and matt fancied he heard a sound of scuffling he jumped out of bed in an agony of alarm he pulled on his trousers caught up his coat and slipped it on as he flew barefoot down the rough wooden stairs with his woollen braces dangling behind him in the narrow icy passage at the foot of the stairs in the bleak light from the row of little crusted panes on either side of the door he found his mother and sister their rubbercased shoes halfburied in snow that had drifted in under the door mrs strang was fully dressed in her frolickin costume which at that period included a crinoline she wore an astrakhan sacque reaching to the knees and a small pokebonnet plentifully beribboned blooming with artificial flowers within and without and tied under the chin by broad black watered bands round her neck was a fringed afghan or homeknit muffler she was a tall dark voluptuouslybuilt woman with blazing black eyes and handsome features of a somewhat gallic cast for she came of old huguenot stock she stood now drawing on her mittens in terrible silence her bosom heaving her nostrils quivering harriet was nearer the door flushed and panting and sobbing a welldeveloped auburn blonde of sixteen her hair dishevelled her bodice unhooked a strange contrast to the others primness where you goin she said tremulously as she barred her mothers way with her body im goin to drownd myself answered her mother carefully smoothing out her right mitten nonsense mother broke in matt you kint go outits snowin he brushed past the pair and placed himself with his back to the door his heart beating painfully his mothers mad threats were familiar enough yet they never ceased to terrify some day she might really do something desperate who knew im goin to drownd myself repeated mrs strang carefully winding the muffler round her head she made a step towards the door sweeping the limp harriet roughly behind her you kint get out matt said firmly why you hevnt hed breakfast yet what do i want o breakfus your sister is breakfus nough for me clear out o the way dont you let her go matt cried harriet ill quit instead you exclaimed her mother turning fiercely upon her while her eyes spat fire you are young and wholesomethe world is afore you you were not brought from a great town to be buried in a wilderness marry your preeps an your micmacs and nurse your pappooses god has cursed me with froward children an a cripple an a husband that goes gallivantin onchristianly about the world with never a thought for his mortal soul an the lord has doomed me to worship him in the wrong church mother yourselves i throw up the position is it my fault if father hesnt wrote you lately cried harriet is it my fault if theres no baptist church to cobequid village shut your mouth you brazen hussy youve drove your mother to her death stand out o my way matthew dont you disobey my dyin reques i shant said the boy squaring his shoulders firmly against the door where kin you drownd yourself the ponds froze an the tides out he could think of no other argument for the moment and he had an incongruous vision of her sliding down to the river on her stomach as the boys often did down the steep reddishbrown slopes of greasy mud or sinking into a squashhole like an errant horse illustration he placed himself with his back to the door why theres ony mudflats he added ill wait on the mudflats fur the merciful tide she fastened her bonnetstrings firmly the river is full of ice he urged there will be room fur me she answered then with a sudden exclamation of dismay my god youve got no shoes and socks on youll ketch your death go upstairs dreckly no replied matt becoming conscious for the first time of a cold wave creeping up his spinal marrow ill ketch my death then and he sneezed vehemently put on your shoes an socks dreckly you wretched boy you know what a bother i hed with you last time he shook his head conscious of a trump card dye hear me put on your shoes and socks take off your bonnet an sacque retorted matt clinching his fists put on your shoes an socks repeated his mother take off your bonnet an sacque an ill put on my shoes an socks they stood glaring defiance at each other like a pair of duellists their breaths rising in the frosty air like the smoke of pistolsthese two grotesque figures in the gray light of the bleak passage the tall fierce brunette in her flowery bonnet and astrakhan sacque and the small shivering sneezing boy in his patched homespun coat with his trailing braces and bare feet they heard harriets teeth chatter in the silence go back to bed you young varmint said matt suddenly catching sight of billys white face and gray nightgown on the landing above youll ketch your death there was a scurrying sound from above a fleeting glimpse of other little nightgowned figures matt and his mother still confronted each other warily and then the situation was broken up by the near approach of sleighbells they stopped slowly mingling their jangling with the creak of runners sliding over frosty snow then the scrunch of heavy boots travelled across the clearing harriet flushed in modest alarm and fled upstairs mrs strang hastily retreated into the kitchen and for one brief moment matt breathed freely till hearing the click of the doorlatch he scented gunpowder he dashed towards the door and pressed the thumblatch but it was fastened from within harriet he gasped the gun the gun he beat at the door his imagination seeing through it his loaded gun was resting on the wooden hooks fastened to the beam in the ceiling he heard his mother mount a chair he tried to break open the door but could not the chances of getting round by the back way flashed into his mind only to be dismissed as quickly there was no timein breathless agony he waited the report of the gun crash a strange unexpected sound smote his earshe heard the thud of his mothers body striking the floor she had stabbed herself then instead half mad with excitement and terror he backed to the end of the passage took a running leap and dashed with his mightiest momentum against the frail battened door off flew the catch open flew the door with matt in pursuit and it was all the boy could do to avoid tumbling over his mother who sat on the floor among the ruins of a chair rubbing her shins her bonnet slightly disarranged and the gun still loaded demurely on its perch what had happened was obvious some of the little strang mice taking advantage of the cats absence at the muddin frolic had had a frolic on their own account turning the chair into a sled and binding up its speedilybroken leg to deceive the maternal eye it might have supported a sitter under mrs strangs feet it had collapsed ere her hand could grasp the gun the pesky young varmints she exclaimed full of this new grievance they might hev crippled me fur life always atearin an arampagin an aruinatin i kint keep two sticks together its nough to make a body throw up the position the sound of the buttend of a whip battering the frontdoor brought her to her feet with a bound she began dusting herself hastily with her hand well whatre you gawkin at she inquired kint you go an unbar the door stead o standin there like a stuck pig matt knew the symptoms of volcanic extinction without further parley he ran to the door and took down the beechen bar the visitor was ole hey who drove the mail the deacon came in powdered as from his own gristmill and added the snow of his topboots to the drift in the hall there were leatherfaced mittens on his hands earlaps on his cap tied under the chin a black muffler hoary with frost from his breath round his neck and mouth and an outer coat of buffaloskin swathing his body down to his ankles so that all that was visible of him was a little inner circle of red face with frosted eyebrows mrs strang stood ready in the hall with a genial smile and matt his heart grown lighter returned to the kitchen extracted the family footgear from under the stove where it had been placed to thaw and putting on his own stillsodden topboots he set about shaving whittlings and collecting kindlings to build the fire here we are again hey cried the deacon as heartily as his perpetual colossal quid would permit do tell is it really you replied mrs strang with her pleasant smile yesdooty is dooty i allus thinks he said spitting into the snowdrift and flicking the snow over the tobaccojuice with his whip whatever deacon haileys hand finds to do he does fustratethets a fact it dont seem so long a while since you and me were shakin our heels in the sir roger nay dont look so peakedtheres nuthin to make such a touse about you air a particler baptist hey an i guess you kinder allowed deacon hailey would be late with the mail hey but hes es spry es if hed gone to bed with the fowls you wont find the beat of him among the young fellers nowadaysthets so theyre a lazy slinky lot and es for doin their dooty to their country or their neighbor hev you brought me a letter interrupted mrs strang anxiously i guessbut youre goin out airly i allowed id walk over to the village to see if it hed come oh but it aint the one you expec no she faltered i guess not thets why i brought it myself i kinder scented it was suthin special and so i reckoned id save you the trouble of trudgin to the postoffice deacon hailey aint the man to spare himself trouble to obleege a fellowcritter do es youd be done by hey the deacon never lost an opportunity of pointing the moral of a position perhaps his sermonizing tendency was due to his habit of expounding the sunday texts at a weekly meeting or perhaps his weekly exposition was due to his sermonizing tendency thank you mrs strang extended her hand for the letter he produced it slowly apparently from up the sleeve of his topmost coat a wet forlornlooking epistle addressed in a sprawling hand mrs strang turned it about puzzled praps its from uncle matt ejaculated matt appearing suddenly at the kitchen door youve got uncle matt on the brain said mrs strang its a halifax stamp she could not understand it her own family rarely wrote to her and there was no hand of theirs in the address deacon hailey lingered on apparently prepared in his consideration for others to listen to the contents of his fellowcritters letter ah sonny he said to matt only jest turned out and not slicked up yet when i was your age i hed done my days chores afore the day hed begun no wonder the province is so tarnally behindhand hey thets so matt murmured pop pop pop was all that he heard so that ole heys moral exhortations left him neither a better nor a wiser boy mrs strang still held the letter in her hand apparently having become indifferent to it ole hey did not know she was waiting for him to go so that she might put on her spectacles and read it she never wore her spectacles in public any more than she wore her nightcap both seemed to her to belong to the privacies of the inner life and glasses in particular made an old woman of one before ones time if she had worn out her eyes with needlework and tears that was not her neighbors business the deacon with no sign of impatience elaborately unbuttoned his outer buffaloskin then the overcoat beneath that and the coat under that and then pulling up the edge of his cardigan that fitted tightly over his waistcoats he toilsomely thrust his horny paw into his breechespocket and hauled out a fig of blackjack then he slowly produced from the other pocket a small toolchest in the guise of a pocketknife and proceeded to cut the tobacco with one of the instruments come here sonny he cried the deacon wants you said mrs strang matt moved forward into the passage wondering ole hey solemnly held up the wedge of blackjack he had cut and when matts eye was well fixed on it he dislodged the old chaw from his cheek with contortions of the mouth and blew it out with portentous gravity lastly he replaced it by the wedge of blackjack mouthed and moulded the new quid conscientiously between tongue and teeth and passed the ball into his right cheek thets the way to succeed in life sonny never throw away dirty afore you got clean hey poor matt unconscious of the lesson waited inquiringly and deferentially but the deacon was finished and turned again to his mother i spect it ll be from some of the folks to home mebbe mebbe replied mrs strang longing for solitude and spectacles when did you last hear from the boss he was in the south seas the captn sellin beads to the savages hed a done better to preach em the word i do allow ah you kint expect godliness from sailors said the deacon its in the sea es the devil spreads his nets thets a fact the apostles were fishermen mrs strang reminded him yes but fishers aint sailors mrs strang its in furrin parts that the devil lurks and the further a man goes from his family the nearer he goes to the devil hey mrs strang winced but hes gittin our way now she protested unguardedly hes comin south with a freight ah joined the blockaderunners hey mrs strang bit her lip and flushed i dont kear the deacon said reassuringly i dont see why nova scotia should go solid for the north whats the north done for nova scotia cept ruin us with their protection dooties gol durn em they wont have slaves hey aint we their slaves dont they skin us es clean es a bear does a sheep aint they allus on the lookout to snap up the province but i never talk politics if the north and south want to cut each others throats thats not our consarn mind your own business i allus thinks hey and if your boss kin make a good spec by provisionin the southerners youll be a plaguy sight better off i vow and so will ifor you know i shall hev to call in the mortgage unless you fork out thet thar interest purty slick theres no underhandedness about deacon hailey he gives you fair warnin drectly the letter comes you shall have itive often told you so mebbe thetll be his letter after allput his thumb out i guess and borrowed another fellers hey nohed be nowhere near halifax said mrs strang her feverish curiosity mounting momently dont them thar

wouldnt kear to write an answer nowid be tolerable pleased to post it for you down thar allus study your fellowcritters i allus thinks no thank you deacon hailey spat deliberately on the floor eryou got to home safe this mornin yes thank you we all come together me and harriet and matt twere a lovely walk in the moonlight with the aurora borealis aquiverin and aflushin on the northern horizon ahh said the deacon slowly and rather puzzled a roarer hey at this moment a sudden stampede of hoofs and a mad jangling of bells were heard without with a durn them beasts the deacon breathlessly turned tail and fled in pursuit of the mailsleigh mounting it over the luggagerack when he had turned the corner matts grinning face emerged from behind the snowcapped stump of a juniper i reckon i fetched him thet time he said throwing away the remaining snowball as he hastened gleefully inside to partake of the contents of the letter he found his mother sitting on the old settle in the kitchen her spectacled face gray as the sand on the floor her head bowed on her bosom one limp hand held the crumpled letter she reminded him of a drooping foxglove the room had a heart of fire now the stove in the centre glowed rosily with rockmaple brands but somehow it struck a colder chill to matts blood than before fathers drownded his mother breathed hell never know bout billy now he thought with a gleam of relief mrs strang began to wring her mittened hands silently and the letter fluttered from between her fingers matt made a dart at it and read as follows dear marmdont take on but ime sorrie to tell you that the cap is a gone goose we run the block kade oust slick but the time we was took by them allfird yanks we reckkend to bluff em in the fog but about six bells a skwad of friggets bore down on us sudden like ole nick the cap he sees he was hemd in on a lee shoar and he swears them lubberly northers shant have his ship not if he goes to davy jones his loker he lufs her sharp up into the wind and sings out lower the longbote boys and while the shot was tearin and crashin through the riggin he springs to the hallyards and hauls down the cullers then jumps through the lazzaret into the store room kicks the head of a carsk of ile in clinches a bit of oakem dips it in the ile and touches a match to it and drops it on the deck into the runin ile and then runs for it hisself jumps into the bote safe with the cullers and we sheer off into the fog mufflin our oars with our caps and afore that tarnation flame bust out to show where we were we warnt there but we heard the everlastin fools poundin away at the poor old innocent sally bell till your poor boss dear marm he larfs and ses he shipmets ses he look at good old sally shes stickin out her yellow tongue at em and

blind on a reef and capsized but we all struck out for shore and allowed the cap was setting sale the same way as the rest on us but when we reached the harbor the cap he warnt at the helm and a shipmet ses ses he as how he would swim with that air bundle of cullers that was still under his arm and they tangelled round his legs and sorter dragged him under and kep him down like seaweed and

gist of the letter then stood folding it carefully at a loss what to say to the image of grief rocking on the settle from the barn behind came the lowing of daisyhalf protestation half astonishment at the unpunctuality of her breakfast matt found a momentary relief in pitying the cow then his mothers voice burst out afresh my poor davie she moaned cut off afore you could repent too deep down fur me to kiss your dead lips i hevnt even got a likeness o you you never would be took i shall never see your face again on airth and i misdoubt if ill meet you in heaven of course you willhe saved his flag

he asked acts chapter eleven verse fifteen muttered his mother it was the finger of god whats thet you say bout harriet aint she finished tittivatin herself yetwith her father layin dead too she got up and walked to the foot of the stairs harriet she shrieked harriet dashed down the stairs neat and pretty you onchristian darter cried mrs strang revolted by her sprightliness dont you know fathers drownded harriet fell halffainting against the banister mrs strang caught her and pulled her towards the kitchen there there she said dont freeze out here my poor child the lords will be done harriet mutely dropped into the chair her mother drew for her before the stove daisys bellowing became more insistent an he never lived to take me back to halifax arter all moaned mrs strang never mind mother said harriet gently god will send you back some day you hev suffered enough mrs strang burst into tears for the first time ah you dont know what my life hes been she cried in a passion of selfpity harriet took her mothers mittened hand tenderly in hers yes we do motheryes we do we know how you hev slaved and struggled as she spoke a panorama of the slow years was fleeting through the minds of all threethe long blank weeks uncolored by a letter the fight with poverty the outbursts of temper all the longdrawn pathos of lonely lives tears gathered in the childrens eyesmore for themselves than for their dead father who for the moment seemed but gone on a longer voyage harriet said mrs strang choking back her sobs bring down my poor little orphans and wrap them up well well say a prayer harriet gathered herself together and went weeping up the stairs matt followed her with a sudden thought he ran up to his room and returned carrying a square sheet of rough paper his mother had sunk into harriets chair he lifted up her head and showed her the paper davie she shrieked and showered passionate kisses on the crudelycolored sketch of a sailora figure that had a strange touch of vitality a vivid suggestion of brine and breeze she arrested herself suddenly you pesky varmint she cried so this is what become o the flyleaf of the big bible matt hung his head it was empty he murmured yes but theres another page thet aintthet tells you to obey your parents this is how you waste your time stead o woodchoppin uncle matt earns his livin at it he urged uncle matts a villain dont you go by your uncle matt fur lans sake she rolled up the drawing fiercely and matt placed himself apprehensively between it and the stove you said he wouldnt be took he remonstrated mrs strang sullenly placed the paper in her bosom and the action reminded her to remove her bonnet and sacque harriet drooping and listless descended the stairs carrying the twoyearold and marshalling the other little onesa blinking bewildered group of cherubs with tousled hair and tumbled clothes sprat came down last stretching himself sleepily he had kept the same late hours as matt and returning with him from the muddin frolic had crept under his bed the sight of the children moved mrs strang to fresh weeping she almost tore the baby from harriets arms he never saw you she cried hysterically closing the wee yawning mouth with kisses her eyes fell on billy limping towards the redhot stove where the others were already clustered an he never saw you she cried to him as she adjusted the awed infant on the settle or it would hev broke his heart kneel down and say a prayer for him you mischeevious little imp billy thus suddenly apostrophized paled with nervous fright his big gray eyes grew moist a lump rose in his throat but he knelt down with the rest and began bravely our father which art in heaven well what are you stoppin about jerked his mother for the boy had paused suddenly with a strange light in his eyes i never knowed what it meant afore he said simply his mothers eye caught the mystic gleam from his a sign a sign she cried ecstatically as she sprang up and clasped the little cripple passionately to her heaving bosom chapter ii the dead man makes his first and last appearance the death of his fatherof whom he had seen so littlegave matt a haunting sense of the unsubstantiality of things what that strong wiry man with the shrewd weatherbeaten face and the great tanned hands and tattooed arms was only a log swirling in the currents of unknown waters in vain he strove to figure him as a nebulous spiritthe conception would not stay nay the incongruity seemed to him to touch blasphemy his father belonged to the earth and the seas had no kinship with clouds how well he remembered the day nearly three years ago when they had parted forever and indeed it had been sufficiently stamped upon his memory without this final blow it is a day of burning augustso torrid that they have left their coats on the beach they are out on the sand flats wading for salmon among the giant saucers of salt water the miniature lakes left by the tide for this is one of the rare spots in the province where the fish may be taken thus what fun it is spearing them in a joyous rivalry that makes the fishers wellnigh jab each others toes with their pitchforks and completely tear each others shirtsleeves away in the friendly tussle for a darting monster so that the heat blisters their arms with great white blobs that stand out against the brown of the boys skin and the ornamental coloring of the mans now and then in their early course when tiny threads of water spurt from holes in the sand they pause to dig up the delicate clam with savory anticipations of chowder farther and farther they wander till their backs are bowed with the spoil the shellfish in a little basket the scaly fish strung together by a small rope passing through their gills the boy carries the shad and the man the heavier salmon at last as they are turning homeward late in the afternoon matt stands still suddenly rapt by the poetry of the scene the shimmering pools the stretch of brown sand strewn with seaweeds the background of red headlands crowned with scattered yellow farms embosomed in sombre green spruces and brooding over all the windless circle of the horizon its cold blue veiled and warmed and softened by a palpitating luminous diaphanous haze of pale amethyst tinged with rose he knows no word for what he sees he only feels the beauty come along sonny says his father looking back but the boy lingers still till the man rejoins him puzzled whats in the wind he asks is farmer wades barn on fire everythins on faar says the boy waving his pitchfork comprehensively his dialect differs a whit from his moretravelled fathers in his little godforsaken corner of acadia the variouslyproportioned mixture of english and american which with local variations of lowland and highland scotch north of ireland brogue and french patois loosely constitutes a novascotian idiom is further tinged with the specific peculiarities that spring from illiteracy and rusticity david strang smiles why you are like brother matt he says in amused astonishment all day his sons prattle has amused the stranger but this is a revelation like your wicked brother matt queries the boy in amaze davids smile gleams droller avast there you mustnt hearken to the mother she knows naught o matt cept what i told her she is halifax bred and we lived way up country i ran away to sea and left him anchored on dads farm when i made port again dad was gone to glory and matt to england with a petticoat in tow but mother said he sold the farm an your share too and if he didnt its a pity he had improved the land hadnt he and i might have been sarved up at fish dinners for all he knew i dont hold with this frenchy law that says all the bairns must share and share alike the good old scotch fashion is good nough for mematts the heir and god bless him then why didnt you marry a scotchwoman asked matt with childish irrelevance twas your mothers fault answers david with a halfwhimsical halfpathetic expression and why didnt you take her to sea with you nay nay the mother has no stomach for it nor i either and then there was harrieta little body in long clothes and the land was pretty nigh cleared he adds with a suspicion of apology in his accent and we couldnt grow nough to pay the mortgage if i hadnt shipped again and why am i like uncle oh he used to be allus lookin at the skynot to find out whether to git the hay in mind you but to make little picturs on the sly in the haymow on sundays and at last he sold the farm and went to london to make em matts heart begins to throba strange new sense of kinship stirs within him hev you got any of them thar picturs he inquires eagerly not one says david shaking his head contemptuously his clouds were all right because clouds may be anything but when he came to cows their own dams wouldnt know em and as for his shipswhy he used to hoist every inch o canvas in a hurcane i wouldnt trust him to tattoo a galleyboy but he had a power of industry dear old matt and i guess hes larnt better now for when i writ to him tellin him i was alive and goin to get spliced he writ back he was settled in london in the pictur line and makin money at it and goodluck to him matts heart swells that one can actually make money by making pictures is a new idea he has never imagined that money can be made so easily why he might help to pay off the mortgage he does not see the need of going to london to make themhe can make them quite well here in his odd moments and one day he will send them all to this wonderful kinsman of his and ask him to sell them five hundred at sixpence eachwhy it sounds like one of those fary calculations with which mctavit sometimes dazzles the schoolroom he wonders vaguely whether pictures are equally vendible at that other mighty city whence his mother came and if so whether he may not perhaps help her to accomplish the dream of her married lifethe dream of going back there an uncles got the same name as me he cries in ecstasy i should put it tother way sonny says his father dryly though when i give it you in his honor i didnt calclate it ud make you take arter him but dont you git it into your figurehead that youre goin to londonyouve jest got to stay right here and look arter the farm for mother see the picturs that gods made are good nough for methats so oh yes dad i shall allus stay on here answers matt readily its billy who allus wants to be a pirate silly billy he says his father silences him with a sudden damn whats the matter he asks startled i guess youre the silly billy standin jabberin when the tides arushin in well have to run for it matt gives a hasty glance to the left then takes to his heels straight across the sands in pace with his father the famous bore of the bay of fundy in a northerly inlet of which they have been fishing is racing towards them from the left and to get to shore they must shoot straight across the galloping current they are at the head of the bay where the tide reaches a maximum speed of ten miles an hour and the sailor so rarely at home has forgotten its idiosyncrasy you might ha kep your weathereye open he growls i wonder youve never been drownded afore we shall never do it father pants matt taking no notice of the reproach for the waves are already lapping the rim of the little sand island cut out by freshwater rivulets on which they find themselves and the pools in which they had waded are filling up rapidly throw em away jerks the father and matt with a sigh of regret unstrings his piscine treasures and economically putting the string into his pocket speeds on with renewed strength but the sun flares mercilessly through the fulgent haze and when they reach the end of their island they step into three feet of water with the safe shore a quarter of a mile off david strang a human revolver in oaths goes off in a favorite sequence of shots but hangs fire in the middle as if damped strikes me the mother ll quote scripture he says grimly instead i suppose you cant swim sonny he adds not so fur nor thet says matt meekly david grunts in triumphant anger and shifting his pitchfork to his left hand he grasps matt with his right and lifts him back on to the burning sand already soddened by a thin frothy wash now then han us your fork he says crossly he knocks out the iron prongs of both the pitchforks ties the wooden handles securely together by the string from matts discarded fish and fixes the apparatus across the boys breast and under his arms to finish the job easily he has to climb back on the sand island for though he stands in a little eddy it is impossible to keep his feet against the fierce swirl of the waters and even on the island where there are as yet only a few inches of sea the less sturdy matt is almost swept away to the right by the mad cavalry charge of the tide on his left flank now then cries david its about time we were home to supper ill swim ye for your flapjacks but father says matt youre not going to carry the fish on your back they wont carry me on theirs david laughs regaining his goodhumor as the critical moment arrives what would the mother think if we came home without a prize in tow avast there ill larn you how ill get out of carryin em on my back and with a chuckle he launches himself into the eddy and shoots forward with a vigorous sidestroke this side up with care he cries cheerily jump sonny straight forards and in a moment the man and the boy are swimming hard for the strip of shore directly opposite the sand island the spot where they had left their coats hours before but neither has the slightest expectation of reaching it for the tide is sweeping them with fearful velocity to the right of it so that their course is diagonal and if they make land at all it will be very far from their original startingpoint david keeps the boy to port and adjusts his stroke to his after a while feeling himself well buoyed up by the handles matt breathes more easily and gradually becomes quite happy for the water is calm on the surface and of the warmth and color of tepid caf au lait quite a refreshing coolness after the tropical air and he watches with pleasure the rosy haze deepening into purple without losing its transparency they pass seagulls fighting over the dead fish which matt left behind and which have been carried ahead of him in their unresisting course were drifting powerful from them thar coats grumbles david twill be a tiresome walk back if it warnt for them we could cut across country when we make port matt strains his vision to the left but sees only the purple outline of five islands and in the far background the faint peaks of the cobequid hills waal im darned exclaims his father suddenly if them thar coats aint comin to meet us its a pity and presently sure enough matt catches sight of the coats hastening along near the shore we must cut em off afore they pass by cries his father hilariously spurt sonny spurt tis a race twixt them and us seabirds begin to circle low over their heads scenting davids fish but he pushes steadily on animating his son with playful racing cries we oughter back the coats he observes theyve backed us many a time just a leetle quicker he says at last or theyll git past yonder pint and then theyre off to truro matt kicks out more lustily then his heart almost stops as he suddenly sees death beneath the lovely purple haze it is the human swimmers who are in danger of being carried off to truro if they do not make the shore earlier than yonder pint for matt remembers all at once that it is the last point for miles the shore curving deeply inward even if they reach the point in time they will be thrown back by the centrifugal swirl they must touch the shore earlier to get in safely he perceives his father has been aware of the danger from the start and has been disguising his anxiety under the pretext of racing the coats he feels proud of this strong brave man the cold terror passes from his limbs and he spurts bravely thats a little man says david well catch em yet lucky its sandstone yonder stead o sandno fear o gettin sucked in now it is the shore that seems racing to meet themthe red reef sticks out a friendly finger and in another five minutes they are perched upon it like gulliver on the brobdingnagians thumb and what is more they tie with their coats meeting them just at the landingplace david laughs a long homeric laugh at the queerness of the incident quivering like a dog that shakes himself after a swim and matt smiles too them thar seabirds air a bit off their feed thats a fact chuckles david as he surveys his fish and then the two cut across the forest drying and steaming in the sun the elder exhorting the younger to silence and hiding the prongless pitchforks in the haymow before they enter the house all smiles and salmon at the early teasupper they sit in dual isolation at one end of the table their chairs close but lo mrs strang passing the hot flapjacks or corndodgers with the superfluous perambulations of an excitable temperament brushes the back of her hand against matts shoulder starts pauses and brushes it with her palm why the boys wringin wet she cries we went wadin david reminds her meekly yes but you dont wade on your heads she retorts i sorter tumbled matt puts in anxious to exonerate his father mrs strang passes her hand down her husbands jacket an father kinder stooped to pick me up adds matt youre a nice moloch to trust with ones children she exclaims in terrible accents david shrinks before the blaze of her eyes almost feeling his coat drying under it an when you kint manage to drownd em you try to kill em with rheumatics and then i hev all the responsibility its nough to make a body throw up the position take off your clothes both o you both of them look at each other feeling vaguely the indelicacy of stripping at table they put their hands to their jackets as if to compromise then a simultaneous recollection crimsons their facestheir shirtsleeves are gone so david rises solemnly and leads the way upstairs and matt follows and mrs strangs voice brings up the rear and goes with them into the bedroom stinging and excoriating they shut the door but it comes through the keyhole and winds itself about their naked limbs mrs strang distributing flapjacks to her brood all the while and david biting his lips to block the muzzle of his oathrepeaterfor he never swears before mother and the children except when he is not angrysuddenly remembers that if he is to join his ship at st johns by thursday he must take the packet from partridge island tomorrow his honeymoon is over he has this honeymoon every two or three years and his beautiful beloved is all amorousness and amiability and the best room with the canebottomed chairs is thrown open for occupation but after a few weeks mrs strang is repossessed of her demon and then it is david who throws up the position and goes down to the sea in a ship and does more businessof a mysterious sortin the great waters and so on the morrow of the adventure he kisses his bairns and his wifeall amorousness and amiability againand passes with wavings of his stick along the dusty road under the red hemlocks over the brow of the hill and sointo the great beyond passes and with him all that savor of strange romantic seas all that flavor of bustling foreign ports that he brings to the lonely farm and that cling about it even in his absence exhaling from envelopes with picturesque stamps and letters with exotic headings passes narrowing the universe for his little ones and making their own bit of soil sterner and their winter colder he is dead this brawny suntanned father incredibly dead and the dead face haunts mattno vaporous mask but stonily substantial bobbing grewsomely in a green sickly light fathoms down with froth on its lips and slimy things of the sea twining in its hair he looks questioningly at his own face in the fragment of mirror trying to realize that it too will undergo petrifaction and wondering how and when he looks at his mothers face furtively and wonders if the volcano beneath it will ever really sleep he pictures her rigid underground the long black eyelashes neatly drawn down and is momentarily pleased with the piquant contrast they make with the waxen skin is it possible the freshness and beauty of harriets face can decay too can billy sink to a painless rest with his leg perhaps growing straight again ah mayhap in billys case death were no such grisly mystery morbid thoughts enough for a boy who should be profiting by the goodness of the northwester towards boykind but even before this greater tragedy last years accident had taken the zest out of matts enjoyment of the ice in former good years he had been the first to cut fancy figures on the ponds and frozen marshes or to coast down the slopes in a barrelstave fitted with an upright and a crosspiecea machine of his own invention worthy of the race of craftsmen from which he sprang but this year the glow of the skaters blood became the heat of remorse when he saw or remembered billys wistful eyes he gave up skating and contented himself with modelling the annual man of snow for the school at cobequid village in the which farstraggling village to take time a little by the forelock his fathers death did not remain a wonder for the proverbial nine days for a week the young men chewing their evening quid round the glowing maplewood of the store stove or on milder nights tapping their toes under the verandas of the one village road as they gazed up vacantly at the female shadows flitting across the gabled dormerwindows of the snowroofed wooden houses spoke in their slightly nasal accent with an emphasis on the r of the pearls of the watter and calling for their nights letters held converse with the postmistress on the watter and its pearls and expectorated copiously presumably in lieu of weeping and the outlying farmers who dashed up with a lively jingle of sleighbells to tether their horses to the hitchingposts outside the stores or to the picketfence surrounding the little wooden meetinghouse for the most combined business with religion were regaled with the news ere they had finished swathing their beasts in their buffalo robes and boots and it lent an added solemnity to the appeal of the little snowcrusted spire standing out ghostly against the indigo sky and of the frosty windows glowing mystically with blood in the gleam of the chandelier lamps and mayhap wrought more than the drawling exposition of the fusty frockcoated minister and the old grannies smoking their clay pipes as they crouched nidnodding over the winter hearth their wizened faces ruddy with firelight mumbled and grunted contentedly over the tidbit and sighed through snuffclogged nostrils as they spread their gnarled skinny hands to the dancing balsamic blaze but after everybody had mourned and moralized and expectorated for seven days a new death came to oust david strangs from popular favor a death which had not only novelty but equal sensationalism combined with a more genuinely local tang for it involved a funeral at home handsome susan hailey driving her horses recklessly her black feather waving gallantly in the wind had dashed her sleigh upon a trunk uprooted by the storm and hidden by the snow she was flung forward her head striking the tree so that the brave feather dribbled blood while the horses bolted off to cobequid village to bear the tragic news in the empty sleigh and so the young men with the carbuncles of tobacco in their cheek expectorated more and spoke of the pearls of the land and walking home from the singingclass the sopranos discussed it with the basses and in the sewingcircles where the matrons met to make undergarments for the heathen there was much shaking of the head with retrospective prophesyings and whispers of drink and commiseration for ole hey and all the adjacent villages went to the sermon at the house the deceased lady being as the minister to whose salary she annually contributed two kegs of rum remarked in his nasal address universally respected and everybody including the strangs and their collie went on to the lonesome graveyardsome on horse and some on foot and some in sleighs the coffin leading the way in a pung or long boxsleigha farstretching black nondescript procession crawling dismally over the white moaning landscape between the zigzag ridges of snow marking the buried fences past the trailing disconsolate firs and under the white funereal plumes of the pines chapter iii the thoughts of youth other rumors too came by coach to the villagerumors of blizzard and shipwreckeach with its opportunities of exhortation and expectoration but in the lonely forest home past which the dazzling mailcoach rattled with only a blast on the horn the tragic end of david strang stood out in equal loneliness for death when he smites the poor often cuts off not only the beloved but the breadwinner and though in a literal sense the strangs made their own bread yet it was david who kept the roof over their head and the ground under their feet but for his remittances the interest on the mortgage under which they held the farm and the house could not have been paid for the produce of the clearing the bit of buckwheat and barley barely maintained the cultivators both harriet and matt eking out the resources of the family by earning a little in kind sometimes even in money matt was a skilful soapmaker decorating his bars with fanciful devices and he delighted in sugaringa poetic process involving a temporary residence in a loghut or a lumbermans cabin in the heart of the forest now that the overdue mortgage money had gone to the bottom of the sea more money must be raised immediately that the dead man had any claim upon the consideration of his employers did not occur to the bereaved family rather it seemed he owed the owners compensation for the lost sally bell a family council was held on the evening of the day so blackly begun not even the baby was excludedit sat before the opendoored stove on its mothers lap and crowed at the great burning logs that silhouetted the walls with leaping shadows sprat too was present crouched on matts mat as the children called the rag mat their brother had braided thrusting forward his black muzzle when the door rattled with special violence and by his side lay the boy staring into the tumbling flames yet taking the lead in the council with a new authoritative ring in his voice wherever the realities of life beleaguer the soul there children are born serious and experience soon puts an old head on young shoulders the beadyeyed pappoose that the indian squaw carries sandwichwise twixt back and board does not cry dump it down and it stands stolid like a pawn on a chessboard hang it on a projecting knot in the props of a wigwam and it sways like a snared rabbit matt strang strenuous little soul had always a gravity beyond his years his fathers removal seemed to equal his years to his gravity he knew himself the head of the house harriet despite her superior summers was of the wrong sex and his mother though she had physical force to back her was not a reasoning being for a time no doubt she would be quieted by the peace of the grave which all but the crowing infant felt solemnizing the household but matt had no hope of more than a truce it was the boys brain and the boys voice that prevailed at the councilfire daisy was to be killed and salted down and soldfortunately she was getting on in years and besides they could never have had the heart to eat their poor old friend themselves with her affectionate old nose and her faithful udders the calves were to become veal and all this meat together with the fodder thus set free deacon hailey was to be besought to take at a valuation in lieu of the mortgage money for money itself could not be hoped for from cobequid village though the almighty dollar ruled here as elsewhere it was an unseen monarch whose imperial court was at halifax there matt might have got current coin here barter was all the vogue accounts were kept in english money it was not till a few years later that the dollar became the standard coin for their own eating matt calculated that he would catch more rabbits and shoot more partridges than in years of yore and in the summer he would work on neighboring farms harriet would have to extend her sewing practice and collaborate with matt in making shadnets for the fishermen and mrs strang would get spinning jobs from the farmers wives which being settled with a definiteness that left even a balance of savings the widow handed the infant in her arms to harriet and replacing it by the big bible she slipped on her spectacles with a nervous involuntary glance round the kitchen and asked the sixyearold teddy to stick a finger into the book opening the holy tome at that place she began to read from the head to the end of the chapter in a solemn prophetic voice that suited with her black cap pinched up at the edges she had no choice of texts pricking was her invariable procedure when she felt a call to prelection and the issue was an uncertainty dubiously delightful for one day there would be a story or a miracle to stir the childrens blood and another day a bald genealogy and a third day a chapter of revelation all read with equal reverence as equally inspiring parts of an equally inspired whole matt breathed freely when his mother announced ezra chap x not because he had any interest in ezra but because he knew it was a pictureless portion when the text was liable to be interrupted by illustrations the reading was liable to be interrupted by remonstrances for scarce a picture but bore the marks of his illuminating brush and his rude palette of ground charcoal chalk and berryjuice he had been prompted to color before his hand itched to imitate and in later years these episodes of the far east had found their way to planed boards of western pine with the figures often in new experimental combinations and these scenes were in their turn planed away to make room for others equally unsatisfactory to the critical artist but his mother had never been able to forgive the iniquities of his prime not even after she had executed vengeance on the sinner she had brought the sacred volume from her home at halifax and a colored bible she had never seen color made religion cheerful destroyed its essential austerityit could no more be conceived apart from black and white than a minister of the gospel an especial grievance hovered about the early chapters of exodus for matt had stained the red sea with the reddish hue of the bay of fundya sacrilege to his mother to whose fervid imagination the sea of miracles loomed lurid with sacred sanguineousness to which no profane water offered any parallel but ezra is far from exodus and tonight the reminder was not likely a gleam of exaltation illumined the readers eyes when she read the first verse at the second her face seemed to flush as if the firelight had shot up suddenly now when ezra hed prayed an when he hed confessed weepin an castin himself down before the house of god there assembled unto him out of israel a very great congregation of men and women and children fur the people wept very sore an shechaniah the son of jehiel one of the sons of elam answered an said unto ezra we hev trespassed against our god an hev taken strange wives of the people of the land she read on pausing only at the ends of the verses harriet knitted stockings over babys head the smaller children listened in awe matts thoughts soon passed from shechaniah the son of jehiel uninterested even by his relationship to elam usually when the subjectmatter was dull and when he was tired of watching the wavering shadows on the grayplastered walls he got up a factitious interest by noting the initial letter of each verse and timing its length in view of his sundayschool task of memorizing for each week a verse beginning with some specified letter his verbal memory being indifferent he would spend hours in searching for the tiniest verse wasting thereby an amount of time in which he could have overcome the longest though as he indirectly scanned great tracts of the bible it may be this a b c business was but the device of a crafty deacon skilled in the young idea however this be matts mind was deeplier moved tonight the shriek of the blind wind without contrasted with the cheerful crackle of the logs within and the woful contrast brought up that weird image destined to haunt him for so long he shuddered to think of itdown there in the cold excluded forever from the warm hearth of life was not that its voice in the windwailing crying to be let in shaking the door his eyes filled with tears vaguely he heard his mothers voice intoning solemnly an of the sons of immer hanani and zebadiah an of the sons of harim maaseiah an elijah an shemaiah an jehiel an uzziah an of the sons of pashur the baby was still smiling and tangling harriets knitting but billy had fallen asleep and presently matt found himself studying the flicker of the firelight upon the little cripples pinched face an of the sons of zattu elioenai eliashib mattaniah an jeremoth an zabad an aziza of the sons also of bebai the prophetic voice rose and fell unwaveringly unwearyingly dont you think i ought to write and tell uncle matt came suddenly from the brooding boys lips silence you son of belial cried his mother indignantly how dare you interrupt the chapter so near the end too uncle matt indeed whats the mortal use of writin to him i should like to know do you think hes likely to repent any to disgorge our land why he dont deserve to know his brothers dead the everlastin barabbas if hed hed to do o me he wouldnt hev found it so easy to make away with our inheritance i do allow and my poor david would hev been alive and to home here with us tonight thets a fact christ hev mercy on us all she burst into tears blistering the precious page harriet ceased to ply her needles they seemed to be going through her bosom the baby enjoyed a free hand with the wool billy slept on presently mrs strang choked back her sobs wiped her eyes and resumed in a steady reverential voice machnadebai shashai sharai azareel an shelemiah shemariah shallum amariah an joseph of the sons of nebo jeiel mattithiah zabad zebina jadau an joel benaiah all these hed taken strange wives an some of them hed wives by whom they hed children her voice fell with the wellknown droop that marked the close anyways she added i dont know your uncles address london is a big placeconsiderable bigger nor halifax an hell allow we want to beg of him never she shut the book with an emphatic bang and matt rose from sprats side and put it away of course i shant go back to school any more he said lightly remembering the point had not come up oh yes you will his mothers first instinct was always of contradiction i may get a job an raise a little money towards the mortgage what job kin you get in the winter why i kin winnow wheat some he reminded her an chop the neighbors wood an sort the vegetables in their cellars an whatever you make by thet she reminded him youll overbalance by what youd be givin away to the schoolmaster youve paid alic mctavit to the end o the season i guess youre off the track this load o poles mother said matt amused by her muddled finance yet it was the less logical if even more specious argument of completing the snow months for only young and useless children went to school in the summer that appealed to him the human mind is strangely under the sway of times and seasons and the calendar is the stanchest ally of sloth and procrastination and so mrs strang settled in temporary triumph to her task of making new black mourning dresses for the girls out of her old merino and a few days afterwards when matt had carried out his financial programme satisfactorily except that deacon haileys valuation did not afford the estimated surplus he joined the other children in their pilgrimage schoolward the young strangs amounted to a procession at its head came matt drawing billy on a little handsled by a breastrope that came through the augerholes in the peaks of the runners and the end of sprat who sneaked after the children formed a literal tail to it till arriving too far to be driven back the animal ran to the front in fearless gambollings this morning the air was keen and bright the absence of wind preventing the real temperature from being felt and the sun lit up the white woods with cold sparkle ere the children had covered the two miles most of them conceived such a new appetite that their fingers itched to undo their lunch packets a halt was called the breadandmolasses was unwrapped and while the future was being recklessly sacrificed to the present by the younger savages matt edified them by drawing on the snow with the point of billys crutch they followed the development of these designs with vociferous anticipation one shouting a cow and another ole hey before more than a curve was outlined matt always amused himself by commencing at the most unlikely part of the figure and working round gradually in unexpected ways so as to keep the secret to the last possible moment sometimes when it had been guessed too early he would contrive to convert a fox into a moose his enjoyment of his dexterity countervailing the twinge of his conscience today all the animals were tamer than usual the boy drew listlessly abstractedly unresentful when his secret was guessed in the first stages and at last half of itself the crutch began to shape a facea face with shut eyes and dripping hair indefinably uncanny father cried ted in thick triumphant tones exultation tempered by mastication but the older children held their breath and teddys exclamation was succeeded by an awesome silence suddenly a sagging bough snapped and fell the collie howled and matt roused from his reverie saw that billys face had grown white as the dead snow the child was palsied with terror matt feared one of his fits was coming on in a frenzy of remorse he blurred out the face with the crutch and hustled the sled forward singing cheerily gentle jesus meek and mild look upon a little child pity my simplicity and suffer me to come to thee the children took up the burden sifting themselves instinctively into trebles and seconds in a harmony loud enough to rouse the hibernating bear billys face returned to its normal pallor and matts to its abstraction in the schoolrooma bare plastered room cold and uninviting with a crowd of boys and girls at its notched pine deskshe continued pensive there was nothing to distract his abstraction for even ruth hailey was away the geography lesson roused him to a temporary attention london flitted across his dreamsthe halifax of england that mighty city in which pictures were saleable for actual coin and a mighty picturemaker the matt strang of england was paid for play as if for work but the readingbook with its menu of solid stories and essays peppered with religious texts restored him to his reveries mctavit who was shaping quills with his knife called upon him to commence the chapter but he stared at the little pedagogue blankly unaware of the call he was noting dreamily how his jagged teeth showed beneath the thin snuffy upper lip and the trick the mouth had of remaining wide open after it had ceased talking he tried to analyze why mctavit was not smiling months ago seeking to make his figures smile the boy had discovered the rident effect of a wide mouth and now he essayed to analyze the subtle muscular movements that separate the sublime from the ridiculous suddenly the haunting thought recurred to him with a new application even mctavits freckled face would one day be frozenthose twitching eyelids still the thin wide lips shut forever how long more would he stride about his motley schoolroom scattering blows and information would he come to a stop in the schoolroom as the clock sometimes did grown suddenly silent its oil congealed by the intense cold or would death find him in bed ready stretched and the restless boys and girls around himgood godthey too would one day be very peacefulmere blockscarroty kitty who was pinching amy warrens arm and peter besant who was throwing those pellets of bread and even simon the sneaks wagging tongue would be still as a plummet they would all grow rigid alike not all at once nor in one way but some very soon perhaps and others when they were grown tall and yet others when they were bent and grizzled some on sea and some on land some in this part of the map and some in that some peacefully some in pain petrified one by one ruthlessly remorselessly impartially till at last all the busy hubbub was hushed and of all that lively crew of youngsters not one was left to feel the sun and the rain the pity of it thrilled him even mctavits freckled face grew softer through the veil of mist then as his vision cleared he saw the face was really darker strange emotions seemed to agitate it so yere obstinate are ye it screamed with startling suddenness at the same instant something shining flew through the air and whizzing past matts ear sent back a little thud from behind matt turned his head in astonishment and saw a penknife quivering in the wall he turned back in fresh surprise and saw that mctavits face had changed lobsterlike from black to red as its owner realized how near had been matts and his own escape eh awake at last sleepyhead he blustered theres na gettin your attention well what are ye starin at are ye na goin to fetch me my knife im not a dog answered matt sullenly then dinna bark ye think because yeve lost your father yere preevilegedto lose your manners he added with an epigrammatic afterthought that mollified him more than an apology im verra obleeged to you he concluded with elaborate emphasis as simon the sneak handed him the knife now then sleepyhead he said again praps yell read your paragraphthats richt simon show him the place mctavit hailed from cape breton isle and was popularly supposed to soliloquize in gaelic this hurt him when he proposed to the postmistress who had been to boardingschool in truro she declared she would not have a man who did not speak good english i do speak guid english he protested passionately mebbe not in the schoolroom when im talkin only to my pupils and it dinna matter but in private and in society im most parteecular mctavit was still a bachelor and still spoke guid english when the readinglesson had come to an end matt was left again to his own thoughts for while poor mctavit gave the juniors an exercise in grammar which they alleviated by gumchewing matt and a few other pupils were allotted the tranquillizing task of multiplying in copybooks s d by the sums were so colossal that matt wondered whether they existed in the world and if so how many pictures it would be necessary to make to obtain them an awful silence brooded over the room for when written exercises were on the pupils took care to do their talking silently lest they should be suspected of copying this being what they were doing there was a little museum case behind mctavits desk containing stuffed skunks and other animals and local minerals lovingly collected by himstilbite and heulandite and quartz and amethyst and spar and bits of jasper and curiously clouded agate picked up near cape blomidon amid the dbris of crumbling cliffs at such times mctavit would stand absorbed in the contemplation of his treasures his rod carelessly tucked under his arm as one the world forgetting by the world forgot then the tension of silence became positively painful for the schoolroom had long since discovered that the museum case was a reflector and mctavit though he prided himself on the secret of his argus eye never caught any but novices not yet initiated into the traditions imagine therefore the shock both to him and the room when today the acute stillness was broken by a loud cry of bang bang bang an irresistible guffaw swept over the school and under cover of the laughter the cute and ready collogued as to answers silence thundered mctavit who was that in the even more poignant silence of reaction a small still voice was heard please sir it was me said matt remorsefully oh it was you was it then heres bang bang bang for ye and as he spoke the angry little man accentuated each bang with a vicious thwack then his eye caught sight of matts copybook in lieu of ranged columns of figures was a rough penandink sketch of a line of great warships overhung by smokeclouds and apparently converging all their batteries against one little ship on whose deck a stalwart man stood solitary wrapped in a flag mctavit choked with added rage ddefacin your books agen whatwhat dye call that he spluttered blockade said matt sulkily blockhead echoed mctavit and was so pleased with the universal guffaw whereof the cute and ready took advantage to compare notes as before that he contented himself with the one slash that was necessary to drive the jest home but it was one slash too much matts vocal cannonade had been purely involuntary but he was willing to suffer for his overvivid imagination the last insult howeversubtly felt as an injury to his dead father tooset his blood on fire he suddenly remembered that this blockhead was at any rate the head of a family that he could no longer afford to be degraded before the little ones who were looking on with pain and awe he rose and walked towards the door where are ye goin cried mctavit to find captain kidds treasure ive learned all i want to know said matt yed better come back matt turned walked back to his seat possessed himself of his halfempty copybook and walked to the door goodbye you fellers he said cheerfully as he passed out the girls he ignored mctavit gave chase with raised rod regardless of the pandemonium that rose up in his wake matt was walking slowly across the field with sprat leaping up to lick his face the dog had rejoined him mctavit went back his rod hanging down behind matt walked on sadly his blood cooled by the sharp air another link with the past was broken forever he looked back at the simple wooden schoolhouse with the ensign of smoke fluttering above its pitched roof kinder memories of mctavit surged at his hearthis little jests at the expense of the boys his occasional reminiscences of his native cape breton and of st john new brunswick with its mighty cathedral the life of napoleon he had lent him last year his prowess with line and hook the summer he boarded with the strangs in lieu of schoolfees and thenwith a sudden flashcame the crowning recollection of his talent for cutting turreted castles and tigers and anything you pleased out of the closegrained biscuits and the chunks of buckwheatcake the children brought for lunch matts thoughts went back to the beginnings of his school career when mctavit had spurred him on to master the alphabet by transforming his buckwheatcake into any animal from ass to zebra he remembered the joy with which he had ordered and eaten his first elephant pausing a moment to cut a stick and drive sprat off with it he walked back into the wondering schoolroom please sir im sorry i went away so rudely he said and ive cut you a new birch rod mctavit was touched thank you he said simply as he took it whats the matter he roared seeing simon the sneaks hand go up please sir hednt you better try if he hesnt split it and put a hair in grand idea yelled mctavit grimly hows that and the new birch rod made its trial slash at the raised hand chapter iv man proposes mrs strang was busy in deacon haileys kitchen the providential death of mrs hailey had given her chores to do at the homestead for female servantsor even malewere scarce in the colony and ruth had been brought up by her mother to play on the harpsichord when mrs strang got home after a three mile walk sometimes through sleet and slush she would walk up and down till the small hours spinning carded wool into yarn at her great uncouth wheel and weeping automatically at her loneliness reft even of the occasional husband for whom she had forsaken the great naval city of her girlhood the beautiful centuryold capital its nough to make a body throw up the position she would cry hysterically to the deaf rafters when the children were asleep and only the wind was awake but the droning wheel went round just the same steady as the wheel of time mrs strang moving to and fro like a shuttle till the task was completed and morning often found her illrested and fractious and lachrymose matt would have pitied her more if she had pitied herself less in the outside world however she had no airs of martyrdom bearing herself genially and independently at the revivals held in private houses she was an important sinful figure though neither harriet nor matt had yet found grace or membership she smiled a pleasant response tonight when deacon hailey came in from the tannery and said goodevenin it was a large low kitchen heated by an american stove with a gleaming dresser and black wooden beams from which hams hung the deacon felt more comfortable there than in the room in which ruth was at that moment engaged in tinkling the harpsichord a room that contained other archaic heirlooms old china a tapestry screen scriptural mottoes worked in ancestral hair and a large colored lithograph of the ark on mount ararat for refusing to come away from which matt had once been clouted by his mother before all the neighbors the house was indeed uncommonly luxurious sheltered by double doors and windows and warmly wrapped in its winter cincture of tanbark an hows billy asked the deacon some folks ud say hows billys mother but thet i can see fur myselfrael bonny and hansum thets a fact its sick folk es a christian should inquire arter hey billys jest the same replied mrs strang her handsome face clouding no more fits hey no not for a long time thank god but hell never be straight again ah mrs strang were all crooked somehow tis the lords will you may depend since my poor susan was took my hearts all torn and mangled my heartstrings kinder twisted bout her grave ah never kin i forgit her love is love i allus thinks my time was spent so happy plannin how to make her happyfor tis only in makin others happy that we git happy ourselves hey now i hev no wife to devote myself to my hans are empty i go bout lookin everyways fur sunday oh but im sure youve never got a minute to spare you may depend said the deacon proudly if i aint tarnally busy what with the tannery an the gristmill an the farm an the local mail its a pity i dont believe in neglectin dooty because your hearts bustin within he spat sorrowfully under the stove my motto is take kear o the minutes and the holidays ll take kear o themselves a man hes no time to waste in this oncivilized province where stinkin indians that never cleared an acre in their lazy lives hev the right to encamp on a mans land an cut down his best firs an ashes fur their butterbutts and baskets and then hev the imperence to want to swop the identical same for your terbacco its thievin i allus thinks rightdown breakin o the commandments hey well what kin you expec from papists replied mrs strang why fur sixpence the holy fathers forgive em all their sins taint often theyve got sixpence hey when lectionday comes round agen i wont vote fur no candidate that dont promise to coop all them greasy micmacs up in a reservation same es they do to newfoundland theyre not fit to mix with hardworkin christian folk them thar kids o yourn now i hope theyre proper industrious a child kint begin too airly to larn fieldwork hey ah theyre the best children in the world said mrs strang theyll do anythin an eat anythin een amost an never a crost word thets a fact the deacon suppressed a smile of selfgratulation labor was scarcer than ever that year and in his idea of marrying harriet strang which he was now cautiously about to broach the possibility of securing the gratuitous services of the elder children counted not a little enhancing the beauty of his prospective bride he replied feelingly im everlastin glad to hear it mrs strang for i know you kint afford t employ outside labor theyre goin to arx three shillins a day this summer the bloodsuckers the laborer is worthy of his hire quoted mrs strang yes but he allus wants to be highered hey a seasonable joke aint bad in its right place i allus thinks you neednt allus be pullin a long face thet matt of yourn now ive seen him with a face like ole jupes fiddle and walkin along es slow es a barkmill turns amost mrs strang sighed ah youre a good woman mrs strang theres no call to blush fur its true dye think deacon hailey hesnt got eyes for whats under his nose the way youre bringing up them thar kids is a credit to the province i only hopes theyll be proper thankful fur it when theyre growed up it makes my heart bleed amost i do declare many a time ive said to myself deacon hailey tis your dooty to do somethin fur them thar orphans many a time ive thought id take the elder ones off your hans theres plenty o room in the ole farmtwere built for children but theres ony ruth left an she isnt my own though when you see a gal around from infancy you forgits you aint the father hey what a pity poor sophias two boys were as delicate as herself sophia murmured mrs strang interrogatively thet was my fust wife afore you came to these parts she died young poor critter never shall i forgit her ah theres nothin like fust love i allus thinks if i hednt wanted to hev children to work fur i should never ha married agen but its a selfish business workin for ones own han i allus thinks

kind o you deacon but of course harriet couldnt live here with you hey why not shes too ole an how ole might she be gittin on for seventeen i guess thets not too ole for me he said with a guffaw mrs strang paused startled the idea took away her breath the deacon smiled on in the embarrassing silence the tinkle of ruths harpsichord sounded like an orchestra youwouldraellylike my harriet mrs strang said at last you may dependive thought a good deal of her a brisk an handy young critter with no boardinschool nonsense bout her he worked his quid carefully into the other cheek complacently enjoying mrs strangs overwhelmed condition presumably due to his condescension of course theres heaps of hansum gals every ways but booty is only skindeep i allus thinks shes very young too but thets rather in her favor you can eddicate em if you take em young train up a child hey but im afeared harriet wouldnt give up abner preep said mrs strang slowly shes the most obstinate gal thets a fact hey she walks out with abner preep nonot thet ive sot my face agin thet but i know she wouldnt give him up thets sartin ruths harpsichord again possessed the silence trilling forth doxology with an unwarranted presto movement mrs strang went on the time o your last muddin frolic she danced with him all night een amost and druv off home in his sleigh an there aint a quiltin party or a candypullin or an infare but she contrives to meet him scendalous exclaimed the deacon i dont see nothin scendalous replied mrs strang indignantly the young man wants to marry her genuine pears to me your darter is more scendalous amost playin hymns as if they were hornpipes i didnt arx my folks if i might meet my poor davie we went to dances and shows together and me a baptist god forgive me and harriets jest like thatthe hussyshe takes arter her mother but if you were to talk to her urged the deacon mrs strang shook her head shed stab herself sooner stab herself soonern give up abner preep soonern marry any one else the deacon paused to cut himself a wedge of tobacco imperturbably there was no trace of his disappointment visible with characteristic promptitude he was ready for the next best thing well who wants her to marry anybody else he asked raising his eyebrows you dont do you nno gasped mrs strang purpling thets right give her her head a bit it dont do to tie a grownup gal to her mammys apronstrings you may take a horse to the water but you kint make her drink hey no no dont you worry harriet with forcin husbands on her iikinderthought gasped mrs strang looking handsomer than ever in the rosy glow of confusion you kinder thought echoed old hey spitting accurately under the stove thet you wanted harriet thets so i guessed she could live here more comfortable than to home i dont ask no reward the widder and the orphan as scripter sayshey you didnt mean marriage hey shouted the deacon marriage me well i swow me whose susan hes only been dead five months a proper thing to suspec me of why all the neighbors ud be sayin susan is hardly cold in her grave afore hes thinkin of another i beg your pardin said the abashed woman an well you may i do declare five months arter the funeral indeed why ten months at least must elapse but you teetotally mistook my meanin mrs strang its a woman id be wantina woman with a heart an a soul not an unbroken filly all i was athinkin of was could thet thar abner preep clothe and feed your darter but i aint the man to bear malice and till you kin feel you kin trust her to him or some other man my house is open to her i dont draw back my offer and when i made it i was quite aware you would hev to be on the spot too to look arter herhey me well youre not too ole anyways and the deacon smiled again aready youre here all day een amost here he half knelt down to attend to the stove which was smoking very slightly it wouldnt be much of a change to sleep here hey oh but youre forgittin the other children deacon deacon hailey aint the man to forgit anythin i guess he said over his shoulder afore he talks he thinks he puts everythin in the tanpit an lets it soak hey is it likely id take you over here an leave the little uns motherless i never did like this kind of stove he fidgeted impatiently with the mechanism at the back making the iron rattle iidontunderstand faltered mrs strang her heart beginning to beat painfully how you do go on terday mrs strang when i aint talkin o marriage you jump at it and when i am you hang back like a mare afore a sixfoot dyke ah thets better and he adjusted the damper noisily with a great sigh of satisfaction you want to marry me gasped mrs strang the dark handsome features flushed yet deeper her bosom heaved youve struck it i do want ter thets plain he rose to his feet and threw his head back and his chest forward youll allus find me straightforward mrs strang i dont beat about the bush hey but i shouldnt hev spoke so prematoor if you hednt druv me to it by your mistake bout harriet es if i could marry a giddy young gal with her head full o worldly thoughts surely you must hev seen how happy ive been to hev you here arnin money to pay off your mortgage not that id acalled it in anyways whats thet thar little sum to me but i was thinkin o your feelins how onhappy you would be to owe me the money and then thinkin how to do somethin for your children i saw it couldnt be done without takin you into account a mother clings to her children nater is nater i allus thinks and the more i took you into account the more you figured up theres a great mother i thinks theres a godfearin woman an a godfearin woman is a crown to her husban hey if ever i do bring myself to marry agen thets the woman for my money i vow when i say money its ony speakin in parables like cause im not thet sort o man there air men as ud come to you an say see here mrs strang ive got fifty acres of fustclass intervalland an a thousand acres of upland and forestland an thirty head o cattle an a hundred sheep amost an a tannery thet with the shoemakers shop attached brings me in two hundred pound a year an a gristmill an i carry the local mail an ive shares and mortgages thet would make you open your eyes i tell you an im free from encumbrances een amost whereas youve got half a dozen but what does deacon hailey say he says jest put all thet outer your mind mrs strang an think ony o the manthink o the man with no one to devote himself to he took her hand and she did not withdraw it emotion made her breathing difficult in the new light in which he appeared to her she saw that he was still a proper manstraight and tall and sturdy and bright of eye despite his grizzled beard and hair an if you kint give him devotion in return jest you say so plump take a lesson from his straightforwardness hey dont you think o your mortgage or his moneybags cause money aint happiness hey an dont you go sacrificin yourself for your children thinkin o poor little billys future cause i dont hold with folks sacrificin themselves wholesale selfpreservation is the fust law of nater hey an it wouldnt be fair to me all ye hev to arx yourself is jest this kin you make deacon hailey happy in his declinin years he drew himself up to his full height without letting go her hand and his eyes looked into hers yes i say declinin yearstheres no deception the taters air all up to sample how ole might you think me fifty she said politely nearer sixty he replied triumphantly but i hev my cold bath every morninim none o your shaky boards that fly into etarnal bits at the fust clout hey but you hev been married twice she faltered so will you bewhen you marry me hey and the deacon lifted her chin playfully were neither on us rough timberweve both hed our wainy edges knocked off hey my father hed three wivesand hes still hale and heartya widower o ninety like father like son hey hes a deacon too down to digby as deacon hailey spoke of his father he grew middleaged to mrs strangs vision but she found nothing to reply and her thoughts drifted off inconsequently on the rivulet of sacred music but ruth wont like it she murmured at last hey whats ruth got to say in the matter i guess ruth knows her fifth commandment an so do i my father is the ony person whose blessin i shall arx on my spousals i allus make a pint o thet you may depend the pathetic picture of deacon hailey beseeching his fathers blessing knocked off ten years more from his age and it was a young and ardent wooer whose grasp tightened momently on mrs strangs hand we might go to see him together he said its an everlastin purty place digby id rayther see halifax said mrs strang weakly in the whirl of her thoughts ruths tinkling tune seemed the only steady thing in the universe oh if ruth would only play something bearing on the situation so that heaven might guide her in this sudden and fateful crisis halifax too some day said the deacon encouragingly laying his disengaged hand caressingly on her hair well go to the circus together she withdrew herself spasmodically from his touch dont ask me she cried youre presbyterian well and what was your last husban dont ask me harriet and matt air ongodly nough as it is theyve neither on em found salvation well i wont interfere with your doctrines you bet freedom o conscience i allus thinks we all sarve the same maker hey i guess youre purty reglar at our church though thets gods punishment on me for runnin away from halifax where i hed a church of my own to go to but he never cared nuthin bout the sential rite my poor davie i ought to ha been expelled from membership there and then thets a fact but the elders were merciful sometimes i think tis the old french nater that makes me backslide my grandfather came from paris in at the end o the amurcan war and settled to st margarets bay but then he married into a godfearin german family that emigrated there the same time amost and that ought to ha made things straight agen mrs strang talked on glad to find herself floating away from the issue but the deacon caught her by the hand again and hauled her back there wont be no backslidin in deacon haileys household you may depend he said when a woman hes a godly staytohome husband satan takes to his heels its widders and grasswidders es he flirts with hey mrs strang colored up again and prayed silently for help from the harpsichord i kint give you an answer yet she said feebly old hey slowly squirted a stream of tobaccojuice into the air as imperturbably as a stone fountain figure i dont want your answer yet didnt i tell you i couldnt dream of marryin agen for ages it dont matter your bein in a hurry cause your pardner left you three years back but i hev the morals o the township to consider its our dooty in life to set a good example to the weaker brethren i allus thinks eight months at least must elapse i ony spoke out now cause o your onfortunate mistake bout harriet and all i want is to be sure thet when i do come to ask you in proper form and in doo course you wont say no mrs strang remained silent and the harpsichord was silent too even that had deserted her its sound might have been tortured into some applicability but its silence could be construed into nothing unless it was taken to give consent and then all at once ruth struck a new chord mrs strang strained her ears to catch the first bar the deacon could not understand the sudden gleam that lit up her face when the instrument broke into the favorite nova scotian song the vacant chair at last heaven had sent her a sign there was a vacant chair and it was her mission to fill it well is thet a bargen asked the deacon losing patience if youre sure you want me breathed mrs strang in a flash the deacons arms were round her and his lips on hers she extricated herself almost as quickly by main force twarnt to be yet she cried indignantly of course not mrs strang retorted the deacon severely ony you asked if i was sure and i allowed id show you deacon hailey was genuine its sorter sealin the bargen hey i couldnt let you depart in onsartinty well behave yourself in future she said only half mollified as she readjusted her hair or ill throw up the position i guess ill be off now and she took bonnet and mantle from a peg not in anger mrs strang i hope let all bitterness be put away from you hey thet thar hansum face o yourn warnt meant for thunderclouds he hastened to help her on with her things and in the process effected a reconciliation by speaking of new onesstore clothesthat would set off her beauty better mrs strang walked airily through the slushy forest road as on a primrose path she was excited and radianther troubles were rolled away and her own and her childrens future assured and heaven itself had nodded assent her lonely heart was to know a lovers tenderness again it was swelling now with gratitude that might well blossom into affection how gay her home should be with festive companies to be balanced by mammoth revivalist meetings she would be the centre of hospitality and piety for the countryside but as she neared the housewhich seemed to have run halfway to meet herthe primroses changed back to slush and her face to its habitual gloom matt and harriet were alone in the kitchen the girl was crocheting the boy daubing flowers on a board which he slid under the table as he heard his mother stamping off the wet snow in the passage mrs strang detected the board but she contented herself by ordering him to go to bed then she warmed her frozen hands at the stove and relapsed into silence twenty times she opened her lips to address harriet but the words held back she grew angry with her daughter at last youre plaguy onsociable tonight harriet she said sharply me mother yes you you might tell a body the news theres no news to cobequid ole jupes come back from fiddlin at a colored ball way down hants county he says two darkies hed a fight over the belle harriet ceased and her needles clicked on irritatingly mrs strang burst forth you might ask a body the news what news can there be down to ole heys harriet snapped deacon hailey began mrs strang curiously stung by the familiar nickname and pricked by resentment into courage then her voice failed and she concluded almost in a murmur is athinkin of marryin agen the ole wretch ejaculated harriet calmly continuing her crocheting hes not so ole expostulated mrs strang meekly hes sixty why you might as well think o marryin the idea oh but im ony thirtyfive harriet well its jest es ole lovemakin is ony for the young thets jest where youre wrong harriet youth is enjoyment enough of itself it is the ole folks that hev nothin else to look fur thet want to be loved its the ony thing thet keeps em from throwin up the position an they marry sensibly young folks oughter wait till theyve got sense the longer they wait the less sense theyve got if two people love each other they ought to marry at once thets a fact yes if theyre two ole sensible people im tard o this talk o waitin said harriet petulantly how ole were you when you ran away with father you ondecent minx ejaculated mrs strang you werent no older nor me persisted harriet unabashed yes but i lived in a great city i saw young men of all shapes and sizes i picked from the treei didnt take the fust thet fell at my feet an how you can look at an onsightly critter like abner preep id rayther see you matched with roger besant for though his left shoulder is half an inch higher than the right amost from carrying heavy timbers in the shipyard he dont bend his legs like a couple o broken candles dont talk to me o roger besanthes a toad its abner i love i dont kear bout his legs his hearts in the right place you mean hes give it to you i reckon so an you will fly in my face i must said harriet sullenly if you dont take your face out o the way you imperent slummix an you will leave your mother alone es soon es abner kin build a house then if you marry abner preep

will take my face out o the way you onnatural darter i will take it to one thet preciates it there was a painful silence mrs strang eyed her daughter nervously harriet seemed dazed youd marry ole hey she breathed at last youd marry young preep retorted the mother im a young gal an im an ole woman two ole folks is es good a match es two young uns ah but you dont allow abner and me is a good match said harriet eagerly if you allow the deacon and me is their eyes met you see theres the young uns to think on said mrs strang if you were to go away how could i get along with the mortgage thets true said harriet relenting a little an if we were all to go to the farm thered be the house for you and abner harriet flushed rosily an mebbe the deacon wouldnt be hard with the mortgage mebbe murmured harriet her heart went pitapat but suddenly her face clouded but what will matt say she half whispered as if afraid he might be within hearing i guess hell be riled some oh hell be all right if you kinder break the news to him an explain the thing proper i reckon he wont take to the deacon at first the deacon its abner im thinkin on abner what does it matter what he thinks of abner taint es if matt was older nor you hes got nothin to say in the matter i do allow but he calls him bully preep and says he used to wallop him at mctavits and didnt he desarve it asked mrs strang indignantly he says he wont hev him foolin aroun he calls him a mean skunk and whos matt i should like to know to pass his opinions on his elders an betters you jest take no notice of his tarnation imperence and hell dry up its hevin a new father hell be peaked about thets why youd better do the talkin to matt then youll hev to tell him bout abner bargained harriet but neither had the courage chapter v peggy the waterdrinker the old year had rolled off into the shadows and the new had spun round as far as april spring came to earth for a few hours a day and behind her winter whistling clanged his iron gates refreezing the morass to which she had reduced the roads even at noon there was no genial current in the air unless you took the sheltered side of hills and trees and found spring nestling shyly in windless coverts though many a sennight had still to pass ere upon some more shaded hummock the harbinger mayflower would timidly put forth a white bud laden with delicate odor everywhere down the hills and along the tracks in every rut and hollow the sun saw a thousand dancing rivulets gleam and run and great freshets stir up the sullen iceladen rivers to sweep away dams and mills but the moon looked down on a white country demurely asleep early in the month matt having previously said farewell in earnest to mctavits schoolroom left home for the spring sugaring billy alas could not accompany him as of yore so sprat was left behind too by way of compensation to billy for company and cooperation matt took with him an indian boy whose christian name for he was a roman catholic was tommy matt had picked up tommy in the proximate woods where the noble savage ran wild in castoff christian clothes tommy belonged to a tribe that had recently pitched its wigwams in the backlands a mile from cobequid village to mrs strang who despatched the sugaring expedition and provisioned it he was merely a filthy brat who grinned like a chessy cat but to matt he incarnated the poetry of the primitive and even spoke it not that matt had more than a few words of algonquinese but tommy broke english quite unhesitatingly and his remarks if terse and infrequent were flowery and sometimes intelligible they generally ran backward after the manner of micmac which is as highly inflected as greek or hebrew for the admiring matt there was an atmosphere of romance about the red man which extended even to the red boy and he had set himself to win tommys heart in exchange for tobacco which was itself obtained by another piece of barter tommy smoked a clay pipe being early indurated to hardship after the spartan custom of his tribe there were sketches of tommy colored like the red sea or the bay of fundy in matts secret gallery tommy was easy to do owing to his other tribal habit of sitting silent for hours without moving a muscle it was only rarely that matt could extract from him native legends about glooscap the national hero and mundu the devil the two boys set out together for a rockmaple district five miles off drawing their impedimenta heaped high on a large sled they were fortified for a three weeks stay mrs strang had baked them several batches of bread and with unwonted enthusiasm supplied them with cornmeal for porridge and tea and sugar and butter and molasses and salt pork and beef all stowed into the barrel that would come home full of sugar their kitchen paraphernalia embraced a teapot and a teakettle a fryingpan and a pot while their manufacturing apparatus comprised tin pails yankee buckets dippers and axes guns ammunition and blankets completed their equipment matts painting materials were stowed away on his person unobtrusively they took possession of a disused logcabin formerly the property of a woodsman as the advertising agent would have put it had he penetrated to the backwoods possibly under his roseate vision it might have expanded into a detached villa without basement or a bungalow standing in its own grounds but a nonprofessional eye would have seen nothing but four walls and a pitched roof with a great square hole in it to let the light in and the smoke out these walls were built of unhewn logs in their rough natural bark the floor was even more primitive being simply the soil it was necessary to thaw it by lighting the fire on it before the stakes could be driven in to support the crosspieces from which the sugarpot depended then the boys chopped down a vast store of hardwood for fuel and lanced the tall maples catching their blood in birchbark troughs through pine spills they emptied the troughs into pails and carried the sap to their cabin and boiled it in the big pot and cooled it again to sugar a halcyon fortnight passed full of work yet leaving matt leisure for daubing boyish fancies on pieces of birchbark to cover withal the wooden walls of his home which the aforesaid advertiser might not unwarrantably have described as a studio with a novel toplight in a quiet neighborhood possibly matts mural decorations would have enhanced the description they comprised a fantastic medley of angels with faces more or less like ruth hailey and devils fashioned more or less after the similitude of bully preep and strange composite animals more or less like nothing on earth moving amid hills and ships and lurid horizons one night matt sat by the fire in the centre of the hut painting a more realistic picture and meditating a weeding of his gallery there had been no sap running that day a sudden return of winter had congealed it and so this extra artistic output during the comparatively idle hours had almost exhausted his hangingspace while he painted he gave an eye to the seething pot in which the sap must change to molasses and then thicken to maple syrup and then to maple wax ere it was ladled into the birchbark dishes and set to cool outside the hut a piece of fat pork hanging from a hook in the crosspiece just touched the surface of the sap and prevented it from effervescing tommy was asleep on a heap of fir boughs in a corner for the boys took it in turn to watch the pot and replenish the fire the soundness of tommys sleep tonight astonished matt for usually the young micmac slept the sleep of the vigilant aquiver at the slightest unwonted sound matt did not know that his ingenious partner had just completed the distillation of a crude rum from a portion of sap arrested at the molasses stage and that he had imbibed gloriously thereof matts paintingstool was an inverted bucket he wore a fur cap with pendent earlaps that gave him an elderly appearance and his feet were cased in moccasins made from the green shank of a cow for some time he painted steadily trying to reproduce the picturesque interior of the cabin with his rude homemade colors and brush the air was warm and charged with resinous odors the campfire burned brightly the hardwood flaming without snapping or crackling with only the soft hissing and spurting of liberated gases the fire purred as if enjoying the warmth the yellow billows curled round the bulging bottom of the threelegged pot and sent up delicate spirals of blue smoke tinged below with flame to mingle with the white sappy steam that froze as soon as it got outside and disentangled itself from the wood smoke by falling as hoarfrost at moments when all this smoke lifted matt could see the stars shining on him through the hole in the roof stainless and far away in a deep blue patch of heaven somehow they made him dissatisfied with his work they seemed like calm sovran eyes watching his puny efforts to reproduce with his pitiable palette the manifold hues and shades of the simple scene around himthe greasy copper of the indian boys face glistening against the yellow blanket which covered him and the olivegreen boughs on which he lay the motley firewood the dull brown tones of the spruce branches the silver of birch the yellow of beech the empty birchbark troughs silverwhite outside and dull salmon within touched with tints of light gold or gray why there was a whole colorscheme of subdued rich tints in the moss alonethe dead dry moss that filled up the uneven rifts in the logroof and gleamed with a mottle of green and olive and russet he threw down his brush in despair longing for the rich thick paints he vaguely imagined his uncle in london must havereal paints that did not fade as his did despite the gums he mixed experimentally with thempure reds and blues and greens and yellows capable of giving real skies and real grass and real water and of being mixed into every shade of color the heart could desire then he slipped out through the door shutting it quickly to prevent the hut filling with smoke the ground was white under a brilliant moon with here and there patches of silver that wellnigh sparkled overhead mystic pallidgold rays of northern light palpitated across the clear starstrewn heaven the trees showed more sombre the birches and maples bare of leafage the spruces and hemlocks and all the tangled undergrowth reduced to a common gray in the moonlight here and there a brown hummock stood solemnly with bared head and from all this sleeping woodland rose a restless breathing that incessant stir of a vast alien selfsufficient life the rustle of creatures living and moving and having their being in another world than the human in that dim remote teeming underworld of animal life with its keen joys and transient pains and every now and then a definite sound disengaged itself from the immense murmur a chickadee chirped a blackheaded snowbird twittered a catowl hooted a rabbit ran from the underwood as faintly distinguishable from the snow in his white winter coat as he had been from the dead leaves over which he pattered in autumn in his gray homespun matt stood leaning against the door absorbed into the multifarious night and hardly conscious of the cold then he went in thrilling with vague sweet emotion and vast manful resolutions that cast out despair but he did not take up his brush again he sat down before the fire in dreamy bliss all the asperities of his existence softened by its leaping light and even that dead face of his father thawed into the pleasant motions of life the past shone through a mellow rosy mist and the future was like the scarlet sunrise of the forest flaming from splendor to splendora future of artistic achievement upon which ruth haileys face smiled applause a future of easy unsought riches which banished the gloom upon his mothers and then all of a sudden he caught sight of tommys clay pipe fallen from his mouth on to the blanket and an unforeseen desire to smoke it and put the seal on this hour of happiness invaded the white boys breast he rose and picked it up it was full of charred tobacco the craving to light it and taste its mysterious joys grew stronger his mother had sternly forbidden him to smoke backing up her prohibition by the text in revelationand he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit but now he remembered he had left school he was a man he put the stem into his mouth and plucked a brand from the fire then stood for a moment irresolute he wondered if any instinct warned his mother of what he was doing and from that thought it was an easy transition to wondering what she was doing his fancy saw her still running backward and forward working that great buzzing wheel with stern joyless face he put down his pipe there was a fresh element in his dreamy bliss as he resumed his seat before the fire a sense of something high and tranquillizing like the clear stars yet touching the spring of tears his head drooped in the drowsy warmth he surrendered himself to voluptuous sadness and the outside world grew faint and fading when he looked up again his heart almost ceased to beat at his side loomed a strange female figure her head covered with a drab shawl that hid her face she stood in great snowshoes as on a pair of pedestals and the log walls repeated her form in contorted shadow the gentle purring of the fire the indian boys breathing sounded painfully in the weird stillness from without came the manifold rustle of the night who are you he whispered give me a glass of water she replied sweetly i hevnt any water he breathed i am afire with thirst she cried quench me quench me her shawl slipped back revealing a face of wild uncanny beauty crowned with an aureola of golden hair but the awesome thrill that had permeated matts being passed into one of sthetic pleasure mingled with astonished recognition why its mad peggy he murmured aye its the waterdrinker assented the beautiful visitor in soft musical tones thereupon crying out water water for gods sake i hevnt any water i tell you not till i git some from the spring in the mornin hev some sap and matt starting to his feet plunged the dipper into the barrel of raw sap that stood on the floor mad peggy seized it greedily and drained the great ladle to the dregs then she filled it again with delicious fluid and then again and yet again leaving matt aghast at her gigantic capacity she was filling the dipper a fourth time but he pulled it out of her hand fearing she would do herself a mischief im so thirsty she whispered plaintively in her musical accents what are you doin in the woods at this hour answered matt sternly im looking for peter what a bonny fire and she bent over it holding out her long white hands to the flames matt divined vaguely that peter must be the sweetheart whose desertion had crazed the poor creature it was reported in cobequid village that the handsome german immigrant who had been betrothed to her had gone off forever on the pretext of sugaring when he learned that she was one of the waterdrinkersthe unhappy family whose ancestor had refused a cup of cold water to a strange old woman who thereupon put the curse upon him and his descendants that they illustration i am afire with thirst she cried might drink water and drink water and never quench their thirst peggy was reputed quite harmless you havent seen peter have you she cooed suddenly no replied matt with a fresh nervous thrill but this is not a night for you to be out and about its bitter cold its bitter cold she repeated bitter cold for an old man like you but not for a girl like me loved by the handsomest young fellow in the province the heart within me keeps me warm always warm and thirsty give me more water no youve hed nough said matt its a shame your folks dont look arter you better look after me theyre all up at the ball the heartless creatures but i saw the weddings both of them in spite of them all and i think its high time peter came back from the sugaring to our wedding and ive come to tell him so this is the spot he used to sugar at are you sure you havent seen him you are his partner confess now she wound up cajolingly turning her lovely face towards his troubled gaze cant you see im only a boy he replied nonsense youre not a boy boys always call after me and pull my shawl i know all the boys matt felt the moisture gathering afresh under his eyelids whats your name then she went on sweetly matt he murmured ah mad she cried in ecstasy we are cousinsi knew it thats what they call me her wild eyes shone in the firelight the boy shuddered not mad but matt he corrected her ah yes mad matt cousins mad peggymad matt im not mad he protested feebly yes yes you are she cried passionately i can see it in your face and yet you wont give me a cup of water youve drunk nough said the boy soothingly oh what lovely little devils she exclaimed catching sight of the wall decorations do you see devils too didnt i say we were cousins why theres one of the bridegroomsha ha ha i guess he didnt show the cloven hoof this morning which is the bridegroom asked matt piqued into curiosity therethere he is there is the boy she pointed to the best portrait of bully preep he always called after me the little devil matts heart beat excitedly his face crimsoned but his strange visitors next words threw him back into uneasy chaos oh but everybody is saying how scandalous it is with his wife only six months in her grave look how long peter and i have waited most of the girls in the village get engaged half a dozen times they dont know what love is they dont know anything theyve got no education but ive only been engaged once and im so thirsty and youve got her too the little angel everybody is saying how hard it is for her and yet they all go to the ball may they dance till they drop the hypocrites what are you sayin faltered matt hard for ruth hailey why shes only a little girl she isnt a little girl little girls run after me i know all the little girls shes a little angel just as youve pictured her give me some more water this time matt surrendered the dipper to her thank you cousin matt she said and drank feverishly but seeing that she was about to dip again he placed himself between her and the barrel she turned away with a marvellously dexterous movement considering her cumbrous footgear and dipped the ladle into the seething caldron instead but matt seized her arm and stayed her from extracting the dipper youll scald yourself he said let go my arm she cried threateningly how dare you touch meyou are not peter you mustnt drink any more you are very cruel she moaned who is that sleeping there perhaps it is peter i will wake him up he will give me water i am so thirsty she moaned and crooned over the threelegged caldron stirring the sap feebly with the ladle in her efforts to wrest herself free and the white steam curled about her face and gave her the air of a young beautiful witch bent over a caldron matt forgot everything except that he would like to make a picture of her as she appeared now youd best go to sleep he said at last awakening to a remembrance of the strange situation theres my bedthose firboughsyou kin lie down there till the mornin and ill cover you with my blanket i want water she crooned you kint get it said matt then may the curse light on you and yours she cried stirring the sap more fiercely in her struggle while the vapor and the wood smoke rose in denser volumes around her may you thirst and thirst and never be satisfied and that is to be your fate cousin matt i read it in your face in your eyes never to quench your thirstnever never never to thirst and thirst and thirst for everything and never to be satisfied never to have anything you want mad matt and mad peggycousins you and i ha ha ha her laugh of malicious glee made the boys blood run cold from without came the answering screech of a wildcat lie down and rest repeated matt imperatively what stay here with you no no no cousin matt i know what you want you want to paint me and put me on the wall among the devils no no i must be off to find peter i shall stay with him in his cabin her grip of the dipper relaxed it reeled against the side of the pot she turned away and matt let go her arm and watched her spellbound she drew the thick dun shawl over her head again veiling the glory of the golden hair and almost brought the edges together over her sad beautiful face so that the eyes alone shone out with unearthly radiance then she moved slowly towards the door and thrust it open and the wind came in and filled the entire cabin with heavy acrid smoke which got into matts eyes and throat and woke even the indian boy who sat up choking and rubbing his black beady eyes dam door shuttum he cried with unusual vehemence the words broke matts spell he rushed to the door but his smarting eyes could detect no grayshawled figure gliding among the gray trunks he closed the door wondering if he had been dreaming taint your turn yet tommy he said waving away the smoke with his hand and tommy fell back asleep as if mesmerized matt was as relieved at not having to explain as at tommys momentary wakefulness which had braced him against the superstitious awe that had been invading him while the mad beauty cursed him with that sweet voice of hers that no anger could make harsh he thought of the apparition with pity mingled with a thrill of solemn adoration she had for him the beauty and wildness of the elemental like the sky or the sea and yet she had left in him other feelingsnot only the doubt of her reality but an uneasy stirring of apprehensions was there nothing but insane babble in this talk of ruth hailey and abner preep a fear he could not define weighed at his heart even if he had been dreaming if he had drowsed over the fireas he must in any case have done not to have heard the scrape and clatter of snowshoes enteringthe dream portended something evil but no it was not a dream assuredly the sap in the barrel had sunk to a lower level with a new thought he lit a resinous bough and slipped out quickly and examined the dry stiff snow the double trail of departing snowshoes was manifest meandering among the bark dishes and irregularly intersecting the trail of arrival the radiant moonlight falling through the thin bare mapleboughs made his torch superfluous except in the fuscous glade of leafy evergreens along which he followed the giant footmarks for some little distance he paused leaning against a tall hemlock doubt was impossible he had really entertained a visitor not seldom in former years had he entertained visitors who came to camp out for the night which they made uproarious but never had his hut sheltered so strange a guest he was moved at the thought of her drifting across the wastes of snow like some fallen spirit he looked up and abstractedly watched a crow sleeping with its head under its wing on the top of the hemlock then his vision wandered to the flashing streamers of northern light and higher still to those keen depths of frosty sky where the stars stood beautiful and they drew up his thoughts yearningly to the infinite spaces something cried within him for he knew not whatsave that it was very great and very majestic and very beautiful mystically blending the luminousness of light and color with the scent of flowers and the troubled sweetness of music and at the back of his dim delicious craving for it was a haunting certainty that he would never reach up to it never never the prophecy of mad peggy recurred to the boy like a cutting blast of wind was it true then that he would thirst and thirst and nothing ever quench his thirst he held up his torch yearningly to the stars while the night moaned around him and the flaring pinewood cast a grotesque shadow of him on the pure white snow an uncouth image that danced and leered as in mockery chapter vi disillusions as soon as he could get away next morning matt drew on his oversocks and started for home racked by indefinite fears he had not troubled to rouse tommy to take his watch for he knew he himself would not sleep a wink and it seemed a pity to disturb so deep and healthy a slumber so he bustled about to blur his thoughts and had breakfast ready an hour after sunrise which his anxiety did not prevent him from observing to see sky and forest take fire in gradual glory was an ecstasy transcending the apprehensions of the moment tommy had asked no questions during the morning meal and made no complaints about matts failure to rouse him but on being apprised of his companions intended journey he had pointed to the scanty woodpilea reminder that had delayed matt by a couple of hours spent in felling and chopping up a straddle or two but at last he got away tommy undertaking in a minimum of monosyllables to attend to everything else matt felt afresh the strength and stability of tommy tommy was like spratfirm faithful and uninquisitive he had five miles of clogged walking before him but he made fairly good progress for he was unencumbered by snowshoes having a light step and an instinct for hollows and drifts and his oversocks which reached beyond the knee kept out the snow when he trod deep the freshness and buoyancy of the morning dispelled his alarm dread was impossible under that wonderful blue sky but as he got deeper and deeper into the recesses under thick boughs that shut out the living blue with dead gray and took the sparkle out of the snow his gloom returned and lasted till he was nearly at his journeys end when the road caught the sunlight again just as the thought of home flooded his soul and soon a bend brought the goal in sight there it was the dear old house standing back from the road in the midst of its little clearing the sun shining on its bleached clapboards the black windowsashes standing out fantastically against the white panes opaque with frosty designs the smoke curled tranquilly from the chimney towards the overarching azure making the home seem a living creature whose breath was thus condensed to visibility it seemed months since he had left it yet it was absolutely unchanged and then he heard the cock crow from the rear and his last fears vanished like evil spirits of the night and a wave of pleasurable anticipation bore him to the porch he opened the doorno one ever fastened doors by day for burglars came only in the milder form of peddlers and other visitors were accustomed to stable their horses and take their seats at the board without ceremony or warning it was not far from noon but he heard no sounds about the house except the crowing of the cock which continued and brought up to memory a grotesque and longobliterated image of his mother holding on to the leg of a soaring hawk that had picked up a chicken he listened for the lowing of daisy then remembering she was dead and salted he moved forward into the passage but he found nobody in the livingroom there was not even a fire the clumsy spinningwheel stood silent the table was bare and tidy the chairs were neatly ranged he ran into the kitchenit radiated bleaker desolation matt fought against the cold chill that was gathering at his heart of course there would be nobody at home harriet was sewing somewhere most of the children were at school and his mother instead of leaving the baby in the kitchen with one of them must have taken it with her to her work and yet it was all very depressing and very disappointing then he remembered with a fresh shock the smoke he had seen curling from the roof and for an instant he was oppressed by a sense of the uncanny an atmosphere of horror seemed to brood over the house but the recollection of a proverb of deacon haileys theres no smoke without fire hey uttered in a moment of unusual articulateness brought back commonsense he ran up to the bedrooms but there was not even a stove except in his mothers rooma room tapestried with texts worked in berlin wool on perforated cardboardwhere the bed had not been made and where there were traces of extinct logs immeasurably puzzled and wondering if the smoke had been an optical illusion he returned to the livingroom there was only one room he had not gone intothe best roomand when he at last recollected the existence of it he did not immediately enter it only visitors had the enjoyment of this room and the privilege of sitting gingerly on its cane chairs and surveying its papered walls and in the absence of the family there could be no reception in progress when for the sake of logical exhaustiveness he did approach the door it was listlessly and with a certain constraint amounting to awe his nostrils already scented the magnificent mustiness of its atmosphere he opened the door with noiseless reverence then he stood rigid like one turned to stone by the sight of medusas head it was indeed a head that petrified himor rather two heads one pressed against the other though he had only a back view of them he knew them both the lank black hair was bully preeps the long auburnbrown tresses were harriet strangs a fire had been lighted regardless of the polish of the franklin stove and the severity of its fancy scrollwork and ornamental urn and before this fire his sister sat on abners knee and abner sat on a cane chair tilting it with a familiarity that hovered on contempt the treble shock was too great matt was dumb and sick and cold though redhot thoughts hurtled in his brain what the skunk had sneaked in during his mothers absence and it was thus that harriet did the honors he struggled to get his voice back harriet he cried in raucous remonstrance harriet gave a little shriek and turned her head the color fled from her soft cheeks as she caught sight of her outraged junior then the blush returned in fuller crimson matt fixed her with a stern imperious eye what are you doin in the best room was the phrase that leaped to his angry lips abner turned on him a face of smiling friendship the best thing he replied gayly how dare you kiss my sister thundered matt dont be a fool matt said abner amiably she isnt ony your sistershes my wife your wife breathed matt yes dont be streaked dear we were married yesterday and harriet disentangled herself from abner and ran to throw her arms round matt but the boy repulsed her with a commanding gesture dont come near me he cried huskily wheres mother does she know oh matt cried harriet reproachfully dyou think id marry without her consent i call it rael mean anyways he cried tears of vexation getting into his eyes and his voice to take advantage of a feller like that jest because his backs turned waal we wont do it agen cried abner with unshakable goodhumor see here matt and he rose too revealing the slight tendency to crookedness of lower limb that offended the exigent eye of his motherinlaw lets be pals you were allus a spunky little chap and i liked you from the day you stood up agin me and blacked my eye though you had to jump up amost to reach it i was a beast in them thar days but i raelly aint now thanks to harrietgod bless her i know you dont like my legs he added with a flash of humor but theres ony two of em anyways an thets two too many you crawlin reptile retorted matt then turning to harriet he went on in slow measured accents and is thischapgoin tolive here he is so retorted harriet then said matt with ominous calmthen you wont hev me here thets all of course we wont said harriet with a pleasant laugh youll live with mother with mother repeated matt staring yes down to deacon haileys hes mother gone to live to deacon haileys he asked excitedly you bet put in abner grinning genially whataltogether exclaimed matt the world seemed going round as it did in the geography books i guess so i wont hev it cried matt agitatedly i wont hev her slavin like a nigger it was bad enough afore when she hed to go there every day but now shes naught but a servant its a shame i do declare an you harriet he said turning fiercely on her again aint you shamed o yourself drivin mother out of house and home no said harriet stoutly the laughter that lurked about her mouth filled him with a trembling presentiment of the truth dont you understand said abner kindly your mothers been and gone and married the deacon and a good thing for all o you i do allow youre a liar hissed the boy the world spun round more fiercely abner shrugged his shoulders goodtemperedly you see it was all arranged in a hurry matt said harriet deprecatingly an mother thought wed best get it all over an so we were both married yesterday an we thought it a pity to bother you to come all the way but you hevnt finished hev you wheres the sugar an a nice scandal i vow he cried furiously everybody is talkin bout it oh come matt thets a good un laughed abner why youve heerd nuthin bout it oh hevnt i returned matt with sullen mysteriousness i dont know thet everybody went there an everybody said it was a shame oh no im blind and deaf thets what i am dont make such a touse matt said harriet putting her hair behind her ears with some calmness dont you see things air ever so much better ive got a man to support me and she put her arms lovingly round abners neck as if supporting him an motherll be quite a lady not a servant as you were silly nough to allow an you wont hev to work so hard an ill tell you what matt you shall come here sometimes an draw your picters an mother wont know but matt clinched his teeth the bait was tempting but unfortunately it reminded him of his obedience to his mother the night before when in deference to her views he had denied himself the joy of tommys pipe oh how he had been duped and bamboozled at the very hour his inner eye had seen her toiling sorrowful at her spinningwheel she was frolicking at her weddingball in gay attire a vast selfcompassion softened his indignation and raw misery he turned his back on the newlymarried couple and strode from the house lest they should misinterpret his tears but the tears did not comeanger rekindling evaporated them unshed what right had the deacon to steal his mother without even asking him and how ignoble of his mother to forget his father thus he figured ruth hailey replacing himself by another boy merely because he was dead it seemed sacrilege and yet no doubt ruth was as bad as the rest of her sex had she not submitted tamely to the supplanting of her dead mothernay was she not a necessary accomplice in the conspiracy to keep him ignorant of the double marriage then he had a vague remembrance that he had once heard she was not originally the deacons daughter but only the late mrs haileys which somehow seemed to exonerate her from the full burden of his doings still she had unquestionably been sly his feet had turned instinctively back towards the lonely forest no he would not go and live with the deacon not even though it brought ruth within daily proximity his attitude towards the deacon had never been cordialnay the auditory strain upon him when ole hey spoke to him had gone far towards making him antipathetic it seemed monstrous that such an old mumbler should have been deemed fit to replace the cheery sailor who had gone down wrapped in his flag no matt at least would have none of him life under his roof would be a discord of jarring memories he would go back to his hut and live in the wood he would shoot enough to live upon and there alone and selfsufficient and free as its denizens he would pass his life painting and sketching or if he wanted society he would seek that of the indian the simple noble indian and pitch his lot with his for a time or forever or perhaps tommy would stay with himtommy who was deep without being wily and restful without being dull what a pity billy was disabled they might have seceded together but fate had separated them not his will the five miles were longer now and the sky had grown a shade colder but he trod the gloomiest paths unchilled his heart was hot with revolt as he came to the little open space round the hut a curious phenomenon arrested his attention there was no smoke curling above the chimneyhole a problemthe exact reverse of that which had greeted him at the other terminus of his journeyclamored for solution surely tommy had not let the fire go out he hastened his steps and saw that the door stood wide open on its leather hinges projecting outwards into the forest outside too empty birchbark troughs were scattered about in lieu of being piled up neatly the air of desolation sobered him like a cold douche he was frightened he had not even courage to dwell on the thought of what foreboding whispered but perhaps tommy had only gone to sleep again and forgotten about the fire with a gleam of hope he ran to the entrance then leaped back with a wild thrill and slammed the door to and put his back to it and stood palpitating restrained only by excitement from breaking down in childish tears the interior of the hut had been transformed as by enchantment of barrels axes ironware provender even of his rude paints there was not a trace though the birchbark picture exhibition was undisturbed the birchboughs were littered over the floor there was no tommy but in the centre of the cabin where the fire had been lay a matted bear voluptuously curled up on the warm ashes and licking the mellifluous soil which was syrupsodden by drops that had fallen from the sappot the beautiful sunshine had lured the animal from its winter sleepingchamber famished after its long fast it was a moment matt never forgot one of those moments that age and imbitter as he stood with squared shoulders against the rough battened door that was built of stout slabs he shook from head to foot with mingled emotions numb misery alternated with burning flashes of righteous indignation against humanity red and white and with it all was a stirring of the hunters instinctan itching to shoot the creature on the other side of the doorwhich aggravated his vexation by the reminder that even his gun had been stolen it eased him a little to let his mind dwell on the prospect of potting such glorious game but first of all he must run tommy to earth tommy could not have gone far burdened as he would be with the spoil the brokenhearted boy moved stealthily from the door and pushed up a small trunk that he had cut down that morning but not yet chopped up with some difficulty he raised this and propped it against the door which being already latched could not easily be burst open by the bear the creature was moreover likely to resume its winter nap in the snug sweet quarters in which it found itself having thus trapped his bear matt started off by a crosscut in the direction of the indian encampment to which he presumed tommy would naturally have returned fullhanded but he had not gone a hundred yards before he called himself a fool and ran back in his agitation he had forgotten to note the trail of the sled in which tommy must have drawn off the things this he now discovered ran quite in the opposite direction and was complicated not only by tommys footmarks but by a mans whither had tommy decamped the day seemed made up of surprises and puzzles however there was everything to gain or rather regain by following the dusky young impostor and the accomplice who had helped him to draw the heavy sled matt discovered that the trail led towards long village two and a half miles off and instantly it flashed upon him that tommy had gone there to dispose of the things he quickened his pace and in less than half an hour strode into a truer solution of the mystery for suddenly he found himself amid dogs grubbing in the sunshine and swaddled pappooses swinging on the poles of birchbark wigwams and perceived that the vagrant micmacs had shifted their encampment during the fortnight tommys knowledge of the migration argued secret correspondence unless a tribal tempter had visited him accidentally during matts absencewhich seemed rather improbable matts soul was aflame with wrath and resentment he rushed about among the wigwams unceremoniously peering behind the blankets that overhung the doorways which were partly blocked by spruce boughs arranged to spring back and forth bowlegged roundshouldered dumpy men with complexions of grayish copper squatting crosslegged on fir boughs before the central fire smoked on unresentful a few ejaculating sullenly kogwa pawotumun what is your wish their faces had nothing of the american hatchetshape they would have been round but for the angularity of the jaw and chinese but for the eyes which did not slant upward but were beady and wide apart the cheekbones were high the nose was of a negro flatness and the straight black hair was long and matted in attire the men had an air of shabby civilization which went ill with the blankets and skins overwrapping the white mens leavings near the doorin the quarter of less distinctionsitting with feet twisted round to one side one under the other as befits the inferior sexwere women goodlooking but greasy who wore shawls and blankets over their kerchiefed heads and necklaces of blue beads twinkling against their olive throats and smoked as gravely as their lords but tommy was invisible nor could matt see anything of the stolen goods but in one tent he found tommys father and discourteously omitting the kwa of greeting plied him with indignant questions in a mixture of bad english and worse indian tommys father understood little and knew nothing he did not invite the visitor into the tent but smoked on peacefully and whittled a shaving and matts admiration of the red mans taciturnity died a painful death had tommys father not even seen tommy no tommys father had not seen tommy for half a moon and the smoke curled peacefully round tommys fathers greasy head never had the unspeakable uncleanliness of the picturesque figure struck matt as it did now he moved away with heavy heart and heavy footstep and interviewed other indians equally dingy and equally reticent even the squaws kept the secret matt went back in despairing anger and poured out his passion in a flood of remonstrance upon the unwashed head of tommys father he pointed to the trail of the sled that drew up at tommys fathers tent he reasoned he threatened he clinched his fist and stamped his foot and tommys father smoked the pipe of peace and whittled the shaving the indian held the stick on his knee and drew the knife towards himself unlike the white man who cuts away from himself it was a crooked knife with a notch for the thumb in the handle matts spirit oozed away before its imperturbable movement to and fro he felt sick and faint he became vaguely conscious that he had eaten nothing since breakfast then he remembered the bear waiting in the cabinwaiting to be killed with a happy thought he informed tommys father that he had trapped a bear and could conduct him to the spot and tommys father instantly began to understand him better and when matt proceeded to offer him the beast in exchange for the stolen goods the micmac betrayed a complete comprehension of the offer and with a courteous exclamation of upchelase invited him into the furthermost and most honorable portion of the tent he even rose and held colloquy with some of his brethren gathered round a bear was a valuable propertydead his snout alone was worth five dollars when presented as a death certificate to a grateful government anxious to extinguish him these five dollars were a great consideration to a tribe paid mainly in kind and hard pushed to find coin for the annual remission of sin at the hands of the priests the bears skin would fetch four or five dollars more while its three or four hundred pounds of flesh would set up the larder for the season as a result of the native council tommys father informed matt that he had just learned tommy had been seen that morning but that he had hauled the sled past the encampment on his way to long village to sell the freight which nobody had suspected was not his own property the much dam thief he had however left a gun with a boy friend and if matt was content to swop the bear for this he could have it matt fuming at his own helplessness consented the gun was accordingly produced matt recognized his old friend but tommys father explained in easy pantomime that when bear was dead boy would get gun and not before and he handed it to a blanketless bystander who had evidently bartered external heat for internal firewater then shouldering his own gun he motioned to matt to lead the way the little procession of three set forth the second indian prudently providing himself with a flat wide sledge the afternoon was waning the blue overhead had lost in luminousness leaving the coloring of the earth more vivid but the shifting of natures kaleidoscope had ceased to interest matt humanity occupied him exclusively and the evil that was done under the sun man or woman white or red they were all alikea skulking shifty breed it was not only he that had been betrayed it was truth it was honor were these things then merely lipbabble on their arrival at the hut matt explained the position he was about to remove the log that braced up the door but tommys father pulled him violently back and gestured that it was much more convenient to shoot the animal through the chimneyhole matt felt a qualm of disgust and remorse it seemed cowardly to give the poor beast that had taken refuge in his hut no chance he leaned sullenly against the door feeling almost like one who had betrayed the laws of hospitality and conscious moreover of a strange savage sympathy with the bear in its strife with humanity his last respect for the noble red man vanished when the two micmacs clambered upon the lowpitched roof they uttered ughs of satisfaction as they peeped over the great square hole and perceived their prey asleep after some amiable banter of the animal they began to put their guns into position but tommys father insisted on having the glory of the deed since he was paying for the bear with matts gun and his rival ungraciously yielded in his cocksureness however tommys father merely hit the bears shoulder the creature started up with a fierce growl and began biting savagely at the bleeding wound excited by his failure and the brutes leap up tommys father leaned more over the hole for his second shot but his companion exclaiming that it was his turn now pushed him back and strove to get his body in front tommys father who was now effervescing with excitement thrust himself more forward still and in his zeal succeeded so well that he suddenly found himself flying headforemost into the hut while the gun went off at random the bullet missed but the man struck the obfuscated creature with a thud ricochetted off its back and lay prostrate on the branchstrewn floor the sound of the fall the explosion the cry of dismay from the roof informed matt of what had happened in a flash his sympathy went back to man he cried to the other indian to shoot but the latters arm was shaking and the bear after a few seconds of bewilderment had risen on its hind legs and stood over the fallen man growling fiercely so that the micmac was afraid of hitting his friend matt reached up impatiently for his gun which the micmac readily handed to him in unforeseen violation of orders and matt overthrowing the doorprop with the butt end lifted the latch and dashed in tommys father was already in the bears grip the infuriated animals elastic forepaws beginning to press horribly upon his ribs matt clapped the barrel of the gun to the bears ear then he was overswept by a fearsome doubt lest the gun had been unloaded since it had left his hands but his suspense was short he pressed the trigger there was a ringing explosion and the creature bounded into the air relaxing its hold of the indian upon whom it fell again in its deathagony matt aided by the other micmac who hurried in grunting disentangled tommys father from the writhing heap and found him bruised and breathless but practically uninjured tommys father vowed eternal gratitude to his rescuer and said his life was henceforward at matts disposal the boy curtly asked for his property instead whereupon the indian shook his head and shrugged his shoulders in token of impotence rolling the bear over with a prod of his contemptuous foot he produced his knife and started scalping and skinning the dead enemy while his brotherinarms lit some boughs and cut a juicy steak from the carcass and set it to broil the warmth was grateful for the shadows were fast gathering and the hyperborean hours returning a covey of bobwhites whirred past and the weird note of a hootowl was borne on the bleak air the indians offered the boy a cut from the joint and he refused sulkilya deadly insult in normal circumstances but the keen pangs of hunger and the delicious odor of the meat weakened him and a later invitation to join the squatting diners found him ravenously responsive though he felt he had bartered away his righteous indignation for a mess of pottage during the meal his guests or his hosts he knew not which they were betrayed considerable interest in his mural decorations which they evidently regarded as symptoms of a relapse from christianity and they were astonished too at his refusal to quaff more than a mouthful or two of their rumthe coarse concoction locally nicknamed rotgut while matt who had started last was still eating from the birchbark dish he had utilized for the purpose tommys father lit his afterdinner pipe and having taken a few whiffs passed it on to his companion who in turn held out to matt the long reedy stem with its feather ornaments the offer sent a thrill through the boys whole being all his grievances ascended afresh from the red stone bowl and mingled with the fragrant smoke how good how obedient he had been and all for what a lump gathered in his throat so that he could not swallow his bit of bear he nodded assent his heart throbbing with defiant manhood and motioned to the micmac to place the pipe beside his dish till he was ready for it the two indians then hauled the carcass athwart the sledge hastily for night had come on as though shed from the starless sky and they called to matt to come along but matt shouted back that he did not intend to accompany them he no longer craved to cast in his lot with the red man yet he went to the door of his tent to watch his fellowhunters disappear among the sombre groves and a deeper dusk seemed to fall on the landscape when the very rustle of their passage died away but as he turned in again and fastened up the door his heart leaped up afresh with the leaping flames the sense of absolute solitude became exultationa keen bitter joy here was his home he had no other he had parted company with humanity forever he reseated himself on a little pile of fir boughs in his deserted home that was naked but for the wallpicturesthe least comforting of all possible salvage since they were the only things tommy had not thought worth stealing as matt sat brooding darker patches on the soil and spots upon some of those pictures caught his eye he saw they were of blood in one place there was quite a little pool which had not yet sunk into the earth or evaporated he touched it curiously with his finger and wiped away the stain against a leaf then with a sudden thought he curled a piece of bark and scooped up the blood into his birchen dish as a possible color murmuring gleefully who caught his blood i said the fish with my little dish i caught his blood in moving the little dish he laid bare tommys fathers calumet forgotten he took it up how the universe had changed since last he held a pipe in his handonly last night again he heard the howl of a wildcat and he looked round involuntarily as if expecting to find mad peggy at his elbow but he had no sense of awe just nowthough he had barred his door inhospitably against further bearsonly the voluptuousness of liberty and loneliness the healthy afterglow of satisfied appetite and the gayety born of flaming logs and a couple of mouthfuls of firewater the waterdrinkers prophecy seemed peculiarly inept in view of the pipe he held in his hand with tremulous anticipation of more than mortal rapture he relit it the sensation was unexpectedly pungent but matt puffed away steadily in hope and trust that this was merely the verdict of an unaccustomed palate and he found a vast compensatory pleasure in his ability to make the thing work to send the delicate wreaths into the air as ably as any micmac or deacon of them all but soon even this pleasure began to be swamped by a wave of less agreeable sensation and matt puzzled and chagrined after a gallant stand threw down the calumet and hastened into the cold air with palpitating heart and splitting head and there in the maple wood bruin was avenged that night despite his vigil of the night before matt strang vainly endeavored to close his eyes upon an unsatisfactory world chapter vii the apprentice the long endless years crowded with petty episodes and uniformities and moving like a cumbrous creeping train that stops at every station flash like an express past the eye of memory yet it is these unrecorded minuti of monotonous months that color the fabric of our future lives eating into our souls like a slow acid when in after years matt strangs youth defiled before him the panorama seemed more varied than when he was living the scenes in all their daily detail of dull routine and when whatever their superficial differences they were all linked for him by an underlying unity of toil and aspiration first came his apprenticeship in cattermoles sawmill at the opposite outskirt of the forest twenty miles from cobequid for though he early tired of savagery as a blindalley on the road to picturepainting he refused in the dogged pride of his boyish heart to return to his folks contenting himself with informing them of his whereabouts and of his intention to apprentice himself with or without their consent labor being so scarce that year deacon hailey drove over in great haste to offer him a loving home matt who happened to be in the house which was only parted from the millstream by a large vegetablegarden saw through a window the deacons buggy arrive at the gardenpath and the deacon himself alight to open the wooden gate the boys resentment flamed afresh and it was supplemented by dread of the deacons inarticulate conversation he fled to mrs cattermole in the kitchen she was a shrewish angular person economical of everything save angry breath a black silk cap with prim bows and ribbons sat severely on her head and a threadnet confined her hair cattermole a simple religious henpecked creature had gone to the village store to trade off butter theres ole hey coming cried matt breathlessly kint you speak quietly thundered mrs cattermole you made my heart jump like a frog you dont mean ole hey from cobequid

man there wont be no touse at all he dont set foot in my kitchen and theres an end of it mrs cattermole greeted the deacon politely and informed him that the lad he was inquiring after was sulking in the kitchen and that he refused to receive his visitor on any account the deacon sighed unctuously with an air of patient martyrdom matts obduracy heightened his estimate of the lads value as a gratuitous fieldworker and sharpened his sense of being robbed of what small dowry mrs strang had brought him the boy is dreadful set agin me he complained but es i told his poor mother if you let a boy run wild wild he runs hey anyways it aint fur me to fail in lovinkindness eye for eye tooth for tooth aint the gospel were called upon to practise i allus thinks theres no sort o use in bein a

rest if ive come on a fools errand thet aint a reason my ole nag should suffer hey mrs cattermole seeing the outworks taken directed the deacon by a flank movement into the parlor as alone befitting his dignity to matt this parlor far finer than the best room at home was a chamber of awe but also of attraction for its walls were hung with sober bible prints mrs cattermole stood there among her splendors with her back to the door partly for defensive purposes partly so as not to depreciate one of the haircloth chairs by sitting down it was enough for one day that her guest sat solidly on the rockingchair of honor weve been hevin too much soft weather mrs cattermole arter all thet heavy snow yes im afeard the dam will go out responded mrs cattermole gloomily they discussed the disastrous thaw of a few years back with a vivid remembrance of the vegetables and dairy produce spoiled in the flooded cellars but its the lords will summed up the deacon it aint any use heapin up worldly treasure i allus thinks thets a fact mrs cattermole shook her head in sad acquiescence heavens the only safe place to lay up your goods hey so i guess im just goin to forgive thet durned boy all the anxiety hes giv his poor mother an me an take him back right along oh but i guess you aint said mrs cattermole weve promised to take him on here well let you off thet thar promise mrs cattermole we

head as if pitying her bubble delusions he aint smart an he aint goodtempered you see for yourself how grouty he is to the best friend a boy ever hed he aint smart i know thets why we aint goin to pay

kitchen id rayther you didnt deacon its all in a clutter the conversation drooped the deacons mouth moved in mere chawing swallowing his quid in deference to the parlor he cut himself a new chunk youve heerd about the doctor mrs cattermole he began again i dunno es i hev what not heerd about our doctor es was said to practise the black art oh the sorcerer es lives on the ole woodroad my brother who drives the stage was tellin me bout it he sets spirits turnin tables tellin the future an nobodyll go past his house arter dark ah but the elders called on him last week said the deacon of

table ah the kitchin table said mrs cattermole walking into the elaborately laid trap i dunno said the deacon shaking his head air you sure it aint too large for us to span around we could let the flaps down the deacon chawed reflectively waal it might he said cautiously at last there aint no harm in tryin we hednt ought to give up anythin without tryin i allus thinks one never knows hey i kinder think we ought to try said mrs cattermole the deacon rose ponderously and followed his guide into the kitchen why theres matt he cried in astonished accents goodday sonny matt strained his ears but pursed his lips and rocked the cradle in violent impassivity the deacon was uneasy at the boys sullen resentment he could not understand open enemies hows your health hey he asked affectionately

see if he kin sell my pictures fur me if you was to drag me back by force id escape into the woods an id work my way to london to be handy my uncle matt i reckon he takes in prentices same es the boss

glance at mrs cattermole did i tell you a lie when i said he warnt worth thet thar he vociferated snatching the tin dipper from the waterbucket the noise disturbed the baby which began to whimper feebly matt turned his chairs back on the deacon and gazed studiously towards the woodhouse in the yard the deacons face grew apoplectic he seemed about to throw the dipper at the back of matts head but mastering himself he let it fall with a splash and said quietly i guess you wont hev me to blame if he turns out all belly an no hans some folksd say im offerin you a smart likely young man with his heart in the woodpile but thets not deacon haileys way he makes a pint of tellin the bad pints hes a man you could swap a horse with hey i tell you mrs cattermole thet durned boy is all moonshine

then theres father youre a rael saint deacon but i sorter think where heaven is consarned father ud like a lookin es well so lets say no more bout it now then deacon the tables waitin he ignored the patient piece of furniture waal dont blame me any if the buckwheat turns out bad he shouted losing his selfcontrol again and spurting out his nicotian fluid at the stove like an angry cuttlefish thets so acquiesced mrs cattermole quietly now then deacon hailey jest you set there she had taken a chair and placed her hands on the table hush said the deacon dont you see thet thar young un wakin up the tarnation boy hes been shakin him like an earthquake i didnt know es you kep your baby in the kitchin or i wouldnt hev troubled to come when thet thar table kinder began to dance and jump you wouldnt

me with tales bout turnin tables taint likely es a table is goin to dance of itself an tell me bout marias sickness jest you come here matt an lay your hands alongside o mine whats thet youre doin for matt had begun pensively adorning the hood of the cradle by means of a burned stick he had pulled from the stove its ony ole hey he said reddening jest you leave off makin fun o your elders an betters she said sharply therell be plenty of work fur you in the paintshop there was plenty of work matt found in numerous other directions too many more things than mechanical woodcutting did the boy practise at cattermoles sawmill to begin with mrs cattermoles apprehensions were justified and the spring freshets swept away the dam and so matt was set to work hauling brushwood and gravel and logs to build up a kind of breastwork cattermole was really a housejoiner and housebuilder so matt acquired cabinetmaking decoration and housebuilding his farming and cattlerearing experience was also considerably enlarged he milked the cows looked after four stagehorses driven by mrs cattermoles brother and thirtysix sheep cut firewood cleared out barns turned churns hoed potatoes mowed hay fed fowls and pigs and rocked the cradle and in the interval of running the circular and upanddown saws in the mill worked in the paintshop at the back graining and scrolling the furniture and ornamenting it with roses and other gorgeous flowers sometimes even with landscapes this was his only opportunity of making pictures for recreation hours he had none he rose at four in the morning and went to bed at ten at night his wages were his food and clothes both left off mrs cattermole made his garments out of her husbands outworn wardrobe itself of gray homespun but the hours in the paintshop threw their aroma over all the others and made them livable and cattermole though a hard was not a harsh taskmaster and had gentle flashes of jest when mrs cattermole was out of earshot and though winter was long yet there were seasons of delicious sunshine when the blueberries ripened on the flats or the apples waxed rosy in the orchard when the air thrilled with the song of birds and the dawn was golden in one of these seasons of hope he wrote to his uncle of his fathers death and his own existence and cattermole paid the postage an ingenuous letter full of the pathetic almost incredible ignorance of obscure and sequestered youth and inquiring what chances there would be for him to reap fortune by painting pictures in london he addressed the letterwith vague recollection of something in his school readingbookto mr matthew strang painter national gallery london it was not an illwritten letter nor an illspelt here and there the orthography was original but in the main mctavit had been not ineffectual and there were fewer traces of illiteracy about the epistle than might have been imagined from matts talk but in matts mind the written and the spoken were kept as distinct as printed type and the manuscript alphabet they ran on parallel lines that never met and that amurcan should be spelled american seemed no more contradictory than that throo should be spelled through the grammar he had used in scholastic exercises was not for everyday wear it was of a ceremonious dignity that suited with the stateliness of epistolary communication alas for all the carefulness of the composition his uncle of the national gallery gave no sign matts suspense and sorrow dwindled at last into resignation for he had come to a renewed sense of religion as mrs strang would have put it he had found grace there were a few pious books and tracts about the cattermole establishment to devour in stolen snatches or by bartering sleep for reading and among these dusty treasures he lighted on the pilgrims progress with quaint woodcuts in the moral fervor with which the dramatic allegory informed him matt felt wickedness an impossibility henceforward his future life stretched before him white fleckless unstainable meanness or falsehood or viciousness could never touch his soul how curiously people must be constituted who could knowingly prefer evil when good thrilled one with such rapture bathed one in such peace already he felt the beatitude of the new jerusalem the pictures he painted should be good please god they should exhibit the baseness of mr worldly wiseman castigate the town of carnal policy he would uplift the eyes of the wicked to the contemplation of the shining ones though after all he began to ask himself could any picture equal bunyans book was not a book immeasurably the better medium of expression the suspicion was strengthened by the reading of a dime novel which his mistresss brother the stagedriver had left lying about it was the first unadulterated novel he had read and the sensational episodes stirred his blood his newborn religious enthusiasm died he loved mike the bushranger who was the hero of the novel action strong selfdependent action a big personalitythere lay the admirable in life the christians and hopefuls were paleblooded figures after all and unreal at that in actual life one only came across mimics who used their language the deacon haileys or the abner preeps to whom even thieving tommy were preferable no wonder mike had been driven to bushranging what a pity he himself had not remained in his forest hut rebel against humanity king of the woods ah and how inadequate was paint to express the fulness of life the medium was too childishly simple at most one could fix a single scene a single incident and that only in its outside aspect books palpitated with motion and emotion he set to work to write a dime novel stealing an hour from his scanty night he made but slow progress though he began with an exciting episode about a white boy besieged in his loghut by a party of indians and saved by the sudden advent of a couple of bears the words he wrote down seemed a paltry rendition of his thought and inner vision they were tame and scant of syllable he discovered that his literary palette was even more pitiful than his pictorial still he labored on for the goal was grand and despite his mental divorce between pronunciation and orthography his spoken english improved imperceptibly through all this contact with literature then one wonderful dayto be marked with a white stone and yet also with a blackhe received a letter from england all his artistic ambition flamed up furiously again as he broke the seal london limners club dear nephewyour letter gave me mingled pain and pleasure i was deeply grieved to hear of the sad death of your dear father my poor brother had not written to me nor had i seen him since his marriage but i knew i should somehow hear of it if anything went wrong with him i am shocked to have remained ignorant for so many months after his death i really think your mother should have let me know as she could have discovered my address through my wifes relatives who live in halifax however i hope god has given her strength to bear the blow and now my dear matthew let me tell you your letter is very childish and not what i should have expected of a young man of fourteen as you describe yourself it is very nice to amuse yourself by painting pictures it keeps you out of mischief but how can you fancy that your pictures are worth any money why painting is the most difficult of all the arts it requires years and years of study under great masters and it costs a heap of money to pay modelsthat is men or women who sit or stand in uncomfortable positions while you are painting them no picture is any good that is done without models if you wanted to paint a horse you would have to hire a horse and that is even more expensive than hiring a man otherwise your horse would be all wrong why a friend of mine painted a picture of a forge and he had to have it all built up in his studio and it cost a hundred and twenty pounds studio the word reminds me that an artist must have a special room to work in with windows on top and these rooms are very expensive london is crammed full of artists who have had all these advantages and yet they are starving the pictures that you do now everybody would laugh at and where would you get the money for frames a nice gold frame might redeem your pictures but gold frames are dear no my dear matthew you must not be a little fool how could you a poor orphan think of coming to london why you would die in the streets no remain where you are and thank god that you are earning your clothes and your keep with an honest sawyer in a land of peace and plenty and are not a burden on your poor mother i hope you will listen to your uncle like a good boy and grow up to be grateful to him for saving you from starvation believe me your affectionate uncle matthew strang matts tears blistered the final sheet of this discouraging document his roseate visions of the future faded to cold gray his heart ached with a sudden sense of the emptiness of existence but when he had come to the last word his hand clinched the letter fiercely a great glow of resolution pervaded his being like the heat that returns after a cold douche i will be a painter i will i will i will he hissed and he tore up the embryo of the dime novel and wrote again to his uncle my dear unclehow good you are to write to me and tell me everything i want to know dont be afraid that i will starve in london dear uncle i could always earn my living there in the fields and paint late at night but i wont come till i have enough money for lessons and models and a studio though i think i could draw horses without hiring them i have always been very good at animals besides what do they do when they want bears as the geography book says there arent any bears in england i could live in the attic and knock a hole in the roof my mother doesnt need anything from me thank god as she is married again and bears the blow well and my sister harriet is married too so you see it will be easy for me to save up money as soon as my apprenticeship is over i shall go on to the states where the greatest fools make heaps of money and so in a few years please god i shall be able to come over like you did and be a great artist like you goodbye dear uncle god bless you from your loving nephew matthew strang pswhen i come over i will change my name if you like so as not to clash with yours i know you would not like it if people thought you had done my pictures ppsbesides my real name now might be matthew hailey as mother has changed hers to that this letter evoked no answer when matts apprenticeship was at an end the first item of his programme broke down for he lacked the money to carry him to the states so he had to stay on at cattermoles farm at a petty wage though a larger than mrs cattermole was aware of till he had scraped a little together and then an accident occurred that bade fair to dispose of all the other items he was at work in the sawmill when his leg got jammed between the log he was operating upon and the carriage that was bearing it towards the gang of upanddown saws there would not be room for his body to pass between the gang of saws and the framework that held them it was an awful instant he cried out but his voice was lost in the roar of the water and the clatter of the machinery round went the waterwheel the carriage glided along offering inch after inch of the log to the cruel teeth and matt was drawn steadily with it towards the fatal point with an inspiration he drew out the stout string he always carried in his pocket and making a noose threw it towards a lever it caught and matt was saved for he had only to pull this lever to close the gate in the flume and shut out the water when the machinery stopped the racket ceased too and matts voice could be heard and cattermole rushed in from the adjoining furniture manufactory and knocking away the dogs at the end of the log lifted it and released the prisoner and then made him kneel down and offer a prayer for his salvation matts awakening sense of logic dimly insinuated that this was thanking providence for having failed to mutilate him but the atmosphere of puritan acceptance in which he moved and had his being asphyxiated the nascent scepticism shortly after matt bade farewell to cattermole farm with its complex appurtenancesa proceeding which mrs cattermole christened onchristian ingratitood she declared that he ought to strip off the clothes she had made him and depart naked as he had come from a dim corner of the kitchen cattermoles face signalled dont mind her god bless you softened by the sawmill accident matt tramped to cobequid to see his mother before departing for boston and thence ultimately for england he felt guilty a sort of prodigal son and kept assuring himself of his innocence and economy the third mrs hailey received him with a rapture that almost surpassed billys she hugged him to her bosom with sobs and told him her grievances these were manifold but seemed analyzable into four categories one the remissness of harriet whose visits were rare and whose baby had bowlegs two the naughtiness of the children of whom matt had always been the only satisfactory specimen three the cruelty of their stepfather in chastising them for the same four the deacons breach of contract in refusing to migrate to halifax or to permit her to hold baptist prayermeetings her black eyes flashed with strange fire when she spoke of her new husbands crimes and derelictions and there was the old dreaded hysteria in her threats to throw up the position evidently remarriage had not made her happy he thought with added tenderness perhaps nothing could he shuddered at his own deeper perception of unhappiness implanted in temperament and finding nutriment in any conditions in conclusion she besought her boythe only person in the world who loved her the only person to whom she could tell her troublesto go to halifax instead of the states it was far nearer and money could be made just as easily her folks lived at halifax and though he must not dream of seeking their assistance for they had been very bad to her mewing her up strictly so that she had been forced to elope with her poor davie still it would be a consolation to know that he was near her own people likewise not far from herself in case of anything happening to either of them perhaps she would persuade her husband to move there after allwho knew or she might come there herself and stay with him for a week or two at any rate and meantime he should write to her about the dear old town moved by her lack of reproaches and by her misery and impressed into his olden subjugation to the handsome masterful woman matt acquiesced perhaps his main motives were the comparative cheapness of the journey and the reinflammation of his childish curiosity concerning the gay city it was saturday but matt suffered such tortures under the moral but mumbled exordiums of ole hey of which his unaccustomed ear took in less than ever that he determined to depart on the monday the deacon seemed to have aged considerably his beard was matted and thick and his dicky was stained with tobaccojuice for the rest matt discovered that most of the children were employed about the farm or the works and that they had ceased to go to school the deacon having converted ruth into a schoolmistress when she could be spared from keeping the books of his tannery and gristmill ruth herself he met with indifference that the stateliness of her unexpectedly tall presence did nothing to thaw he was surprised to hear from billy whose bed he shared that night and who was more greedy to hear matts adventures than to talk that they were all very fond of her and that she could still romp heartily but ruth had gradually grown shadowy to his imagination beside his burning dreams of art and the sight of her seemed to add the last touch of insubstantiality to her image and yet in the boredom of the sunday services with his eye roving restlessly about the severe unlovely meetinghouse in search of distractions he could not but be conscious that she was the sweetest and sedatest figure in the village choir that sang and flirted in the rising tiers of the gallery over the vestibule and when deacon hailey tapping his tuningfork on the rails imitated its note with a rasping croak matt had a flash of sympathy with the divined inner life of the girl in this discordant environment he told her briefly of his plansto save up enough money to get to his uncle in london who would doubtless put him in the way of studying art seriously she said she wished she had something as fine to live and work for still she was busy enough what with bookkeeping and teaching school as she put it smilingly their parting like their meeting was awkward selfconsciousness and shyness had come into their simple relation neither dared take the initiative of a kiss which for the rest was a rare caress in cobequid save between children and lovers relatives shook hands even women were not free of one anothers lips and for the lads part timidity was all he felt in the presence of this sweet graceful stranger only at the last moment when she handed him a keepsake in the shape of a prize copy of the arabian nights her musicmistress had given her did their looks meet as of yore and then it was more the young painter than the old playmate who was touched by the earnest radiance of her eyes and the flicker of rose across the delicate fairness of her cheek he made a little sketch of her in return and sent it her from halifax when he was on his way he opened the giltbound volume and read on the flyleaf to matt from ruth god make you a great artist chapter viii a wanderyear halifax exceeded matts expectations and gave him a higher opinion of his mother for the first time his soul received the shock of a great town or what was a great town to him the picturesque bustle enchanted him the harbor with its immense basin and fiords swarming with ships and boats was an inexhaustible pageant and sometimes across the green water came softened music from a giant ironclad high in the background of the steep city that sat throned between its waters rose forests of spruce and fir from the citadel on the hill black cannon saluted the sunrise and sambro head and sherbrooke tower shot rays of warning across the night the streets throbbed with traffic and were vivid with the blues and reds of artillery and infantry and the nigger and the sailor contributed exotic romance on the wharves of water street which were lined with old shanties and dancinghouses the black men sawed cordwood huge piles of which mounted skyward surrounded by boxes of smoked herrings on one of the wharves endless quintals of codfish lay adrying in the sun and when the great tide receding exposed the tall wooden posts like the long legs of some manylegged marine monster covered with black and white barnacles and slime of a beautiful arsenic green the embryonic artist found fresh enchantment in this briny fishy muddy waterside then too the government house was the biggest and most wonderful building matt had ever seen and the fish fruit and meat markets were a confusion of pleasant noises in the newly opened park on the point the wives of the english officials and officersgrand dames who set the tone of the citystrolled and rode in beautiful costumes matt thought that the detached villas in which they lived with imposing knockers and circumscribing hedges instead of fences were the characteristic features of great american cities he loved to watch the young ladies riding into the cricketground on their wellgroomed horses beautiful faraway princesses whose exquisite figures revealed by their ridinghabits fascinated rather than shocked his eye accustomed though it was to the puritan modesty of illfitting dresses the bulky wrappings of a village where to go out in your shape was to betray impure instincts he would peer into the enclosure with a strange wistful longing eager to catch stray music of their speech silver ripples of their laughter he wondered if he would ever talk to such celestial creatures for whom life went so smooth and so fair what charming pictures they made in the lovely summer days when the officers played against the club and they sat on the sward drinking tea under the shady trees in white dresses with white lace parasols held over their softly glinting hair to shield the shining purity of their complexionsa refreshing contrast of cool color with the scarlet of the officers uniforms sometimes the wistful eyes of the boy grew dim with sad delicious tears how inaccessible was all this beautiful life whose gracious harmonies whose sweet refinements some subtle instinct divined and responded to at moments he felt he could almost barter his dreams of art to move in these heavenly spheres among these dainty creatures whose every gesture was grace whose every tone was ravishment there was one girl the most bewitching of all whom he only saw in the saddle so that in his image of her as in his sketches of her she was always on a beautiful chestnut horse which she sat with matchless ease and decision a tall slender girl with yellowbrown hair that lay soft and fluffy about the forehead of her lovely english face her favorite canter was along the beachroad and here before he had found work he would loiter in the hope of seeing her how he longedyet dreadedthat she might some day perceive his presence sometimes so high flew his secret audacious dream that in imagination he patted her horses glossy neck in such an exhilarating atmosphere the boy felt great impulses surge within him but alas the seamy side of great cities was borne in on him also he had a vile lodging in the central slums near the roof of a tall tenementhouse that tottered between two groggeries and here drunken wharfingers and sailors and negro wenches and irishmen reeled and swore to a lad brought up in godly cobequid where drunkenness was spoken of with bated breath this unquestionable supremacy of satan was both shocking and unsettling nevertheless matt spent the first days in a trance of delight forapart from and above all other wondersthere were pictureshops in the town and the works of odonovan the local celebrity were marked at twenty or thirty and even fifty dollars apiece they were seapaintings of considerable merit that excited matts admiration without quite overwhelming him on the strength of odonovans colossal prices matt invested some of his scanty stock of dollars in a kit of paint at a fairy shop where shone collapsible tubes of oilcolor such as he had never seen before and delightful brushes and undreamedof easels and canvases he also bought two yellowcovered books one entitled artistic anatomy and the other practical house decoration which combined to oppress him with his ignorance of the human form divine and the house beautiful and became his bedfellows serving to raise his pillow his conceit fell to zero when he saw a portrait by sir joshua reynolds among the collection in the session hall after a depressing delay mitigated only by the sight of his fair horsewoman he found work in a furniture shop at the top of an old rambling warehouse that was congested with broken litter and old pianos the proprietor not only dealt in dbris but bought new furniture and had it painted in the loft matt received six dollars a week half of which he saved for his english campaign at first he had the atelier to himself but as the proprietors business increased he was given a subordinatea fullgrown frenchman rather shorter than himself who swore incomprehensibly and was restive under matts surveyorship by this time matt had learned something of the wisdom of the serpent so he treated his man to liquor after the frenchman had got drunk several times at the expense of his sober superior he discovered that matt was his longlost brother and peace reigned in the paintshop but matt did not remain long in halifax the frenchmans jabber of the mushroom millionaires of the states though he failed to explain his own distance from these golden regions fired matts imagination and he resolved to go to boston in accordance with his original programme he considered he had sufficiently studied his mothers wishes and her letters had become too incoherent for attention it was a pain not a pleasure to receive them he was not surprised to learn from billys letters that domestic broils were frequent and that the deacons proverbial wisdom did not avail to cope with mrs strangs threats of suicide it was only poor ruths girlish sweetness that could bring calm into these household cyclones and so one fine evening matt set sail for the city of culture and crsuses everything seemed of good augury though the expense of the trip had wellnigh eaten up his savings his heart was as light as his pocket he was going only to the states but he felt that in quitting his native soil the voyage to london the temple of art and to his uncle its highpriest had begun the moon shone over the twinkling harbor like a great gold coin and as the vessel spread its canvas wings and glided out of the confusion of shipping matt felt that its name was not the least happy omen in this auspicious moment the ship was named the enterprise that night finding some confusion about the distribution of bunks matt lay down on deck with artistic anatomy and practical house decoration for his pillows and slept the sleep of the weary tempered by a farrago of inconsequent dreams when he woke up next morning he rubbed his eyes from more than sleepiness halifax seemed still to confront his visionits hills its forts its wharves george island the point and the great harbor in which the enterprise rocked gently what was this hallucination he soon discovered that it was reality there had been a headwind in the night and the ship had dropped her anchor in the harbor for safety the incident was typical in the course of the voyage matt learned to know the captaina grizzled old seadog with the heart of a bitch the ship was his own and he sailed it himself to save expense and check dishonesty there is a proverb about saving a pennyworth of tar and captain bludgeon illustrated it no man was ever so unfitted to walk the quarterdeck his idea of navigation was to hug the coast and he seized every pretext for putting in at creeks or ports and anchoring for the night when the crew would go ashore and come back incapable the schooner itself was an old tub a cumbrous dingeylike craft but sound in timber matt had a rough time though the reading of the arabian nights made the voyage enchanted the passengers were a plebeian crowda score of women mostly servantgirls and single fifteen men emigrating to the states and a few children there were only six bunks the mate had given up his stateroomwhich matt was to have sharedto some of the women those who could not secure bunks herded dressed in a big field bed which also accommodated some of the men likewise sleeping in their clothes for toilet operations all the women resorted to the stateroom which held a mirror and washing apparatus etiquette was freeandeasy the food was horrible the cooks menus being almost ingenious in their unpalatableness fortunately most of the passengers were sick already matt had no immunity all the pangs of his first pipe were repeated without the moral qualms which rationalized those he continued to sleep on deck as often as he could making friends with the stars when the night was too chilly he couched on the woodpile near the stove thus was he spared licentious spectacles and his innocence was granted a little longer term they passed the signals and flagstaff of sable point safely captain bludgeons face as white as the breakers that girdled its barren rock then instead of making a beeline for boston the captain fetched a semicircle following the new england coast line and holding on to the apronstrings of his mother earth such voyaging he conceived to be sure if slow mistakenly enough considering the ironbound character of the coast the passengersonce they had got over their sicknessdid not complain for they had the leisure of poverty and the prospect of indefinite board and lodging was not unpleasing and their frequent stoppingplaces diversified the monotony of the voyage with little excursions one night having been driven into harbor by a capful of wind they witnessed the torchlight fishing it was a scene that set matts fingers itching for the brushwaving torches glittering on the water from dozens of boats and lighting up the tanned faces of the fishers who were scooping up the herrings with nets every detail gave him the keenest joythe wavering refractions in the water the leaping silver of the fish touched with gold flame the sombre mystery of sea and sky above and around the night was made even more memorable for some of the girls who had landed brought back in giggling triumph many bundles of cured herrings which they had pilfered from an unguarded smokehouse and these they generously distributed so that the whole ship supped deliciously in defiance of the cook on another occasionin the afternoon at highwatermatt and about a score of the passengers the majority females went on shore to pick graybeards as they called the gray cranberries that grew in the swamps and they tarried so long that when they came back to the boat they found the tide turned and two hundred yards of mud between them and the water one of the men tried the mud and sank to the knees in slimy batter in the end there was nothing for it but to launch the empty boat and then wade to it the launching was easy the boat slipping along as on grease but the sequel was boisterous jack floss a strapping anglosaxon with a blond mustache and a devilmaycare humor set the example of giving a woman a pickaback to save her skirts and the few other men followed suit returning again and again for fresh freight the air resounded with hysterical giggling and screaming as the women frantically clutched their bearers some of whom extorted unreluctant kisses under jocose threats of tumbling their burdens over into the mud one or two actually carried out their threats by involuntarily stepping suddenly into a gutter worn by the rains and sinking up to the waist but the mishaps abated no jot of the madcap merrimentit rather augmented the rowdiness as the women were hauled from their mudbaths for his part matt waded warily more conscious of the responsibility than of the fun for he was doing his duty manfully as became a lad stout sturdy and sixteen his second burden was a slim pretty servantgirl named priscilla and when he was depositing her speckless in the boat she took the opportunity of the embrace to kiss him in hearty gratitude matt dropped her like a hot coal he felt scorched and flustered and had a bewildered moment of burning blushes ere he ploughed his way back to rescue another of the distressed damsels that sudden kiss was an epoch in his growth a discomfort at the time the aftertaste of it lent new warmth to his interest in the royal amours of the arabian nights in his dreams he bore delectable eastern princesses across perilous magic marshes and their gratitude found him stockish no longer the next episode in this curious creeping voyage was superficially more critical for matt a sudden gale upset all poor captain bludgeons calculations he was near shore as usual and tried to beat into harbor almost under bare poles but the haven was of a dangerous entrance narrow and choked in the throat by a rock and no one on board had sufficient seamanship to get the schooner in the mate advised abandoning the hope of harbor and setting the jib and the jibforesail to make leeway the captain swore by everything unholy he would not go a cable farther out to sea the night was closing in but the wind dying away the enterprise anchored outside the harbor but in the night the wind sprang up from the opposite quarter fiercer than ever and the vessel dragged her anchors and drove towards the rock that squatted on guard at the mouth of the harbor pitching helplessly in the shifting troughs in the inky blackness great swamping waves carried off her boats her topsails and both houses her anchors were left behind her and part of the bulwarks was likewise torn away fortunately her cables held out as she drove bumping along though they did not moderate her pace sufficiently to prevent her keel being partially torn away when she bumped upon a reef yet she jolted over the reef and drifted blindly on and on none knew whither within the schooner the scene was almost as wild as without the womens screams rivalled those of the wind the distracted creatures ran up and down the companionladder getting in the way of the crew the captain went below to quiet themand did not return apparently he preferred the society of his own sex the mate thus left in command boarded up the companionway to stop the aimless scurrying and told off some of the crew to help him unload the cargo which consisted of plaster and to pitch it overboard matt and the cook bore a hand in the work not daring to unhatch for fear of being waterlogged they had to pass the plaster through the lazaret jack floss did his best to comfort the females by profanities he laughed and hoped the lord would damn the old hulk whose fleas were big enough to swim ashore on his cool blasphemies calmed some but others plainly regarded him as a jonah matt was half perturbed half fascinated by this unconventional vagabond of the real danger his own buoyancy made light when the morning light came at last it showed that they had providentially skirted the grim rock and were drifting into harbor the deck was covered with dbris and with sand which the ship had stirred and raked up in her dragging progress along the shallow waters piles of grit had accumulated in the corners and the waves on which she tossed were discolored with dirt very soon she passed a little island where a brig lay moored and with great difficultyfor the sea was still running highthe brig sent her a hawser and made her fast then they were enabled to realize further the extent of their luck for the harbor was strewn with wreckage no fewer than seven schooners had gone down and only two men had been saved the harbor was alive with boats looking for the dead captain bludgeon bestriding his desolate quarterdeck congratulated himself on his seamanship he arranged with a tug to draw the enterprise back to st john new brunswick for repairs the few impatient passengers who could afford to pay an extra fee went on to boston by the rescuing brig but the majority stuck to the enterprise and captain bludgeon who was compelled to board and lodge them at a cheap waterside hotel while the schooner was laid up thus were the fates kind to these waifs on the ocean of life who enjoyed the holiday after their mannerplain living and high jinksand had no need of satan or even jack floss to find mischief for their idle hands to do matt however was not of the roysterers he had remained with the enterprise of course not having the money to exchange but the scenery of a new townand that a hillgirt town like st john with a cathedral a silver water and a forest afire with flowerswas always sufficient business for him the cathedral was not so colossal as it had loomed to his childish fancy through mctavits reminiscences after a day or two matt found an even more delightful occupation he happened to remark to jack floss that the ceiling of the hotel sittingroom would be all the better for a little ornamentation and that worthy straightway sought out the proprietor a gentleman of scotch descent and expressed himself so picturesquely that matt was offered a dollar to make the ceiling worthy of being sat under by artistic souls like jack floss thereupon jack floss and everybody else except matt were turned out of the sittingroom and the boy guided by his practical house decoration in the mixing of colors and the preparation of plaster stood on the ladder and stencilled one of his imaginative medleys his fellowpassengers were not permitted to see it till it was ready but speculation was rife and the rumor of its glories had spread about the waterside and on showday the room was packed with motley spectators gazing reverently heavenward as at fireworks some breaking out into rapturous exclamations that made the boy more hot and uncomfortable than even the damsels kiss had done he was glad he was almost invisible squeezed into a corner by the crowd and despite his discomfort aggravated by a crick in the back of the neck due to painting with his hand over his head there was a subtle pleasure for him in his fellowpassengers facile recognition of the torchlight fishing scene which formed the centre of the decorations the hotel bar did good business that day just before the enterprise started again for boston a man came to see the ceiling and immediately offered the artist a commission there was a paintshop in the railwaycarriage works and matt could have a situation just vacant there at ten dollars a week dazzled by these fabulous terms which seemed almost to realize his ambition at a bound matt accepted and the enterprise patched up and refitted sailed without him a few hours later he discovered that it had also sailed without priscilla that seductive young person having found a berth as chambermaid in the hotel she came into matts room to tidy up and expressed her joy at the prospect of looking after his comfort but the boy told her he must seek less comfortable quarters and despite her protests and her offers to help him temporarily he departed for cheaper lodgings leaving behind him a perfunctory promise to call and see her soon jack floss whom matt gratefully regarded as the architect of his fortunes had half a mind to stay behind too he said he wanted to go under and the enterprise didnt seem to have any luck but at the last moment he found that he could not desert the ladies matt was more sorry to part from him than from priscilla there was something in the young mans devilmaycare manner that appealed to the germs of bohemianism in the artistic temperament the young artist had however an unpleasant reminder of the defects of the bohemian temperament for jack floss was forced to confess that he had lost the copy of the arabian nights which he had persuaded matt to lend him to beguile the tedium of the days of waiting the boy was grievously distressed by the loss it seemed an insult to ruth hailey and a misprision of her kindly wishes however it was no use crying over spilled milk and jack floss slightly assuaged his chagrin by fishing out from among his miscellaneous effects a volume of shelley in small type and anotherwith an even more microscopic textcontaining the complete works of lord byron both books opened as by long usage at their most erotic pages through these ivory gates the boy passed into the great world of romantic poetry whole stanzas remained in his memory the brain that had refused to retain bible verses spending hours in quest of the tiniest absorbed the sensuous images of the poets without effort he fell asleep with them on his lips in the railwaycarriage shopa spacious saloon as full of painters as an atelier in the quartier latinmatt was allowed a free hand on great canvases that when filled with flowers and landscapes were nailed to the roofs of the carriages by electroplated pins he also decorated the wooden panels with scrollwork and foliage and gilded the lettering outside the doors thus was the citizen fed on art at every turn standing under his ceiling or sitting on his chair or lying on his sofa or travelling on his railway art is notoriously elevating but as the depraved quarters of the town continued to flourish the art must have been bad matts career in the paintshop was neither so long nor so pleasant as he had anticipated his pictures did not please his fellowartists as much as his employers and he became the butt of the place a series of impalpable irritations almost too slight for analysis subtle with that devilish refinement of which coarseness is only capable when it is cruel rendered his life intolerable matts vocabulary was too mincing for his fellowcraftsmen they resented his absence of expletives though imperceptibly he succumbed to the polluted atmosphere which had surrounded him ever since he set foot in halifax and the boy whose mind was stored with lovely images and ethereal lyrics began to bespatter his talk with meaningless oaths nor was this his only coquetry with corruption for the daily taunt of milksop conspired with the ferment of youth varnishingday was his day of danger it was payday and matt had boundless money it was also the hardest day of the six the windup when all the work of the week was varnished in an atmosphere of sixty degrees and the poor lad drunk with the fumes of turpentine sticky from head to foot his face besplashed his eyes stinging his nose red and his brain dizzy threw off his apron and overalls and reeled to the door and groped his way into the streets to breathe in the glorious fresh air and revel like the rest of his fellows in the joy of lifeaye and the joy of license the saturnalia of saturday night for the glorious fresh air soon palled and in the evening matt was dragged by his mates to a species of musichall in a hotel near the harbor where in a festive reek of bad tobacco and worse whiskey he repeated the choruses of winking soubrettes dubious refrains whose inner meaning the brag and badinage of the workshop had made obscurely clear but disgust invariably supervened byron and shelley were his sunday reading and under the spell of their romantic song which chimed with his souls awakening melodies he revolted against his lowminded companions hating himself for almost sinking to their level he felt that he inhabited a rarer ether he was conscious of a curious aloofness not only from them but from humanity at large and yet here he was joining in their coarse conviviality to such a mood the accidental turning up of an old sketch of his halifax divinity on her horse appealed as decisively as an accidental text was wont to appeal to his mother the beautiful curves of her figure the purity of her complexion rebuked him perhaps it was because he was an artist that his soul was touched through the concrete in a spasm of acuter disgust and in a confidence of higher destinies he threw up his berth he had saved twenty dollarstwenty stout planks between him and the deep but the luck that had been his hitherto deserted him in six weeks he had only one fortunate fortnight when he carried the hod for a housejoiner and was nearly choked by the veering round of a little ladder through which he had popped his head in mounting a bigger one by one his twenty planks slipped from under him and then he found himself struggling in the lowest depths the few dollars he had squandered on the musichall haunted him with added reproach too proud to beg or to go back to the paintshop or to write to his mother his only possessions his clothes and a box of cheap watercolors he carried with his slim library in his jacket pockets he searched the streets for an odd job or stood about the wharves amid the stevedores and negroes to earn a copper by unasked assistance in rolling casks into warehouses till at last when the cathedral lawn was carpeted with autumn leaves the streets became his only lodging hungry and homeless he was beginning to regret his hut in the woods and to meditate a retreat from civilization for in the frosty nights that shadowed the genial autumn days this unsheltered life was not pleasant when by one of those strokes of fortune which fall to the most unfortunate he found a nightrefuge a fellowlodger of his at the hotel of the beautiful star a glassblower out of work with whom he had once halved his evening bread fell into employment and gratefully offered him the nocturnal hospitality of the factory here voluptuously couched on warm white sand piles and barrels of which lay all about the boy forgot the gnawing emptiness of his stomach and the forlornness of his situation in the endless fascination of the weird effects of light and shade it was a vast place dim despite its gasjets mysterious with shadowy black corners the red flannel shirts of the men struck a flamboyant note of color in the duskiness the stokers were outlined in red before the roaring furnaces the blowers were bathed in a dazzling white glow from the glass at the end of their blowpipes so that their brawny bare arms and the sweat on their brows stood out luridly with every movement with every flickering and waning light there was a changing play of color matt would lie awake in his corner taking mental notes or recording the action of muscles by the pencilled silhouette of some picturesque figure rolling the pliant glass great painters he thought in his boyish ignorance worked from imagination on a basis of memory but he was not strong enough yet to dispense with observation though observation always brought despair of his power to catch the evershifting subtleties of living nature in the enthralment of these studies and in his sensuous delight in the dantesque effects matt often omitted to sleep altogether and sometimes on that background of ruddy gloom other visions opened out to the boy dreaming on his bed of sinuous sand the real merged into the imaginative and this again into the fantasies of delicious drowsihead the walls fell away the factory blossomed into exotic realms of romance peerless houris ripe in womanhood passed over moonsilvered waters in gliding caques prisoned princesses pining for love showed dark starry eyes behind the latticework of verandas pensive maidens divinely beautiful wandered at twilight under crescent moons rising faint and ghostly behind groves of cedars london too figured in the pageantry of his dreams glittering like a city of the arabian nights ablaze with palaces athrob with music and perched on the top of the tallest cupola on the loftiest hill stood his uncle matthew holding his paintbrush like a sceptre king of the realm of art hark was that not the kings trumpeters calling calling him to the great city calling him to climb up and take his place beside the sovereign oh the call to his youth the clarion call summoning him forth to toils and triumphs in some enchanted land oh the seething of the young blood that thronged the halls of dream with loveliness and set seductive faces at the casements of sleep and sanctified his waking reveries with prescient glimpses of a sweet spiritwoman waiting in some veiled recess of space and time to partake and inspire his consecration to art the narrow teachings of his childhoodthe conception of a vale of tears and temptationshrivelled away like clouds melting into the illimitable blue merging in a vast sense of the miracle of a beautiful world a world of infinitely notable form and color and this expansion of his horizon accomplished itself almost imperceptibly because the oppression of that ancient lowhanging heaven overbrooding earth of that sombre heaven lying over cobequid village like a pall was not upon him and he was free to move and breathe in an independence that made existence ecstasy even at its harshest so that though he walked in hunger and cold he walked under triumphal arches of rainbows chapter ix artist and puritan but the dauntless practical youth lay beneath the dreamer even as the puritan lay beneath the artist matt could not consent to live on his host the glassblower who shared his lunch with himin the middle of the nightand he was almost reduced to applying again at the paintshop when the captain of a schooner gave him a chance to work his way to economy on the basin of minas twentyfive miles below cobequid village matt had to make up his mind in a hurry for this was the last ship bound north before the bay was frozen for the winter and ships bound south for the states seemed always to have a plethora of crew the mental conflict added to the pains of the situation to go north again was to confess defeat but was it not a severer defeat to lessen a poor mans lunch even although he accepted only a minimum on the pretext of not being hungry this reflection decided him though he had no prospects in economy and nothing to gain but a few days food and shelter he agreed informally to ship and to help load the schooner at nightfall he would have preferred to go on board at once were it only to dine off a ships biscuit but no one suspected his straits and so he had an afternoon of sauntering on the hilly outskirts of the city he was stopped by a stylish young lady so dazzling in dress and beauty that for a moment he did not recognize priscilla a fashionable crinoline and a fullsleeved astrakhan sacque together with an afghan muffler round her throat had given the slim chambermaid an imposing portliness an astrakhan toque with a waving red feather was set daintily on her head and below the sacque her gown showed magnificent with bows and airy flounces evidently her afternoon out good land she cried what have you been up to nothing im in a hurry he said flushing shamefacedly as he passed hastily on but priscilla caught him by the hem of his jacket dont look so skairt why havent you been to see me all this time too busy he murmured too proud i reckon i thought youd come for to look at your decorations anyways lets go right along there you aint lookin as smart as a cricket thats a fact ill make you a glass o real nice grog to pick you up some he shook his head im going awayim off to economy scat you want to give me the mitten why dont you speak straight you dont like me she looked at him half provoked half provokingly he looked at her with his frank boyish gaze he noted the red curve of her pouting lips the subtle light in her eyes the warm coloring of the skin shadowed at the neck by waves of soft brown hair in which the beads of a chenille net glistened bluishly he was pleasured by the brave note of the red feather against the shining black of the toque the piquant relation of the toque to the face and he thought how delightful it would be to transfer all these tones and shades to canvas he forgot to answer her he tried to store up the complex image in his memory im glad you dont deny it she said her angry face belying her words he started oh yes i like you well enough he said awkwardly her face softened archly then why dont you come an see me i wont bite you im sorry im sailing tonight i guess you aint she smiled imperious solicitation what are you goin to do in economy why dont you stick to the paintshop ive left there way back in the summer what made you leave oh well then you aint got no money there was tender concern in her tones not hardly how many meals have you had today he had a flash of resentment dont you worry about me he said gruffly bother said priscilla contemptuously though her voice faltered youre jest goin to come along and have a good square meal no im not im not hungry any oh matt where do you expect to go to said priscilla with a roguish disarming smile not with you rejoined matt smiling in response priscilla laughed heartily the white teeth gleamed roguishly against the full red lips come along she said with goodhumored conclusiveness he shook a smiling head im going to economy youre comin with me the bossll stand you a dinner for repairin your decorations why whats wrong with them he asked anxiously he knew from his book how liable such things were to decay oh the centre of the ceilin is a bit off color that silly old owl of a cynthia spilt a pail of water on the floor above you dont say he cried in concern honest injun i was jest mad you could get lots to do if you would stay at our shanty ill come and put the ceiling right he said indecisively and giving her his hand with shy awkwardness was promenaded in triumph through the dignified streets he felt a thrill of romance as this dazzling person clasped his hand clingingly he wondered how she dared be seen with so shabby a being the juxtaposition had a touch of the arabian nights of the amorous adventures of his daydreams it was like a princess wooing a pauper they passed other couples better matchedsome in the first stage of courtship some in the second in the first stage the female and the male walked apartshe near the wall talking glibly he at the edge of the sidewalk silent gazing straight ahead in apparent disconnection in the second stage the lovers walked closer together but now both gazed straight ahead and both were silent only if one looked between them one saw two red hands clasped together like the antenn of two insects in conversation when priscilla and matt met pairs in this advanced stage her hand tightened on his and she sidled nearer it was like a third stage and matts sense of romance was modified by a blushing shamefacedness as they entered the hotel matt made instinctively towards the sittingroom to see his damaged decorations but priscilla protesting that he must feed first steered him hurriedly upstairs into his old apartment he was too faint with hunger to resist her stronger will there you silly boy she said affectionately depositing him in a chair before the stove which she lighted now you jest set there while i tell the boss she lingered a moment to caress his dark hair then stooping down suddenly she kissed him and fled matts heart beat violently the blood hustled in his ears the sense of romance grew stronger but mingled therewith was now an uneasy indefinable apprehension of the unknown the magnetism of priscilla repelled as much as it drew him his romance was touched with vague terror yet as the fire vivified the bleak bedroom with its textornamented walls the warm curves of the girls face painted themselves on the air subtly alluring priscilla herself was back soon bearing some cold victual and some hot grog and watched with tender satisfaction the boys untroubled appetite she drank a little too when he was done and they clinked glasses and matt felt it was all very wicked and charming stanzas of shelley and byron pulsed in his memory tropical flowers of speech blossomed in his brain but only weeds sprouted out it was real good of you priscilla to speak to the boss id better see to the ceiling at once oh dont it can wait till tomorrow but i promised to go aboard tonight you nasty feller youre goin to shake me after all dont say that priscilla he said shyly i only wish i could do something to show my gratitude to you no you dont priscillas bosom heaved and tears were in her eyes yes i do you dont like me i do you dont think im pretty she had removed her things now revealing the natural gracefulness of her figure oh priscilla said matt looking at her why id give anything if i could he paused timidly well why cant you interrupted priscilla her face very close to his im not good enough yet and the lights failing why what do you want of the light i cant paint so well by night the color looks different in the day but id give anything to be able to paint something as pretty as you priscilla swept her glass aside pettishly lan sakes what a boy pictures pictures pictures if it aint the ceilin its me there are better things on this earth than pictures matt matt shook his head with a sceptical smile priscilla looked disconcerted why didnt you say i was prettier than a picture matt oh thats different he parried feebly then feeling her fascination lulling him to forgetfulness of the price to be paid for his dinner as well as of the mute appeal of his damaged designs he jumped up id best see to the ceiling before its too late i wonder if theyve kept the materials handy set down matt oh but i mustnt cheat the boss whos talkin o cheatin this is my treat oh but it aint right o you priscilla he protested never mind when im down on my luck you shall do as much for me ill send you half a dollar from economy he said resolutely then smiling to temper his ungraciousness he added short reckonings make long friends heyas an old deacon i knew used to say i guess ill go downstairs now priscilla what for you havent got to go aboard till nightfall youre forgetting the ceiling i kind o want to touch it up all the same you silly boy she said with a fond smile that was only my fun priscilla he stared at her in reproachful amazement was his incurable trust in humanity always to be shaken thus dont look so solemn but you told me a fib scat dyou think i was goin to let you fool around on an empty stomach but you told me a lie the boy towered over her like an irate judgmentangel priscilla had a happy thought but you told me a lie you said you warnt hungry matt looked startled oh but thatthat was different he stammered again cant see it tit for tat matt pondered in silence priscilla rose set down she said soothingly and the boy feeling confusedly guilty let himself be pressed down into his seat priscilla nestled to him sharing his chair and pressing her soft cheek to his was he mad with his poor little priscilla she cooed no he mustnt be angry bless his handsome face matt was not angry any longer but he was uncomfortable he tried to whip up his sense of romance to feel what he felt in reading lovepoetry to fancy that he was sitting with a pensive princess in a cedar grove under a crescent moon but he could only feel that priscilla was a real terrestrial person and mendacious at that priscillas lips sought his in a long kiss you are fond o me matt arent you she murmured coaxingly matts conscience checked conventional response he faltered slowly i guess youre real good to me a moment later the door opened priscilla sprang up hurriedly and to be doing something noisily pulled down the rollerblind that you cynthia she said carelessly yes its me grumbled the old woman youre wanted downstairs in a jiffy im just lighting mr strangs candles she said fumbling about for them in the darkness she had herself produced rayther early croaked cynthia yes mr strang wants to paint there aint enough light to see by replied priscilla glibly while matt felt his cheeks must surely be visible by the light of their own glow the candles were lit and priscilla ostentatiously running into the next room returned with a sheet of white paper there you are mr strang she cried cheerfully adding in a whisper ill be back presently you wont go tonight will you and her eyes pleaded amorously no sooner had priscilla disappeared than matts perception of romance in the position began to return but it was an impersonal artistic perception he was but a spectator of the situation he could not understand his own apathetic aloofness he walked restlessly about the room trying to pump up byronic emotion but finding the well of sentiment strangely dry his eye wandered to the blind and became censoriously absorbed in the crude flowers and figures stamped upon the arsenicgreen background he studied the effects of the candlelight on the glaring coloration noting how the yellow roses had turned pink then priscillas face flew up amid the flare of flowers and matt seizing the sheet of paper and pulling out his paintbox forgot everything else even the artificial light in the task of expressing priscilla in watercolor he had nearly finished the sketch which glowed with dainty vitality though the figure came out too ladylike suddenly the sound of voices broke upon his ear priscilla and cynthia were talking outside his door his critical situation recurred to him in a flash his broken promise to the captain if he yielded to the pertinacious priscilla the artists imagination might enflame the crude actuality chilled curiosity alone persisting and the latent puritan leaped up at bay faraway reminiscences of whispered references to the flesh and the devil resurged with all that mystic flavor of chill unspeakable godlessness that attaches to sins dimly apprehended in childhood remember thy creator in the days of thy youth seen suddenly in red letters on one of the walltexts was like the voice of a minatory providence poor priscilla became an advancing serpent dragging insidious coils he shut up his paintbox hastily and scribbling beneath the sketch for priscillawith matts thanks he puffed at the candles only one went out priscilla was still talking outside his heart was thumping with excitement as he added in a corner i promised the captain goodbye then blowing out the other candle he waited striving to draw serener breath as priscilla still dallied without only a blurred glimmer showed through the isinglass of the stove door the room was quite dark he began to hope she would ascend with cynthia and leave the coast temporarily clear but at last only cynthias step receded and he heard priscilla turning the doorhandle it was an anxious moment he heard her exclamation of surprise have you gone to bed she cried he held his breath as she grazed his sleeve in the darkness then he glided out and slid boyishly down the banisters like a flash there was a gay hubbub of voices in the saloon he walked unquestioned into the street then ran as if pursued by a horde of amazons till he reached the docks and saw the friendly vessel moored against the wharf remorse for his balked romance set in severely as soon as the bustle of loading was over and the anchor weighed priscilla took on the halo of byronism and the arabian nights which had steadily absented itself in practice often during that miserable voyage he called himself a fool and a milksop for the passage was a nightmare of new duties complicated by seasickness and the weakness of a halfstarved constitution and on that swinging schooner with its foulmouthed captain the mean bedroom he had deserted showed like a stable paradise but blustrous as the captain was by the side of the blubbering bludgeon he had his compensations for he made the voyage before the few passengers had found their sealegs arrived in economy matt was again face to face with starvation but here fortune smiledwith a suspicion of humor in her smile and having already climbed masts and ladders for his dinner her protg was easily tempted to seek it at the top of a steeple the steeple after tapering to a point two hundred feet high was crowned by a ball which for years had needed regilding unfortunately the architect had made the ball almost inaccessible but matt being desperate undertook the job the breath of winter was already on the town a week more and the whole steeple would be decorated for the season with snow so matts offer was accepted and his boots equipped with creepers the young steeplejack begirt with ropes made the ascent safely in the eye of the admiring populace lowered the great ball and then himself and being thereupon given board and lodging and materials he gilded it in the privacy of his garret thus become a public hero matt easily got through the winter he decorated the ceiling of the freemasons hall and painted a portrait of the member of the house of assembly a burly farmer this was his first professional experience of an actual sitter and he found himself more hampered than helped by too close contact with reality however a touch of imagination does no harm to a portrait and matt had by this time acquired sufficient experience of humanity to lean to beautys side even apart from his youthful tendency to idealization which made it impossible for him at this period to paint anything that was not superficially beautiful or picturesque the member pronounced the portrait lifelike and gave matt a bushel of homegrown potatoes over and above the stipulated price which was board and lodging during the period of painting and an order on a store for two dollars with the order matt purchased a pair of congress or sidespring boots the potatoes he swopped for a box of paper collars from economy he wrote home to his mother and received an incoherent letter in which she denounced the deacon by the aid of fulminant texts matt sighed impotently pitying her from his deeper experience of life but hoping she got on better with ole hey than she imagined he had half a mind to look up his folks especially poor billy but just then he got an order from the farmerdeputys brother who wrote that he was so pleased with his brothers portrait that he wished matt to paint his signboard he added that although he had not seen any specimen of matts signwriting he felt confident the painter of that portrait would be a competent person matt accepted the new task with mixed feelings and got so many other commissions from the shopkeepers for every shop had its movable signboard that he soon saved fifty dollars and seemed on the high sea to england and his uncle he had fixed three hundred dollars as the minimum with which he might safely go to london to study art the steerage passage would cost only twenty unfortunately he was persuaded to invest his savings in a partnership with a yankee jewelpeddler and to travel the country with him the peddler did not swindle his partner merely his clients but matt was so disgusted that he refused to remain in the business thereupon the peddler freed from the obligations of partnership treated him as an outsider and refused to return his principal matt thought himself lucky to escape in the end with twentyfive dollars and a cleansed conscience he went back to signpainting but taking a hint from the yankee continued his travels and became a peddlerpainter he hated the work was out of sympathy with his prosaic sitters wondering by virtue of what grace or loveliness they sought survival on canvas but the road to art by way of his uncle in london lay over their painted bodies so he drudged along and yet when the sitter was dissatisfied with the pictureit was generally the sitters friends who persuaded him that he was dissatisfiedand when matt had to listen to the fatuous criticisms of farmers and storekeepers the artist flared up and more than once the hotblooded boy sacrificed dollars to dignity he was astonished to find that in many quarters his fame had preceded him and more astonished to discover finally that the advance advertiser was his late partner whether the yankee compounded thus for the use of matts dollars matt never knew but in his kinder thought of the cute peddler the boy came to think himself the debtor for the dollars mounted one on the head of another and the heap rose higher and higher day by day and week by week till at last the magic three hundred began to loom in the eye of hope three hundred dollars saved by the sweat of the brow and semistarvation and sanctified by the blood and tears of youth sweet to count over and to dream over and to pile up like a tower to scale the skies and so the great day drew near when matt strang would sail across the atlantic chapter x exodus billy strang was dreaming happy dreamsdreams of action and adventure in which he figured not as the morbid cripple but as the straightlimbed hero matt was generally with him in these happy huntinggrounds of sleepdear old matt who had become a creature of dream to his waking life but absorbed as billy was in this phantasmagoric happiness he was still the sport of every unwonted sound from the real world his tremulous nerves quivered at the first shock ready to flash back to his brain the bleaker universe of aches and regrets and rancorous household quarrels tonight he sat up suddenly with a premonition of something strange and gazed into the darkness of the bedroom seeing only the dim outline of the other bed in which his two younger brothers slept after a long moment of mysterious rustling a thin ray of light crept in under the door then the handle turned very softly and his mother glided in swiftly bearing a candle that made a monstrous shadow follow and bend over her she was fully dressed in outdoor attire wearing her bonnet and sacque and muffler her eyes were wide with excitement and shone weirdly and the whole face wore an uncanny look billy trembled in cold terror his mouth opened gaspingly shhhh whispered his mother putting a forefinger to her lips then in hurried accents she breathed quick get up and dress to oncet magnetized by her face he slipped hastily from the bed too awed to question shhhh she breathed again or youll wake ruth then moving with the same noiseless precipitancy her shadow now growing to giant now dwindling to dwarf quick quick children she whispered shaking them the two younger boys sat up dazed by sleep and the candle and were silently bundled out of bed yawning and blinking and automatically commencing to draw on the socks they found thrust into their hands your best clothes she whispered to billy throwing open the cupboard in which they hung the action seemed to loosen his tongue but it aint sunday he breathed shhhh today is a holiday put them on quick quick she replied in the same awful whisper we are goin out of the land of bondage in haste with our loins girded and lo in the mornin in every house there was one dead she set down the candle on the little bare wooden table where it gleamed solemnly in the gaunt room then she fell to feverishly helping the children to dress darting violently from one to another and half paralyzing billy whose fumbling freezing fingers could not keep pace with her frantic impatience he dropped a boot and the sound seemed to echo through the silent house like a diabolical thunderclap he cowered before her blazing eyes as she picked up the boot and violently dumped his foot into it are we goin out mother he said so as not to scream his words sounded sinister and terrible to himself yes ill go an see if the girls are finished dressin she took up the candle and her whisper grew sterner dont make a sound but where are we goin mother he said to detain her for an instant goin home were throwin up the position and for the first time the exultation in her voice raised it above a whisper then putting her forefinger to her lip again not a sound she breathed menacingly and moved on tiptoe to the door her face set and shining her shadow tumbling grotesquely on the walls and ceilings aaah billy fell back on the bed screaming like a flash his mother turned her hand was clapped fiercely over his mouth you little devil she hissed what do you mean by disobeyin the light the light he gurgled she withdrew her hand what are you shakin bout theres light nough she drew up the blind and a faint moonlight blurred itself through the frosty glass youre growed up now you big booby an your brothers are with you ill go with you he gasped clutching at her skirt with that crutch o yours you pesky eyesore she whispered angrily youll stay with the little uns bless their brave little hearts and she clasped the dazed children to her breast the lord hes punished him for his cruelty to you finish your dressin quick she released the two little boys and glided cautiously from the room holding the candle low so that her great wavering shadow darkened the room even before the thicker horror of blackness fell when she was gone the three children pressed together their heartbeats alone audible in the awful stillness they were too bewildered and terrified to exchange even a whisper an impalpable oppression brooded over the icy room and a dull torpor possessed their brain so that they made no effort to understand they only felt that something unreal was happening something preternaturally solemn after a dreamlike interval of darkness the mysterious rustling was repeated without a thin line of light crept again under the door and their mothers face reappeared gleaming lurid in the circle of the candlerays the two girls loomed in her wake a big and a little both wrapped up for a journey but shivering and yawning and rubbing their eyes still glued together by sleep the younger boys who had remained numb guiltily gave the last hasty touches to their costume under the irate gaze of their mother but billys face had grown convulsed his mother advanced towards him dazzling his eyes with the candle and her face and bending down so that her eyes lay almost on his dont you dare to have a fit now she hissed her features almost as agitated as his own or ill cut your throat like ive cut his the intensity of her will mastered him oversweeping even the added horror of her words and combined with the return of the light to ward off the threatened paroxysm he dragged on his topcoat only a few minutes had elapsed since he had sat up in bed yet it seemed hours the mother stealthily led the way through the hushed house down the creaking stairs blowing out the light in the hall when she opened the outer door the cold air smote their faces like a whip as she was cautiously closing the door a dark thing ran out through the aperture there goes his soul she whispered in grim exultation but it was only sprat the creature now old and infirm quietly took his familiar place in the rear of the procession which now set forth over the frozen moonlit snow under the solemn stars in the direction of cobequid village the farmhands asleep in the attic built over the kitchen in an ell or annex to the main house heard nothing ruth sleeping the sleep of virginal health and innocence in her dainty chamber was deep in kindly dreams the woman led the way noiselessly but rapidly so that the little children had to run to keep pace with her and billy dragged himself along by clinging to her skirt dreading to be left behind in the great lonely night the road led downhill towards a little valley in which stood the deacons gristmill hidden by trees but as they drew near it showing dark against the white hill that rose again beyond it they descended towards it through a cutting in the hill lined with overhanging snowdrifts curled like crystallized waves everything seemed dead the millpond was frozen and snowcovered frozen bundles of green hides stood in piles against the front of the mill there were icicles round the edges of the sullen cascade that fell over the dam the millstream was a sheet of ice spotted erminewise with black dots where airholes showed the gloomy water below the procession crossed the little wooden bridge bordered by bare willows whose branches glittered with frost and then the snowpath rose again every sound was heard intensely in the keen airthe rumbling of the little waterfall the gurgling of the stream under the ice the frost fusillade of the zigzag pole fences snapping along the route the crunch of crisp snow under their feet they mounted the hill and reached the broad flat fields that stretched on white and bare to cobequid the last inch of deacon haileys possessions was left behind then the leader of the procession slackened her pace and lifted up her voice in raucous thanksgiving when israel of the lord beloved out from the land of bondage came her fathers god before her moved an awful guide in smoke and flame now then sing up children she cried bewildered and still half asleep they obeyedin bleating quavering tones that came through chattering teeth to an accompaniment of cloudy breath the woman and her children passed on into the night singing amid the stretches of sky and space they seemed a group of black insects crawling across a great white plain abner preep coming down before dawn found a bunch of children on the great kitchen settee asleep in their clothes the mother sat on the floor before the open stove smiling happily and muttering to herself they had quietly taken possession of the old familiar room and stirred up the slumbering fire for the first few seconds abner wondered if he was dreaming for the next if he were mad but another look at the crouching woman convinced him that it was not he that was mad while a phrase from her babbling lips sent something of the truth home to his beating heart he roused harriet and broke the news as gently as time permitted the brave girl bade him drive at once to deacon haileys while she kept guard over her mother abner thereupon mounted his horse bareback to save time and galloped to the farm to his relief he found the deacon little injured the neglect of his beard had been ole heys salvation it had sprouted thick and tangled about his throat and the mad woman armed with a blunt knife had only inflicted a fleshwound leaving the trachea unsevered the sleeping man suddenly awakening to the strange spectacle of his wife in outdoor attire brandishing a knife had fainted from horror and loss of blood but presently recovering consciousness he had clamored for ruth and with her help bound up the wound already half stanched by the clogging beard the matter was kept in the family but the deacon swore he would have no more to do with the woman or her unmannerly brood beyond paying the minimum for her incarceration where she could do no more mischief and so abner took her forthwith by sleigh and train to the capital and placed her in a private asylum in this manner mrs strang went back to halifax when matt heard the awful tidings his aircastles crashed and fell as at the crack of doom abner preep was the messenger of evil for matts painting tour had brought him near halifax and abner thought it best to look up his boyish enemy ere he went back home beneath all the tumult of consternation in matts breast there throbbed an undertone of remorsea vague feeling that this would never have happened had he been on the spot his boyish wilfulness had received its deathblow but it served him right he cried with irresistible bitterness when he heard the deacon had not only washed his hands of the family but was now vindictively pressing abner for the arrears of the mortgage interest which had been allowed to lapse while abner was building up his position abner had always understood that mrs strang had exacted the freedom of her property but there was nothing in black and white theres no gettin out of it said abner gloomily but your poor father must hev made an everlastin mess of it fur how there comes to be so much to pay arter all these years fur a few acres of ground an a wretched shanty durned if i can make out he cheated father you may depend said matt hotly i wouldnt go as fur nor thet said abner it aint right to call a man a thief without proof anyway ive got to stump up i shouldnt ha minded it in an ornery way though i hev got two babies bless their souls but it comes hard jest now with five extra mouths to feed oh but you are not going to feed them who then me of course nonsense nonsense matt said abner youve got to go to london an larn paintin harriets told me all bout you an shes got some o your picters an theyre rael beautiful theres one in our bedroom besides theyre all growed up now amost an theyll soon be feedin theirselves an then you see the house itself is your sisters not mine its mighty good of you said matt hoarsely but it isnt fair no more it was o me fightin you thet thar time said abner smiling this evens things up there was a great lump in matts throat so that he could not speak he held out his hand mutely and abner took it and they gripped each other so heartily that the tears started to the eyes of both then thets settled said abner with husky cheeriness no thats only to beg your pardon said matt recovering his voice ive been a skunk to you thats a fact but im not going to behave badly again im just raking in the dollars now hand over fist and learning painting all the time into the bargain i dont want a bit to go to london and ive put by two hundred and eighty dollars that arent the least use to me and that ll just come in handy to pay the old scoundrel and i can easily send you five dollars a week till i earn more billy alone ll cost you near that i guess and its my fault he cant earn anything hardly in the end the imperious matt had his way and while the boy went on to see his mother abner returned home with the situation considerably lightened the bearer of money for deacon hailey and loving messages for all matts brothers and sisters even harriet being now restored to grace matt found his mother in a small padded room in a house that stood on the hill overlooking the harbor she was gazing yearningly seaward and tears trickled down her doleful cheeks matt stood silently near the door surveying her askance with aching heart abner had told him that her life with deacon hailey had grown a blank to her and he wondered if she would recognize him in the last two years he had shot up from a hobbledehoy into a tall stalwart youth when she turned her head at last and espied him she leaped up with a wild cry of joy and folded him in her arms davie she cried rapturously my own davie at last i didnt see your ship come in a nervous thrill ran down matts spine as he submitted to her embrace the separate tragedies of his parents lives seemed poignantly knit together in this supreme moment theyre so strict with me here davie she said take me away from my folks anywhere where we can be happy and free i dont care what they say any morei am so tired of all this humdrum life matt pacified her as best he could and promising to arrange it all soon left her his heart nigh breaking he walked about the bustling streets like one in a dream resenting the sunshine and wondering why all these people should be so happy again that ancient image of his fathers dead face was tossed up on the waves of memory to keep company henceforth with the deathinlife of his mothers face the breakdown of his ambition seemed a petty thing beside these vaster ironies of human destiny book iichapter i in london on a dull february day a respectably clad steerage passenger disembarked at southampton with little luggage and great hopes he was only twenty but he looked several years older there were deep traces of thought and suffering in the face bronzed though it was and despite the vigorous set of the mouth and the jaw the dark eyes were soft and dreamy he was cleanshaven except for a darkbrown mustache which combined with the little tangle of locks on his forehead to suggest the artistic temperament and to repel the insinuation of rough openair labor radiating from his sturdy frame and bearing matt strangs foot had touched england at last two long monotonous years of steadfast endurance selfsacrifice and sordid economiestwo years of portrait and sign painting interrupted by spells of wagonstriping at two and a half dollars a day had again given him the mastery of three hundred dollars despite his despatch of five dollars a week to abner preep and of a final subsidy of one hundred dollars to bridge over the time till he should have a footing in england gradually the cloud of despondency had rolled off the springtime of life and aspiration would not be denied and though the pity and terror of his mothers tragedy had tamed his high spirit and snapped the springs of buoyancy the passion for painting returned with an intensity that dulled him to every appeal of the blood in his veins and with it a haunting fear that he could never live to see london or his artist uncle that he would die in the flower of his youth all his possibilities latent so impatient was he to give this fear the lie that he suffered a vexatious loss through his hurry to realize the bills and the goods in which his art had too often found payment when the steamer floundered into a field of ice off newfoundland his semisuperstitious feeling wellnigh amounted to a quiet conviction that he would be shipwrecked in sight of port the three hundred dollars serving but to sink him deeper without stopping in southampton to tempt providence he went straight on to london every vein in him pulsing with feverish anticipations of mysterious splendors the engine panted in answering exultation and the rattle of the carriages was a rhythmic song of triumph at last he was approaching the city of his dreamsthe mighty capital of culture and civilization where art was loved and taught and honored for some days now his whole being had been set in this key he sat at the window gazing eagerly at the sunless landscapes that raced past him gradually he became aware of the approach of the monstrous city fields were interrupted by houses later houses were interrupted by fields then the rural touches grew fewer and fewer and at last he sped under a leaden sky amid appalling endless everlasting perspectives of chimneypots and sooty tiles and dingy houses and dead walls and vomiting columns and gasworks and blankfaced factories reeking with oppressive odorson and on and on as amid the infinities of a mean inferno whirring past geometrical rows of murky backyards with dustbins and clotheslines and fleeting glimpses of grimy women and shockheaded children and slouching men thundering over bridges that spanned gray streets relieved by motley traffic and advertisement hoardings and flashing past gaunt mansions of povertybald structures with peeling fronts and bleared windows there was a sombre impressiveness in the manifold frowziness the squalid monotony it was the sublime of the sordid fresh as matt was from the immensities of sea and sky the shabbiness of the spectacle caught at his throat he thought chokingly of the unnumbered unnoticed existences dragging dismally along within those bleak congested barracks what had all this to do with art the glow of his blood died away to be rekindled only by the seething streets into which he emerged from the clangorous maze of waterloo station the throb of tumultuous life that beat as a drum and stirred the blood as a trumpet yet he had not come up to conquer london but to sit at its feet his bitter experience of life had destroyed every vestige of cocksureness almost of confidence leaving him shy and sometimes appalled at his own daring as he realized the possibilities of selfdelusion he knew that fame and money were the guerdons of art but these were only indirectly in his mind if they sometimes flashed to his heart in intoxicating instants of secret hope he was too full of the consciousness of his disadvantages and imperfections to think much of anything beyond getting the necessary training far down the vista of thought and years lay this rosy rim of splendor a faint haze dimly discerned but the joy of learning and practising his art was the essence of his yearning and yet there were moments like this of feeling london under his foot for the first time when a consciousness of power welled up in his soula sense of overflowing energy and immovable purpose that lifted him high above the crowd of shadows escaping the touts and cabmen he carried his valise across a great noiseful bridge to the nearest inexpensivelooking hotel intending to secure a base of operations from which to reconnoitre london before looking up his uncle but though he was at once booked for a room the genteel air of the place with its welldressed customers and whitetied waiters terrified him with the prevision of a portentous bill he would have backed out at once had he dared but he thought now that he was in for it he would give it a weeks trial he took only his breakfasts there however though the unnatural hour at which he took them made him an object of suspicion he seemed always on the point of catching an early train his other meals were taken at those modest restaurants where twopence is not a tip but the price of a dish and the menu is cut up into slips and pasted across the shopwindow his first visit on the day of his arrival was to the national gallery not only to fulfil a cherished dream but to see his uncles pictures to talk of which might smooth the meeting but he could nowhere come across the works of matthew strang and a catalogue he could not afford and he soon forgot the unseen pictures in the emotions excited by the seen which plunged him into alternate heats of delight and chills of despair despair alone possessed him at first in his passage through the florentine and sienese rooms the symbolic figures of catholicism had scant appeal for a soul which in its emergence from puritan swaddlings had not opened out to medivalism and the strange draughtsmanship blinded him to everything else if margaritone or even botticelli was art then his ideas must be even cruder than he had feared he was relieved to find as he continued his progress that it must be the madonnas that were crude for he was apparently following the evolution of art but the sense of his own superior technique was briefdespair came back by another route before the later masters he was reduced to a worshipper thrilled to tears and somewhat to his own astonishment it was not only the poetic and imaginative that compelled this religious ecstasy his soul was astrain for high vision yet it was seized at once by moronis portrait of a tailor and by the exquisite modellingthough he did not know the word for itof the head in his portrait of an ecclesiastic to the young nova scotian who had so chafed at having to paint uncouth farmers it was an illumination to see how in the hands of a teniers or above all a rembrandt the commonplace could be transfigured by force of technique and sympathy and yet he surrendered more willingly to the romantic held by the later philip the fourth of velasquez as much for its truculent kingly theme as for the triumphantly subtle coloring which got the effects of modelling almost without the aid of shadows and the fever of inspiration and mastery the sense of flowing paint which pervaded and animated the portrait of the admiral was the more entrancing because of the romantic figure of the spanish sailor while beside rembrandts jewish merchant with its haunting suggestion of suffering and the east even the fine vandyke its neighbor seemed to lose in poetry the brilliant and seizing qualities had his first vote luminosity of color richness of handling grip of compositionall that leaped to the eye being alone he had the courage of his first impressions and having always been alone he had the broadness that is clipped by school the beautiful sense of form and landscape in titians christ appearing to mary magdalen captivated him though for subject he preferred the bacchus and ariadne he was equally for murillos st john and the lamb and for andrea del sartos portrait of himself for palmas christlike portrait of a painter he wondered wistfully whence bassanos good samaritan took the glow of its color or greuzes head of a girl its pathetic grace and he was as struck by the fine personal if sometimes unsure touch of gainsborough as by the vigorous handling and extraordinary painting force of sir joshua reynolds whose children alone he found unreservedly delicious amid many sound if superficial judgments were many crude admirations and condemnations destined to undergo almost annual revision at the present stage of his growth for example the charming correggio was his ideal of an artistto wit a skilful painter suffusing poetical themes with poetical feeling subject counted for him a sympathetic theme seemed to him of the essence of art but the craftsman in him was not to be suppressed when he was absorbed in raphaels pope julius ii his practical self suggested that the reds needed varnishing to bring up the head from the background and though the fine feeling of joseph riberas dead christ awoke longdormant chords of religious emotion what moved him most was the modelling of the foot caressed by the magdalens hair his emotion subsided in the study of the painters mannerisms his heavy blacks and shadows his delight in the luminous quality of bordones portrait of a lady was modified by an uneasy conviction that the left hand was unnatural even in moronis portraits the hands seemed slightly too small though he was astonished at the triviality of subject in gerard dows fish and poultry shop he must fain admire the exquisite quality of the stilllife passages and the loving patience of the infinite touches in van mieris treatment of the same subject he found a resentful pleasure in the discovery that despite the marvellous accuracy of the dish of fish and the vegetables the womans head was too little her left arm too heavy and too big for the right her flesh more like fish and her very cat purring in contented ignorance of its wrong proportions in the landscape galleries he was puzzled by the old classic landscape the occasional fineness of line the masterly distribution of masses did not counterbalance his sense of unreality before these brown trees and sombre backgrounds where were the sunlight and atmosphere of nature as he had known her the sky over all subtly interfused with all the living hues the fresh openair feeling which he had tried to put into his own humble sketches of novascotian forest and by virtue of which he found more of the great mother in peter de hooghs pictures of the courts of dutch houses than in all the templed woodlands of the pregainsborough period but constable revealed to him the soul of loveliness of rural england setting in his heart a pensive yearning for those restful woods and waters crome touched his imagination with the sweep of his lonely heaths and turner dazzled him with irisations of splendid dream and subdued him with the mystery and poetry of sea and sky and the total effect of this first look round was inspiration over all the whirling confusion of the appeal of so many schools and ages over all his bewilderment before early italian pictures that seemed to him badly drawn and modern english that seemed banal over all his dispiriting diffidence before the masterpieces was an exultant sense of brotherhood as of a soul come home at last there were pictures to which he returned again and again with a feeling of reverential kinship a secret audacious voice whispering that he understood those who had painted themthat he too was of their blood and race though come from very far and lonely and unknown that he too had thrilled with the beauty and mystery of things that he too had seen visions and heard voices quitting the gallery with regret tempered by the prospect of many magic hours in the society of its treasures he found out the whereabouts of the limners club and took his way towards bond street every sense thrilling with vivid perceptions receiving pleasant impressions from the shopwindows exhilarated by the pretty women that brushed by him with a perfume of fashion and keenly enjoying the roar of the town on the threshold of the club he inquired for mr matthew strang the doorkeeper eyed him surlily and said there was no such member the world grew suddenly dark and bleak again he stammered in piteous apology that mr strang had given him that address and the janitor a whit softened by his evident distress admitted that mr strang was sometimes about the club and volunteered to send the boy to seean offer which matt gratefully accepted with a sense of taking alms but mr strang was not on the premises and matt was further driven to inquire where he could be found the doorkeeper tired of him replied to the effect that he was not mr strangs keeper and that it was not unusual to look for gentlemen in their own homes whereupon matt turned miserably away too disheartened to ask where his uncles own home was situate and feeling that there was nothing for it but to keep watch over the club door till the great painter should appear he lingered about at a safe distance for to be seen by the doorkeeper were terrible scanning with eager glances the faces of the few men who passed through the swinging glass doors his imagination glorifying them and seeing rather halos than silk hats on their heads but at last the futility of his sentinelship dawned upon him he could not be sure of recognizing his uncle he could not accost the celestials and question them he must come again and again till he found his uncle at the club the thought of facing the doorkeeper made him flinch but he knew the road to art was thorny and precipitous it was three oclock but he had forgotten to lunch now that his emotions had been chilled he remembered he was hungry he looked around in vain for a mean eatinghouse then reluctantly slipped into a publichouse and ordered a glass of ale and something brown and dumpy which he saw under a glass cover the wench who served him smiled so amiably that he was emboldened to ask if by chance she knew where matthew strang lived her smile died away and nothing succeeded it matthew strang the painter said matt with a ghastly suspicion that the girl did not even know the name london to him meant largely matthew strang it was to matthew strang that he had taken his ticket and booked his passage it was to get to matthew strang that he had starved and pinched himself and it depressed him to discover the limitations of fameto find that matthew strang was not hung in the air like mohammeds coffin twixt earth and heaven for all to see theres the directory said the girl lugging it down when she perceived that the goodlooking young man with the curious drawling accent was not quizzing her youll find painters in the trade directory the barmaids satire was unconscious understanding the bulky red volume but dimly matt hunted up strang in the general section he was surprised to see there was more than one person of that name but fortunately there was only one matthew strang and he lived in a side street off cavendish square warmly thanking the girl matt gulped down his ale and hurried out to inquire the way munching the relics of the cake as he hastened towards the longelusive goal very soon scanning the numbers his eye flashed and his heart leaped up there it wasthe magic nameactually twixt earth and heaven painted above a shopwindow surprised he came to a standstill the window was one which would have arrested him in any case for it was illumined with paintings and engravings and through the doorway matt saw enchanting stacks of pictures mounting from floor to ceiling and the side wall was a gallery of oils and watercolors and an aroma of art and refinement and riches seemed over everything from the gold of the frames of the oilcolors to the chaste creamy margins of the engravings he entered the shop with beating heart his eyes lit first on a sweetfaced matron in a cap standing at the far end of the shop reverentially surveying a faded holy family and while he was wondering whether she was the artists wife a dapper young gentleman installed behind a broad desk near the door startled him by asking his business he coughed uneasily overcome by sudden diffidence the series of barriers between him and his uncle gave the great painter an appalling aloofness i want to see mr matthew strang he stammered the dapper young gentleman looked inquiringly towards the sweetfaced matron can this gentleman see mr strang madame he said matt noticed that he wore a pearl horseshoe in his cravat certainly sir be seated said the lady with grave courtesy and a pleasant touch of foreign accent such as matt had heard in the french families of acadia she disappeared for a moment and returned in the wake of a saturninelooking elderly gentleman with interrogative eyebrows a pointed beard and a velvet jacket the first sight of whom gave matt the heartsickness of yet another disappointment but though his keen eye soon snipped off the pointed beard and wiped off the sallowness of civilization revealing the david strang interblent with the matthew his heartsickness remained the gap between him and this fine gentleman and great artist seemed too great to be bridged over thus suddenly he became acutely conscious of his homely clothes of his coarse unlettered speech of the low menial occupations he had followed he saw himself furling the sail and carrying the hod and sawing the wood he felt himself far below the dapper young shopman with the pearl horseshoe and his throat grew parched and his eyes misty goodafternoon sir said his uncle rubbing his hands with chilling geniality what can i have the pleasure of doing for you in that instant matt perceived all the perversity of which he had been guilty he remembered he had flown in the face of his uncles kind advice and had not even apprised him of his departure from america i want to buy some colors he faltered his uncles eyebrows mounted we do not sell colors young man he said frigidly i thought matt stammered matthew strang contemptuously turned on his heel and withdrew his nephew lingered desperately in the shop without the strength either to go or to stay the lady who had half followed her husband turned back hesitatingly and with reassuring sweetness said you will get colors near at hand in oxford street we only sell pictures under her penetrating sympathy matt found courage to say im sorry mr strang got streaked streaked echoed madame opening her eyes as with a vision of broadcloth brushing against wet canvases i mean angry said matt confusion streaking his own face with red yes i remember now said madam sweetly its an american word yes it was in america that i heard of mr strang he replied slowly striving to accentuate his words as though he were reading them from a schoolbook indeed madame flushed now yes i heard of his fame as a painter ah her eyes sparkled roses leaped into her blond cheeks i always told him his work was admirable she cried in exultant excitement but he is so easily discouraged matt thrilled with a sense of the mans greatness so you see he said with a quaver of emotion in his voice i was just wild to see him i am so glad cried madame with a charming smile i will go and tell my husband he really must see you matthew she called out tremulously fluttering towards the passage the saturnine figure in the velvet coat descended again you must talk to the young gentleman dear he has heard of your fame in america matthew strangs interrogative eyebrows reached their highest point and matts face got more streaked than ever he felt he was in a false position i heard of you from my father he said hurriedly what is the price of this he asked in his confusion half turning towards the shopman this etching of millets angelus three guineas sir he added gauging his man we have a photogravure of the same subjecta little smallerfor half a guinea your father repeated mr strang gruffly he was a brother artist i presume matt would have given much to say he was not an artist but a brother but he replied instead no not exactly he was a captain he felt somehow as if the whole guilt of his fathers calling rested upon himself and it was mean of him to cross the atlantic to impose some of it on the dignified figure before him oh i love soldiers murmured madame strang matt felt things were now entangled beyond the possibility of even future extrication so he desperately consented to purchase the photogravure threw down a sovereign and snatching up the change and the pictureroll hurried from the establishment what a charming young man said madame strang but matthew strang tapped his forehead significantly you always will run yourself down dear murmured madame josephine replied matthew strang in low solemn tones the fellow is either a fool or a rogue hes left sixpence on the desk broke in the voice of the shopman ha a fool it is enough for me to live in my son he has advantages which i was denied the dear boy breathed madame the extravagant purchaser of the angelus divided the rest of his week between the national gallery where he concluded his uncle had not yet been canonized and the streets of london which he explored fearlessly in a few days of industrious investigation he saw more than many a londoner sees in a lifetime he had experience of the features and cookshops of peckham rotherhithe clapton westminster covent garden the east india docks the tower wandering wherever the shapeless city stretched its lubber limbs and seeing things and places that made him glad of the protection of the pistol he carried in his hippocket the very formlessness of the city fascinated even while it dazed him he ceased to wonder that artists found inspiration in this atmosphere in which the fog itself seemed but the visible symbol of the innumerable mysterious existences swarming in its obscure vastness the unexpected was everywhere green closes in the heart of commerce quiet quadrangles in the byways of fleet street quaint old churches by the riverside bawling marketplaces behind stately mansions great parks set in deserts of arid poverty bustling docks hidden away in back streets and elegant villas at the end of drab dismal longtrailing eastend thoroughfares redolent of slush and cabbageleaves and publichouses and fried fish miles were of light account to one who had lived in a land of great spaces yet matt was wearied by the lengthy sweep of the great arteries and the multiplicity of their ramifications by this vastness that was but reiterated narrowness in its lack of the free open horizons to which his eye was used but the titanic city awoke strange responses in his soul something in him vibrated to the impulse of the endless panorama often his fingers itched for the brush as if to translate into color and line all this huge pageant of life for the spell of youthful poesy was still on his eyes and if he could not see london as he had seen his native fields and sky and ocean all fresh and pure and beautiful if in the crude day its sordid streets seemed labyrinths in an underworld unlovely intolerable there were atmospheres and lights in which it still loomed upon his vision through the glamour of fantasy and chiefly at night when the mighty city brooded in sombre majesty magnificently transfigured by the darkness and the solemn river stretched in twinkling splendor between enchanted warehouses or shadowed itself with the inverted architecture of historic piles or lapped against the gray old tower dreaming of ancient battle but he could only take rough pencil or mental notes of the romance of it all and it was almost always the fantastic that touched his imagination and found expression in the pictorial shorthand of his sketchbooklurid splotches of sunset against tall grimy chimneys tawny barges gliding over black canalwaters shot with quivering trails of liquid gold from the morning sun ragged rembrandtesque figures asleep under glooming railway arches over which trains flew with shining windows street perspectives at twilight with strange livid skies filmy evening rain blurring the lights of the town to a tender haze late omnibuses tearing by glistering moonlit pavements and casting the shadows of the outside passengers on the sleeping houses foggy forenoons with the eye of day inflamed and swollen in the yellow heaven with his purchase of the angelus on the other hand he was not greatly taken despite its sentiment he had seen too much of peasants he had himself stooped over the furrows when his heart was elsewhere his soul turned from the mean drudgeries and miseries of the human lot yearning for the flash of poetry the glow of romance the light of dream in spite of his boarding out his bill for the weeks bed breakfast and attendance reached as far as s da terrifying total that drove him headlong into the frowsiest coffeehouse to be found in the slums round holborn here he spent a wretched interminable night provoked by insects and mysterious noises into dressing again and keeping his hand on his pistol as he sat shivering on a chair the staircases resounded with the incessant tramp of feet mounting and descending and there were bursts of rowdy laughter and blows and tipsy jeers and once his locked door was shaken and matt thought he had fallen into a thieves den and trembled for his savings in the morning he called for his account and left not without having discovered the real character of the place into which he had strayed after some trouble he chanced upon a clean furnished room in the same neighborhood for four shillings and sixpence a week attendance included it was a back room on the third floor and it gave on a perspective of tiles and shabby plaster and the evidences of jerrybuilding in the doors and windows discomforted the whilom joiners apprentice but he calculated that for less than twenty of his pounds he would have a foothold in london for a year he wellnigh cried to think of the weeks he had lost in that week of hotel luxury on sixpence a day he could sustain life on ninepence he could live in clover why even making lavish allowance for the technical expenses of which his uncle had warned him he would easily be able to stay on for a whole year in a yeara year of ceaseless paintingwhat might he not achieve ah what hopes harbored what dreams hovered in that bleak little room the vague troubled rumor of the great city rolled up in inspiring mystery the light played with instructive fascination upon the sooty tiles high over the congested chaos of housetops he saw the evening mists rifted with sunset and on starry nights he touched the infinite through his rickety casement chapter ii graingers only where to learn there was the rub he had looked to his uncle to put him in the way of instantly acquiring art and here had he wasted a week without acquiring even information but in the british museum he lighted upon young men and women drawing from the antique and entering into conversation with the shabbiest of the men who was working at the head of a roman emperor in chalk pecking at it with a pointed pellet of bread he learned that the roman emperors head was intended in alliance with the torso of a greek rivergod to force the doors of the royal academy schools the privileges of which gratuitous establishment the aspirant duly recounted but the examination would not take place for some time and matt though he felt it hard to have to pay fees elsewhere in the meantime was secretly pleased at being able to shelve temporarily the thought of partaking in this examination for the roman emperors head was appallingly stippled and the student said he had been at work on it for four months and evidently meditated touching and retouching it till the very eve of the examination matt did not think he could ever muster sufficient interest in roman emperors to live with the head of one for more than a week his heart sank at the thought of what he might have to go through to please professors and examiners but he would have willingly tried his hand at copying a bust had not the student informed him he must apply for permission and give a reference to a reputable householder with the exception of his unclaimed uncle matt knew no one reputable or disreputable householder or vagrant but he obtained from the shabby delineator of the roman emperor the address of a cheap good artschool though he found to his dismay that even at the cheapest he could only afford to take the night class from seven to ten three times a week he saw he would have to study form apart from natural color and apply during the days the preachings of the three nights impatient and holding his paintbox tight against his palpitating heart he set out that very night to join the class but losing himself in a labyrinth of squares exactly alike did not find the school till halfpast seven passing through an open door marked graingers academy of art in ugly and faded lettering he found himself in a long gloomy passage that led away from the rest of the house and following the indication of a dirty finger painted on the wall he stole cautiously along the deserted corridor which grew momentarily drearier as it receded from the naked jet of gas in the doorway till it reached its duskiest at the point where it was bordered by a pair of cloakrooms matt peered eagerly into their shadowy depths which seemed to contain coals and a bicycle and litter as well as clothing and to exhale a flavor of ancient stuffiness but he could detect no movement among the congested overcoats at last at the end of the passage he stumbled against a boy in buttons kneeling with his eye to the keyhole of a door apologetically he asked the boy if this was graingers and the boy jumping up quickly told him to walk in and retreated in haste matt opened the door a wave of insufferably hot air reeking of tobacco smote his face and his nostrils a glare of light dazzled his eyes he was vaguely aware of a great square room crowded with young men in uncouth straw hats sitting or standing at work in their shirtsleeves before easels but the whole scene was a blur compared with the central point that stood out in disconcerting clearness immediately facing him on a platform at the other end of the room a nude woman was standing he started back shocked and was meditating flight when a student near him growled to him to shut the door he obeyed and had an instant of awful loneliness and embarrassment amid this crowd of gifted strangers in the rear of which he stood paintbox under arm wondering why nobody challenged his entry and where grainger was turning to look for him he upset a rickety easel and a disengaged stool both of which seemed to topple over at the slightest touch but his awkwardness saved the situation the owner of the easel was goodnatured and perceiving he was a newcomer bade him seat himself on the stool and fix up an easel next to him the number painted on the oilcloth of the floor being unappropriated as matt had no canvas he even went outside to buy him one for twoandninepence from the boy in buttons matt handed him the money with a feeling of eternal gratitude while his amiable fellow was thus busied in his behalf the new students keen eye absorbed the scene in detail a great square dusty room rimmed as to the roof by skylights and lighted tonight from above by a great circular gasflare round two of the walls patched here and there by the crumbling away of the plaster ran a rack on which innumerable canvases and drawingboards were stacked and underneath the rack a streak of wood permeated the plaster to hold the pins by which crude sketches were fastened up evidently for criticism here and there hung notices of the meetings of graingers sketching club mixed up with photographs and advertisements of studios and of a drawing competition instituted by the proprietors of a soap and the mural ornamentation was completed by clever nude studies rapid tours de force of the visiting artists as matt discovered later everywhere about the floor were canvases boards and an unstable assortment of threelegged easels donkeys quaintly carved chairs and stools high and low upon which last students of all figures and complexions some of them smoking sat perched crowned with the uncouth straw hats to keep the glare out of their eyes and reduced to the shirtsleeves by the heat from so many lights and breaths the pendent gasjets being supplemented by the paraffine lamp that lighted a shadowy corner where a skull grinned on a shelf and by the big fire that was needed to keep the model from shivering on the throne where she stood statuesque against the white background of a dirty sheet her head resting against her arm and from everything breathed an immemorial dustfrom the fire in the centre of the righthand wall an impalpable ash seemed to drift dust covered the mantelpiece and coated the bottles of linseedoil and fixative and the boxes of charcoal that stood upon it dust draped in gray the dilapidated squashnosed layfigure that leaned drunkenly against the right side of the throne in the corners of the room the dust had an air of legal possession as if the statute of limitations had secured it against the broom there were dusty mysteries doubled up on shelves a visible leopards skin suggesting infinite romantic possibilities for the others and within a dusty barrel in a corner near him matt saw dusty bits of velvet and of strange splendid stuffs which he divined were for costume models and the floor seemed a land of lost drawingpins and forgotten fragments of charcoal and then his heart gave a great leap for his eye returning timidly to the throne where it had scarcely dared as yet to rest encountered a mans head bending over a writingdesk in the compartment of the floor to the left of it surely it could be no other than grainger himself that thin austere man with the big bald forehead and the air of wellington and matt thrilled with proportionate reverence and turned his eye away as if dazzled to repose it on the inchoate paintings of the students who were squinting scientifically at the model and measuring the number of heads with sticks of charcoal or their brushhandles some had her large some small some turned her head this way some that some were painting her some drawing hereach from his point of sight as soon as his own canvas arrived altogether forgetting his startled modesty in the delightful interest of the work he fell to touching in the head with rapid strokes of a flowing brush the woman vanished in the womans form what a privilege to enjoy and reproduce those beautiful curves those subtle fleshtones those halftints of cream and rose seen under gaslight what are you about said his mentor presently painting her portrait he replied pausing with painful foreboding but wheres the charcoal outline the charcoal outline yes you cant paint her without sketching her first in charcoal cant i asked matt with a sudden remorseful recollection of his first sitter the acadian legislator whose portrait had paved his way to signpainting he hastened to efface his ignorance with a paletteknife and to obliterate it with a rag moistened with turpentine but he was frightened and nervous and denuded of confidence in himself and when he attempted to outline the figure the charcoal boggled at the greasy surface of the canvas and while he was wrestling with his medium he became conscious that the great grainger was behind him and a nervousness that he had not felt when he pointed his gun at the bear in his forest home paralyzed his hand grainger stood for some moments watching his fumbling strokes then he said you want to join the life class matt flushing furiously stammered an affirmative dont you think youd better begin with the antique asked grainger matt murmured that he didnt care about the antique anyhow and grainger shook his austere head ah theres no getting on without slogging away its no good shirking the groundwork the living figure is all subtle lines you cant expect to be equal to them without years of practice at the antique and stilllife matt plucked up courage to guess that he would have another try at the figure and grainger having pocketed a quarters fees moved off leaving matt amazed at his own temerity do you think hell be annoyed if i stay on here he asked his mentor as he resumed his work with the determination to prove himself not unworthy of the privilege if you want to chuck your money away its your lookout said his mentor candidly you dont hurt him then he wont say anything it doesnt matter what he says hes not up to much no queried matt astonished isnt he a great painter the student laughed silently a great painter keep a school he said no its only the failures that do that then how can one learn asked matt in dismay oh well we have a visitor once a weekhes rather a good man tarmigan hes not an ra but he can knock off a head in twenty minutes but the raswhat are they for inquired matt only partially reassured for show said the young man smartly you are a green un to think that youre going to get academicians for thirty bob a month youve got to go to the academy schools if you want them and then the chaps say theyre not much use most of them are out of date and you get a different man every month who contradicts all the others a fellow i know says the best of the visitors is marmor but hes awfully noisy and facetious and claps you on the back and tells you a story and forgets to criticise and then theres petershe sighs and says very tender and you think youve improved till you hear him say very tender to the next man too the chief advantage of going to a school is that you get a model which you couldnt afford to hire for yourself and you learn from the other fellows and then of course theres compositiontarmigans jolly good for that by this time matt had sketched his outline and he was about to resume the brush when the clock struck eight the model stretched herself and retired behind the dirty sheet which now operated as a screen and there was a rising a putting down of palettes each with its brushes stuck idly in its thumbhole an outburst of exclamations a striking of matches a mechanical rolling of cigarettes a sudden lowering of the lights and a general air of breaking up school over already he asked in a disappointed tone no theyre only turning the gas down for coolness while the model has a rest you see she cant stand two hours straight off the reel no i guess not said matt and then repented of having said guess for he was trying to prune away his humble expressions and to remember the idioms of the educated people with whom his new life was bringing him into contact it must be awful hard he added yes especially in a school where a lot of chaps are working at once and she cant rest a limb because somebody might just be painting it one woman told me shed rather scrub floors so as to feel her limbs moving about but posing pays better this is a new modelfirst time shes been here pity women with such fine figures havent got prettier faces have a cigarette no thanks said matt dont smoke i did smoke once but i gave it up matt did not like to confess it was because he could not afford the luxury you cant be an artist without tobacco said his mentor laughingly ah heres the model ill just go and get her address he went up to the model who had reemerged and seated herself at ease upon the throne where a group of students with pipes or cigarettes in their mouths was in conversation with her matt followed his mentor interested in this new specimen of humanity and thinking that he would prefer to paint her as she was sitting then nude in that dim mysterious light surrounded by smokewreathed figures in tropic headgear her face alive her feet crossed gracefully playing a part in a real scene yet withal unreal to the point of grotesqueness oh ive sat a lot for him she was saying when matt came up i stand every morning for the portrait of letty gray the skirtdancer its for the academy she cant come much and shes awfully unpunctual of course im only for the figure werent you in the grosvenor gallery last summer asked a bald middleaged man yes i was setters moonbeam began the model proudly i thought i recognized you said the middleaged man with an air of ancient friendship and i was also on the line in the big room she addedcolin campbells return of the herringboats and i got into the royal institute as wellsaxons woman wailing for her demon lover ah here you are then said a redhaired young man producing an illustrated catalogue yes said she turning over a few pages and theres my husbandsardanapalus they often have him at the academy schools she wound up with conscious pride ah perhaps we shall get him here one week said the middleaged man while his mentor was taking down her address matt looked round the room the austere grainger with a cigarette in his mouth was reading a yellowish paper embellished with comic cuts most of the students were moving about looking at one anothers easels the work on which with few exceptions matt was surprised to find mediocre a few sat stolidly humped on their stools feet on rail and pipe in mouth one group was examining photographs which its central figure had taken and which he loudly declared knocked the painting of the fishtown school to fits from all sides the buzz of voices came through the stifling smoky darkened atmosphere have you seen pivertons new picture rather another s contemptuously replied a very young man seated smoking a very long pipe before a very indifferent canvas what do you mean bubbles asked a bystander what havent you noticed he answered with ineffable disdain swinging his arm in illustration that the lines of his compositions are all curlythey always make s i thought they always made s d interjected a curlyheaded wag and all except the very young man laughed bubbles is gone on whistler observed a frecklefaced student compassionately i admire him admitted the very young man candidly but i dont say hes the end of art no thats reserved for bubbles laughed the frecklefaced student what is the end of art bubbles said another man t of course put in the curlyheaded wag five oclock and fashionable i say grainger says miss hennery used to work in his day class said a handsome young irishman strolling up with a bag of cakes from which the model had just helped herself in the pervasive spirit of camaraderie well i dont see anything to boast of in that pronounced bubbles puffing at his long hookah shes only a feeble female imitation of tarmigan her colors muddy and her brother comes into all her mens heads i suppose she cant afford models said the irishman charitably have a banbury bubbles accepted and the bystanders helped to empty the bag matt moved back towards his easel passing a little dark man with a mane who was explaining to a derisive audience that the reason he went to musichalls was to study character and brushing by a weedy giant who was boasting that he hardly ever went to bed so tied was he to his anatomy during his progress a meagre wrinkled old man with pepperandsalt hair and a stoop approached him and said in a husky whisper excuse me introducin myself but i do admire your feet so matt flushed startled my names gregsonwilliam gregsonand ive made a speciality of feet the uman form divine is beautiful everywhere sir but the footah there you have the combination of graces all the beautiful curves in a small compass the arch of the foot the ankle instep the beautiful proportions of it all when you do get a really beautiful foot such as yours i come here sir every night to study the beautifulfor in daily life the foot is idden distorted by boots and shoes that ignore the subtleties and delicacies of natureand the foot is the first thing i look at but how rarely does a model man or woman exibit a truly beautiful foot oh how i wish i could paint your foot or take a cast of ita study from the nude of course but noyou will not allow me i know may i at least be allowed to measure it to take the proportions to add to my knowledge of the laws of the beautiful foot matt faltered that he didnt know he had anything extraordinary in the way of feet my dear sir protested william gregson showing the whites of his eyes just then the light was turned up and william gregson retreated abruptly to his easel the models court scattered and she herself resumed her inglorious occupation of the throne placing her feet within a chalkedout line and her arm against a mark in the sheet matt returning to his canvas worked enthusiastically to finish the figure by closingtime and laid down his brush with some minutes to spare thereby drawing upon himself the attention of his mentor who exclaimed by jove what made you rush along like that there was no time said matt time why theres four more evenings every model sits a fortnightsix nights you know well shes done anyhow said matt in rueful amusement yes she is done anyhow and his mentor laughed why that ll never do you cant show work like that why not its like her yes but theres no finish in it its only a sketch youre supposed to make a careful study of it tarmigan insists on the exact character of the model he always says even velasquezs early things were tight and careful but matt felt he could not take the thing any furtherat any rate not that night the fury of inspiration was over he sat abstractedly watching the quivering of the models tired limbs and her shadows on the screen a dusky silhouette with lighter penumbras till the hour was up on matts homeward journey he was overtaken by old gregson who discovered that their routes coincided and renewed his admiration of matts foot and his request to gauge its beauties till at last unwilling to disoblige a brother artist but feeling rather ridiculous the young man slipped off his boot in the shelter of a doorway under the light of a streetlamp and the wrinkled old man producing a tapemeasure ecstatically recorded on a crumpled envelope the varied perfections of its form at the next lesson matt set to work and painted away all the force of his study in the effort to reach the standard prevailing at graingers but he worked dispirited and joyless like a warhorse between the shafts of an omnibus or a savage in a stiff shirt and a frockcoat suppressing himself with the same sense of drear duty as when he had sawn logs or drilled potatoes during the rest while matt was listening in amazement to some secret information concerning royal personages who seemed to have confided all their intrigues to bubbles william gregson drew him mysteriously into the anteroom do you know i couldnt sleep the other night said the meagre wrinkled old man with the pathetic stoop were you ill said matt sympathetically no your foot kept me awake matt cast a furtive look at it as if to read marks of guilt thereon yes you must know im a shoemaker by trade and love art but i cant devote myself to it like you young fellows i work ard all day ammerin and stitchin its only in the evenings that i can spare an hour for paintin matts eyes moistened sympathetically im so sorry he murmured i knew you would be i knew you had a beautiful nature it always goes with beautiful feet ah you smile im an enthusiast i admit and you will smile more when you ear i sat up half the last two nights to create an artistic boot with your beautiful lines you had given me the inspiration i had to create there and then i was tired of my days work i was poor and my time was valuable but before all i am an artist sir i have brought the boots with mehere he produced a brownpaper parcel from under his armand i shall be proud if you will accept them as a umble tribute from a lover of the beautiful no no i couldnt think of taking them said matt blushing furiously oh but you will vex me sir if you do not it pains me enough already to think of you wearin the cumbrous inartistic pair i see i wont take them unless i pay you for them no no what is a guinea between artists and he pressed the parcel into matts hand matt shook his head he was appalled at the price but he felt it wouldnt be fair to take the poor old mans work for nothing a vague suspicion that he was being tricked flitted beneath his troubled mind but his worldly experiences had not yet robbed him of his guilelessness and there was such a fire of abnegation in the homely face that matt felt ashamed of his doubt and drew out the money with a feeling that he was at any rate helping a worthy artistic soul here is the price of them he said the artist took the money and looked at it a guinea would give me nearly another months lessons he said wistfully put it in your pocket then insisted matt his last doubt dissolving in fellowfeeling but the cobbler shook his head no no sir you mustnt rob me of my impulse i cannot charge you full price take back the shilling concede something to my feelings thereif that ll satisfy you said matt reaccepting it you wont tell the chaps besought the shoemaker pathetically they wouldnt understand us they would laugh at our innocent enthusiasm as matt shared this distrust of the sympathy of the studio he was not backward with assurances of secrecy while he was laboriously bulking his overcoatpocket with the parcel at the end of the four lessons when matts painting seemed to him to be getting almost as smooth as a wax figure and as dead tarmigan camea stern illdressed man prematurely grayat whose approach matts heart was in his mouth the famous artist moved leisurely but inevitably towards him shedding criticism by grunts and phrases and gestures expressing the ineffable by an upward snap of the fingers accompanied by a russiansounding sibilation inquiring sarcastically whether one student was drawing the model or the layfigure and sneeringly recommending another to move his drawing if the model moved every now and again he sat down at an easel to get the mans point of view and taking up his brush suggested tone and color or if it was a draughtsmans easel borrowed his charcoal and showed him how to put the head on the shoulders or fit on an extremity when at length matt felt the great mans breath on his neck a cold shiver ran down his spine the brush clove to his paralyzed hand ah a new man said the visitor not bad all the blood in matts body seemed to be rushing to his face his hand began to tremble the visitor did not pass on immediately he said where do you come from theres a want of sharpness in the shadows from america breathed matt i mean from what school i havent been to school since i was a boy not been to an art school queried the visitor in surprise nonsense impossible the face is very well but the rest is not taken far enough a little too clever search search even velasquezs early things werebut you must have had a deal of practice i have painted quite a little admitted matt but not rightly though i did study artistic anatomy out of a book ive painted hundreds of portraits and signs and ceilings the artist was examining the work more minutely dont you call that practice he said a little triumphant smile flitting across his wintry face hundreds of portraitswhy that means hundreds of models why however did you get all those commissions its more than i can boast of try and keep that lower in tone and dont use that color at all he added his fingers tattooing kindly on matts shoulder the class had pricked up its ears for the artist spoke by habit in a loud tone so that all might benefit by his criticism of the individual and his remarks to the newcomer were quite out of the ordinary run it was only in the country places in nova scotia said matt apologetically and people didnt know anything about it so long as i made a handsome likeness it was all they cared for and then of course they were nevernever naked no said the celebrity with a little laugh no they always wore their best clothes said matt smiling too so this is the first time ive done one like this you havent done it yet said tarmigan moving on theres that foot yet to be studied search finish if you please sir said matt with an unconscious reversion to the idiom of mctavits schoolroom i have finished the foot nonsense said tarmigan youve got another toe to paint in i thought i had to copy the model exactly said matt meekly well sir said tarmigan puzzled well i only see four toes on that foot the artist was startled he cast a rapid glance at the model good lord the mans right he murmured for the model was indeed minus a toe i say you men he said where are your eyes youve given the model an extra toe how often have i told you to look before you paint all eyes were bent on the foot the model reddened those whose work had not yet been examined hastened to amputate the toe the others took on an air of injury you might have told a chap whispered his mentor i thought you knew said matt i saw it as soon as i began to paint but i didnt take any notice of it in my first rough sketch it was only when you told me i must copy the model exactly that i put it in or rather left it out for some time longer the fusillade of tarmigans criticisms rang out intermittently not bad humph i wouldnt make too much of those little things keep it broader thats very well psch thats better dont get your shadows too hot thats a good bit that legs too long from the knee down dont lick it too much not bad no no that wont do at all youll never get her feet into that canvas look at the model with your eyes nearly closed and compare the tones then tarmigan set a composition to be done at home in illustration of charity and stalked through the door amid a chorus of goodnights in incongruous keys and then there was a silence so tense that the creak of his departing boots could be heard dying away in the long passage but it was not till the rest arrived and the model wrapping a cloak round her had left the room and grainger had silently disappeared after his wont that the storm burst bubbles led off who ever saw a picture of a woman with four toes he cried disgustedly yes how could he expect us to examine her blooming toes said the frecklefaced student oh i saw she had four toes right enough said bubbles but a painter hasnt got to paint accidentshes got to paint pictures it ll be an accident if you paint pictures put in the curlyheaded wag i saw the missing toe asserted the handsome young irishman when i set her for the class but i wasnt going to spoil the study one can easily imagine a toe hes got no sense of poetry i saw a scratch on her wrist volunteered the middleaged man i wonder he didnt want us to paint that i suppose hell put a background to it and send it to the academy cackled the redheaded young man theyve got blue noses in nova scotia i believe i wonder if he put them into his portraits the weedy giant remarked in a loud whisper to the little man with the mane though the last two remarks were so impersonal matt knew well enough they were aimed at him and he seemed to feel an undercurrent of resentment against himself beneath the animadversions on tarmigan whom he knew the studio revered he sat uneasily on his stool poring mechanically over his unhappy study from the nude and morbidly misreading animosity into this goodhumored badinage before his mothers living death he might have replied violently with word or even fist but life had broken him in seeing the new man spiritless another student took up the parable hes going to leave it to the nation then hell have to leave it on the doorstep when nobodys looking replied the weedy giant then the stream of wit ran dry and comparative silence fell upon the room abruptly the voice of the curlyheaded wag shot across the silence fourtoes ra the cry was taken up in a great shout of laughter even the uninterested joining in from sheer joy in a catchword it seemed to matt he had not a friend in the room but he mistook the grizzled old shoemaker sidled up to him youve licked me sir he said in emotional accents youve shamed me me whose speciality is feet i never noticed there was a toe missin no sir not even me your hand sir i bear you no malice gratefully matt gripped the cobblers extended hand and he took occasion to apologize for not enduing the artistic boots explaining that he was reserving them for high days and holidays he let the bantering cry die away unanswered but at heart he was sick with the thought he was to repeat the experience of the st john paintshop and he had a fierce impulse to shake the dust of the studio off his feet even as he had thrown up his position in new brunswick and in his resentful bitterness he allowed his sense of the inferiority of the jeerers work to well up into clear consciousness and thus he brought himself round to the remembrance of the great tarmigans words and to a softening sense of gratitude for the strange way in which he had been acquiring art in his own land even while he was yearning and planning to get it across the seas and so though the nickname stuck to himfor indeed graingers scarcely knew his real namehe remained at the studio learning to take its humors more genially and even to partake in them and drawn to its habitus by the discovery that they too were fighting their way to art from the shop the school or the office but never losing altogether the shyness and sensitiveness of a lonely alien and highspirited soul from tarmigan whose executive faculty and technical knowledge were remarkable and who despite surface revolts behind his back was worshipped by the whole school matt got many pointers as he called them in his transatlantic idiomtraditions of the craft which he might never have hit out for himself though on the other hand in the little studies he made at home and sometimes showed to tarmigan he produced effects instinctively the technique of which he was puzzled to explain to the mastercraftsman who for the rest did not approve of the strange warm luminosities matt professed to see on london tiles or the misty coruscations that glorified his chimneypots grainger himself never offered criticisms to his pupils except casually and mainly by way of conversation when he was bored with his own thoughts to the science of art which tarmigan taught and which was based upon inductions from great pictures matt in his turn did not always take kindly the reduction of sthetics to rule chafed him he was distressed by tarmigans symmetrical formul against symmetry and though some of the canons of composition seemed to him selfevident when once pointed out and others not unreasonable he could not always relish the mechanical application of the general law to his particular case but he suppressed his untutored instincts much as in her day his mother had wrestled with satan and in faith hope and selfdistrust submitted himself duteously to law and tarmigan he worked fluently for the most part but every now and then came a sudden impotency not always due to lack of sympathy with the model an inability to get the exact effect he wanted which tortured him even more than tarmigans straitwaistcoat of dogma very soon graingers grew half boastful half jealous of its american prodigy whom all later arrivals catching up the nickname without the history of its origin imagined to be likewise abnormal in the number of his toes some recalled byrons clubfoot and wondered if matt strangs pedal defect had any connection with the genius of fourtoes ra chapter iii the elder branch in the heated discussions at graingers of the demerits of the painters of the day no one ever mentioned the name of strang except once and then the christian name was not matthew matt did not like to bring up the name himself as it was his own but he soon understood that artists do not deal in other peoples pictures and recalling madame strangs remark about her husband he gradually came to the conviction that his namesake was the dethroned god of an earlier day discouraged into sterility and commerce by the indifference of the younger generation and as the deity loomed less terrible and as matt felt himself more at home in the art atmosphere of england so the idea of making himself known to his uncle began to be shorn of its terrors and even to be tinged with the generous thought of inspiring the neglected artist to fresh workan inversion of attitude the humor of which did not occur to him but when one afternoon he did betake himself again to the elegant emporium off cavendish square and found himself face to face with the dapper young gentleman and his horseshoe cravatpearl the old awe of the refinement radiating from every quarter of the compass overwhelmed him and his tongue refused to ask for mr strang compromising by a happy thought in the demand for madame madame appeared forthwith flashing upon him a sense of matronly sweetness and silk and snatching him from the embarrassment of openings by exclaiming in her charming accent ah youve come for your change what change asked matt you left sixpence on the desk i noted it down it is very kind of you said matt i had no idea you would remember me all this time i never forget clever people said madame with a bewitching smile how do you know im clever matt smiled back madame waved away the question with her plump white hand in silent smiling reaffirmation ive always lived with clever people she said simply talent is the only thing i admire in this world matt said lamely that he was glad to hear it the phrase was a poor expression of his pleasure in at last meeting a soul with his own ideals where was it you saw my husbands pictures asked madame eagerly matt flushed i didnt see any he confessed my father told me about them where did your father see them at home when they were boys together what they were schoolfellows brothers said matt and felt the instant relief of criminal confession madame uttered a little cry of delighted astonishment and took matts hands in hers my dear sir my dear sir she cried shaking them i knew you were clever come insidecome inside why didnt you say who you were last time you are the boy who wrote to matthew from nova scotia years ago what a pity he is out he will be so charmed and still holding his hands she led him up a little flight of stairs into a daintily furnished sittingroom resplendent with pictures and sat him down in a soft armchair and hung admiringly over him and plied him with inquiries as to his past and his projects and things nova scotian without always waiting for an answer or ever getting more than a brief generality and rang for claret and cake which were brought in by a pretty girl in a piquant white cap but which matt refused for fear of seeming to be in want of refreshment i have a son who is also an artistoh so clever the dear boy she told him you must know himyou will love each other he is at work now in his studio but he must not be interrupted till the light fails matts eyes kindled i shall like to know him he cried fervently yes dear herbert oh youve no idea how sweet and good and clever he is hes twentythree yet as obedient as a child were so proud of himhis father and i he quite consoles us for the failure of the english to appreciate matthews work oh where can i see uncles work asked matt eagerly madame shook her head sadly oh he parted with all his pictures ever so many years ago she said but arent they exhibited anywhere we dont know they must be some day if they are not destroyed for they are so clever but the fact isthough of course i wouldnt tell it to a strangerwe had totopawn them and they were never redeemed and poor matthew never would paint again he was so embittered oh it was such a slow sad struggle those early days of our married life for years no one would buy poor matthews work and when the money he had brought from nova scotia gave out we should have starved if i had not started a little dressmakers shop they still call me madame she interpolated with a melancholy smile but you are french arent you said matt thrilling with the pathos of those faraway struggles yes my parents were french but i have spoken english almost from girlhood there is french blood in our family too murmured matt with a sad recollection of his mother he wondered what she was doing at the moment indeed perhaps that was what drew me to matthewthat and his artistic genius poor matthew but you are well off now said matt dubiously he did not trouble to correct her mistake to explain that the french blood was on the spindle side oh we are rich we have all we want when my dressmakers business grew prosperousin fact quite a fashionable resortmatthew who could not bear to be out of touch with art though he had sworn never to paint again saw his way to dealing in pictures of course he makes far more than any of his artist friends who succeeded but that does not console me for the pictures the world has lost but why doesnt he paint now that he has money inquired matt he says hes too old said madame sighing and besides he thinks hed only be eclipsed by herbert of course herbert is exceptionally gifted he took the medal at the royal academy schools you know for the best copy of an old master and he has had advantages which were denied to his poor father but still it often makes me cry to think of how he sinks himself in the dear boy not caring a jot about his own reputation oh there are few such fathers i can tell you i dont know what i have done to deserve such a husband i who have no cleverness or talent of any kind and here as at his cue matthew strang entered in a soft hat and a black cloak vastly more impressive than the staid shabbiness of tarmigan than whom his vandyke beard alone gave him the greater artistic distinction he leaned slightly upon a gnarled walkingstick madame sprang up to meet him in the doorway oh matthew she cried ecstatically the young man who wanted to see you is your own nephew and he is come to study art and wont it be delightful for herbert to have a companion i made him wait for youi knew you wouldnt be long and radiant beneath her cap madame stepped aside as if to leave the stage free for the rapturous embrace between the uncle and his longlost nephew but matthew strang stood rigid with astonishment only his eyes moving in startled examination of the young man who had risen respectfully for an interval of seconds that seemed numerable in minutes he looked at matt without speaking leaning on his stick his saturnine face growing momently darker davies son i suppose he said slowly at last yes sir said matt hm i might have seen it so you have come to england after all yes sir but not till i had the money for my studies matthew strangs face lightened a little sit down sit down no need to stand he said with uneasy graciousness placing his disengaged hand on matts shoulder and how are all your folks oh theyre pretty spry thank you said matt resuming his chair let me seeyour mother married again didnt she matt nodded shes still alive i suppose yees faltered matt and hows the province its about the same said matt vaguely ha said mr strang with an allcomprehending air he allowed madame to divest him lovingly of his cloak then he said youre settled in london then i shall stay here some time humph youre not like your father he could never stay in one place well well im sure i wish you success but you know its not an easy line youve gone into so you wrote to me sir ha well i wrote the truth i was much obliged to you sir for your advice said matt sincerely but the elder man suspecting sarcasm replied half defiantly theres not one man in a thousand that makes his breadandbutter by it why ive just bought a picture from an ara for fifty pounds its worth treble you would have done better at your farmor was it a sawmill it isnt the money i was thinking of sir its the joy of painting hum i talked like that once matthew strang sat down rather peevishly and crossed his legs and you talk like that now too said madame with gentle reproach not for yourself she corrected hastily as his eyebrows took their interrogative altitude but you know you dont care if herbert doesnt make money for years so long as he makes a reputation eventually herbert is in a different position he doesnt need to earn anything nor does your nephew said madame he has ample resources he tells me matt blushed at madames unconscious magnification of his curt statement on the point but he did not think it worth while contradicting her matthew uncrossed his legs restlessly i suppose your mother married a welltodo man yes pretty welltodo matt stammered why didnt you say who you were at first i didnt like to ii remembered you had advised me not to come to england well the mischief was done you might just as well have spoken i might have given you some advice you could have had the engraving at trade price if you are looking for etchings or any little things for your rooms i couldnt dream of treating you like a stranger thank you said matt with feeble fervency dont mention it said his uncle holding up his right palm deprecatingly bytheway what made you address your letter to the national gallery matt colored i thought all the london painters lived there he said with an uneasy smile madame laughed heartily why matthew only got it through an official inquiring among the people copying pictures there one of them happened to be a customer of ours and suggested trying us yes it was all boyish foolishness said matt and where are you living now that you have come said his uncle not far from herein holborn he added hastily for fear his uncle might be meditating a visit i can bring you some of my work if you like oh yes do wont that be charming interjected madame clapping her hands matthew checked her with a stern glance i dont think i should be able to do anything with an unknown man he said shaking his head no i dont mean that said matt getting hot i thought you might like to see that i wasnt quite a duffer i dont expect to sell my work yet but they think im rather promising at the school what school who thinks tarmigan tarmigan echoed matthew strang why i could have picked up one of his watercolors for a fiver last week tarmigan has been going down steadily for the last four years he took the gold medal at the academy and at first promised well ten years ago i even meditated a corner in him but luckily i had the sense to sell out in time before it was quite certain he would never even be an associate no wonder hes reduced to visiting oh but he does that for nothing they say protested matt hotly hes a jolly fine chap ha no wonder he doesnt get on who ever heard of a really good man wasting his time in that way then dont you think im doing any good studying under him asked matt in affright oh hes all right for teaching i havent a word against him hes one of the few men in england who are supposed to know their trade but hes too stilted and classical theres no sentiment in him he dont touch the heart of the buying public its all science and draughtsmanship and he wont do anything to meet the market half way its spunky of him to stick to his convictions anyhow said matt in low tones provoked by his uncles disparagement into a recrudescent enthusiasm for tarmigan who had recently been weighing upon him like a nightmare bah and how does he know his convictions are right the publics the best judge of art oh said matt deprecatingly should you really think thats so of course i think so would the public have me no and the public was right he looked at matt half fiercely as if defying him to deny it madame was smiling and shaking her head the publics always right he went on emphatically its the critics that throw the market into perpetual confusion such a babel of voices all laying down what is right and what is wrong what is art and what is not art that its enough to drive a dealer crazy for my part i steer by the academy thats my polestar and im rarely out for thats what the public take their reckoning by and its an ra that my boy is going to be please god for theories may come and theories may go but the academy goes on forever dear herbert murmured madame i suppose hes awfully advanced said matt wistfully years ago he took the medal for the best copy of an old master at the royal academy schools where he is now just finishing his course explained his uncle and you know you cant even begin the course without being clever no i know said matt with a sinking of heart for he had by this time studied the prospectus of the national artschools and been dismayed not so much by the anatomical information and technical expertness demanded at the entrance competition as by the slowdragging septennial course the drudgery of stilllife and perspective and the antique and all the tedious grind of convention i thought of trying to get in myself but im afraid i shall have to give up the idea oh herbert only drops in there now and then said matthew loftily he works mostly at home with his own models matt had a pang of envy and then he has always had the benefit of your experience he said oh i cant pretend to have done more than encourage him now matthew said madame shaking her finger fondly you know it was at your knee that he made his first studies matthew smiled faintly not displeased im like tarmigan i can teach better than i can paint he said and poured himself out a glass of wine fascinating matts eye by the play of light in the diamond on his forefinger if i listened to my wife i should give up business and set up an easel again as in my young and foolish days thank god he said pausing to gulp down the claret i had sense to stop in time what could be expected of a young man whod lived on a farm in a godforsaken country ah your father was right he never would allow any merit to my ships or cows red sands flitted before matts vision with lambent pools and overhead a diaphanous rosy vapor beyond which brooded the vast cloudless circle of the sky ah god why was the sky so blue and depthless in those days as from dim faraway caverns the acrid voice of the picturedealer reached his ears in complacent exposition its all training and if you dont get trained young you might as well attempt to fly becoming conscious of a silence matt answered thats so its the same with music went on his uncle tapping impressively on his wineglass with his glittering forefinger you cant expect a grownup man to sit down and practise scales like a little girl in a pinafore and even if he would his fingers have lost their suppleness his joints are set i saw this clearly and was determined my boy shouldnt suffer as id done why herbert had a brush put into his hand before he could write matts heart sank lower i should like to see his work he said anxiously ha said matthew a complacent smile hovering about his lips oh yes let him see herberts work pleaded madame i dont think we ought to disturb him said matthew yieldingly wont you take another glass of wine no thank you sir said matt who was quite faint for his dinner had been of the slightest and feeling the request a signal to take his leave he rose oh yes do let him see them said madame hurriedly its only for once oh well as youre a sort of relation said the father imposingly but i make it a point not to interrupt him these hours are precious theres not too much light at the best of times and as if following matts impulse he rose and turned doorward theres no need for you to trouble josephine he said waving her back as they mounted the softcarpeted staircase on which undraped marble statues looked down from their niches he explained gravely theres a male model up there you see matt nodded awed to silence by the splendor of the staircase up which he toiled side by side with the vandyke beard and the velvet coat herbert of course uses the side door vouchsafed his companion graciously to relieve the monotony of the long ascent i couldnt have his models coming through the shop matt murmured something negative but his reply was lost in a dull thud from above the elder man cleared the remaining stairs in alarm and threw open the door give us a hand up you beggar a piping girlish voice was saying on the rich carpet of the vast elegant studio whose glories dazzled matts vision a slim young man was sprawling on his back over him stood a stalwart figure clad only in boxinggloves the saturnine picturedealer rushed forward and helped his boy up its all right dad said herbert in unembarrassed amusement as he was scrambling to his feet i just wanted to give the models arms a little movement during the rest the positions so difficult for him i havent been able to get the thing right all day look theres nothing at all on the canvas ive had to paint it out the model had somewhat shamefacedly taken off his gloves and struck an attitude upon the throne ha said matthew strang in vague accents you ought to be getting on faster with those goldmedal studies now that you have put aside your picture for this years academy you will need all your time you know ive brought you a visitor herbert turned his face towards the doorthe handsome glowing face of a boy beardless and cleanshaven with candid blue eyes and tumbled flaxen hair and the flash of white teeth accustomed to display themselves in laughter there was his fathers interrogative mark about the arched eyebrows as he caught sight of matt hanging back timidly on the threshold the young novascotians heart was leaden his soul wrapped in a gloom which had been gathering blackness ever since he had set foot in his uncles shop and which the sight of the commodious studio with its rich properties and luxurious appliances its crimson lounges and silk drapings and fleecy rugs and gleaming marbles and bronzes had darkened into despair the penurious past surged back to him through a suffusion of unshed tearstears that were salt with the sense of injustice and of sorrows unforgettable all the creeping irremediable years contributing their quintessence to the bitterness of this supreme moment the chances he had missed the lessons he had not received the obstacles that had rather sprung up to beat him back whose infant fingers no loving hand had ever guided whose boyish yearnings no word of encouragement had ever sweetened whose youth had been all distasteful labors and mean tragedies and burdens too great to bear and whose very triumph would find none to sympathize with it if it came as it never could come to one so untrained so alien from the world of art and elegant studios and all the soft things of life driven to the scum of the streets for models at a few pence an hour and reduced to studying attitudes from his own contortions before a bleared strip of mirror in a dingy back room unregarded uncaredfor unknown an atom in that vast magicgleaming london which had so cruelly disillusioned him and in which even the one heart in which his own blood ran was cold and far away his poor preeminence at graingers his primacy among a set of duffers no augury of success in that fierce struggle in which tarmigan himself had gone to the wall was it worth while to vex himself endlessly swirled to and fro like a bubble on an ocean were it not sweeter to break and to be resolved into the vastness and the silence his right hand wandered towards his hippocket where his pistol lay how good to be done with life then he became aware through a semitransparent mist that the gracious blond boy was holding out his hand with a frank smile and instinct drew out his own right hand in amicable response and so the temptation was over the poor children dependent upon him came up to memory and he wondered at his spasm of selfish despair his uncle must have said words to which he had been deaf for herbert seemed to know who he was and why he had come welcome fair coz he said gripping matts hand heartily i feel as if i were in shakespeare a moment ago i scarcely remembered i had a relation in the world confound it why werent you a girl cousin while you were about it herbert dont be rude said his father herbert elevated his blond eyebrows i wish you would cultivate a sense of humor dad he observed wearily matt who was responding to his grip fascinated instantly by the boyish sunny charm loosed his clasp in sheer astonishment at the transition matthew strang disregarded his sons observation but gruffly told the model whose attitudinizing immobility was irritating that he need not pose for a moment or two whereupon herbert bade him begone altogether ive been off color all day he observed explanatorily as he counted out the models silver but the excitement of discovering i am not alone in the world is the finishing touch matthew threw a rather reproachful look at matt whose eyes drooped guiltily he raised them immediately however in accordance with his uncles instructions to admire a study of a draped figure which was hung on a wall the coloring struck him agreeably though he found a certain feebleness in the drawing which was equally agreeable to his jealous mood this not displeasing impression was borne out by the other pictures and sketches for which his uncle besought his admiration always this facile poetic coloring and this indifferent draughtsmanship this suggestion of difficulties shirked rather than of difficulties overcome at last seen to be due to the conventional composition most of the works whether in chalk or watercolor or oil being pretty landscapes or singlefigure studies in simple attitudes or when complicated by other figures embracing episodes which seemed to have been transferred direct from other pictures some of which indeed matt had seen either in the originals or in engravings to his astonishment herbert who had been yawning widely drew his attention to one such little bit dont you recognize that he said dad did at once its a quotation from millais matt looked puzzled at the phrase cribbing the unwise it call expounded herbert and so did dad till i explained to him it was only quoting when a great writer hits off a phrase it passes into the language and when a great painter hits off a new effect of technique or gets a happy grouping i contend it belongs to the craft as much as the primitive tricks of scumbling or glazing we praise the mellow virgilisms in tennyson but we are down upon the painter who repeats anothers lines the old masters borrowed unblushingly but we are such sticklers for originality which after all only means plagiarizing nature didnt raphael crib his composition from orcagna and michael angelo copy masaccio and tintoretto turn michael angelos samson into jupiter why in the academy at venice i saw have you been to venice cried matt eagerly herbert has been to all the galleries of europe said his father impressively we travel abroad every year its part of the education of a painter how are you to know bellini and tintoretto if you dont go to venice velasquez and titian cannot be fully studied by any one who has not been in madrid and the man who is ignorant of the treasures of the louvre or of the uffizi at florence wherehe interpolated with simulated facetiousness laying his hand on herberts shoulderi hope to see my boys portrait painted by his own hand one day look at this queer stone scarab interrupted herbert annoyed i picked it up in egypt comes from inside a mummycase egypt the word fell like music on matts ears the roselight of romance illumined the uncouth beetle herbert hastened to exhibit his other curios coins medals cameos scarves yataghans pottery ivories with a cursive autobiographical commentary passing rapidly to another object whenever his father threatened to take up the thread of autobiography and as matt handled these picturesque trophies of travel that wafted into the studio the aroma of foreign bazaars the wave of hopelessness resurged swamping even the fresh hopefulness engendered by the discovery that his cousins craftsmanship was not so far beyond his hand after all all those marvellous faroff oldworld places that had disengaged themselves from his lonely readings fair mirages thrown upon a phantasmal sky not vaguely but with the sensuous definiteness of a painters vision jostling one another like the images in a shaken kaleidoscope in an atmosphere of romantic poetry venice dreaming on its waters in an enchanted moonlight paris all life and light spain

on silken chargers in a land of sand and sphinxes and violet shadows the indies east of the sun and west of the moon full of palmtrees and nautchgirls and bayaderesa shifting panorama of strange exotic cities steeped in romance and history and sunshine and semibarbarian splendors where the long desolation of his native winter never came nor the clammy vapors of britain cities of splendid dream where anything might happen and nothing could seem unreal where adventure waited masked at every street corner and love waved a white hand from every lattice and in a flood of sadness that had yet something delicious in it he pitied himself for having been cut off from all these delectable experiences which the happier herbert had so facilely enjoyed i know you are bored father said herbert pausing amid his exposition you want to get back to business and matt and i want to yarn matts bitterness was soothed it thrilled him to be called matt by this rich refined travelled young gentleman well goodbye my young friend said his uncle holding out his hand for the first time i dare say i shall see you again ha drop in any time youre passing i think your mother will be wanting you presently herbert he moved to the door then paused and turning his head uneasily said and if you ever want any advice you know dont hesitate to ask me and with a faint friendly nod of his vandyke beard he went out closing the door carefully behind him awful bore the governor said herbert stretching his arms he never knows when hes de trop matt did not know what de trop was except when he saw it printed but the disrespectful tone jarred upon him you owe him a good deal it seems to me he replied simply hullo hullo my young methodist parson and herbert threw back his head in a ringing laugh which made his white teeth gleam gayly why do you think we owe anything to our parents they didnt marry to oblige us i am only a tool for his ambitions what do you mean murmured matt oh well i oughtnt to talk about it perhaps but youre my first cousinthe first cousin ive ever hadmatt smiled fascinated afreshand after all its an open secret that he wants the name of strang to live in the annals of paintingif it couldnt be matthew strang it must be herbert strang and so he belongs to the minor artists clubs of course he cant get into the limners though he contrives to be there on business pretty often and consoles himself by using their notepaper but at the gillray and the reynolds they dare not blackball him because the committee always owe him money or want to sell him pictures but i dare say they laugh at him behind his back when he jaws to them about art in general and my talents in particular its confoundedly annoying oh ive been forgetting to smoke what can be the matter with me and he pulled out a lizardskin case from which matt not liking to refuse drew forth a cigarette but what good does he do by belonging to those clubs he asked oh he likes it for one thing replied herbert striking a match and holding it to matts cigarette my belief is he only went into the picture business to rub shoulders with artists though where the charm comes in i have never been able to find out for a duller a more illiterate set of fellows i never wish to meet shop is all they can talk and then of course its good for business but in the background lurks i feel sure the idea of advancing my interests of accumulating backstairs influence of pulling the ropes that shall at last lift me into the proud position of ra nay who knows he said puffing out his first wreath of smokepresident of the royal academy and he laughed melodiously well but began matt inhaling the delicious scent of the tobacco well but echoed herbert thats just it my tastes are not considered in the matter at all art art art nothing but art rammed down my throat till im sick of the sight of a canvas i was a connoisseur in my cradle and sucked a maulstick instead of a monkeyonastick and i live in the midst of art and out of the profits of it its pictures pictures everywhere and not aoh have a brandyandsoda wont you dont stand about as if you were going matt obediently dropped upon a lounge that yielded deliciously to his pressure the fragrant smoke curled about his face while his cousin made pleasant play with popping corks and gurgling liquids but dont you really like painting he asked in astonishment i like some things in it well enough replied herbert but its such beastly drudgery all this wretched copying of models is no better than photography and a camera would do the tiding in a thousandth part of the time i always work from photographs when i can but is that artistic said matt slightly shocked its the only thing worthy of the artists dignity the bulk of art is journeymans work besides lots of em do it nowadayswith magiclanterns to boot because one man by a fluke happens to be a better drawingmachine than another is he to be counted the greater artist matt felt small before this answer to his secret criticism did you ever see the cameraobscura at the crystal palace that does landscapes in a jiffy that we should go messing over for months and then think of the lookingglass they talk of rembrandt and franz hals ill back a bedroom mirror to put more life into its portraits than either of em why if some process were inventeda sort of magic mirror to fix the image living and colored in the glassheres luckhe clinked his glass against mattsthe governor would have to shut up shop yes but the mirror hasnt got any imagination urged matt setting down his glass refreshed the glow of brandy in his throat lending added intellectual charm to the discussion oh i dont know there are distorting mirrors rejoined herbert laughing but you are quite right art is selection nature travers dun temprament art is autobiography but painting which somehow monopolizes the name of art is really the lowest form of art nature is full of scenes quite as good as art doesnt ruskin say an artist has got to copy nature but is there anything in nature so closely akin to a poem or to ruskins own prose or to a symphony of beethoven as a moonlit sea or a beautiful woman is to a picture what is the skylarks song compared to shelleys or the music of the sea to mozarts the real creation is in the other arts which are called literature and music they are an addition to naturesomething extra painting and actingthese are mere reduplications of nature perhaps i was unfair to painting that at least fixes the beauty of nature but acting is merely an evanescent imitation of the temporary the younger man sat half bewildered beneath this torrent of words and quotations the respect herbert had lost in his eyes by his draughtsmanship a trifling matter under herberts disdainful analysis returning multiplied to reverence and with a fresh undercurrent of humility and envy how much there was to know in the world how many languages and books and arts how could he mix with herbert and his set without being found out thats why i prefer literature and music said herbert but then im not my own master like youyou lucky beggar if i had my way pictures would be nothing but colorschemes sheer imagination with no relation to truth of nature what do i care how her shadows fall if they dont fall gracefully and then why must my lines imitate natures thats where the japanese are so great dont smoke that fagend have another and he threw his cigarettecase across to his magnetized listener it was the first time in his hard busy existence matt had ever heard any one talk like a book discussing abstract relations of art and life i wish i knew as much as you he said navely i wish i was as free as you retorted herbert laughingly though i certainly wouldnt employ my liberty as you do what in heavens name made you want to study art i did laugh when the governor told the mater of your letter i was just in the roughest grind and felt like writing you on the sly to warn you i dont think i should have taken your advice said matt with an embarrassed laugh but what made you come to london anyhow why didnt you go to paris to paris yes theres no teaching to be got in london no matt turned pale no at least thats what everybody says in england paris alone has the tradition once it was holland once florence and now its paris why in paris any fellows who club together can get the biggest men to visit them free gratis for nothing here the big pots prefer the society of the swells then why are you not in paris asked matt rallying ah thats where my governor is such an idiot he pretends to think theres more chance for a man whos been through the academy schools he gets known to the ras and all that but his real reason is that hes afraid to trust me in paris by myself no said matt in sympathetic incredulity yes thats why he had this room knocked into a studio for meit always reminds me of a nursery at the top of the houseand even selects my female models knows their parents and that sort of thing its all sheer selfishness i tell you and im just sick of all this perpetual fussing and worrying over me as if i were a prize pig or a racehorse a man of twentythree not allowed to have a studio or chambers of his own you dont realize how lucky you are my boy if i could afford it id chuck up the governor tomorrow but im dependent on him for every farthing and all he allows me for pocketmoney iswell youd never guess matt did not make the attempt he judged herbert might think meanly of even a pound a week but he did not dare to hazard a guess three hundred a year and out of that ive got to get my clothes and pay my models confound em matt stared in startled reverential envy yes you may well stare why you know yourself if you buy a woman a bracelet it runs away with a months allowance but talking of clothes youll have to get better than those things if you ever want me to be seen with you these are quite new murmured matt in alarm and original added herbert ill have to introduce you to my tailor isis he dear matt stammered if you pay him said herbert dryly oh i always pay protested matt youre lucky i have to economize matt thought suddenly of william gregson with a throb of gratitude at least his wardrobe boasted of unimpeachable boots then he suddenly espied a small battalion of footgear ranged against a wallblack boots brown boots patent shoes brown shoes boots with laces boots with beautiful buttonsand he relapsed into his primitive humility uneasy lest herbert should insist on equipping him similarly he was glad to remember that herberts mother was expecting her boy and with a murmur to that effect rose to go nonsense said herbert im not due till dinnertime but if you must be going i think ill just stroll a little you go towards oxford street dont you yees faltered matt who was a little frightened at the idea that his dainty cousin might accompany him to his lodging all right ill just go to the club to see if there are any letters theres another of your privileges confound you i cant have any letters come to my own place why not why not do you think id have the governor nosing my correspondence hed be always asking questions its a jolly little clubill put you up for it if you like take another cigarette take half a dozen put em in your pocket as they were going downstairs matt said he would like to say goodbye to madame so they passed into the sittingroom au revoir my dear nephew au revoir said madame shaking both his hands i said you and herbert would love each other you will find your sixpence awaiting you on the desk chapter iv the picturemakers funny ive never been to see your place i must look you up one day thus herbert at uncertain intervals but he never carried out his threat his life was too full and he had been accustomed from childhood to have the mountain come to mohammed and so gradually matt who had at first lived half apprehensive of an exposure half wishful that herbert should become rudely aware of his real position surrendered himself to the magnetism of his cousins manner and weakly tried to live up to that young gentlemans misconception of him whenever they were together even submitting to a morning suit and an evening dress from herberts tailor for an undefined sum at an unmentioned date for if the disadvantages of herberts society were many if he had to starve for days to return herberts club hospitality at a restaurant still he was satisfied the game was worth the candle from herbert he felt himself acquiring polish and refinement and impeccable english and social lore herbert was an intellectual stimulus with thoughts to give away and the newest poets to lend herbert was bright and gay charming away the vapors of youthful despondency but above all herbert sometimes allowed him to work in his studio amid the sensuous beauty of draping and decoration and statuary that lapped his artistic nature like a soft summer seaa privilege inestimable but in view of the mere model worth at least all the extra money this friendship cost him it befell thus on matts second visit herbert said goodnaturedly ive just laid my palette you sit down lets see what you can do may i cried matt eagerly there was a costumemodel on the thronea darkeyed beauty in oriental drapery herbert relinquished the brush and threw himself upon his back on the couch puffing lazily at his cigarette by jove he said after ten minutes youve put that in all right but what a juicy style youve got where did you get that from i cant do it any other way said matt apologetically the governor told me youre under tarmigan he never taught you that no but thats the way ive always worked i did a lot of portraits in nova scotia the devil you did no wonder youve made money confound you i thought you were a blooming ignoramus just come over to learn your pictorial pothooks and hangers i thought so too said matt flushing with pleasure and modesty none of your sarcasm you beggar you can finish the head if you like thank you said matt flutteringly he felt as if herbert were heaping coals of fire upon his own head repaying his first secret depreciation by overgenerous praise he painted away bravely soon losing himself in the happy travail of execution i must come down to your place and see your work said herbert looking up from the volume of swinburne in which he had immersed himself oh there isnt much said matt hastily ill bring you some little things next time only i dont want your father to see themtheyre not for sale youre quite right said herbert dont show em to him hush whats the matter asked matt turning his head talk of theold gentleman said herbert the brush dropped from the painters palsied fingers he felt like one caught redhanded he had already come in somewhat surreptitiously through the side door in obedience to herberts recommendation and to be found using herberts appliances and model would be the acme of guiltiness the alarm was false but thenceforward the old gentleman indicated matthew strang the elder for they had frequent occasion to fear his advent since matt came often tempted from his gloomy back room to the beautiful light studio where he was allowed not only to do bits of herberts work while herbert read or gossiped with the model but occasionally to set up another easel and use the same model but they were only detected together twice by the vandyke beard and the velvet coat and on one occasion herbert had had time to resume the brush and on another to pose matt as a model the old gentlemans rather grumpy about you he admitted with his customary candor ive had to tell the servant not to mention your coming so often the maters mashed on you and i suppose hes a bit jealous she wanted to ask you to our dinnerparty last nightwe had two associates and a scotch academician and an american millionaire who buys any rot and an art critic who praises itbut he said one didnt give dinnerparties for ones relations but for strangers as matt had already dined once en famille with madames guileless homage at his side to put him at ease he did not feel himself hardly used his position with the old gentleman was not improved by his demeanor on an occasion when meeting him in the doorway herberts father instead of raising remonstrant eyebrows astonished him by asking if he would like to see the masterpieces he had in stock matt did not know that this generous offer was due to the death of a member of the institute whose watercolors had been accumulating on matthew strangs hands and who now even before his funeral was showing signs of a posthumous boom he replied eagerly that nothing could be a greater favor the picturedealer waved his jewelled hand with pompous geniality and mounting one flight of stairs with the hand on matts shoulder ushered him into the holy of holies a chamber religious with purple curtains and hushed with soft carpets where the more precious pictures reposed behind baize veils that for possible purchasers were lifted with a reverent silence bespeaking a hundred extra guineas long habit of ritual awe made matthew strangs hands pious even before his nephew but his nephews expected ecstasies were tempered by unexpected criticism in an eminent academicians portrait of a lady matt pointed out that the eyes were wrong that pupils should be round not squashy and that the hot shadows made by the indian reds under the nose were inspired by romney he questioned the veracity of a landscape by a costly name demurring to the light on the under sides of the leaves as impossible under the conditions depicted and in a historical composition by an old english master he found a lack of subtlety in the legs and a stringy feeling throughout all this wanton depreciation of goods by one who was not even an interested bargainer galled the picturedealer conscious of overflowing goodnature and prepared for a natural return in breathless adoration so when matt suggested that in a celebrated picture of a seabeach the sea had no fluidity and was falling on the fishermens heads he lost his temper and cried sarcastically i think you had better open a school for ras young man matt flushed feeling he had been impertinent then his sense of justice repudiated the rebuke it was of no use pretending a thing was right when it wasnt he protested he didnt profess to get things right himself and he only wished he could do anything half as good as the worst of these pictures but he did know when he was wrong even if it wouldnt come right for all his sweating and fuming a young man oughtnt to talk till he can paint interrupted his uncle severely but you know what dr johnson says sir matt remonstrated if you cant make a plumpudding its no sign you cant judge one plumpuddings and pictures are very different things said matthew strang stiffly as though insulted by an implicit association with a pastrycook my thats ripping cried matt abandoning the argument at the sudden sight of a fine mellow piece of portraitpainting how the old masters got the grays oh why dont people wear wigs nowadays this outburst of enthusiasm made the private exhibition close more auspiciously than had seemed probable but matt was never again invited to inspect the sacred treasures his relations with his relatives came to be limited to morning visits to herbert whose stairs he ascended half secretly to watch the progress of his cousins studies for an ambitious picture of daniel before nebuchadnezzar the models for which he also used himself he left his own studies behind at herberts requestthough reluctantly for he was not at all satisfied with themas a species of payment for the privilege when through his interest in this coming masterpiece of herberts and under the fascination of this delightful and flattering friendship he forgot his pride and fell into the habit of regular morning work in herberts company lunch somehow came up regularly for three though madame was not supposed to be aware of his presence those were joyous lunches full of laughter and levity made picturesque by the romantic dress or undress of the third party and extra palatable for mattwhen his first reluctance wore offby the fact that they saved dinners daniel before nebuchadnezzar was intended for next years academy herbert told him and he gathered from his cousins casual observations that it had also to be submitted beforehand to the professors at the schools for there were strange cramping conditions as to the size of the canvas and the principal figure but he was less interested in its destination than in its draughtsmanship he saw the tableau in his minds eye the moment herbert told him he was engaged upon it for the scene had often figured itself to his fancy in those faroff days when his mother read the bible to her helpless children by random prickings nebuchadnezzars dream was one of the lucky chapters to which matt listened without distraction as the narrative unrolled itself pictorially before his inner vision he rapidly sketched his conception then found he disliked it and ultimately remembered he had unconsciously reproduced the grouping of figures in the illustration in his mothers bible one of those he had colored in his childish naughtiness herbert protested this was no drawback but matt went away brooding over a more artistic arrangement and dreamed that he was mangled by lions in a den but in the morning he brought a new grouping for herberts consideration this herbert picked to pieces as being against the canons dont forget its for the academy he said we mustnt make mistakes in grammar some of the old buffers are worse than tarmigan damn tarmigan cried matt but he had to admit ruefully that his scheme was full of solecisms he had by this time as full an acquaintance with the rules as his senior but with herbert they had become instinctive it was with a renewed sense of inferiority to his cousin paradoxically combined with an inward raging against the lindley murrays of art that matt abandoned point after point under herberts searching criticism herberts gift of pulling other peoples ideas to pieces amounted to genius but he abandoned his original sketch also dismissed his projected models and devoted himself to arguing out the composition afresh under the banter of the artcritic smoking cynically on the sofa matt was put upon his mettle to group all the figures and dispose the lines so as to escape the pitfalls lurking on every side and likewise satisfy the conditions of the pedantic professors we must get as much subject as possible into it explained herbert they give you such a small spaceonly fifty by fortythat you must crowd all you know into it gradually the composition took shape with infinite discussion daily renewed matt was for pillars with curious effects of architecture herbert objected that pillars would make the perspective too difficult and only consented on the laughing stipulation that matt should work out the angles and herbert was very averse from matts suggestions of strange original attitudes for the figures that ll make some awfully stiff foreshortening he grumbled what does it matter youll have models matt would reply its all very well you havent got to do the work herbert would retort and when the grouping was settled the color and the drapery brought fresh argumentation the young men working as at a chess problem till the puzzle of arriving at the original without deserting the academic was solved and as in the solution of a chess problem by a pair of heads the suggestion of the winning moves has been so obscured by the indefinite suggestion of abortive moves by both that neither remembers to which the final discovery of the right track was due so matt would have been surprised to be told that the ideas that had been retained were all his and the ideas that had been rejected were all herberts the thought of apportioning their shares in the final scheme never crossed his mind even though it was his hand that always held the experimentative pencil indeed the technical interest of the task had absorbed every other thought and the details of the tentative were lost in the triumph of the achieved and obscured as by a cigarette cloud of happy mornings and then herbert told his father he must have new models fresh to studios i dont want em from haverstock hill or lillie road he saidwomen whove been hung in every gallery i dont want your italians from hatton garden or professionals that any of the other fellows might get hold of and extract my ideas from besides new faces will give me a better chance and matthew strang the elder recognized there was some reason in his sons request but he pointed out it was not so easy to go outside the stock families especially for figure models and that old hands often helped the painter but herbert easily overrode his objections it was only the conventional attitudinizings and foreshortenings which they understood the quotations of art which he was now about to abandon in deference to paternal prejudice and so matthew strang morbidly solicitous obediently brought picturesque orientals for daniel and the king and the satraps and the counsellors and blushing brunettes for the beauties of the court and herbert set to work to reproduce in large on the canvas matts rough charcoal scheme of the whole and his own or matts studies of the parts and when herbert blundered matt suggested with pastel a change of tone or color or outline sometimes even taking up the brush when herbert was lazyas herbert often was matt was never surprised to find the work no more advanced than when he had gone away the morning before for herberts mind was on many and more important things the academy students were rehearsing a burlesque which he had written for their dramatic society and he sometimes slipped out to the rehearsals lamenting to matt that through his fathers insistence on steady work he could not even play in his own piece the only recreation allowed him was a ride in the park on a hired hack and even that he grumbled was to enable him to salute cantering ras sometimes he went to tea with the girl students at restaurants sometimes he went to balls and was too tired on the day after to do anything but describe them they were always painters dances the old gentleman blocks others he said on one occasion the host was an ra whose son was a fellowstudent at the schools and then the old gentleman chortled then there was the students ball to which he convoyed matt who was quite dazzled by the elegance and refinement of the ladies and almost afraid to speak to his partners and torn afresh with envy of the beautiful life from which he had been and must long be shut out not losing his discomfort till after the supper at which he tasted champagne for the first time herberts special circle danced the lancers with a zest and entrain that horrified some of the matrons and brought back to matt the dear old nights when he took the barn floor with little ruth hailey under the placid gaze of the cows and amid the odors of the stable and the haymow for other memorable experiences too matt was indebted to his easygoing cousin there was herberts club the bohemian a cosey little place favored by actors and journalists caricatures of whose sensuous faces lined the walls in company with oilpaintings and sketches more sensuous still matt felt measureless reverence for the men he brushed against here he had seen some of them before in the illustrated papers which he read in shopwindows or penny newsrooms or herberts studio and he trembled lest they should detect from his embarrassment amid the varied knives and forks and glasses that he was only a boor with less education than the waiters he wondered what the clever cultured peoplescraps of whose conversation floated across to him amid the popping of sodawater corkswould think if they knew he had planted potatoes chopped logs made sugar in the woods and climbed masts and steeples in the new snobbishness with which their society had infected him he could not see that these things were education not humiliation and he was glad that even herbert knew little of his history and asked less of other peoples histories on the other hand matt heard a great deal bubbles had robbed him of his belief in royal virtue in the smokingroom of the bohemians society fell to pieces like a house of cards in building which as herbert once said the knaves alone had been used it was a racing dicing drinking swindling fornicating fraternity wormeaten with hypocrisy sincerity or simplicity was all my eye there was always money or a woman or position in the background they talk a lot of scandal matt once complained my dear matt remonstrated herbert its not scandal its gossip brixton gossips about who marries whom bohemia about who lives with whom scandal implies censure despite the scandal or the gossip matt was full of curiosity to see this strange new life of clubs and restaurants and theatres to which herbert sometimes got paper admissions this feverish realm of intellect and gayety where nobody seemed to want for anything but it sometimes came over him with an odd flash of surprise and bitterness as he caught the gleam of white scented shoulders or saw heavyjowled satyrs swilling champagne that all this settled luxury had been going on while he was tramping the snowy roads of what might have been another planet the feeling wore off as the london season advanced and the tide of luxurious life rolled along the great sunny thoroughfares or flecked the midnight streets with darting points of fire his puritan conscience curiously persisting beneath all the scepticism engendered by his mothers tragedy had at first acquiesced but uneasily in the unscriptural view of life that seemed to prevail around him but fainter and fainter grew its prickings the sensuous in him ripened in this liberal atmosphere and that greek conception of a beautiful world which budding for him in solitude had been almost nipped by the same cruel tragedy flowered now in the heats of an ardent city the old gentleman was in such goodhumor at the surprising progress of herberts daniel before nebuchadnezzar that madames gentle remonstrance that he ought to do something for matt touched a responsive chord and before the academy sendingin day matt had the privilege of being escorted by his uncle in company with herbert to a conversazione at the reynolds club of which the dealer was a member herbert was soon lost in the crush of secondrate painters and engravers and obscurely famous visitors who gathered before the members wouldbe academy pictures that lined the walls or the secondrate entertainers who struck attitudes on the das but matt was too nervous amid this congestion of celebrities to detach himself from his uncle who did the honors grandly pointing out the lions of the club with a proprietorial air matt could not but feel that his uncle who was of the swallowtailed minority was himself one of the lions of the club and in very truth he was its most distinguishedlooking member the refreshments are not gratis he told matt but of course you can have anything you like at my expense will you have a cup of coffee or are you one of those degenerate young men who cant live without whiskeyandwater but matt had no appetite for anything he was too fluttered by this close contact with the giants of the brush he listened eagerly to morsels of their dialogue strained his vision to see them through the smoky lamplit air critical as he might have been and was before their work the men themselves were shrouded in a vague splendor of achievement they had all been hung there seemed a good deal of talk about a virulent article of comprehensive condemnation in the art columns of the saturday spectator everybody seemed to have read it and nobody to have written it for the rest compliments crossed like smiling couples in the quadrille what a stunning landscape that is of yours rapper said wilfred smith a journalist so ignorant of painting that he was suspected of art criticism quite like a corot oh its nothing just knocked off for a colorblind old johnny who admires me replied rapper deprecatingly he was a moonfaced man with a double eyeglass on a gold cord its rotten really im awfully ashamed of it and he elbowed his way towards it so he ought to be and so ought you to be ashamed wilfred said morrison the poet of pessimism and musichalls its just like those splashes of silvery gray they sell for corots on the boulevards thats what i meant said wilfred didnt you see i was guying him hullo clinch ive been admiring that watercolor of yours what an exquisite face the girl has it isnt a watercolor you fool its a pastel said clinch gruffly thats what i meantnot an oilcolor replied wilfred unabashed matt stared with interest at the picture which was just beside him the face was indeed exquisite with the peculiar delicacy of pastel he looked at the painters own face coarse and splotched the teeth fouled by endless tobacco it was as though pan should paint psyche i see the saturday spectator doesnt understand your carolina clinch said the poet smiling clinch damned the saturday spectator in a string of unlovely oaths which were drowned by the music of a violin and a piano he did not care a twopenny damn what people scribbled about him his pictures were there just the same but what does carolina mean old man said the poet appealingly clinch replied that literary fellows were invariably sanguinary fools who fancied that painting meant things and could be explained in words he had just been reading about the significance of leonardos backgrounds in some rotten book on the renaissance in reality those bits of landscape must have been put in and painted out a dozen times before leonardo had struck the colorharmony he tried after morrison retorted that if the artcritic could paint he would become a partisan tied to his own talent as it was he could approach other mens pictures without prejudice but also without knowledge clinch replied goaded he pointed out brutally that to learn painting meant to learn a new set of symbols if you wanted to paint that lamp he said youd probably put down a line to get that edge and so lose all the softness a real line wouldnt look a bit like the real thing same with color real red wouldnt give red painting is all subterfuge optical illusion color and form are only an affair of relations he went on to explain with punctilious profanities that to study the relation of that lamp to the pianolid was enough for a picture treated perfectly there would be a poetry and mystery about it beauty too was only an affair of relations and in carolina he had been trying to get a beautiful relation between two ugly things and an early georgian feeling into a nineteenthcentury interior with a scientific accuracy of tones known only to modern french art matt listened eagerly wincing a little at the livelier oaths but conscious of piquant perspectives of novel artistic vision which if not quite intelligible was in refreshing contrast with tarmigans oldfashioned orthodoxy but you had the same woman in your picture of the salvation lass persisted the poet clinch explained that if writing chaps knew what it was to hunt for a satisfactory model theyd thank their stars they didnt know a palette from a planchette a swell woman that really expressed your idea you couldnt get to sit for you and if you could get her you couldnt swear at her besides it was his ambition to create a new type of feminine beauty and impose her on his periodune femme de clinch wilfred smith took mental notes prepared henceforward to expound clinch to an ignorant world its about time he got a new model anyway he said when the repulsivelooking artist had moved off or painted her added morrison dryly matt had a flash of resentment the picture was to him a dainty dream of cool color and graceful form despite his association with herbert he did not yet understand the temperament that strides to wit over truths body isnt it funny a man like that should draw such refined women he could not help remarking to his cicerone matthew strang assumed an oracular expression arts just a knack he said youve got to be born with it i wasnt mores the pity but herbert makes up for it thank heaven arts got nothing to do with character ive paid many a man to do me so many easelpictures a year and do you suppose i ever got them the rogues get drunk or die or something but they never come up to time matt was puzzled if art demanded anything it seemed to him it was steadfastness and sobriety the truth about it seemed to lie in those lines he had read in a volume of matthew arnold borrowed from herbert young gay radiant adorned outside a hidden ground of thought and of austerity within a sudden fear that he was not a genius himself was like a vivisectors knife through his heart laying bare with painful incision its secret hope do you think clinch gets his effects without bothering he asked with anxiety o heavens no said matthew strang authoritatively i once watched him at work he was squatted on a tiny stool looking up at his picture and painting upward he had a cigarette in his mouth which he was always relighting every now and then he would sigh heavily or swear at himself or his model and sometimes he would go and lie on the hearthrug and stare solemnly at the canvas then jump up give one touch swear if it went wrong paint it out and then go and stand in the corner with his face to the wall probably in meditation but looking exactly like a naughty little boy at school matt smiled half at the picture of clinch in the corner half from relief at finding that even men who swore and drank far more than he did suffered quite as acutely in the parturition of the beautiful he fell back on the theory of an essential inner delicacy behind the occasionally coarse envelope of artistic genius just as grossness could lurk beneath a gentlemanly refinement they ultimately found herbert in the billiardroom with a cue in one hand and a sodaandwhiskey in the other i dont want to look at the pictures he protested if theyre decent ill see them in the academy and if theyre rot its waste of time seeing them at all as for the entertainment you can get a better at any musichallat least so ive been told nevertheless he himself took matt to another conversazione the same week the far more homely gathering of the st georges sketching club where the refreshments were gratis and evening dress was taboo and really famous people scrambled for the breadandcheese and beer of which there was not enough and members disported themselves in their models costumes for the edification of a company which had turned its back on their pictures for the academy itself matt paid his shilling into such extravagant habits had he slipped since the days of his arrival in london when a national gallery catalogue was beyond his far fatter purse but he came away much less inspired than from that momentous visit his imagination untouched save once or twice as by erlesmiths personalized projections of medival romance in which the absence of real atmosphere seemed only natural there were so many smooth portraits of uninteresting people that he was reminded drearily of his novascotian drudgery when his heavenscaling spirit had to stoop to portray and please some tedious farmer who was sometimes not even picturesque it did not occur to him how unfair was the latent comparison with the national gallery he forgot that art is short and the academy long that one can no more expect a batch of great pictures every year than a batch of great novels or of great symphonies tarmigan had a picture of the rape of the sabines it was hung on the line and graingers was very proud of it in the discussion on the academy which supplied the class with the materials for a fortnights carping it was the only picture that escaped even bubbless depreciation though he declared he would never himself paint like that which the curlyheaded wag eagerly admitted one of the students had secured a place in the skies and his success made matt regret he himself had not dared to send in graingers own contribution had been rejected which made his pupils think more highly of themselves matt was more interested in the azure art gallery a little exhibition mainly of landscapes with violet shadows held by some young men about whom herbert was enthusiastic for they did not attempt said he to vie either with the camera or the conte if painting be an art at all he contended it can only be so by virtue of ignoring nature as goethe said we call art art because it is not nature the musician works up notes the poet syllables into a music unlike anything in nature and so must the painter work up natures colors and forms under the sole guidance of his artistic instinct and whatever can be better expressed in words has no place in painting these young mens pictures tell no stories and no truths either they are merely concerned with color and line matt afterwards found that with the exception of a couple of scotchmen these young men by no means accepted herberts account of their aims indeed they rather regarded it as satirical for to give truer impressions of nature was precisely their boast and glory although matt could not always credit them with success in this still he found a note of life and fantasy in their work he was especially struck by cornpeppers chimney on fire in fitzroy streeta flight of sparks falling and curving in a golden rain in vivid contrast with the dark starlit sky above and the black mass of spectators below faintly illumined by streetlamps and broken at the extreme end by the brassy gleam of the fireengine tearing up the street there were inaccuracies of detail but matt was immensely impressed by the originality of the subject and the touch of weirdness and it was with joy that he accepted herberts offer to take him to the azure art club where cornpepper and his clique mostly forgathered since herbert had misinterpreted them to his cousin matt had read a good deal about them in the papers and they had held forth brilliantly to interviewers on the veracity of their rendering of nature cornpepper going so far as to claim that you could not look at his landscapes without feelingfrom the color of stone and sea from the tints of the sky and the disposition of the cloudswhat oclock it was whereupon the interviewer had consulted a study of poppies on a cliff and reported that it was halfpast eleven cornpepper crying correct all of which did not fail to provoke counterblasts from the academic camp and from the irresponsible concocters of facetious paragraphs it was all very smallthe feeble british refraction of the great gallic battle then waging of the campaign of plein air and modern subject against bituminous landscapes and classic conventions the expurgated english edition of the eternal battle of youth and age spiritless as the bouts of boxers in a quaker land sans prizerings or heroworshippers the shadowy warfare of art in a puritan country vibrating only to politics and religion indifferent to style gauging literature merely by its message and art by its idea but matt was not a trueborn briton and his own aversion from an unreal nature doctored and tricked up in which an artificial chiaroscuro took the place of observation and atmosphere led him into instant sympathy with this painting of real moments with this presentation of nature caught in the fact as cornpepper brilliantly defined the impressionism he had smuggled over from paris even if nature was not so violet as she was painted matt felt the mistake was on the right side and who but cornpepper had revealed and interpreted the mystery and poetry of the night true he was rather staggered to remember it was impossible to paint the night with your eye on the object the night side of nature might be caught in the fact it could not be arrested in the fact herbert was not a member of the azure art club they had to call on a man in kensington to get him to take them there he proved to be no other than the moonfaced rapper whom herbert had invited to invite them to dinner hes an awful duffer he said enviously but he has a flat of his own and an income of his own and hes had the run of copenhagen paris and antwerp they say copenhagen is worse than paris rapper made them stay to admire his rooms dont look at my pictures he said thats only a portrait im doing of riggs the bucketshop keeper im an awful duffer why i should get so many commissions at a hundred and fifty guineas when theres lots of geniuses starving i never can make out i suppose its because i dont want the moneyi shall only blue it at monte carlo ive only just come back from the countrya jp an awful screw he made me do him and his wife for twofifty still theyre only halflengths do try some of this burgundy its genuine i import it direct from a small grower i get a huge barrel for five pounds and pay three pounds duty and get hundreds of bottles out of it people dont know how to get wine in england oh do please look at that limoges enamel over the mantelpiece mr strang its far better worth looking at than that daub of a library i always prefer to look at pictures said matt apologetically it is rather a strong bit of color admitted rapper yes do you think the light is accounted for asked matt that red glow dont you see the library lamp rejoined rapper yes but the shades off and even then isnt it more like firelight not a bit of it replied rapper hotly do you suppose i didnt study the effects with a lighted lamp thats a good bit of action in the old scholars arm reaching for the book matt examined it carefully the forearm is a little out of drawing isnt ita little too long he asked timidly my dear fellow the model had an unusually long forearm you dont suppose everybody is alike of course it isnt near finished yet but really i was trying for color more than for line and after all its the careless draughtsmanship of a man who can draw it attracted quite a lot of notice at the azure art gallery last year but i put a big price on it so that it shouldnt sell and id have time to work it up thats a little bust of myself its only plaster of paris bronzed over i model ever so much better than i paint but nobody will give me a commission isnt it funny do have some more of the burgundy im not much of an artist but i flatter myself i do know a good wine before they left he presented them with photographs of his library picture apparently forgetting that he hadnt near finished it i say i cant go about with you if you go on like this whispered herbert to matt as rapper lingered to extinguish his gas and lock his door fancy telling a chap his faults you mustnt go by me and my nebuchadnezzar i rather like to be pitched into it keeps a fellow from getting conceited i didnt know matt murmured with a new admiration for herbert who had already become a hero to him moving so brilliantly amid all these shining circles the three young men got into a hansom and smoked rappers cigars at the little club which was only ten minutes off they dined in a long narrow drabpainted room with a billiardtable near the door several men whose work matt had studied with interest were dining in their vicinity matt strained his ears to catch their conversation but it seemed to be all about the billiardtable an apparently recent acquisition at last to his joy he was introduced to some of the most famousto butler tall dark muscular and frockcoated most erratic of etchers most slapdash of painters to the foulmouthed daintyfingered clinch to gurney slim youthful and oldfaced habited in tweeds the latest recruit an earnest disciple of every master in turn old or new always in superlatives of eulogy or abuse and untaught by his own gyrations to respect a past adoration or to tone down a present to greme more barefacedly boyish than even herbert a blonde youth credited by his admirers with a charming new blond vision of nature though the philistines contended that all he did was to get watercolor effects with oils to simpson who ground his own colors and had mysterious glazes and varnishes and was consumed by an unshared anxiety as to the permanence of his pictures andoh awful joyto the great cornpepper the most brilliant and the youngest of them all a squat juvenile figure with a supercilious eyeglass in the right eye a beaklike nose and a habit of rasping the middle of his seat with his hands like an owl on a perch matt was dying to talk to themand especially to cornpepperof their art as to men who had already done something in the world through which they moved burdened with aspirations and haloed with dreams but the talk would not veer round to painting and the evening was entirely devoted to a general game of shellout with halfpenny points matt was drawn into taking a cue and lost one and threepence halfpenny in the first game his inexperience being aggravated by herberts whispered caution not to cut the cloth however his skilled eye and hand practised with gun and brush soon told and he won his money back in the second much to his relief for his funds were running away at an appalling rate the strenuous leaders of the newest art movement relaxed over the green table highly hilarious as the white ball ran among the red balls like a sheepdog to drive them into the pockets and stamping and contorting themselves in mock applause after a failure to score thats a fluke herbert would say when the failure was his and the jest became a catchword provocative of perpetual cachinnation there were so many hands in the game that matt had plenty of time for occasional remarks between his turns but nobody would speak of art except a venerable graybeard named brinkside who talked to him enthusiastically of the azure art campaign he told him of the heroism of its leaders of how cornpepper had lived on dates and water while doing blackandwhite illustrations for the christian home salvation subjects at starvation prices of how the even sturdier butler had slept in a stableloft refusing to compromise with his genius or to modify the great dabs of paint that the world mistook for daubs in answer to matts inquiries the old man explained to him how cornpepper painted his night scenes by putting down at fever heat in the morning some beautiful effect noted and absorbed the night before in the evening cornpepper would return to the spot brinkside said but if despite all his waiting he could not see the same effect he would wilfully forget the second impression and return again and again till the first conditions were repeated matt relieved to find that cornpeppers method was similar to his own and that genius had no esoteric prerogatives of method pointed out that in natures infinite permutations an effect never recurred exactly as before and that therefore he for his part contented himself with storing up in his mind the main values and colorplanes relying on deduction for the minuti but of course it all depended on holding the total effect the original sensation vividly in the memory on leaving he thanked brinkside with touching humility for the instructive interest of his conversation funny to find an old man in a new movement he observed suddenly to herbert in their homeward hansom why not old men often creep in its their last chance but if its brinkside youre thinking of hes not an artist at all hes an artists colorman who supplied em with their materials on tick before they caught on brinksides like a dressmaker i used to know at brighton who financed lovely woman till she married wealthy flats he foresaw they would get on and by jove they are blazing away like a house on fire or perhaps i ought to say like a chimney on fire then the opposition to the academy is flourishing cried matt joyfully his vague youthful sympathy with all that was fresh and young was strengthened and made concrete by the revelations of struggle and starvation in the lives of those that had preceded him martyred for the faith that was in them yes it is flourishing said herbert so much so that in ten years time most of em will be academicians or associates if i were the governor id buy em up now but hes got no insight oh said matt disappointed do you mean the academy will win after all six of one and half a dozen of tother theyll be half accepted and half toned down already greme and butler are marriedand thats the beginning of the end lucky beggars supplied with enthusiasm in their youth and comfort in their old age i wish i was young myself what nonsense i never was young said herbert shaking his head i always saw through everything heigho give us a light from your cigar ive sighed mine out i suppose theyre very grateful to brinkside said matt when the fire of herberts cigar was rekindled they play billiards with him but i dont suppose theyve squared up yet but theyre making money now urged matt horrified years of bitter slavery to domestic liabilities had unfitted him to understand this laxity of financial fibre and then why be rash one cant foresee the future before the magnificence of this rebuke matt shrank abashed he had a sneaking twinge of shame and concern for his own homely honesty as for something inauspiciously inartistic talking of money went on herbert im devilish hard up myself for a day or twobills to meet at once and my allowance dont come due for a few days you couldnt advance me a trifle i suppose of course i could said matt eagerly do you think you could let me have a pony a pony repeated matt mystified twentyfive pounds dont do it if it will at all inconvenience you matt was glad that it was too dark for herbert to read his face the sum was by far the greater portion of his worldly possessions but he did not hesitate herbert would refund it in a day or two i will bring it to the studio tomorrow he said thats a good chap said herbert bytheway weve got to go to cornpeppers studio next sunday week really cried matt in delighted excitement yes he told me he didnt like to ask you direct because you looked so serious and straitlaced oh protested matt with a vague sense of insult well you do theres no denying it remember how you preached to me about the governor the first time you saw me perhaps youll go lecturing cornpepper because he economizes by domesticating his model when he has a big picture on the easel personally i like cornpepper he is the only fellow who has the courage of his want of principles in this whitewashed sepulchre of a country but be careful that you dont talk to him as you did to rapper for he lives up to his name he is awfully peppery when you tread on his corns though he has no objection to stamping on yours not that i believe theres any real malice in him but they say his master at the beauxarts was a very quarrelsome fellow and my opinion is that he models himself on him and thinks that to quarrel with everybody is to be a great artist oh but dont you think he will be a great artist said matt he is a great artist but he wont be said herbert hell be an ra by jove we nearly ran over that guardsman mary ann has been standing him too many drinks do you know the price of a guardsman matt the price yes a nursemaid who wishes to be seen walking out with a swagger soldier has to give him half a crown and his beer herbert never lost an opportunity of showing off to matt his knowledge of the inner working of the great social machine madame passing her white hand lovingly over her boys hair had no idea of the serpentine wisdom garnered in the brain beneath at the marble arch matt carefully bearing the photograph of rappers library got out of the hansom to exchange to a bus which passed near his street he offered to pay his share of the hansom but herbert waved the silver aside with princely magnificence chapter v a symposium matts desire to hear the brotherhood of the brush on art was gratified ad nauseam at cornpeppers for a batch of artists of all ages together with a couple of journalists assembled in the big bare picturelittered studio to smoke their own pipes and to say when to the neathanded model who dispensed the hosts whiskey some declared they wanted it neat to take off the effects of a grewsome tale with which rapper had started the evening it was about the time when he had studied art in berlin and attended ringschneiders anatomy class im not much of an artist but i do know anatomy he interpolated one day when the corpse upon which the professor was about to demonstrate was uncovered the students recognized to their horror a favorite fellowpupil who had been away for a few days he had been taken ill in his garret conveyed to the hospital and being alone in the world had been sold to the lectureroom the startled class immediately subscribed for another corpse and buried the unfortunate boy with due honors greme tried to counteract this tale by another one about a model an old fellow named william tell who after vainly applying at the slade and lambeth schools for work had been taken up by the st georges sketching club for the sake of his picturesque corded breeches when at the end of the two hours spell the men were criticising one anothers work one said to another there doesnt seem any leg under those breeches overhearing which william tell fell to indignantly unbuttoning his gaiters the arrival of a twinklingeyed caricaturist joyously greeted by all as jimmy dispelled the last flavors of the mortuary arent you in china everybody asked jimmy explained he had thrown up the commission but was off to the west indies next month though he expected to find himself in paris instead he was a genius with an infinite capacity for taking pains and making friends and being forced to rise in the small hours to get through his work before the countless callers arrived to distract him was popularly supposed to be an idle scapegrace who produced sketches as rapidly and copiously as the conjurer produces oranges from his coatsleeve matts breath was almost taken away in a rush of reverence and rapture at the unexpected privilege of seeing him for despite his own craving for the sublime and the beautiful jimmy ravens sketches of low london life had for him a magnetic appeal whose strength surprised himself sometimes he fancied it was the humor and the fun that held him as being the qualities in which he himself was most deficient sometimes it flashed upon him obscurelyas in a light thrown through a fogthat jimmy raven was teaching him to see the spectacle of life more deeply and truthfully through the medium of his humorous vision at such instants he almost thought one of jimmys loafers worth a whole academy of poetic myths but he suppressed the suspicion as absurd and perturbing to his own ideals and vision telling himself it was only the truth and subtlety of the draughtsmanship that he admired he listened to him now as eagerly and deferentially as to cornpepper his eyes fixed mainly on these two famous faces as if to seize the secret of their gifts in some contour of nose or chin but he had ample curiosity and respect to spend even on the other men though below all his real modesty and diffidence was a curious bedrock of selfconscious strength as of a talent that might hope one day to be recognized even of these but there was little arttalk to be got out of jimmy having likewise said when he launched into an account of an east end girl he had sketched that morning in the park and quoted her idea of a coster gentleman my brothers a toff he had overheard her boasting he wears three rows of buttons down his trousers and sixteen wentilation oles in is at and who do you think i saw in the park he went on egyptian bill no cried various voices what was he preaching buddhism said jimmy hes sitting to winkelman that old chap who became a buddhist when he was painting those eastern things the critics made such a fuss about there was a laugh at the expense of the mohammedan model who always suited his religion to his employers when i did him said jimmy i pretended to be a jew and it was great fun after he became a jew to tell him i was a christian i dont know which was the biggest lie he added with his droll twinkle did you hear about the hindoo who went to see winkelmans things at dowdeswells said butler he spat out you see he knew the real thing he smiled with grim satisfaction for the things were licked and stippled into a meretricious poetry and his own bold blobs of oriental color had been laughed at dont you wish they supplied spittoons at the academy asked jimmy it was the red rag for the next ten minutes the absurdities of the academy and the transcendent merits of the salon which most of them had run over to paris to see occupied the tapis and then a spectacled scotchman who answered to the name of mack dilated upon the decadence of the grisette and the degeneracy of the students orgies ah but still paris stands for the joy of life said cornpepper they are not ashamed of living they ought to be said matt and the company laughed as at a good joke our young friend thinks the artist should be moral said herbert paternally hell say art should be moral next said mack it isnt immoral is it said matt feebly as usual he was half fascinated half shocked by the freedom of the artistic standpoint for which his intellect was ready but not his deeper organization he wondered again why he was so uncomfortably constructed and he envied these others for whom their art seemed to flow in happy irrelation to conduct and character or at least to the moral ideals of the bourgeois he marvelled at them too not understanding how talents more subconscious than his own could lie in closed compartments as it were of the artists minds apparently unaffected by the experiences of their temporary owners arts neither moral nor immoral pronounced the little host magisterially as he grasped his perch more tightly any more than its lunar or calendar the artist thinks and feels in line and color he sees nature green or gray according to his temperament there are as many views from richmond hill as there are artists if two views are alike one is a plagiarism nature will never be exhausted for every man sees her differently and so long as he doesnt see her double put in jimmy quite so said cornpepper so long as he isnt too drunk to keep his brush steady we ask no more of him in fact its always best to be in love with your sitterthats what gives chic rot said a granitefaced whitebearded septuagenarian who had been smoking in silent amusement chic comes merely from painting with brushes too large for the work avast there rocks said jimmy we dont want any of your revolutionary notions here what would you say if we denounced jammy shadows at the academy dinner avast yourself cried cornpepper rather angrily this is liberty hall i wont be classed with the new school or with any school cornpeppers success had already made him feel the deadweight of an extravagant school with which one is confounded because i exhibit with you chaps people credit me with all your views you might as well say i agree with the president because im on the line in the academy have you got a picture in the academy teddy i didnt notice it said wilfred smith the journalist thereby expressing what was in matts mind too there you are laughed rocks when you come among us youre lost its only by our rejecting you that we make you famous when you exhibit by yourselves you stand out i allow rocks to talk said little cornpepper with a goodnatured smile he was the first to detect my talent and i am really sorry to be the last to detect his i think his big nudes are shocking he and tarmigan are a pair where is the point of painting heathen mythology i only paint the nude because i cant paint clothes said rocks smiling you are all so versatile nowadays ah teddyll come round to the classic too one day said butler with a weary expression on his strong stern face you should have seen his joy when he got the invitation for varnishingday nothing of the sort cried little cornpepper glaring through his eyeglass and humping himself into a more owllike curve i didnt even accept the invitation i wasnt going to help the ras to correct their draughtsmanship the glare relaxed under his pleasure at the laugh and he added more quietly do let us drop shop for heavens sake im not one of a schoolim myself and i dont say salvation lies with any sect give me style thats all i ask for will you have it neat murmured jimmy style not school pursued cornpepper pleased with the phrase take literature theres style in boccaccio and style in flaubert and style in wycherley even a moral work may pass if it has stylepopes satires for instance so too in painting i dont find style in bouguereau or fred walker in rocks or tarmigan who are only fit for chromos but i do find it in mantegna in fortuny in degas in goodbye said jimmy getting up i have to meet my wife at ten oh theres lots of time said cornpepper carrie pass jimmy the whiskey sit down theres a good chap and jimmy sat down styles going to be a square touch and a feathery outline said greme sarcastically styles merely a decorative appearance said mack a picture is primarily a walldecoration it has no right to exist for itself hear hear cried herbert mack lived up to his principles for he always saw nature as a pretty pattern styles an accident look at the blottesque effects you get in watercolor said rocks the last and greatest artthe art to blot quoted levison the second journalist who also posed as a warartist in times of peace when i was in antwerp under villat said rappera fierce little man he washe used to come and correct our canvases with big blotches of burnt sienna and lampblack on the last day of a model rocks would call that a blottesque effect now i flatter myself i can tell you what style is though i dont profess to get it myself style is the art of leaving inor leaving outaccidents finished rocks you see that so well in fortunys work jimmy gets his effects by leaving out all the dead lines of his first sketch said wilfred smith the journalist dont you jimmy so im told said jimmy style is the art of leaving out said herbert they dont leave out the ras pictures in the academy hence the absence of style in the show tut tut tut shop again cried cornpepper despairingly the only chance of progress for art is in neglecting valuesnot from ignorance like the germans but from intention not viewing nature through a bit of black glass like millet or toning down the violets of her shadows but painting real sunlight but you cant really paint sunlight put in matt timidly paints only mud quite so said cornpepper but delacroix said give me mud and ill paint you the skin of venus it depends on what you put round your mud or how you put it on added gurney the only way is to get optics to help you and mix your primaries on the canvas not on the palette with a brights brush i reckon youll be breaking out in spots next laughed rocks that vibriste nonsense has been the ruin of young dircks he used to be quite secondrate but since he crossed the channel he squeezes his tubes on to his canvas and its all streaks like a clowns face paint is neither mud nor sunlight interposed butler authoritatively its paint glory in it dont pretend its silk or wood according to the academy the highest art is to conceal paint shop again groaned cornpepper were an awfully narrow set we artistsalways girding at each others methods though were all trying for the same thing then recalled by butlers frowning face to a sense of his position as chef dcole a position he was not yet prepared to abdicate he added in more conciliatory accents all i object to in the academy is its existence no body of men has the right to say to the public lart cest moi i dont for a moment claim our works better than theirs only that theirs is worse than ours suggested jimmy its all very well but their ideal is smooth things persisted butler vehemently smooth things in paint in life and in afterdinner speeches i should have taken the gold medal in my year and been spared years of grinding misery if i had scraped out the life with a fishshell or a razorblade matts eyes flashed sympathetic admiration at him bother the academy said herbert hastily pass me the jug schools of arts are barracks went on butler his resentment unexhausted they would fuse all talents in one mould and put together what god has put asunder you may teach craft but artnever the idea of setting a subject too said greme who was very proud of his private colorvision they go on a false analogy art cant be got at by a competitive examination it isnt like latin or greek or the use of the globes its the expression of individual temperament and its always such a rotten stilted subject they set for the gold medal i wonder what it is this year strangs at the academy said rapper hell tell you oh confound the academy said herbert crossly something biblical you bet your boots said jimmy it makes the fellows read the bible anyhow but i must really go and meet my wife i heard it was about nebu greme began here shut up greme interrupted herbert isnt it time to sing songs he glanced anxiously at his cousin but that enthusiastic young man was gazing at butler with a hypnotized stare lost in an inward vision of the youthful rebel painting in his stableloft its time to drop shop responded cornpepper sharply ive been trying to get the talk off art for the last halfhour i want to discuss whiskey woman and song whats the difference who wins the gold medal or even the prix de rome thats the last one ever hears of them oh no said rapper all the professors at the beauxarts took the prix de rome did the men with guts inquired cornpepper scathingly as he glared through his monocle at his contradictor did the biggest of all puvis de chavannes now you fellows define style but it never occurs to you that it is simply the perfect handling of your medium whatever it be what makes the decorations of puvis de chavannes so great merely that the gray cool color scheme just suits the stone of the pantheon the decorations of laurens would be finer as easel pictures they make the building look smaller those of chavannes ennoble it give the sense of space and atmosphere the medium forced to yield its bestthat is style there is one glory of silverpoint and another of chalk or pencil fritzs pictures are damn bad because they are in the wrong medium to preserve a chronicle of the time is the function of black and white only by i really must go said jimmy starting up again as a blackandwhite man i preserve a chronicle of the time and it tells me its a quarterpast ten and i have got to meet my wife at the monico at ten oh rot theres lots of time and a dozen hands pushed jimmy into his seat and carrie brought him more whiskey i never could see how you square that with your principles cornpepper argued gurney the gyrator with a thoughtful wrinkle of his elderly face every painters got to do his own time posterity wont want erlesmiths greek gods with gingerbread flesh and sickly seanymphs with wooden limbs a cods head well painted is better than a madonna erlesmith had been his last idolized master before he came to worship at the shrine of cornpepper but theres imagination in erlesmith matt protested deferentially gurney snorted out quintessence of contempt in an indecorous monosyllable busdrivers and balletgirlsthats the modern artists duty to posterity and his duty to his contemporaries is to find the poetry and beauty around em and teach em to see it thats why your chimney on fire in fitzroy street is the picture of the year oh yes matt burst forth in the idiom of grangers its jolly stunning cornpepper made a moue of disgust are we never going to get away from shop he asked desperately what has my chimney to do with the chronicles of the time you chaps have always misunderstood me you all go by what obrien writes of me in the saturday spectator i do wish he wouldnt interpret me i wish hed leave me alone its bad enough to have the papers writing about ones sayings and doings its bad enough to be afraid of your own friends when like levison and wilfred smith they happen to be journalists but to be interpreted in leading articles by obrien is the crowning blow what right has he to meddle with art why the hell doesnt he stick to his last if i painted that chimney instead of sweeping it murmured jimmy do let me go and meet my wife it was because i saw an opportunity for style and for giving an epic sense of london little cornpepper went on fixing jimmy with his basilisk glare i dont care a twopenny damn about posterity or my contemporaries i paint as i do everything elseto please myself we know you dont please anybody else retorted jimmy i must be off well black and white is going to be the art of the future anyhow said butler art is dead in england nobody disputes that of course not said cornpepper paintings a lost art not one of us can touch the old menwatts millais whistler no we none of us can paint but english artll revive through black and white butler maintained its the art of the people i wish i had discovered that in the days when i refused to do it black and white is not the art of the future but the future of art said herbert nothing else pays its surer than anything else admitted gurney and a paper gives you a far wider appeal than a gallery its the only way of elevating the people his eye lit up he was meditating a new departure matt pricked up his ears herbert had not yet repaid him the twentyfive pounds borrowed for a day or two and in any case he felt he must soon be earning money in the stagnation of the picture market of which he heard on every side and on which the talk fell now it was at once comforting and distressing to hear of another source of income black and white had scarcely entered into his thoughts before he looked upon it as a degraded commercial form of arta thing manufactured for the moment in obedience to editorial instructions perhaps if times had changed if editors allowed the artist to express himself through their pages one might think of it otherwise it was too horrible art to order the spirit whose essence was freedom chained to a cashbox it were as welland honesterto be a cobbler like william gregson he shuddered violently remembering his sufferings as a portraitpainter in nova scotia and very resolved to starve sooner than repeat those degrading efforts to please customers i dont talk about it said cornpepper after ten minutes of general tragic anecdotage from which he gathered there was quite a rush into black and whitea subject concerning which both the journalists seemed fully posted i just go on working i dont care whether i sell or not the dealers i hate and despise they have no measure of art but what itll fetch i will have nothing to do with them the world will come to me sooner or later you never hear me grumbling about the market the more i hear of the troubles of you chaps said rapper the more surprised i am that i with nothing like your talents should be the one to get the commissions as if i had any need of the shiners im going to birmingham again next week to do a municipal duffer in his robes even when i studied art in brussels the real reason were coming to black and white broke in the spectacled scotchman is that were all born colorblind the dulness of our surroundings the long centuries of homes without decorations with unbeautiful furniture and crockery have told and now there was a roar of laughter stow that mack cried rapper you cant keep mack off shop cried cornpepper im sick of this talk about principles art life nature realism the decorative the decorative indeed for what is art it isnt studiopictures its its halfpast ten groaned jimmy trying to shake off the detaining hands of his friends wheres sandstone why hasnt he turned up he goes my way i dont know said cornpepper hes been quarrelling with the man who published his lithographs what a quarrelsome beggar he is i believe hes quarrelled with clinch now bytheway where is clinch he said he was coming everybody supposed simultaneously that clinch was drunk and their lighthearted acceptance of the idea jarred upon matt who again became conscious of a curious aloofness from the company from which he seemed as cut off on the moral side as from the despised bourgeoisie on the artistic side what a strange isolation the thought made him feel lonely and thenby reactionstrong even rocks laughed i prefer philip drunk to philip sober he said its the only time he uses drawingroom english how can i sup with my wife at the monico persisted jimmy plaintively the beastly place closes at eleven on sundays oh the english sunday said herbert how can you have art and the english sunday together you talk of the art of the people curtis the real national art of england is oratorio and elijah may not appear on the stage except in evening dress dont talk to me of the middle classes groaned cornpepper they will never be saved till boccaccio is read aloud in every parlor on sunday afternoons dont be an ass teddy said butler youll be moral some day i can get my stockings darned without marrying retorted cornpepper with an irritating laugh and butler reddened angrily he had married a slipshod artistic creature who neglected his shirtbuttons and the thrust rankled my wifes waiting at the monico complained jimmy in a droll singsong oh bother carries just making the coffee replied the host i wont have coffee said jimmy i never mix drinks the coffee came round and with it sandwiches and broke up the talk into duets and trios cornpepper planned a houseboat party for the summer to pick up nautical models and paint the river matts envious consciousness that he was too poor and too obscure to share in these delightful artistic experiences gave him a new and more disagreeable sense of aloofness then the proceedings became musical and remained so till the next morning their refusal to depart before the advent of which the guests melodiously declared as the party was breaking up cornpepper cried oh i was nearly forgetting what said jimmy to offer a prayer no to take up a collection retorted cornpepper his eyeglass gleaming with joy of the mot lilys broken her leg our lily asked greme but she doesnt sit nowshes on the stage i know shes dislocated her ankle and cant dance she never could dance observed herbert how ever did she get an engagement browney put her into his types of english beauty replied cornpepper but shes a good girl all the same and she hasnt got any money ill lead off with five bob in a few minutes two guineas were collected matt giving half a crown which he could ill spare as the men left cornpepper stood at the door exchanging a confidential word with each by jove you didnt say a word during the whole discussion mossop he said as he shook hands with a brownbearded middleaged scotchman whose cranium bulged curiously at the side mossop took his pipe out of his mouth and looked meditatively at the stem if art could be talked it wouldnt want to be painted he said gravely goodnight goodnight old chap ah goodnight wilfred said cornpepper to the journalist understand this evening is private i dont object to your quoting what i or anybody else saidmy opinions are common propertybut damn it if you mention who were here in any of your papers youll never cross my doorstep again you dont mind my frankness goodnight old man goodnight cornpepper said herbert ill let the governor know about those things of yours he added in a low tone thats a good fellow he wont regret taking me up mind you mention im not unreasonableim open to an offer im awfully glad to have made your acquaintance goodnight old chap ah goodnight levison he said shaking hands with the other journalist now please do understand that what passes at my gatherings is strictly confidential if you can earn half a dollar by mentioning who were hererocks is rather a lion just nowim not the man to stand in your light but i wont have what one says in private reported and thats straight goodnight old fellow two oclock boomed from a neighboring steeple goodnight teddy said jimmy the last man to go he added lugubriously ive still got to meet my wife then as he caught sight of himself in the hallrack mirror the gleam in his eye grew droller im going home in my own hat and coat he grumbled im sober it was delicious to breathe the balmy night air after the smoky alcoholic atmosphere of the studio rocks walked a little way with herbert and matt under the silent stars before they came upon a hansom are you also an artist he asked matt i hope to be said matt gravely but its awfully confusing to know whats right they all talk so cleverly and they all seem to be right he was still worried about formul not having discovered that there are only men rocks emitted a short laugh dont you bother your head with theories my boy he said laying his hand kindly on matts shoulder you just paint every man does what he can and runs down what he cant after all art is very old there are no great sensational reforms left like wests discarding the toga for the clothes of the period the plein air school is this centurys contribution after that there can only be permutations and combinations of the old what is new in the azure art gallery is not good and what is good is not new cest fini said herbert thats what people always say till genius comes along my belief is going by literature and music that painting hasnt said its last word it may come back to its first admitted rocks laughing things go in cycles at present the last word of art is azure but there are azure shadows said matt yes sunshine on a yellow sand gives a suspicion of blue and violet where the yellow light is cut off but you exaggerate it and call that a revolution yes but this intensified violet made on your canvas out of light pigments does produce the illusion of sunlight argued matt and to my mind it doesnt falsify nature or values one bit because in bright sunlight the eye really sees the dazzle not the values perhaps you young men see the new ultrashades at the end of the spectrum said rocks a little annoyed to find matt restive under his patronizing geniality apelles had only four colors but his reputation has survived it is the craze for novelty that makes these fads catch on on the contrary retorted matt hotly people are so accustomed to the false they have no eyes for the true its the old fable of the man with the pig under his cloak i read somewhere that in sir joshuas day it was the convention to paint portraits with hats under their arm and that sir joshua having to paint a man with his hat on automatically put a second hat under his arm if he hadnt found it out i dont believe the public would have and werent the men laughed at in france though now theyre thrown in the teeth of the impressionists its always the same talethe revolutionary is always wrong till hes right treason never prospers whats the reason when tis successful tis no longer treason truth and lightthats the right formula of landscapepainting herbert laughed my stars matt he cried gayly thats the longest speech ive ever heard you make is cornpeppers whiskey so much better than mine it was perhaps not so much the whiskey as the reaction after the long respectful selfrepression of the evening but rocks caught fire in his turn revolution he cried scornfully doing things literally by halvestheres a revolution theres a revelation for you the new art if the modern young man cant draw colors the thing and if hes got no sense of color color is vulgar and even if he doesnt offend my sense of line by figures that couldnt stand and limbs that dont fit on he wont finish his work he leaves it halfcooked to show his chic to take it further would be academic its mere notes for pictures not pictures and even at that half the ideas come from paris like our ladies gowns if you ran over there as often as i do you could put your finger on most of these azure fellows inspirations if they would only search like the french if they would only really imitate their monet thats a real worker for youhow he slaves at his haystacks more science than art to my thinking but how he searches these chaps are such dwarfs think of leonardo think of raphael think of milletreal men with big brains and big souls no this azure art clubs a set of bounders and bad draughtsmen theres too much mutual admiration it prevents men getting on theyll find themselves stranded with a halftalent and hasnt butler got a big soul cried matt boiling over and hasnt cornpepper got a big brain cornpepperoh but this is shop again hes a good little chap at bottom but hes succeeding too young and in rockss hearty guffaw the stormclouds rolled away you mustnt fancy i agree with him altogether mr rocks said matt simmering down in his turn about the morality of art now isnt there ah theres the methodist parson again interrupted herbert laughing hang it all man youre not a virgin are you no of course not faltered matt mendaciously he went on in haste theres a cab no i hate fourwheelers said herbert then why the devil do you always talk such rot hansom they dont seem as united as the papers make out anyway said matt in shamefaced evasion he was ashamed of the lie and ashamed of its not being true no theres no esprit de corps among artists returned rocks people always imagine there are schools but in london theres only the camaraderie of success and the camaraderie of unsuccess goodnight cant we give you a lift said herbert no thanks im successful rejoined rocks and went off chuckling i wish i was herbert grumbled to matt fancy not being able to join that houseboat party but to be stuck down in town by the old gentleman to paint nebuchadnezzar i wish i was you matt matt was on the point of consoling him by confessing he was on the brink of ruin but that would have seemed like dunning a friend to whom he owed so much for the twentyfive pounds so he postponed the inevitable explanation chapter vi the outcast it was midsummer and everybody who was anybody was pent in the sweltering city the sort of weather to make one want to be a figuremodel herbert said wearily as he flicked finically at daniel before nebuchadnezzar now well on its way to completion but it seems to suit the old gentleman you might laugh matt im too languid myself matt did not reply he was leaning against the marble mantelpiece pale and perspiring what do you think is his latest move pursued herbert though thats rather a bull for the mischief is that he refuses to go on our annual autumn jaunt abroad lest it should interfere with daniel and nebby however i am to have a horse of my own and thats some consolation talking of horses how do you like nebbys left leg you see ive repainted it as you marked it he got up walked backward and surveyed the picture approvingly brush in hand by jove its coming on splendidly i could imagine i was in the palace there is something in following nature after all the creative part lies in the invention and color whats the matter with you this morning matt you dont say a word are you sunstruck or moonstruck both said matt with a ghastly smile why whats up herbert scrutinized his cousins face for the first time matt looked towards the model you know his english is limited herbert remarked reassuringly unless you are bent on talking arabic but matt still hesitated at last as in desperation he extracted a letter from his breastpocket and tendered it to herbert who took it wonderingly cast a glance at it and frowned the scoundrel he said how dare he send it in so soon i shall never recommend him to anybody again it isnt soon corrected matt its more than three months youre not going to take any notice of him yet oh i must oh nonsense why the shock would drive him silly he only sends it in as a matter of form i dont like not to pay all right said herbert sulkily only youll spoil the market for us poor devils whore not crsuses thats all but dont give him the fifteen guineas at once give him five on account matt struggled with himself i cant even do that he faltered at last unless you can manage to pay me something oh by jove said herbert whistling lugubriously id forgotten you were among my creditors but im stonybroke just now so the old scoundrel will have to wait after all ha ha ha when do you expect to be flush again i suppose you draw interest on bonds or something all americans do ii dont said matt his head drooping shamestricken then with the courage of despair he burst out ive only got tenpence in the world thats a fact herbert gave a shrill whistle of surprise and dismay and let himself drop upon his paintingstool here go and play a little haroun al raschid he called over to the model and nebuchadnezzar shedding his purpureal splendors cantered joyously downstairs now then he said sternly what in the devil have you been up to my methodist parson gambling horseracing women matt shook his head a wan smile struggling with his shamefaced expression he already felt happierthe false atmosphere in which he had moved was dissipated forever ive never had any money to lose he confessed i only saved up fifty or sixty pounds to study in london for a year and now its all goneunless you can manage to repay me the twentyfive pounds well of all the cried herbert and did not finish the mysterious phrase he leaned his elbows on his knees and supporting his face upon his palms stared severely at his cousin so this is the man who thinks art should be moral he said half musingly half indignantly to go and let us all think you were a capitalist and to let me in for borrowing money of a man who was practically a pauper why i must have taken almost your last penny matt flushing afresh under his reproachful gaze did not attempt to deny it well if thats your idea of cousinly behavior or even decent behavior said herbert witheringly ii didnt mean to deceive you matt stammered apologetically you all took it for granted i was welltodo all i said was i had money enough to go along with and so i thought i had yes but when i asked you for the pony you consented at once i gave you an opportunity to explain but instead of that you intensified the original false impression matt was silent and now youve put me into the wretched position of owing money which i cant pay to a poor relation from whom i never would have borrowed it had he been frank and truthful now both were silent meditating the painful situation then youve got no money at all said herbert at last in stern accents in which a note of astonishment still lingered matt shook his head his throat felt parched unless you can pay me he murmured herberts face softened his tones became sympathetic then what are you going to do he asked anxiously matt was touched by the transition from reproach to solicitude oh i shall manage somehow he said huskily i dont want to worry youyouve always been very good to me yes thats all very well but suppose you starve said herbert sharply oh i shall find something to do said matt in fact ive already done some illustrations for the christian home though they havent paid yet i wouldnt have told you if it hadnt been for this tailors bill confound him cried herbert savagely ill never recommend him another customer as long as i live he started promenading the studio angrily muttering maledictions against the snip as the source of all the mischief what a pity the governor wont touch a new mans work he said pausing oh id rather not trouble him said matt shrinking from a supplementary explanation with the vandyke beard herbert resumed his promenade with knitted brow i wonder if drcker would take them if you did seapieces oh please dont worry pleaded matt concerned at his cousins anxiety i dare say i shall fall on my feet yes but while falling tenpence isnt enough to fall with you dont owe any money into the bargain i hope matt turned red three weeks rent he murmured how much is that matt shrank weakly from shredding his last rag of dignity not much he said she hasnt said anything yet i always paid her so regularly but i dont see any reason to despair it looks as if i can make my bread and cheese by black and white they were all agreed that that was the most paying kind of art you remember that night at cornpeppers yes i remember said herbert curtly but i cant let you go away with tenpence in your pocket i wonder if ive got anything he drew a handful of silver and copper coins out of his trouserspocket eight and fourpence halfpenny he announced dolefully and i shall want seven for haroun al raschid this evening i told you i was stonybroke i suppose its no use offering you one and fourpence halfpenny no then youd have nothing said matt dont bother oh but i must bother i wish i knew how to raise a little cash for you to keep you going till you get work the grave anxiety of his tones troubled matt sympathetically he was pained to see herbert so distressed suddenly his eyes fell on herberts battalion of boots ranged against the wallbrown boots black boots patent boots riding boots shoes slippersand a wild impish idea flew into his brain breathing malicious suggestion and even kindling a flash of resentment why should not herbert sell some of those serried boots if he was really in earnest but the impish idea was extruded in a moment it savored of ungenerous cynicism and in so far as it meditated diminishing herberts wardrobe touched indecency it was impossible to imagine herbert with only a single pair of breeches or without subvarieties of ornamental shoes he moved in a large atmosphere of discriminate waistcoats and superfluous neckties ill give you an introduction to drcker if you like said herbert i dare say you have some little things by you iive already been to drcker matt admitted a fellow at graingers told me about him but he wont look at my work there was another embarrassing pause matts eyes wandered distractedly towards herberts boots the spotless battalion fascinated him the buttons winked maliciously how about portraits said herbert suddenly i thought you did portraits in nova scotia was that alsowas that ertrue matt did not at once answer it had suddenly occurred to him that there was probably another battalion of boots in herberts dressingroom when herberts question at last penetrated to his consciousness he replied with a start oh yes perhaps i may get sitters here too the only thing that really worries me is that bill oh well if thats all you can make your mind easy he cant touch you youve no money herbert laughed gleefully itll serve him right the scoundrel but he can put me in prison said matt blanching at the mere idea and that i could never survive herberts laugh became more boisterous oh you innocent he gasped were not living in the dark ages a man without a farthing is the king of creation nothing can touch him oh but they put people in prison for debt in nova scotia said matt surprised really ejaculated herbert surprised in his turn well i had no idea the country was so uncivilized as that no dont funk and even suppose you were put into quod for debt what then why debt is the breath of the artistic nostril read your bankruptcy court daily in your paper and cheer up dye hear why should you take other peoples worries on your shoulders other peoples quoth matt puzzled yes the worry is for the tailor who cant get his money not for you explained herbert with the gay smile that showed his white teeth i must pay him matt repeated stolidly and lunch coming up he took himself off in spite of every protest now that herbert knew him in his true colors his pride would not endure sitting as a pauper at the midday banquet though he had eaten nothing all day except a halfpenny roll he saw haroun al raschid in the street luxuriating in the sultry sunshine and sent him up to luncheon then dragged himself along the hot pavements to his back room brightened now with unsaleable sketches and threw himself upon the little iron bed and abandoned himself to bitter reflection why indeed could he not take life as lightly as the artistic temperament demanded he had already tried other dealers than drcker with as little success the irishman at graingers was wont to boast that he always sold his work by pawning it matt had essayed to imitate him speculating the outlay for a gold frame but either his face betrayed him to the pawnbrokers or his picture and it eventually went for less than the price of the frame ando vanity of resolutions and idealshis horror at doing art to order had dwindled daily in the actual imminence of starvation in the impossibility of sending any further subsidies to his family he had broached to other students his desire to get on this or that paper but could gain no sympathetic information from them except that they had already refused the positions he coveted on the strength of some specimens sent by post he had been permitted to illustrate five short stories for the christian home but only two had yet been published and none had yet been paid for and so the dregs of his savings had dripped away slowly slowly like honey from an inverted pot more and more slowly the less there remained till only twenty drops for he had come down to counting in halfpennies divided him from starvation the arrears of rent had been an agony more gnawing than that at his stomach and now this tailors bill had come as the crowning catastrophe yet none of his bitterness was for herbert despite the impish suggestions of the buttons he did not even blame himself much in a sense he had had value for his money he had bought experience if not quite of the kind for which he had saved up his dollars but for those frightful fifteen guineas he might have weathered starvationpoint even though by the practice of a form of art he had not contemplated to pawn or sell the unfortunate clothes would be but to cut himself off from gentility without surmounting the crisis his hopeless reverie was interrupted by a tap at the door and the landlady entered bearing a letter he jumped up from the bed in excitementit must be his check for the drawings but the letter bore an american stamp and was in billys writing and he tore it open fearful of new evils dear matti write not because there is anything fresh but because there isnt life here is so dreary and monotonous i can no longer endure it it isnt my health for that is better and the fits are very rare now thank god but sometimes i think i shall go mad or cut my throat if something doesnt happen dont you think i could come over and stay with you youve seen so much of the world and always enjoyed yourself and i have always been tied down to one wretched little village the people are so dismally religious and between you and me i am losing faith in everything the more i think of it and how bad the good people are deacon hailey and ruth have quarrelled and she has gone away to the states she came to see us before she leftshe is just lovelyi like to picture her before me i should not be much extra expense dear matt because you could deduct something from the amount you are soon going to send us monthly i have mentioned this to abner and he is willing i am very little use here in the fields and in london i might perhaps earn money by writing i feel i have it in me to write tales i have already written one called the whale hunters and another called in the burning desert i do so long to be famous we should be a pair dear matt do you think you could get these tales printed in a paper i should not want money at first i did not like to send them to you without asking as the postage would be heavy and the winter has been so unusually protracted we are delayed with the crops do please send me some books if you can i have read everything in the school library twice over novels and books of travel are what i like best the last we heard from halifax was that mother was less violent do write and say i may come and if you can let me have the fare i will repay you out of my tales abner and harriet send their love and so do all the boys and girls amy is getting quite podgy and with the same from me i remain your affectionate brother billy psdont you think william strang would look fine on the cover of a book matt suddenly felt faint and dizzy raising his eyes he perceived that the landlady had not gone that she was effervescing with unuttered speech i am very sorry mrs lipchild he said i thought that your rent would have been in this letter the lank elderly woman looked grieved lor bless you sir said she im not worryin about the rent dont i know an honest face when i see it us landladies are always made out so bad were always stealin the lodgers provisions and what not and we cant speak proper i should like to see a book written on the other side why last year i had an old maid in this very roomshe took her meals here and said i wasnt to charge for attendance because shed be always out but bless me if the bell didnt go tinkelytinkely every minute like an alarmclock gone wrong in its inside believe me mr strang it isnt the lodgers as is always taken in ive often wished my son was a writer instead of an artist id get him to write the book your son is an artist said matt in astonishment yes mr strang though not near so clever as you i could show you some of his work if you didnt mind oh i should like to see it said matt half amused at this unexpected interlude though his temples throbbed with a shooting pain would you mind comin down into the parlor sir with pleasure said matt he followed his landlady down the narrow stairs into the musty little room resplendent with oleographs and a gilt mirror and two fruitshades there said mrs lipchild proudly me and my husband in uniform matt surveyed the large colored presentments of mr and mrs lipchild in their oval mounts further astonished to discover that his landlord was a policeman what did he do them with asked matt rather puzzled with his own hand replied the proud mother they were taken quite plain but he colored them lifelike as you see they would have charged half a crown more each but for a shilling he bought a book telling him how to do it himself my cousin bob who is in the postoffice said he ought to be an artist but i wouldnt let him give up his place at brown illustration lor bless you sir said she im not worryin about the rent brothers hes in the grocery department and earnin good money and ive seen such a heap of artists sittin on the pavement with the risk any moment of the rain washin all the pictures out dont you think i was right sir quite right said matt heartily mrs lipchild thereupon produced a bottle of brandy and what she called a seedycake from a cupboard under a sideboard and insisted on matts partaking of the same to refuse would pain her to accept would refresh him so he accepted in the conversation which ensued it transpired that mrs lipchilds daughter was about to marry a young man from brown brothers haberdashery department that the young couple were now furnishing and that it had occurred to mrs lipchild that they might get their parlor pictures from matt instead of from a shop if they could get them any cheaper so matt and his art patroness remounted again to the bedroom studio and haggled over prices mrs lipchild pointing out that his pictures were far inferior to shop pictures not only by their unsympathetic subjects but by their absence of frames and glass and that she could get much bigger sizes than any of his for five shillings apiece but as it came to be understood that ready money would not be required and that the price was to be reckoned off the rent mrs lipchild ultimately departed in possession of a months worth of picturessix of the prettiest landscapes and ladies in the collection with rappers library thrown in the poetic streetscenes she scorned much to matts relief for he set no value on the earlier nova scotian work she had carried off this was matts first sale of pictures in the great metropolis of art considerably exhilarated by the change in his fortunes and revived by the brandy and the seedycake he reviewed the situation again proof even against billys letter which he put by for later consideration he found himself actually smiling for a phrase of cornpeppers kept vibrating in his brainarts neither moral nor immoral any more than its lunar or calendar mrs lipchilds last words had been very well well reckon it a month and he wondered whimsically whether the month was to be lunar or calendar under the impulse of these gayer sentiments he resolved to raise money by pawning whatever he could part with and by persisting in the search for an adventurous dealer and reflecting that after all the tailor would be satisfied with an instalment he wound himself up to the pitch of applying to herbert by letter though he could not bring himself to a verbal request my dear herberti am sorry to bother you again but if you could let me have only five guineas to offer the tailor i should be very grateful i hope soon to find work or sell some things and you will be pleased to hear that i have got over the difficulty with the rentat least for the moment yours sincerely matt strang psdont put yourself out if you cannot you have been very kind to me and i shall never forget it i dare say i shall pull through somehow matt carried this request to the pillarbox through the stuffy splendor of a summer night in holborn back streets as he heard the slight thud of the letter in the box he had a sense of something achieved and had no compunction in spending one of his nine remaining pennies on his supper of baked fagot in a muggy porkbutchers shop nightmare followed by a giddy uprising with furred tongue and aching forehead was the sequel of this devilmaycare diet and early in the afternoon the nightmare seemed to resume its riot in the guise of a reply from herbert dear mattwhat in the name of all that is unholy made you send that letter to my house instead of to the club theres been a devil of a row the old gentleman opened the letter he pretends he did so without noticing as it came mixed up with his and so few come for me to the house when i got down to breakfast the mater was in tears and the old gentleman in blazes of course hed misread it altogetherimagined you wanted to borrow money instead of to get it back isnt it comical its almost an idea for a farce for our dramatic society and insisted you had been draining me all along you did write you were sorry to bother me again you old duffer of course i did my best to dispel the misconception but it was no use my swearing till all was blue that this was the first application he wouldnt believe a word of it he said he had had his suspicions all along and he called the mater to witness that the first time he saw you in the shop he said you were a rogue and at last the mater whod been standing up for youi never thought she had so much backbone of her ownwas converted and confessed with tears that you had been here pretty nigh every day and swore you should never set foot here again and the old gentleman dilated on the pretty return you had made for his kindness sucking his boys blood he called it in an unusual burst of poetry and he likewise offered some general observations on the comparative keenness of a serpents tooth and ingratitude and thats how it stands theres nothing to be done i fear but to let the thing blow overhell cool down after a time meanwhile you will have to write to me at the club if you want to meet me i am awfully sorry as i enjoyed your visits immensely do let me know if i can do anything for you im in a frightful financial mess but i might give you introductions here or there i know chaps on papers and that sort of thing i am sure you have sufficient talent to get alongand you can snap your fingers at creditors as you havent got anything they can seize and can flit any day you like i wish i was you with every good wish yours always herbert strang matt took this letter more stoically than he would have predicted he even grinned like a red indian at the stake in truth he was already so prostrated by illness hunger and above all by the heat that there was nothing left in him to be prostrated he crawled out soon after the receipt of the letter and recklessly bought a halfpenny currant loaf which he washed down with water chapter vii towards the deeps the summer rolled heavily along bringing strange new experiences to matt strang and strange glimpses of other artworlds than herberts for he did not starve though herbert had gone quite out of his life and he had none with whom to exchange the thoughts of youth two pounds ten shillings lent on his dresssuit staved off hunger and his tailor who got the pounds till by the aid of the landladys sons book he found out how to tint photographs and earned sixpences and shillings by coloring cartesdevisite and cabinets for cheap touting photographers censoriously critical and given to refusing the work of hours byandby the christian home took him to its hearth situate at the summit of a cobwebbed ramshackle staircase in bolt court and paid him seven and sixpence for a halfpage illustration of an unworldly serial payday was a delightful weekly emotion the staff adjourning to a publichouse in fleet street to drink one anothers health and their own damnation matt was forced to join them because dick gattel the puffyfaced author of the spiritual romance he was illustrating a godly atonement insisted on standing treat declaring with odd oaths that hed never been so well interpreted before by any blooming papersmudger he also initiated matt into the secrets of his craft summing up in a formula the experience of a quarter of a century of storywriting emotion for the penny papers excitement for the halfpenny selfsacrifice for the religious strange impecunious beings gathered in this publichouse or outside it uncouth unclean unshaven many had drifted down from society from the universities from the army from the navy with reserve forces from india and america the flotsam of lifes wreckage and they consoled themselves by babbling of the seamy side of the successful rolling under their tongues the money these others were making and parading a confident familiarity with their doings and their passbooks matt shuddered at the thought that he might one day become even as thesethe damnedbeforedeath there was another artist on the staffa thickset german whose wife was wont to waylay him on payday and who always wrote on professional paper girdled with his own designs in proof of his prowess and expressive of his willingness to undertake washdrawings linedrawings colorwork or lithography at reasonable rates and with prompt deliveries through this german who was goodnatured after his second glass matt procured extra employment in a comicpicture factory managed by a solemn snuffy scotchman who selected from old comic papers the jokes that were to be illustrated by his hands and signing the sketches with his own name peddled them in the offices of new comic papers matt was paid half a crown per sketch and his employer from four to five shillings but when the young man tried to send original jokes and sketches direct to these papers he got only the same two and sixpence for the few things they accepted one editor whose pages bristled with balletgirls took the trouble to explain to him that the presence of a clergyman in a sketch was a disqualification as any attack on the church would be distasteful to his public from another the merry miracle whose proprietor was a philanthropist a member of the school board and a candidate for parliament he received a prospectus instructing him to eschew crosshatching solid black linework and society figures in favor of roughandtumble farce in bold outline the more sober of the comic papers had settled staffs and settled jokes and newcomers were not welcomed not that matts jokes were very good labored verbal oddities for the most part intellectual quips and cranks which he was quite aware lacked the true humorous insight of jimmy raven upon whom he modelled himself feeling no firsthand impulse humor indeed was not his vocation when he saw the world through jimmys eyes he was tickled yet fortified as one set face to face with the prose of the real and finding it genial but he could not see it like this himself his was a world of beauty set over a strange disquieting substratum of ugliness from which it were best to avert ones eyes and which perhaps existed only as something to aspire away from jimmy raven had published a sketchbook of beggars which matt strang had found vastly entertaining and yet matt strang saw rather the tragedy of beggars than their humor and this tragedy seemed to him outside the realm of art it was only their occasional picturesqueness that attracted his artistic interest at this period of his development and all the figures of his socalled comic sketches were either pretty or picturesque he studied extensively in the streets notebook in hand fearful of losing the subtleties of nature through his inability to afford even the cheap casual models of his first days in london and training himself to catch the salient points of character or movement at first glance probably no artist ever made comic pictures so seriously as matt strang with such scrupulous backgrounds in the which when they were done in wash he strove with entirely unappreciated thoroughness by careful adjustment of values to make his black and white yield veracious coloreffects when the drawings were accepted they came out so reduced and so badly reproduced that the subtleties were blurred away and the values quite transmuted woodengraving falsified the lines or photography the color and thus their appearance in print was as much a pain as a pleasure matts redemption from comic journalism was partly due to the prosperity of the proprietor of the comicpicture factory who started a seriousart department where matt found less uncongenial work in painting figures into the landscapes of his less competent fellowworkmen this gradually opened up to his astonished eyes a new section of the trade he saw one of these landscapes near kings cross resplendent in a gorgeous gold frame and marked original oilpaintingtwo guineas only and another in a poor neighborhood marked watercolor handpainteda bargain and he perceived that he had been flying too high in his early attempts to approach dealers of the type of drcker henceforward he haunted furniture dealers pictureframe makers and artists colormen and thus he occasionally obtained half a sovereign to despatch to his tailor his drawings in the christian home attracted the attention of the editor of the working man and matt was commissioned to accompany a journalist through the east end to expose the evils of sweating the working man was owned by a syndicate and matt had to settle terms with the manager a truculent gentleman with a double chin and a double watchchain who agreed to give him five shillings a sketch matt did several sketches for each article and the pathetic series caused a great stir and much correspondence but at the end of the monthwhen poor matt who had already nearly starved himself for his tailors sake was expecting a goodly check to send to abner preephe received only a quarter of what he had bargained for he went to the editor who referred him to the manager who insisted the terms were five shillings for the illustration of a single article you must remember too what a lift we are giving you with our big circulation concluded the manager his double watchchain heaving pompously on his abdomen it is not every young man who gets such a chance of showing what he can do youre a set of damned scoundrels cried matt with an access of ancient rage and had wellnigh torn up the check and thrown it in the managers face when his later chastened self plucked at his coattails and bade him begone with it who so helpless as the blackandwhite artist his work poorly paid and reproduced again and again without his control his very originals taken from him and sometimes sold at a profit it was not a happy time for matt this period of spiritless work by day and spiritless study by night his soul chafing alike against the degradations of life and the routine of school for what an actuality had he exchanged his dreams yet he had no option the tailor must be paid his family must be helped and to these two ends moreover he himself must exist but the friction of ideals and realities left him irritable and highstrung and even when towards the autumn he won his way into the ladies weekly at a guinea an illustration he lost his work by not concealing his contempt for the art editor a pragmatic person absolutely dead to art but excessively fastidious about the drawings which he refused whenever there was time for alterations this is feeble but were pressed for time was his encouraging apology to the artist for accepting his work and ill put it into the hands of a competent engraver his first selfrevelation to matt was his complaint about some rough shadows on the borders of a sketch i wish you would bear in mind mr strang that we have to pay as much per inch for the reproduction of those blotches as for the most finished work but it was not till the old lady as the other artists called the art editor of the ladies weekly behind his back had insisted on his dressing his figures better that matt lost control of his tongue and retorted i draw pictures not fashionplates in afterremorse he would have been glad to get fashionplates to do he replaced the lost work by returning to phototinting though he now obtained more important work on enlarged photographs which he colored in oil at three and six apiece managing to do two or three a day while the light held without interfering with his black and white which could be done at night by which means he scraped together enough to pay off the tailor in full and to send his promised contribution home together with seven fourpenny halfpenny notable novels to reconcile billy to his narrow existence and then with these burdens thrown off his idealism resurged again for beneath the placid everyday exterior of this homely young man who trudged up foul staircases portfolio under arm or danced attendance on smug hless photographers smoking twopenny cigars a volcanic fire burned and the thought of his precious youth wasted and abraded in this inartistic artdrudgery under the yoke of vulgar souls was a dull haunting torment his qualms of selfdistrust vanished under the pressure of obstacles and the measure of his aversion from joyless commercial art became to him the measure of his genius one gray windy forenoon of late autumn he had stopped to take a mental sketch of a strangely attired woman who was listening to a salvation army exhortation a woman who was a dab of color upon the dreary day below an enormous white hat with a recumbent ostrich feather and a broad brim with an upward slant tied under the chin with black bands shone through a black veil a glorious ovalshaped dark face with flashing eyes full red lips large shapely ears and raven hair curling low over the forehead she wore a black halfmasculine jacket with big motherofpearl buttons and a yellow bow that was awry and by a shapely hand cased in a white glove with three black stripes she held the skirts of a slaty gown clear of the mud while matt was whimsically wondering what the editor of the christian home would say to a sketch of her in his staid organ he instinctively noted the other romantic touches about the scene ineffably grimy though the roadway was to the inartistic eye flanked on one side by a coal office with a bleareyed old man at the window and on the other by a canal running lengthwise there were fresh country faces among the girlsoldiers and among the men was an exheathen in a turban a flaring paisley shawl flowing robes and sandals bearing aloft a red flag with a blue border and a central yellow star around which ran the words blood and fire and while his eye selected the picturesque points the whole scene passed half insensibly into his subconsciousness as into a camera to be developed in afteryearsthe grotesque snagtoothed hags in the crowd the collarless men with the air of being connected with the canal one of them with a mephistophelian red tuft on his chin the icecream stall at the corner where a postman a baby of three and an urchin with his collar paradoxically up against the cold were licking green glasses and then a buxom workgirl with a tambourine began to hold forth pouring out breathless sentences all running into one another clutching her inspiration tight lest it should escape her and repeating herself endlessly rather than pause for a moment only the blood of christ can save only the blood of christ has saved only the blood of christ will save and her fellowsoldiers quivering with unction punctuated her shapeless periods with soulwrung ejaculations ah yes bless her glory to god you may try earthly pleasures you may go to the theaytre she gasped but it brings no peace nothing brings peace but the rock but the lamb hallelujah but the oldest of all religions proved over and over again christianity tried in the furnace any day you may die no one knows the end nows the time dont put it off come are you prepared once i had bad companions aaah groaned a melodramatic brother with folded arms but i gave them up glory in a great sob of relief from all the palpitating figures matt began to forget the visual aspects of the scene the infectious emotion of the girl and her comrades gained upon him what she was saying left no dint on his mindto her dogmas he was become indifferent but her earnestness thrilled him her impassioned ignorance flashed upon him a clearer sense of baseness hollowness insincere falling away from the ideals that had sailed with him to england glorifying the noisome steerage turning his head he saw tears rolling down the dark passionate face of his dashing neighbor and he hurried away shaken and troubled pursued by the cacophonous melody into which the street congregation had broken what was the point of his life what had he become at graingers there were fellows who looked to art as an escape from some worsepaid calling that was not had never been his idea to him art was an end in itself he was of those who live to paint not paint to live even in his boyish days when the vendibility of pictures first came within his ken the money had always seemed to him a pleasant byproduct not a motive and now instead of pouring out on canvas all that effervescence of youthful poetry that flooded his soul he was coloring photographs and illustrating foolish stories for foolish editors in contravention of all his own ideas of what illustrations should be why even in nova scotia he had painted from the life in his lowest days he had decorated furniture at his own pleasure oh it was sordid unworthy humiliating he would give it all up if he could not pursue art at least he would not degrade it thanks to his novascotian training his good right hand could do more than wield the brush better to earn bread and water for himself and his family by some honest craft till such time as honest art came within his means rather an honest artisan than a dishonest artist and while he was still hot with the impulse he looked through the advertisement columns of the clerkenwell chronicle and answered three demands one for a joiner another for a sugarboiler and the third for a harnesscleaner the sugarboiling firm alone answered and he was asked to call he stated that he had had considerable experience of the manufacture in nova scotia but a brief conversation convinced the manager that the applicant knew nothing of scientific sugarboiling with its elaborate engines and differentiation of labor but matts sober respectable appearance and his conviction of his capacity stood him in good stead and he was given a fortnights trial at eighteen shillings a week with a prospect of rising to forty in his confidence of mastering the easy detail and to clinch his resolution he wrote to his art patrons throwing up his position in each establishment with due form and superfluous sarcasm and one happy morning soon after sunrise repaired to the factory with a more buoyant tread than had been his since the memorable day when he crossed the great bridge which led to the heart of all the splendors the fortnights end found him spiritually seared and physically scalded the depressing society of the british workingman the everpresent contrast of the blank building with the free forest in which he had made sugar in his boyhood how happy his boyhood seemed now and the overflowing contents of the seething boilers demonstrated to him daily that he had made a mistake he might have stayed on nevertheless but the dread that an accidental scald on the hand might permanently injure his power with the brush made the trial fortnight his last he scanned the advertisement columns again with no suspicion of what now awaited him he had been misled by the comparative facility with which he had found work hitherto he was now destined to reexperiencefar more poignantly than in new brunswickthe longdrawn agony of unemployment the sickness of hope deferred to bruise himself against the ruthless indifference of an overstaffed nation to see and hear the blind deaf forces of the social machine grind out happiness for all but him at first he did not mind getting no replies except for the waste of stamps for he took feverish advantage of the hours of daylight thus left free for art but as day followed day and week followed week the perturbation of his soul and the weakness of his body enfeebled by hunger and cold made painting difficult and he had not even the capital to expend on canvas broken in health and pride he applied again for his old work prepared even to tint cartesdevisite but his place had been filled up the stream of human life had flowed on as if he had never been the work he had got was the only work in london open to a man in his position and this work he had thrown away one of the papers he had so imprudently quarrelled with was willing to take him on again but at half the price subdued as he was a pride he afterwards felt to have been insane spurred him to refuse he fancied he could get such terms from a score of other papers but he was mistaken in truth black and white was no more his mtier than humor the rush into black and white of which he had first heard at cornpeppers had filled the ranks with abler men or of older standing with a better appreciation of the market and of how to draw for reproduction by the new processes just coming up and he had yet to learn also that the world went very well without him that it had no need for him either as artist or artisan craftsman or clerk that every hole had its peg round or square and that he was of no more account in the surging life of london than the fallen leaves blown about the bleak squares he earned a few odd shillings now and then for his old pictures by persuading some small skinflint dealer to cheat him and that was all once he was cruelly tantalizeda fivepound commission to copy a national gallery picture being dangled before him only to be withdrawn he parted with all but the barest necessitieswith the fashionable morning suit with his pistol with the gregson boots his only luxury was the engraving of the angelus which he had retained because nobody offered more than eighteenpence for it the bulk of the money thus raised was remitted to abner preep as promised the rest went to pay mrs lipchild himself he so stinted that often when he went to graingers which he had fortunately prepaid he took care to arrive first not only because of the warmth but because the girl students whose class preceded his left stale crusts lying about whose crumb had been used up on their charcoal drawings to such straits may a man sink in a few weeks though he sinks slowly for each week is a year to him but outwardly he preserved dignity brushing his one suit scrupulously and glad that owing to his interlude of fashionable tailoring it was still in good condition for the vision of the lost mortals was ever before his eyes and he foresaw that without a decent appearance he would not be able to grasp an opportunity even when it came but would be driven down to the deeps to join the damned souls outside that fleet street publichouse within which the happier staff of the christian home ushered in the sabbath with beer and the more london refused him the more his consciousness of power grew as he tramped the teeming streets in quest of a job or a customer a thousand ideas for great pictures jostled in his sick brain a thousand fine imaginings took form and shape in beautiful colorharmonies and majestic groupings in the ecstatic frenzy of moments of hysterical revolt against the blind forces closing in upon him like a tomb to shut him out forever from the sunlight he grew titanic to his own thought capable of masterpieces in any and every kind of artgreat heroic frescos like michael angelos great homely pictures like those of the dutch great classic canvases like raphaels great portraits like rembrandts great landscapes like turners great modern streetpieces like cornpeppers great medival romances like erlesmiths not to say great new pictures that should found the school of strang combining all the best points of all the schools the ancient poetry with the modern realism nay even literary impulses mingled with artistic in these spasms of nebulous emotion his immature genius not having yet grasped the limitations of the paintable good god what did he ask not the voluptuous round of the young men whose elegant silhouettes standing out against the black silent night from the warm lighted windows of great houses athrob with joyous music filled him with a mad bitterness not the soft roseleaf languors of the beautiful white women who passed in shimmering silks and laces from gleaming spickandspan carriages under canvas awnings over purple carpets amid spruce obsequious footmen not the selfish joys of these radiant shadows dancing their way to dusty oblivion to be trodden under foot by the generations over which he would shine as a star serene immortal but bread and water and a little money for models and properties and a toplight straight in touch with heaven and a few pounds to send home to his kith and kin but to paint to paint to joy in conception and to glory in difficult execution to express the poetry of the ideal through real flesh and real shadows and real foliage and find a rapturous agony in the search for perfection to paint to paint to exult fiercely in the passing of faces with their pathos and their tragedy to catch a smile on a childs face and the grace of a girls movement and the passion in the eyes of a woman to watch the sunrise consecrating tiles and chimneys or the river mirroring a thousand nightlights glide on glorifying its own uncleanness to express the intense stimulus of the wonderful city resonant with the tireless tread of millions of feet vibrant with the swirl of perpetual currents of traffic pulsating with the rough music of humanityroaring markets shrilling trains panting steamships to record in pigment not only the romance of his dreams or the glamour of the dead past but the poetry of the quickthe rich full life of the town the restless day and the feverish night with its mysterious perspectives of fitful gleams to paint to paint anything everything for the joy of eternalizing the transient beauty that lurked everywherein the shimmer of a sunlit puddle in the starry heaven in the motions of barefoot children dancing to a barrelorgan in the scarlet passing of soldiers in the play of light on the fish in a hucksters barrow in the shadowy aisles of city churches throbbing with organ diapasons oh the joy of life oh the joy of art that expressed the joy of life yes but in the absence of a few bits of metal neither joy nor art nor even life could be his he must die be swept off from among the surging crowds of which he was an unnoticed unit and no one would ever know what mighty things he had dreamed and suffered in his little span of years every supper eaten by radiant couples at richly lit restaurants would have nourished him for weeks nor did it diminish the bitter socialistic sentiment this reflection caused him to remember that he himself had fared as wantonly once and again at least he had earned his money what gave those young men with the vacant faces those women with the improbable complexions the right to all the good things at the table of life even herbert was splashed by this wave of bitterness herbert the brilliant with his battalion of boots ah poor little billy was right it was impossible to believe in anythingto see any justice in life and was it worth while going on the thought presented itself again and again especially in those november days when london was as dark as his own soul and it made him half sorry half glad that a grim providence had sent his pistol to the pawnshop he was walking to graingers one evening in such a double darkness of without and within when the memory came to him of a newspaper paragraph concerning people who had wandered into the river and hypnotized by the idea he bent his steps towards the docks with a vague intention of giving death a chance what did it matter what became of his brothers and sisters it were better that they died too in any case he could not help them any more he had just scraped together the usual remittance but he could not see where the next was to come from but his semisomnambulistic motion did not bear him towards the waterside in the gray obscurity he erred endlessly in strange ghostly squares whose chill ironrailed enclosures loomed like cemeteries through the sepulchral air london smelled like a boiled sponge the raw air reeked with sulphurous grime as if the chimneys of hell had been swept it was not an inviting world to remain in a gigantic brown head of a horse suddenly shot past his he jumped back but a shadowy wheel caught him in the pit of the stomach and hurled him across the road where he fell on his back hearing inarticulate noises from the cabman and just seeing the hansom swallowed up again by the yellow sea he got up feeling dazed and indignant rather than hurt and staggered along in purposeless pursuit of the vanished cab he found himself in a business street where the illumined shopfronts thinned the fog a familiar face with a strange green light upon it from a chemists window burst upon him as unexpectedly as the horse it was tarmigans he studied it abstractedly for a moment in its greenish pallor with its deep furrows seeming to read clearly a weariness and heartsickness akin to his own and struck for the first time by the shabbiness and flaccidity of the figure then the face took a more joyous expression than he had ever seen in it and he heard tarmigan saying hullo strang are you lost too yes sirat least i dont quite know sir he replied like one awaking from a dream youre usually at graingers at this hour im on my way there if you are going tonight we had better keep together thank you sir said matt he went into the chemists to inquire their whereabouts and feeling a little stiff had the sudden idea of laying out his last coppers in arnica then he began to pilot his master with a sense of lofty responsibility but they walked in silence mutually embarrassed tarmigan coughed lengthily ought you to be out on a night like this sir matt ventured to say duty my boy duty rejoined tarmigan gruffly but you are not bound to go are you sir matt remonstrated remembering that tarmigans services were a voluntary sacrifice at the shrine of art i am not forced by an outsider if thats what you mean said tarmigan but that wouldnt be duty that would be necessityat least in my definition then duty is only what you feel you ought to do said matt decidedly any man who knows what true art is is bound to hand it down to the next generation especially in an age when there is so much false doctrine in the air but cant each generation find out its own art matt asked timidly can each generation find out its own science tarmigan retorted sharply in all things there is a great human tradition and the torch is handed down from generation to generation otherwise we should be in a nice fog he added grimly and coughed again and a nice fog the young men are in who reject the light of the past with their azure art and their violet nonsense and their slapdash sketchiness but they seem to be gaining the public ear matt murmured liking neither to contradict his master nor to agree with him the public ear tarmigan laughed scornfully yes they gain that but not the public eye thank god that can still tell slipshod botchery from honest faithful work but cornpepper is in the academy this year matt reminded him yes the academy lets itself be outbawled said tarmigan sharply i wish i were a member i wish you were said matt fervently tarmigan coughed i didnt mean what you mean he said gruffly oh but they ought to elect you sir said matt rushing in on delicate ground in his enthusiasm for the mans character everybody says so whos everybody tarmigan inquired bitterly society doesnt say so for i dont go to its drawingrooms the ras dont say so for im unknown to their wives but i am unjust let us drop the subject after all a mans work stands even if he is passed over in his lifetime matt felt a sharp pang of sympathy for this strong stern man sustained by the false dream of immortality he could not conceive that posterity would care a rap for tarmigans cold classic pictures indeed now that he had assimilated all that was good in tarmigans teaching he only went to the studio for the sake of the model and the practice emotion and embarrassment kept him silent do you live with your people tarmigan asked presently in an interested tone no said matt they are in america oh ah yes so you told me youre not married no nor engaged i hope no said matt wonderingly thats right no artist should marry his wife is sure to drag him down to sacrifice his art to her pleasures and wants fine feathers and fine houses are ruining english art i warn you of this because you have the makings of an artist if you work hard you are very kind sir said matt touched not at all you have a fine natural talent still undisciplined so long as you keep yourself free from matrimonial complications you may hope to achieve something a single man can live on bread and water i am heartily glad to hear you have nobody to keep but yourself matt smiled grimly under the imagined cover of the fog ah i know what youre smiling at said tarmigan more genially than he had yet spoken youre wondering whether the preacher is a bachelor well i am proud to say im still single though i cant boast of living on bread and water you see it isnt only the expense marriage spoils the silent incubation of ideas the wife wants her husband not his art but suppose an artist falls in loveisnt it hard on him asked matt no man can serve two masters every artist has got to ask himself does he want happiness or does he want art that choice will face you one day mr strang i hope not said matt but i guess arts enough for me he spoke in a tone of quiet conviction and his bosom swelled happiness forsooth how could there be happiness apart from art or how could art be apart from happiness their talk fell to a lower level matt casually expressed an ardent wish to see sundry ras especially the president he had only come across the secondrate painters or the young men he felt vaguely that he was at one with butler and greme and herbert and apparently tarmigan also in despising them though he had only seen one of their exhibitions they were in power and popular and therefore timeserving mediocrities yet beneath all this prejudice was a keen curiosity about them and a latent respect for these oldsters who had arrived tarmigan promised to get him a ticket for the prize distribution of the academy schools next month when he would see most of them the suggestion of suicide slunk into the rear the spectacle of the academicians was something to live for then the old man and the young relapsed into silent thoughts of their art projecting visions of ideal beauty on the background of yellow grimy vapor that shrouded the great dreary city but when matt sat down to paint that night he found himself incapacitated a mass of aches and bruises he went home to anoint himself with his arnica in the unconscious optimism of sickness the suggestion of suicide had vanished altogether chapter viii gold medal night with a step that faltered from nervousness even more than from the weakness due to a diet of one meal per diem matt strang passed across the clangorous courtyard of burlington house nigh turned back by the imposing bustle of broughams and cabs whose shadows were thrown sharply on the stones under the keen frosty starshine of the december night in the warmlighted hall he shrank back even more timidly blinking at the radiance of the company the white shirtfronts of the men the dazzling shoulders of the women before a counter a block of black figures struggled to get rid of their hats and coats in exchange for numbers matt hid his hat fortunately flexible in the pocket of his overcoat which being the least shabby of his vestments by reason of its summer vacation he did not dare to take off otherwise he would not have dared to keep it on there were spots of discoloration on the concealed garments for they had suffered from the weeks job which together with the expectation of this galanight had kept him alive since he had met tarmigan in the fog three weeks before as a housepainter and distemperer matt had still hovered on the verge of art and if butler was right in his interpretation of the academy of his day and the highest art was indeed to conceal paint then was the young nova scotian strictly academic in retaining his overcoat on this most academic of occasions he marched with the courage of desperation up a broad crimson staircase keenly conscious of the frayed edges of his trousers and mistily aware of overarching palms and bordering flowerpots and fashionable companions and surrendered the ticket tarmigan had given him to a sumptuous official who seemed a part of the ornamental avenue to the academic salons once safely past this point the haze cleared and he saw to his joy less fashionable figures in frockcoats and ladies in hats and jackets and though he wished they had been more numerous and more dowdy he felt a morsel more at ease there seemed to be pictures on view and he eagerly joined the sparse groups of spectators that promenaded the rooms in curious contrast with the crush of the populace the last time he had walked at the price of a shilling within these historic walls the exhibition was curious in one room dozens of semidetached heads some evidently from the same model in another cartoons of draped figures in a third sculptures he saw from a placard that they had been done in competition for the prizes that were to be adjudged tonight he heard scraps of foolish criticism from the people about him but his commerce with arteditors had blunted his once sensitive nerves and he was only amused from the pictures his eyes strayed to the spectators and he wondered which were celebrities it occurred to him with a pang of dismay that in the absence of any cicerone he might go away no wiser than he had come and he remembered with regret the personally conducted tour he had made through the reynolds club would his uncle be here tonight he thought with apprehensive shrinking as he moved aimlessly about thinking of the old gentleman his heart leaped to seenot matthew strang but daniel before nebuchadnezzar and not the daniel before nebuchadnezzar he knew but other daniels and other nebuchadnezzarsa veritable vision of daniels and nebuchadnezzars a gallery of daniels and nebuchadnezzars perspectives of daniels and nebuchadnezzars stretching away on both sides of the room young cleanshaven daniels and old graybearded daniels and middleaged daniels with mustaches daniels with uplifted arms and daniels with downcast eyes daniels dressed and daniels undressed daniels with flashing faces and daniels with turned backs and nebuchadnezzars analogously assorted and palaces of equal variety and backgrounds of similar dissimilarity each tableau differing in properties and supernumeraries but all appearing only the more alike because of their differences so conventional were the variations matt divined instantly that the picture herbert had painted must be among them and he looked about ardently for the painted palace in which he had spent so many happy hours ah there it was the dear old canvas though it had an undreamedof grandeur in its broad gold frame there was daniel and there was nebby more finished than when he had last seen herbert at work on them that fatal midsummer day but essentially unchanged he felt quite a small proprietary interest in it unconscious how much it really owed to him his touches on the actual final canvas had been but few and these mainly suggestions in pastel and his remembrance of the scaffolding work that preceded was hopelessly blurred by the countless discussions he was shaken by a resurgence of pleasant memories of these artistic talks and merry lunches with the bright sunshine streaming down on the skin rugs and the gleaming busts he became absorbed in the painting seeing episodes of the past in it like a magician looking into a pool of ink and then he was pierced to the marrow as by an icy wind he heard an ecstatic voice ejaculating isnt it beautiful the dear boy in charming foreign accents and he divined the vandyke beard hovering haughtily in his rear he felt the couple had come to see their sons work and he tried to sidle away unperceived but an advancing group forced him to turn round and he found himself eye to eye with madame whose radiant face of praise was exchanged for one of smiling astonished welcome when she caught sight of him my dear young she began in accents of lively affection then matt saw her face freeze suddenly and he quailed beneath the glooming eyebrows of her dignified consort who swept round the other way with the frozen lady on one arm and herbert on the other turning three backs to his nephew in a sort of triple insult the semicircular sweep which veered madame off brought herbert near and matts heart beat more rapidly as his whilom chums dresscoat with its silk facings brushed against his tightly buttoned overcoat the glimpse he had of herberts face showed it severe impassive and devoid of recognition but ere the young gentleman had quite swept past he managed to give his homely cousin a droll dig in the ribs which was as balm in gilead to the lonely youth and brought back in a great wave all his fondness for his dashing relative with whom he now felt himself a fellow conspirator in a facetious imbroglio the last lees of his bitterness were extruded by the dig he gazed with affectionate admiration after the solemn swallowtails of his cousin receding staidly and decorously up the avenue of daniels at one or other of which his disengaged hand pointed with no faintest suggestion of droll digs in its immaculate cuff and delicately tapering fingers presently there was a marked move in a particular direction and matt joining the current was floated towards a great room filled with chairs and already half full of gentlefolks he made instinctively for the rear but finding himself amid a mob of young fellows in evening dress some of them sporting the ivory medal of studentship he retreated farther towards the front ultimately taking up a position on the last chair of the left extremity of the fourth row from the back out of view of the incomers streaming through the oaken panels it was a broad oblong room with skylights in the handsome ceiling and large watercolors hanging on the walls a temporary dais covered by a crimson baize and ascended by a crimson step faced the audience and at its central point stood a readingdesk lighted from the right by a lamp matt heard whispered comments on the newcomers from his neighbors now it was a knighted brewer who rolled his corporeal cask into a front seat now it was a musical conductor with an air of exile from the central desk a few painters of eminence with neither handles nor tails to their names dotted art about the audience while wives and daughters of the academically distinguished exhaled an aroma of fashion striving to banish all reminiscences of paint from everything but their complexions here and there was an actor out of employment or a strayed nondescript celebrity and on a plush couch to the right of the platform a popular author chatted noisily with a pretty vivacious lady journalist the mixture was completed by a few favored relatives of the students like mr and madame strang whose anxious faces were clearly visible to matt in a diagonal direction a few rows ahead herbert himself herded with his fellowstudents who had taken exclusive possession of the back rows where they stood in evening dress a serried gallery of blackandwhite figures prophesying all the winners a great round of applause from their ranks set everybody peering towards the door only to encounter the stern gaze of the magnificent beadle whose entry had prompted the salvoes and who arrayed in what appeared to be a rich red dressinggown showed like a venetian colorstudy amid a collection of engravings a more general outburst of clapping accompanied by a buzz of interest greeted the arrival of the less picturesque train of academicians headed by the president the procession bowing and smiling defiled slowly towards the dais especial enthusiasm being reserved for the more popular or the newest academicians and associates the students having a ruling hand or hands in the distribution of the noise matt craned forward eagerly to see these pillars of english art whose names flew from lip to lip as they only looked like men he had a flash of selfconfidence the president takes his seat on the central chair flanked and backed by the faithful forty and the trusty thirty minus the absentees the ras dispose themselves along the front bench the aras occupy the reara younger set on the whole with more hair on their heads and less on their chins the beadle solemnly slides the oak panels to cloistering the scene from the world and a religious silence spreads from him till it infects even the excited back rows the president rises bland and stately there is a roar of welcome succeeded by a deeper hush it is seen that he has papers on his desk and is about to declare the results of the competitions and to determine the destiny of dozens if not the future of english art there is no vulgar sensationalism with a simple dignity befitting the venerable selfsufficient institution which still excludes great newspapersand great paintersfrom its banquets he disdains working up to a climax and starts with the tidbit of the evening the gold medal and travelling studentship for awarded every two years for the best historical painting the subject this year being daniel before nebuchadnezzar the president pauses for a breathless instant the ranks of blackandwhite figures standing in the background have grown rigid with excitement the president imperturbably announces herbert strang there is a brief pause for mental digestion then a great crash of applausethe harmonious cacophony of clapping hands generous lungs and frenzied feet matt thrilling through and through with joy and excitement shouting frantically and applauding with all his limbs turns to look for herbert amid the students but sees only rows of heaving shirtfronts and animated black arms then he becomes aware of his cousin strolling leisurely along the near side of the room through a mad tempest of cheering towards the presidents desk a faint smile playing about his beautiful boyish lips which yet tremble a little matt feels proud of being the cousin of the hero of the moment whose course he follows with teardimmed eyes he sees him reach the presidential desk and receive a medal and an envelope from the great man who shakes hands with him and evidently offers words of congratulation he follows his passage back to his fellowstudents through the undiminished tempest then his eye lights suddenly on matthew strangs face and sees great tears rolling down towards the vandyke beard while beside him madame strang her face radiating sunshine her eyes dancing throws kisses towards the cynosure of all eyes who carrying his honors and studiously avoiding the weakness of a glance in the direction of his parents ploughs his way amid fraternal backthumpings to his place among his cronies there is a rapid exchange of criticism and gossip among the students ejaculations of commiseration for flinders whose friends had convinced him that he would win and for rands a poor devil of talent the only hope of a desperately genteel family in dalston but comment must be hushed for other prizes some of them important enough have to be announced there is a steady succession of individual students more or less blushing moving to and from the presidents congratulatory hand some stumbling nervously against the crimson step placed in front of his desk probably by the beadle to disconcert the shy some fortunate prizewinners come up three times and stumble three times sometimes they are girls one wears spectacles and a yellow sash and has the curved back of the student another is pretty and petite and causes a furore by her multiplex successes and her engaging charm a third is handsome but gawky with bare red arms a young man who wins two events attracts special attention by his poetical head and his rapt air of mystic reverie and goes back winking then the president commences his biennial address to an audience of students throbbing with excitement afire with the afterglow of all that applause anxious to canvass the awards and dying to run out into the other rooms to look at the winning pictures which have in some instances been dark horses which nobody remembers to have noticed his theme is the evolution of ecclesiastical art for half an hour the audience always with the exception of the students he is addressing listens patiently to the procession of ornate periods classically chiselled hoping to emerge from the dulness and gloom of obscure epochs into the light of familiar names then the seats begin to feel hard by the aid of copious shufflings wrigglings and whisperings they drag through another bad quarter of an hour relieved only by the mention of albrecht drer whose name is unaccountably received with rapturous cheers as if he were a political allusion the next quarter of an hour is lightened by the feeling that it is to be the last but as the second hour arrives without a harbinger sentence three brave men arise and pass through the beadleguarded portal there is tremendous cheering from the back which is taken up and reechoed from all parts of the room and the president beams and turns over a new page the seats become granite the presidential eloquence flows on as if it would wear them away an endlessly trickling stream he enters into painful analyses of vanished frescos painted in churches long since swept away and elaborates punctilious appreciations of artists and architects known only to biographical dictionaries some have fancy without imagination some imagination without fancy a few both fancy and imagination and the rest neither imagination nor fancy the stream strewn with dead names flows on slow and stately with never a playful eddy and another man greatly daring fortified by the example of his gallant predecessors steals from the room and blushes to find it fame amid the plaudits that ring around this manful deed matt suddenly finds herbert at his side his cousin slips a note into his hand and retreats hastily to his place excited and glad of the relief he opens it and reads meet me outside after this rot is over dont let the old gentleman see you matt smiles proud and happy to resume his old relations with the hero of the evening and pleased to find the ancient password of the old gentleman supplementing the droll dig in the ribs in resetting their camaraderie on its ancient footing in his eagerness to talk to herbert again and to congratulate him personally the presidential oration seems to him duller and the seat more adamantine than ever he strains his ears to catch instead the babble of the students who have finally given up any pretence of interest in medival flemish cathedrals his eye long since satiate with the sight of the celebrities roves again over the faces of the academicians on their platform austere in their striving to appear absorbed and again he draws confidence from their merely human aspect he watches the popular novelist gossiping with the vivacious lady journalist he examines for the eighth time the watercolors on the walls which he gathers from one of the many conversations going on in his neighborhood are by the competitors for the turner prize he sees that the hardworked newspaper artist in the row in front of him has given up sketching and gone to sleep despairing of escape the pangs of his own stomach keep him awake he looks forward wistfully to the hour of release resolved to treat himself to twopennyworth of supper in honor of herberts triumph but the interminable voice goes on discoursing learnedly and elegantly of apses and groins and gargoyles the wrigglings have ceased all around but especially in the quiet front rows under the presidential eye apathetic listless beings droop on their chairs matt steals a glance towards his uncle and finds him the only member of the audience genuinely alert and interested his head perked up his eyes gazing admiringly towards the rostrum where perchance in imagination he already sees his son carrying on the timehonored tradition of the great sir joshua at his side madame sustains herself by furtive looks in the direction of the same young gentleman then matt turns his attention to the speaker watching his mouth open and shut and his shapely hand turning the perpetual pages he expects that every moment will be the orators last but the great man is just warming to his work his silvery voice rising above the buzz and the murmur descants dreamily on the spiritual aspirations of uncouthly christened architects who had mouldered in their graves long centuries before his gracious majesty george iii patron of arts and letters gave the academy houseroom after an hour and a half he launches lightly into a treatise on glassstaining the audience has now given up all hope it has the sense of condemnation to an earthly inferno in which the suave voice of a fiend of torture himself everlastingly damned shall forever amble on unwinding endless erudition a reference to my young architectural friends greeted with suspicious thunders by all the students affords a momentary break in the monotony the end comes suddenly after a lastly forgotten ten minutes before there is a brief interval of incredulity people awakened by the silence look up sleepily yes there is no doubt the president is actually down then a great roar of joy bursts out from all sides the back benches go delirious and then the meeting dissolves in a stampede towards the oaken panels at last open in three places the discharged prisoners swarm down the grand staircase and besiege the cloakrooms some parade the rooms to inspect the winning pictures now ticketed and to express their surprise at the judges decisions outside in the cold air which immediately began to make him sneeze through the compulsory imprudence of having worn his overcoat throughout matt lurked about looking for herbert and at last the hero appeared carefully muffled and wrapped up and with a murmur of wasnt it awful wait by the arcade till my peoples cab rolls off dashed back when he reappeared smiling sunnily he explained that he had told his people he must show up at the students club in order not to appear caddish ive been slobbered over enough he added whimsically flicking the traces of an imaginary maternal kiss off his fresh smooth cheek oh but i dont wonder your people are delighted said matt i know i am i havent congratulated you yet and he shook his cousins hand heartily thank you old fellow its very good of you oh bytheway dont mention to anybody i let you see the picture on the easel will you one is supposed to keep it to ones self dont you know thats why i didnt tell you i was doing it for the gold medal oh who should i mention it to asked matt reassuringly thats a good chap you see if it got out that i talked it over with you there might be a bother people are so jealous especially now that it has won oh i shant tell a soul you may depend said matt it was very good of you to let me come so often and chat about it and even if i did save you a little trouble in working out the perspective i learned a great deal about composition from you dont mention it said herbert oh i wont said matt gravely whereat herbert laughed and replied now you must do an academy picture old fellow theres three months time yet would there be any chance of my getting in asked matt wistfully he had been fluttered by the applause of the evening it seemed impossibly grand to be the centre of an admiring fashionable assemblage instead of a shabby alien hovering on its outside rim in such company the colossal selfconfidence of his solitary exaltations dwindled to a pitiful sense of his real insignificance rather replied herbert why i thank my stars you werent a competitor i should never have got the medal if you had been matt shook his head deprecatingly but herbert rattled on with increasing enthusiasm wouldnt it be jolly if you got a picture in and it was hung on the line next to mine now that ive taught you composition and educated you up to the academys ideas you could easily do something that would take the old buffers fancy and then once you got a show in the academy the old gentleman would take up your work and run you i dont think theyd take what i wanted to do oh but you mustnt want to do it said herbert at least not till you can afford it besides im not so sure that there isnt something in the academys ideas after all candidly i dont quite see how daniel and nebuchadnezzar could have been treated any better i dont want to treat them at all said matt well anyway do something you old duffer you dont want to go grubbing along at ten bob a weekor was it tenpence a day i forget promise me to do a picture for the next show or i shant feel easy in my mind about you i promise matt murmured thats right said herbert considerably relieved he went on heartily the academy is the steppingstone its no good kicking it out of the way put a picture in the academy by fair means if thou canst butput a picture in the academy you see even cornpepper had to come to us and even if you will do newfangled stuff you can always get in if you make the picture a certain queer sizejust to fit an awkward corner i forget the exact measurements but the old gentleman knows he took care to find out in case i couldnt get in legitimately ill make a point of asking him poor old governor i dont suppose hell sleep tonight why he was quite blubbery when the cab drove off do you know theres a certain pathos about the old gentleman hes been very good to you said matt well and now he is happy virtue rewarded the cream of the joke is that now ive got to go abroad in spite of himtravelling studentship you seeand he cant possibly chuck business for a year to come with me was the money in that envelope matt asked only the first quarterly instalment what a shame i cant pay you out of that only i must study abroad with the money it wouldnt be honest to use it for any other purpose would it dont talk of it said matt flushing from a sense of the misconstruction of his thoughtless query oh dont be so shocked you look as if i had already misappropriated it i cant tell you how glad i was to see your dear old phiz tonight what have you been doing with yourself i often wondered why you didnt look me up at the club bytheway here we are at the club here echoed matt interrogatively they had been walking automatically as they conversed and had come to a standstill before a blank cheerless building in golden square yes this is the shanty not my club you duffer this is only the students little ken i told my people the truth you know it would be snobbish not to drop in tonight they make rather a night of it though i hadnt intended to go otherwise hang it all i had an appointment to sup with a girl at halfpast ten i forgot all about hershell be mad he took out his watch ten past eleven why ecclesiastical art must have evolved till close on eleven it isnt my fault anyhow do you mind trotting round to the imperial shes in the first ballet wed better have a hansom the young men drove round to the stage door but the fair one had departed after a few impatient instants i think i heard her tell the cabby rules was the sixpenny worth of information obtained from the janitor lets go there said matt who was now quite faint with hunger and who had a lurking wish that herbert would stand a supperone of the olden heroic suppers that he had not tasted for half a yeara wild riot of a supper with real meat and wholesome vegetables and goodly saucesnay even red wine and a crowning cup of coffee made of real beans not the charred crust of overbaked loaves out of which he had been making his own lately getting the burned bread cheaper with a double economy a supper fit for wellfed gods which a starving man having eaten might be well content to die but herbert unaware of what was going on in matts inner man replied cruelly no its too late to look for her at the restaurant i know her address but she wont be there yet besides i ought to show up at the club so they strolled back to the bleak building matt suddenly bethinking himself that even here supper might lie in wait and passing through a dark hall mounted a stone corkscrew staircase that led to a hubbub of voices and a piano jingling musichall tunes the doorway of the first room was congested by black backs overcircled with clouds of smoke herbert and matt peered in unseen for a few moments the little room decorated only by a few sketches from the hands of members and separated from the second room by the primitive partition of a screen was crowded with young men in evening dress sitting round on chairs or knees or coalscuttles with glasses in their hands and cigars in their mouths and new men were squeezing in from the inner room the advent of each being greeted by facetious cheers plaudits more genuine in their ring welcomed flinders who it was understood had been in the final running he came in trying to make his naturally long face look short and exclaiming with punctilious carelessness wheres my whiskey rands who it was whispered had lost by only a few votes was not present he had apparently gone home to the heartbroken gentility at dalston matt caught sight of cornpepper on the right of the doorway and his heart rejoiced as at the sight of a laid supper the little painter was clutching the middle of his chair with his most owllike expression his single eyeglass glittered in the gaslight why theres cornpepper matt whispered in awed accents oh has he come in yawned herbert i saw him marching greme about among the daniels and giving them hell in emulation of clinchlooking round after every swear as if half hoping the ladies hadnt heard him and half hoping they had but matt had only half heard herbert he was listening to the oracles of cornpepper but listeners rarely hear any good of themselves strangs not in it with you cornpepper was saying to flinders theres no blooming style in his technique it might have been done by an ra they do say the result would have been very different if more ras had come down said the semiconsoled flinders somewhat illogically but barbauld had the gout and platt is in morocco and at this point shouts of strang made the cousins start but it was only the playfulness of the room greeting a newcomer as the victor the youth acquiesced humorously in the makebelieve slouching round the room with a comical shuffle and a bow to each chair then a man got up and began a burlesque lecture on ecclesiastical art to my young architectural friends every reference to apses groins or gargoyles was received with yells of delight a demoniac shriek being reserved for albrecht drer im awfully glad i escaped it said a youth in front of matt i got there five minutes late and the man wouldnt let me in at least he said im not supposed to let you in after ninefifteen but i didnt take the tipor give it in the middle of the address on art gurney coming up the staircase in the wake of a student friend to whom he had been descanting on the absurdities of cornpepperism from which he had now revolted perceived herbert and pushed him boisterously into the room which straightway became a pandemonium the pianist banging see the conquering hero comes the boys stamping singing huzzahing rattling their glasses and shouting cigars drinks strang herbert beamingly ordered boxes of havanas and sodaandwhiskies and soon matt still in his overcoat found himself drinking and smoking and shouting with the rest exalted by the whiskey into forgetfulness of his clothes and his fortunes and partaking in all the rollicking humors of the evening in all the devilmaycare gayety of the eternal undergraduate roaring with his boon companions over the improper stories of the asceticlooking young man with the poetic head bawling street choruses dancing madly in grotesque congested waltzes wherein he had the felicity to secure cornpepper for a partner and distinguishing himself in the highkicking pas seul not departing till the final auld lang syne had been sung with joined hands in a wildly whirling ring herbert had left some time before goodnight matt i want to get away i dont often get such an excuse for being out late theres no need for you to go yet you lucky beggar he whispered confidentially as he sallied forth radiantly sober weaving joyous dreams of his travelling studentship future when the party broke up in the small hours matt strang saturated with whiskey and empty of victual staggered along the frosty pavements singing to the stars that reeled round blinking and winking like the buttons on herberts boots chapter ix defeat his own boots preoccupied matts attention ere the new year dawned had fourtoes continued going to graingers instead of letting his subscription lapse perforce with the christmas quarter he might have convinced the class that his toes were normal for they had begun to peep out despite all his efforts to botch up the seams the state of his wardrobe prevented him from looking up herbert at his club especially as he was doubtful whether the travelling studentship had not already carried his cousin off and thus that mad night which was a hot shame to sober memory grew to seem an unreal nightmare and herbert as distant as ever a vagrant atom of the scum of the city he tasted all the bitterness of a millionpeopled solitude his quest for work was the more hopeless the shabbier his appearance grew in optimistic afterdinner moods he had thought the spectacle of the streets sufficient and to feast ones eyes on the pageant of life a cloyless ecstasy and indeed in the first days of his wanderings the merest artistic touch in the wintry streets could still give him a pleasurable sensation that was a temporary anodynethe yellow sand scattered on slippery days along the tram lines and showing like a spilth of summer sunshine the warm front of a publichouse making the only spot of color in the long suburban street strange faces seen for an instant in fog and lost forever snowflakes tumbling over one another in their haste or fluttering lingeringly to earth red suns grayringed like schoolboys tawsbut as the slow days unfolded their sordid unchanging coils he found himself shrinking more and more into himself he sought warmth and refuge from reality in the national gallery or the british museum dreaming away the hours before the more imaginative pictures or the elgin marbles but even these failed him at last their beauty an intolerable irony sometimes he realized with a miserable start the real tragedy of being out of work how it narrowed the horizon down to the prospect of meals so that the great movement of the world from which he was shut out left him equally exclusive and the announcements on the newspaper posterswars and international football and the opening of parks and new plays and the deaths of great men and the rise of ministriesstruck no responsive chord in his imagination were all shadowy emanations from some unreal mockery of a universe the real universe had his own navel for centre sometimes a faint perception of the humor of the position distorted his lips in a melancholy smile he wondered how he would come out under jimmy ravens pencil at other times he lay huddled up in his bed his fading clothes heaped over the one blanket passing the day in an apathetic trance interrupted only by the intermittent working of his imagination or by observation of optical effects that accidentally arrested his gaze and the next day in remorse for lost possibilities he would rise before dawn and recommence his search for employment from such a long days tramp he was shuffling homeward late one dark dismal night when pausing to warm his feet and hands at the cellargrating of a bakers shop he was accosted by william gregson striding along with a frown on his forehead and a brownpaper parcel in his hand hullo fourtstrang he cried pausing dont see you any more no said matt wishing gregson wouldnt see him now and edging a little away from a streetlamp you dont want any boots no said matt sticking his toes downward to hide the gaps as far as possible you wont forget i am at your service whatever you want said the little stooping old man with shining enthusiastic eyes it is a pleasure to work for a man with feet like yours i was only thinkin of you tonight at the studioa scurvy wretch has been servin me a shabby trick and i was thinkin to myself ah fourah strang theres a difference now strangs a man and a brother artist this blokes a artless biped why what did he do theres no need to go into details said william gregson pathetically suffice it to say he refuses the boots and here they are a beautiful pair left on my hands after i sat up half the night to finish em for him trades so brisk just now he unwrapped the package to expose their perfections and what will you do with them said matt id like to put em on and kick him with em replied gregson gloomily only theyre too small gregsons own feet were decidedly not beautiful yes they seem more my size agreed matt will you have them cried the old man eagerly name your own price dont be afraid i shant ask more than last time but matt shook his head im hard up he confessed blushing in the lamplight ill trust you was the fervid response id never pay you matt protested unless i could do something for you in return if you want he hesitated your shop painted or any wallpapering oror i could build you a counter or but the shoemaker was shaking his head i dont want my shop paintedbut ow if you painted me he cried with an inspiration ive often tried to do it myself but someow an angelic expression gets into it and the missus dont recognize it have you ever tried doin your own portrait strang nonot seriously said matt well you try and see if you dont find it as i say its a curious thing how that angelic expression will creep in when a mans paintin his own portrait besides you can paint better than me i dont say it behind your back but then its a bargain interrupted matt anxiously yes i can give you an hour every mornin trades so slack unfortunately may i take the boots with me inquired matt yes the moment the portraits done said gregson in generous accents are you afraid ill walk off in em matt cried angrily and suppose they dont fit ah well you may try them on conceded gregson and with a curious repetition of a former episode matt slipped off his boot under a streetlamp the boots were a little tight especially after the yawning laxness of the old but it was heavenly to stamp on the wet pavement and to feel a solid sole under ones foot even though an oozy sloppy stocking intervened gregson perceived the ruin of the vacant boot and his face grew stern keep it on keep it on he said harshly youre an old customer oh thank you ejaculated matt you can give me the old pair he rejoined gruffly oh but theyre past mending said matt but they can help to mend other boots theyre like clergymen said the little shoemaker laughing grimly nothing is ever wasted in this world matt was thinking so too though from a different point of view he was grateful to the economical order of the universe the boots reinvigorated the pilgrim on his way to the everreceding mecca of employment and each day he sallied forth further refreshed by the bread and butter and tea which william gregsons spouse dispensed after the sittings all over london he tramped one day he wandered in hopes of a job among the docks of rotherhithe feeling a vague romance in the great gray perspectives of towering woodstacks with their faraway flavor of exotic forests and in the sombre canals and locks along which men with cordwain faces were tugging discolored barges the desolation of the scene and of the district was akin to his moodhis eyes were full of delicious hopeless tears he rambled on forgetting to ask for the job through the forlorn streets all shipchandler shops and onestory cottages and threading a narrow passage strewn with lounging louts found himself on a little floating pier on the bank of the river and lost himself again in contemplating the grimy picturesque traffic the bleak wharves and warehouses you see that air barge with the brickdust sails matt started an aged gentleman with a rusty silk hat was addressing him well tother day i see one just like that capsize in calm weather under my very eyes i come here every day after dinner to watch the water and i do get something worth seein sometimes the piermaster he told me it was loaded with roadslop and roadslops aliveshifts the weight on the lurchin side you see and thats ow it occurred there was two men drownedoh its worth while coming here sometimes i can tell you you see that green flag off the buoythats where she lays right in the fairway of the river here the aged gentleman snuffed himself with tremulous fingers that spilled half and offered matt the box the young man took a pinch for exhilaration a strayed sparrow hopped dolefully amid the grains of snuff on the floating platform in futile quest of seeds it would be appier stuffed the aged gentleman declared i mean with tow not toke and he laughed wheezingly matt contesting this the aged gentleman maintained with an air of deep philosophy that all birds would be appier stuffedthat their life in a state of nature was a harrowing competition for crumbs and worms while to keep them alive in cages was the climax of cruelty it subsequently transpired that he was a retired birdstuffer and the conversation ended in matts accompanying him home to learn the process as the birdstuffers son and heir in faroff stepney was in need of a trustworthy hand in the shop there isnt a honest art in the trade he said gloomily and the boys are wuss than the men they ought to be stuffed what i like about you is that youve got no character the better the character the wuss the man they takes advantage of it arrived at his housewhich was more pretentious than most of its onestory neighborsfor it had a basement sublet to a blind woman whose insignia read chairs neatly cained on reasonable terms and its parlor window was gay with wax fruits and stuffed birdsthe aged gentleman who gave the name of ground discovered that he had no skin to operate on and being spent from the walk directed matt to buy a dead canary for sixpence from a birdfancier in the eye road theres the tanner he said now if you dont come back with the bird you may stuff me for a old goose matt came back with the bird but the aged gentleman put it to his nose and contorted his aged snuffcolored nostrils i want a bird not manure he said a bird fresh from this wale of tears why if i began to skin this the feathers ould drop out youve been took in but you havent took me in so heres another tanner in great anxiety matt stood outside the birdfanciers shopwindow staring wistfully at the frowsylooking birds roosting in the cages and hoping that some kindly canary would drop off to eternal sleep under his very nose so that he might be sure of its freshness but the poor little creatures all clung to existence and their perches suddenly he began to laugh there was an owl in a cage and it looked like cornpepper on its head was an erectile tuft like cornpeppers hair after argument and though devoid of an eyeglass the creature regarded him from its great featherfringed eyes with the same large profound gaze give me style he heard it saying give me style and then he thought of cornpeppers theories of which he had heard more on that glad mad night when the juvenile celebrity had been his partner in the waltz erlesmith is all wrong cornpepper had pronounced testily but i dont want to talk shop tonight imagination is shown in treatment not in subject there may be more imagination in the painting of a dressinggown than of an allegory painters are called poets when they cant paint and the saturday spectator is quite at sea when it claims me as the champion of modern subject against ancient medival or imaginary subject indeed what i demand is modern treatment i do wish obrien would leave off interpreting me and matt strang fell into a reverie wondering what he should paint for the academy and gazing into the owls eyes what if he were destined to waltz to fame in company with cornpepper and then he remembered gurneys enthusiastic talk during the pauses of the wild waltz in denunciation of the real moments of cornpepperism and in acclamation of the simpler harmonies of outamaro the great japanese master from whose work cornpeppers was a rotten retrogression rather than a legitimate evolution matt speculatively surrendered his fancy to japanese images a gallery of beautiful dreampictures passed before his eyes like a panorama a brusque tap on the shoulder roused him from his daydream and turning he saw the animated face of the aged gentleman beneath the rusty silk hat wheres the bloomin bird cried mr ground relieved to find matt not run off for during the suspense of waiting it had struck him that even the first bird might have been picked up in the gutter the bird matt murmured dazedly oh ah i was waiting for one to die i wanted to be sure it wasnew with my little eye i sore im die quoted the aged gentleman mockingly ere give us the cashyoure a juggins but i suppose folks cant be honest and clever too he took the sixpence and went inside and reemerged with what he called a newlaid linnet and returning to his parlor skinned it and smeared the skin with arsenical soap which he manufactured on the spot out of common yellow soap beaten up into a batter with water white arsenic and some drops of toothache mixture he had in a vial he stuffed the skin with the cottonwool in which the vial was embedded and ran a wire right through from mouth to tail with half a hairpin for each leg and each wing im out of eyes he said pausing but in them sockets you sticks glass eyestheyre so much a dozen according to size see matts aptitude as a pupil regained him the aged gentlemans esteem and a day or so after the oddly assorted couple sailed down the thames on a penny steamboat and walked from blackwall to stepney where matt was introduced to the birdstuffers son a fat greasy hilarious man who told his father that he was a old innercent and facetiously argued out the probabilities of matts honesty in matts presence ultimately ground junior took the young man on a weeks trial the trial going in matts favor he was installed permanently in the establishment at eighteen shillings a week fulfilling miscellaneous functions the most troublesome of which was the superintendence of a snubnosed errandboy who played excruciatingly on a penny whistle this boy whose name was tommy and who reminded matt queerly of his ancient indian chum by his dishonesty as well as by his name would calmly return with bare pedestals where there had been birds and shades and assert that he had smashed the glass and that thieves in the crowd had torn off the birds he did not flinch from smashing whole nests of glass shades two dozen inside one another a veritable napoleon among errandboys sometimes when he had been out with the barrow delivering orders he would wheel it home laden with mysterious coats and boots which he vainly offered matt on easy terms at irregular intervals too he fell ill a note from his mother arriving in his handwriting differently sloped and then matt was reduced to trundling the barrow himself while the fat facetious man summoned from the workroom over the shop or from his other establishment in the new cut where his wiry vixen of a wife had her headquarters replaced him behind the counter matt had also spells of mechanical occupation in the workshop he not only stuffed the skins which came from abroad but arranged baskets of waxfruit which were bought readymade and paper flowers and cases of shells with moss and seaweeds and pyramids of pebbles and he made mock red coral out of balls of brown paper dipped into a hot composition of beeswax and rosin and stuck it on wooden stands with manyhued shells variegating it and preserved insects creeping prettily over it likewise he manufactured waxflowers to replace breakages hollow frauds mere wax shells pounced with dry colors or mixed originally with coloring matter yellow ochre making apples and lake lending transparency to cherries or uniting with prussian blue to furnish the florid richness of purple grapes but thoughas everhis taskwork hovered oddly about the purlieus of art or the vaults of its temple and though his eighteen shillings a week enabled him to send nine shillings a week home in monthly instalments to abner preep still he was not happy the difficulties with the errandboy the fat facetiousness of ground junior the menial trundling of the barrow with the dread of some day meeting bubbles or other fellows from graingers to say nothing of cornpepper gurney rapper or the old gentleman the retail trade over the counter the biweekly task of cleaning all the shades with a chamois leatherall this combined with the sense of wasted months galled and fretted him he was working at his academy picture nowin accordance with his promise to herbertbut his hours being from eight to eight sunday was his only leisure time and he was paradoxically grateful for the ancient oriental ordinance which made the godless british birdstuffer close his shop once a week and thus enable him to work he was able to do some of the preliminary sketchingout in the early morning and at night but there was no light for the real work nor was there much light in his back bedroom even at noon on sundays he had not changed his address though he had to walk three miles to and from his work kept to his old lodging by habit and the trust that his landladyan artists motherwould not hastily throw him upon the streets the subject of his picture had grown upon him from his daily occupation the simulated birdlife around him moved him at moments to thoughts of the joyous winged creatures butchered to make a parlor ornament he could not agree with ground senior that they were happier stuffed and then too the pathos of prisoned birds would overwhelm him exiled from their natural woodland home and set to peck endlessly at wires his own lot and theirs became subtly interlinked and his imagination turning from the sordid prose of the actual world in which he found himself brooded on visions of poetry and idyllic happiness and so instead of selecting from reality that which was beautiful in it instead of following cornpeppers theories or his own theories or anybodys theories he found himself irresistibly and instinctively seized and possessed by a subject and a mode of treatment uncompromisingly imaginativethe paradise of the birds a beautiful wood suffused with a magic sunlight in which freed birds of many species should flutter blithely around a divine female figure with a wondrous radiance of love and joy upon her welcoming face and at her feet a beautiful boy playing upon an oaten pipe there should be an undertone of tender pathosthe pathos of birdsbut light and joy were to be the essence of this harmony of lovely forms and colors all the painters semiunconscious yearning for happiness all his revolt against his narrow squalid lot his secret resentful sense of the high place denied him at the banquet of life reflecting themselves inverted in the mirror of his art and though the sunlight and atmosphere should be real enough to satisfy the cornpepper faction yet over all he would put something of erlesmiths glamour the gleam the light that never was on sea or land the consecration and the poets dream for the paradise matt drew on his recollections and old sketches of acadia supplemented by a few watercolor studies made in epping forest which was within difficult walking distance of the birdshop from which of course he got his birds the divine female figure was based upon his first study from the nude at graingers which he still possessed though he now gave the woman the normal allowance of toes while by the aid of coppers he bribed the snubnosed apprentice with his penny whistle to sit for the cherub with the oaten reed and thus was nature transfigured to art but as eden to epping so was matts mental conception of the picture to the real picture from dawn to sunset matt painted tirelessly and with many patient effacements and substitutions of passages during his one workingday convinced that the academy was now his only avenue to recognition and as sendingin day drew nearer and the precious light was born earlier he was able to snatch an hour or two every morning before setting out for stepney towards the end the need of time drove him to the omnibus nor was it only the need of time of late a strange languor had grown upon him against which he was incessantly battling the image in his strip of glass frightened him his face was white his once sturdy frame thin and so feeble was he become that the threemile walk which had been rather a pleasure than an inconvenience was now a weary endless drag he had bilious headaches but he toiled on at his picture finding in the fairyland of imagination consolation for existence and in the anxieties and agonies of artistic travail an antidote to the agonies and anxieties of the daily grind the paradise of the birds though he was conscious it did not equal his conception still seemed to him far superior to the ordinary academy picture it could not fail to redeem him from his own inferno reveal him to the world make him an honored guest in artistic coteries and give him all the day for art through the sordid life of stepney and whitechapel he moved sustained by an inner vision of beauty and victory and it was not till he had surreptitiously wheeled his picture to burlington house in the birdstuffers barrow at the price of a reprimand for idling about that his willpower gave way and he realized that he was but a limp shadow hope kept him on his feet a little longer but the terrifying symptoms developed rapidly and at last even ground junior perceived his condition and allowed him a mornings leave to attend a hospital for two hours and a half he waited on one of the bare benches of a cheerless dimlit anteroom amid a grimy crowd of invalids ranging from decrepit bandaged old men to wanfaced children all coughing and groaning and conversing fatuously and ostentatiously comparing complaints and finally fading away tediously two by two into the presence of the physician at last his own turn came announced by the sharp ting of a handbell and preceded by a rheumyeyed stonemason he passed through the polished aweinspiring portal and found himself in the presence of an austere gentleman with frosty sidewhiskers whats the matter with you my man the doctor inquired in low tones of the stonemason all outer sorts replied the stonemason ah any special pain anywhere he went on in the same dulcet accents eh asked the stonemason hearing imperfectly in his fluster the doctor shouted in a mighty yell any special pain anywhere the appalled stonemason admitted to a stitch in the side and the doctor continued his interrogative thunders he had only two conversational methodsthe piano and the fortissimo matt trembling awaited his succession to the criminal dock and straining his ears when the trying moment came was fortunate enough to secure the piano treatment your blood is poisoned was the great mans verdict this is the third case i have had from birdstuffing establishments when you clean the glass shades and breathe on the insides you imbibe the arsenical and other foul gases that are given off by the skins and collect inside the airtight glasses you will take the medicine three times a day but it wont do you any good if you go on living in that atmosphere you want seaair you ought to try and get into the country and have a little holiday and matt strang dazed but smiling grimly crawled down into the dispensary and handed in his prescription and tottered back to the birdshop with a big bottle of yellow fluid in his hand he would not let himself think there was only one point of lighthis academy pictureand he kept his eyes fixed on that as on a star a few days later the notice of rejection arrived and the thin sickly faced young man being out with orders surreptitiously wheeled the paradise of the birds home on his barrow and discounted the renewed wrath of his employer by giving a weeks notice he did his work as usual that afternoon smiling in uneasy defiance at the oddly intrusive thought that the cobequid folks would have said it was all through his painting on sundays yet not without a shred of their superstition but when he got home he fell helplessly on his little iron bed and wept like a child he was beaten broken shattered in body and soul he had fought and lost and as an ailing child turns yearningly to its mother so his heart yearned to his native land in a great surge of homesickness here the narrow labyrinthine streets were muddy with spring rains but there the snow would still be on the fields and forests white and pure and beautiful under the dazzling blue sky oh the keen tingling cold the large embrace of the salt breezes the joy of skating over the frozen flats his poor poisoned blood glowed at the thought here he was ill and lonely there he would be among loving faces poor billy how the boy must long for him it would be humiliating to return a failure but there would be none to reproach him and his own pride was gone vanished with his physical strength but how to get back he was too ill to go before the mast too impoverished to command even the steerage he had unfortunately sent thirtysix shillings home just before the rejection of his picture and he was again in arrears of rent through the extra expense of the canvas and the compulsory gilt frame mrs lipchild was induced by the splendor of the frame to take the paradise of the birds in payment for the three weeks lunar and the carver and gilder overmantel and pictureframe maker in red lion street who had made the frame purchased all his remaining pictures and schoolstudies for a sovereign down there was nothing for it but to borrow so feeble was his whole being that the first suggestion of this ignominy carried no sting he thought first of herbert and brushing his garments to a threadbare specklessness inquired of his club doorkeeper who informed him curtly that mr strang was abroad this was as he expected but he was disappointed tarmigan was his only other friend but him he had lost sight of since christmas and though he had in these hours of weakness abandoned the hope of art he had still a vague paradoxical aversion from applying to a man whose artistic ideas he did not share and who might hereafter have a sort of right to resent his departure from them besides tarmigan was poor was unsuccessful in his desperation he thought of madame strang and though in the course of their chat that night at the students club herbert had told him the old gentleman had given her an awful wigging and she had renewed her promise to close her door in the culprits face yet matt nerved himself to risk insult so spying the shop from a sheltered doorway across the street he hung about till the vandyke beard and the velvet jacket had issued and disappeared round a corner then he rang the bell of the side door and to his joy madame herself opened it my poor boy what is the matter with you she cried the unexpected sympathy of her words clouded the lonely young mans gaze with hot tears he staggered into the passage and madame growing pale herself took him by the arm and helped him into the sittingroom and in her agitation poured him out a whole tumblerful of brandy which fortunately he only sipped a little recovered he explainedimproving his pallid complexion with blushes when he came to the pointthat he was returning to nova scotia as the doctor had ordered him a seavoyage and he wanted four or five pounds till he got to the other side when he would easily be able to repay the loan certainly my poor boy certainly said madame the idea of clever people having no money and people like me having plenty she ran upstairs and returned with ten of the sovereigns that she hoardedliterallyin her stocking but matt would not take more than five he felt it foolish to burden himself with superfluous temptations i knew you werent a rogue cried madame in thoughtless triumph the sentiment reminding her of the interrogative eyebrows she added hastily of course you wont tell my husband not that he would mind of course for i am helping you to leave the country but oh how i wish you had come to me instead of to herbert the dear boy has such hard work and so few pleasures and his allowance is so small that his father was naturally annoyed to think of your making the poor boy stint himself of course i made it up to herbert unbeknown to his father who would only return him a little of the money you had borrowed promise me you will not apply to herbert again you know it is so expensive living in paris i promise matt murmured hardly conscious of what madame was saying his soul already in nova scotia and dissolved in tenderness and gratitude the prospect of leaving london was as delightful as the prospect of coming to it had been not fifteen months ago ere he bade her farewell madame made him promise to come and see her when he was back in london again hoped the voyage would do him good and scolded him for never having shown her his pictures i am sure you will be a great artist she said smiling winsomely you have the artistic hand god bless you the young man listened unmoved he was hoping the ice would bear till he arrived in cobequid village and so with all his worldly goods including the unsaleable angelus packed in the smallest of satchels matt strang sailed back across the atlantic the blood clogged in his veins an unregarded unit of the countless myriads that london has allured and scorched chapter x matt receives sundry hospitalities but the prodigal son was not fated to see any of his relatives immediately upon his return to his native land except his mother and this was scarcely his mother this pale creature with eyes vacant of all save tears who babbled to him with heartrending verbal repetitions of revelation and the beast not even mistaking him for his dead father she had survived her life from halifax matt did not proceed forthwith to cobequid village joining instead a crew of mackerelfishers in the hope of earning enough to repay madame strang immediately for his soul reinvigorated by the seabreezes of the voyage and the skies of his childhood had returned to its healthy repugnance to debt and was ashamed of its lapse it was a mixed company that he sailed away withthe bulk decent nova scotians of old fisher stock but some rougher and more casual and a fewthough these were harmless enoughdespised portigees the fishing was not devoid of danger the men had to row out from the schooner in twos or threes to tend the nets spread on the mackerel banks and sometimes a fog would come on and ingulf the ship and the fishers with their mocking freight would row for hours and hours and at times for days and days on the ghostly sea in search of their floating home and sometimes they too would be swallowed up in the mystery of sea and fog and wives and mothers running anxiously to the wharf to meet them would learn that an older fisher had netted his prey to matt the hard work and the peril were alike welcome the very mists were poetry after the yellow charnelhouse vapors of london which now lay behind him like a nightmare and with it his dream of art his soul had swung round violently in the strain of hauling up the nets in the misty moonlight in the silence of sea and sky and night he found repose from his morbid craving to reproduce this mighty nature which stretched away all around him in large sane serenity as indifferent to the puny images of art as the waste of waters to the little dory rocking on its bosom and the rugged simplicity of his briny hornyhanded mates was equally restful after the garish brilliance of the young artists about town after all his heart was with homely folk went out to seafolk he was his fathers son and the brother of all those who go down to the sea in ships and do business in the great waters how like a childs cackle cornpeppers epigrams sounded across the silence of the lonely deep under the hushed stars touching the infinite spaces with awful beauty all these feverish figures of the smokingroom showed like fretful midges when the cruise was over and the spoil had been unloaded and sold on the fishy wharf or steeped in brine and packed in the vats matt was able to send ten dollars to england besides keeping up his usual allowance to cobequid village and maintaining himselfa triple task which weighed heavily upon his brain and gave him frequent moments of corroding nervous apprehension for his health was only partially reestablished and his correspondence with cobequid village was not reassuring his brothers and sisters were growing up without finding much to do billy moped a great deal and though he thanked his brother for the engraving of the angelus which matt sent him he intimated that he would have been better pleased had matt spent his money on books of travel and adventure for him and abner wrote with pathetic facetiousness that he was tolerable pleased that his brotherinlaw had not come home as they would have been mighty squeezed to put him up for what with the increase of abners own progeny and the growth of the strangs even the best room with the cane chairs had long since been turned into a bedroom though it could still be restored to its pristine magnificence on state occasions from the neighboring fishingground matt gravitated back to halifax his thoughts divorced from art centred on money his artistic fibre was coarser now than in those days of almost religious enthusiasm for art he had an idea of opening a drawingschool and becoming the local grainger but the initial funds were to seek he got a few drawinglessons but the stupidity of his pupils was maddening and his communion with their parents fretted him after the larger mind of london he feared he would have to take to the road again in search of sitters and the prospect of weary tramps in quest of patronizing storekeepers and farmers was not alluring even though that fine squeamish horror at the idea of art to order had been knocked out of him he was saved from the tramping by becoming assistant in a photographic caravan which toured the country leaving in each village a trail of attitudinizing inhabitants mounted and framed in the course of which campaign by a pleasanter stroke of fortune he painted the portraits of a minister of fisheries and of the cook he had married and so gained enough money to quit the caravan and start a carriagepainting shop in the village where the happy couple had their country home as the poorest inhabitants were carriagefolkfor horses and oats and hay were cheap and carriage taxes unknownmatt strang with a commercial instinct sharpened and an artistic interest blunted by miseries calculated to do well his signboard executed by his own hand ran carriages painted also sleighs house decorating portraits and drawinglessons the shop was a success ere the summer waned many of the villagers had their idle sleighs brilliantly illumined and when winter came their faded carriages were handed over to matt to be berouged or otherwise beautified each man had his equipage decorated after his own taste or whim though he always began by leaving it entirely to the artist one would order lemonyellow underworks with vermilion stripes and an olivegreen body for another the ideal of beauty lay in lake and russetandgreen while the fancy of a third would turn lightly to prussian blue and gold stripes and matt devoid now of artistic interest and thus of artistic irritability faithfully obeyed the behests of his employers and filled the leafy streets with a riotous motley of perambulating color the little village was pranked and rejuvenated it wore a sempiternally festive air the signboards were spickandspan the house fronts fresh and bright the vehicles gayly aglitter the glass windows of the stores black with selflaudatory lettering by day while at night the buff storeblinds repeated the brag and over all the village was a sense of wet paint thus did the artist throw a glamour over life and touch the sleeping souls of his fellows to livelier issues though his own interest in art was numb but prices were small and paid mainly in kind and when once the place was transmogrified there was nothing further to be done the latter items of his signboard evoking no response so matt shifted his ensign to starsborough a shipbuilding village on the coast where he found new scope for his versatile craftsmanship as witness two new items added to his painted prospectus figureheads carved ship decorating he got leave to set up in the shipyard speculated in a set of carvingtools and supplied the prows of the ships with those picturesque wooden persons whose uselessness is of the essence of art he occupied a corner in the calkers shop reeking with tarry odors and worked hemmed in by the oakumpickers who relieved the tedium of toil by smoking and singing lewd songs one of his works a turkish lady eight feet high to get which done in time cost him much sweat and sacrifice of other work pleased the shipbuilder so vastly that he gave matt the contractin preference to all the other candidates who sent in estimatesfor painting his next ship within and without the delighted young man saw his way to speedy competence the longtorpid thought of art began to stir drowsily only it was paris that now gleamed fitfully in the background of his daydreams he talked over the decorations with the shipbuilder and agreed to pay the men from week to week and to supply the tools paints and goldleaf till the job was completed when his employer undertook to pay him the sum agreed upon in actual coin as matt was able to get the materials from a store on three months credit and to pay his men with orders on the same allembracing store on the same terms and the job would be finished in less than three months the arrangement promised to be very profitable alas it proved the crash and breakdown of all his new prosperity in the middle of the work the shipbuilder failed heavily and matt found himself on the point of bankruptcy too for though he sent in his claim against the estate there seemed scant chance of his obtaining anything even the turkish woman had not been paid for matt having consented to receive her price with the rest of the money for the sake of getting silver in lieu of goods his account with the storekeeper had run up to he could not see how to meet his bills the weeks without other work had exhausted his savings there was even about a fourth of his debt still to be sent to madame strang he got other little jobs but the great shipwrights failure had reduced starsborough to stagnation the time of payment drew nigh after sleepless nights of anguish he went to the storekeeper and told him he could not pay the man received him sympathetically said he had been expecting the confession and consented to give him a little time so matt broke up his establishment and journeyed by train and packet to another village nearer halifax and set up his signboard afresh a job took him to the capital and in the streets he ran across his starsborough creditor who was come up to order hardware and who apparently delighted to see him invited him to breakfast with him at his hotel next morning always glad to save a meal and rejoiced to find his creditor so genial and debonair matt tramped into town the first thing in the morning and repaired to the hotel but there was no breakfast for him a sheriffs officer awaited him instead and arrested him for debt he had been the victim of a subterfuge his creditor fearing from his migratory movements that he was about to run off to the states and so matt was clapped into the prison to await his trial and became one of the brokendown band that inhabited its spacious ward promenaded the long whitewashed corridor on which the lavatory gave and slept on the iron beds ranged against the wall every morning the bedclothes were stripped off and piled in the empty cells to give the ward a more habitable air in this dreary bed and sitting room matt spent days of mental agony though physically he fared better than under his own parsimonious rgime but the sense of degradation outweighed all else he felt he could never look his fellowmen in the face again his character was gone his ambitions had received their deathblownay his very business career in his native land was at an end the stigma would always soil his future all the long travail and aspiration had ended at what a goal he could not understand the careless merriment of his fellowprisoners who fleeted the time with cards which they played for love there was a negro among them who was the whetstone of their wit and a frenchman who varied his tearful narrative of the misfortune that had brought him low with ventriloquial performances and anecdotes of selfmade yankee millionaires in this gesticulating little man matt recognized with surprise and shamefacedness his ancient fractious subordinate in the halifax furniture shop who had taken him to his bosom after due alcohol but he was glad to find his unconscious fellow made no advances at moments he forced himself to look for the comic bohemian side of the situation to imagine cornpeppers superiority to a debtors prison the artist sublime amid the ruins of his credit snorting disdain for the absurd institutions of the bourgeois but neither this nor philosophy availed to shake his sense of shame he summoned the infinite to his aid saw himself again rocking on the little dory between sea and sky and asked himself what anything mattered in this vast of space and time but these excursions of the intellect left instinct unmoved from childhood the word jail had been fraught with shuddering associations they could not be argued away strangs aloofness from his companions even when an outside friend had sent in liquor or dainties to one of them attracted the notice of the jailer a kindly man in a cutaway coat with only an official cap to mark his calling he talked to the sullen brooding prisoner conceived a liking for him and commissioned him to paint his portrait for ten dollars supplying the materials himself and providing a temporary easel the darkness that had threatened matts reason if not his life fled before this kindness the days before the trial flew by almost joyously and the nights were rendered more tolerable by being passed alone on a plank bed in one of the criminal cells whose stout doors studded with iron nails and furnished with little gratings rarely held anybody so that the painter easily persuaded his patron to allow him to occupy it he had scarcely set up his easel when his companions clustered round and the frenchman burst into tears of emotion and professed that he toohe who spoke to youwas an artist if only some one could see the creditor who had thrown him into prison and explain to him that his victim was guiltless of all save genius as matt had heard all this before he pursued his work unmoved affording a new distraction to his mates so that the negros life became endurable and less love was lost at cards but ere the second sitting was over the frenchman who had studied alternately the artists face and his canvas uttered an exclamation of joyous recollection and fell upon his neck crying that he had at last found again the comrade of his soul when matt had shaken him off he drew a romantic picture of their early affection and collaboration for the edification of the salon and henceforth took a proud fraternal interest in the progress of the portrait the picture turned out better than matt had expected to his own surprise he found himself painting more vigorously than ever his hand instead of having lost its cunning seemed to have gained by the rest the jailer was well content and promised two and a half dollars over and above the price but as matt had expressed his intention of sending the money to his creditor his new friend held over the surplus till he should need it for himself when at the end of the third week the trial came on and matt swore out solemnly asserting absolute impecuniosity his creditor mollified by the ten dollars and further assuaged by the sale of matts effects from his tools to his signboard did not press the counterproof of competency and so the prisoner was set at liberty sundry other bankrupts swore out at the same time one or two who had boasted privily of their means perjuring themselves back to freedom and prosperity before matt strang bade farewell to the jail the frenchman broke off a ventriloquial performance to beseech him with tears in the name of the camaraderie of art and for the sake of their ancient affection now that he was going forth into the free sunshine to expostulate with that cruel creditor and plead for unhappy genius the persecutorcoble by namewould not listen to his own appeals but if a brotherartist would speak for him cobles better natureand every man had a better naturemight be touched and the skylark might soar freely again towards the blue empyrean he was quite honestoh heaven yes he did not really possess two hundred dollars as coble imagined but he could not account for them before the courtone would see whythough privately he could account for them in a way that would satisfy every honest man some emissary of satan had put a bill into his hand which said for a hundred dollars we will give you a thousand dollars of our goods he had hankered as any man might after those thousand dollars and sought out the coiners for all the world knew that was their formula and paid his hundred dollars but the bag of coin they had given him was snatched from him on his road back by one of their agents determined not to be outwitted he had gone again and invested another hundred dollars and posted the parcel to himself at a neighboring postoffice but when it arrived he had found only a brickbat inside he had been afraid to swear out lest coble should maintain he had the money and thus get him indicted for perjury if the friend of his youth would lay these facts before the cruel coble he would no longer languish in a dungeon would not the great artist promise him the story seemed too strange to be false and matt promised at the risk of a kiss to recount it to the cruel coble though he failed to see how it proved the frenchmans honesty he was indeed not sorry to have something definite to do for with the completion of the jailers portrait had come a reaction and he had lapsed if not into his first agony into a listless apathy that was worsethe nerveless purposeless inertia of a crushed spirit he had been in jail not even a miracle could erase that blot upon his name how could he take up the burden of life afresh unless perhaps temporarily with the sole object of wiping off the debt which he owed morally though no longer legally anyway he would see this mr coble the frenchman seemedcuriously enoughto attach value to life and if a little bit of his own life could be of any use to the poor weak creature it was at his disposal mr coble too must be a strange person to derive any satisfaction from keeping the pygmy in prison in revenge for the loss of a few hundred dollars money money money how it had cramped and crippled and defiled his life he washed himself in the lavatory before leaving and brushed his clothes which were in a very fair condition he was startled to find how many gray hairs streaked the curly locks he combed it wont be a monochrome much longer he thought surveying his mane with bitter merriment outside it was may but he was not brightened by the great blue sky that roofed him once more the bustle of life sounded pleasantly about him but he slunk through the busy quarters of the town with hanging head as if every passerby could read his shame in his face the horrible thought struck him suddenly that coble would know whence he came but on top of it came the happy idea of explaining he had only gone to the jail to paint the portrait of an official the journey was not very long though the road was muddy and steep mr coble lived beyond citadel hill amid whose grassy expanse a path wound towards the more scattered portions of the town the ice was quite off the sunny fields except in the shaded parts under the fences and men were ploughing with yokes of oxen though here and there heapedup piles of snow still bordered the route which they flooded with slush in their gradual deliquescence mr cobles suburban residence was a detached doublefronted wooden cottage barred from the road by a neat whitepainted picketfence there were attics in the roof which like its neighbors was pitched with broad eaves for the sliding down of the snow the front garden had been newly dug up and laid out to receive seed there was a dirty line round the house showing where the winter embanking had recently been removed matt pushed open the white picket gardengate and walked up the gravel path towards the pillared porch three wooden steps led to the little platform and then the door was raised one step higher to prevent snow drifting in from without matt knocked he heard the inner door open the patter of light footsteps then the outer door swung back and a girlpassably prettyappeared in the little entry between the doors which were thus duplicated against the frost matt lifted his hat and inquired for mr coble he had reverted to the drawling accents of the colony though not altogether to its locutions oh pas down at the store answered the girl staring at the visitor when will he be in matt asked disappointed oh not for hours said miss coble is it anything i can tell him no no i dont think so matt replied hesitatingly i had better call again this evening the girl lingered silently without closing the door there was a perceptible pause yes she answered at last i guess you had he raised his hat again and went down the gravel path at the gardengate it struck him that he ought to have inquired the address of the store in town and so saved a second journey he turned his head and saw the girl still at the door looking after him then it seemed funny to go back he shut the gate hastily and pursued his way to town down the muddy road wondering what he would do next and how he could cope with life the thought of the frenchman brought up the memory of that furniture warehouse in which they had worked together in the days of his boyish dreams he bent his steps towards it with a vague thought of seeking work there again but found it had been converted into an emporium for sewingmachines as he sauntered aimlessly down the street his eye was caught by a lurid picture in a store window it represented a shark snapping savagely at a diver upon the bed of the ocean he smiled at the crude composition which reminded him of his own early works then as he perceived its relation to the stockintrade his smile became broader sponge was the staple and a gigantic delicate sponge with ornamental spoutholes and fragments of rock adhering realistically to it was a conspicuous object amid dandybrushes and spokebrushes and chamoisleather and glass cases covering rockwork there were little sponges on a card and matt started violently as he read cobles fivecent sponges the mountain had come to mahomet he walked in crunching over a dbris of shells grit and sand and inhaling a pungent saline odor a veritable mountain of a man towered over him with beetling brows and snowy hair and beard his paunch protruded imposingly and his eyes glittered mr coble said matt inquiringly thats me cried the mountain of flesh in fierce accents as if defying contradiction matt felt the business would not be easy ive taken the liberty of coming to youon behalf of not that tarnation frenchman shrieked mr coble matt reddened uncomfortably thats the fifth man hes sent me when did you come out of prison ive been painting the jailers portrait matt stammered with burning cheeks and i used to know the poor little man years ago and he says i cant listen now does he think ive no business to attend to he didnt send me here he sent me to your house ho thats a new dodge but i reckon he told you the old things ehthat im a stonyhearted cuss that id sneak the coppers off a corpses eyes or squeeze a cent till the eagle squeaked no really he didnt tell me that said matt oh you neednt spare the old mans feelings i know what a man says when he finds you wont be swindled hes the everlastingest old dodger that ever drummed for me his tricks ould puzzle a philadelphia lawyer the only honest bit of work he ever did in his life was that thar pictur of a shark thats stunnin i admit and id willingly let the poor devil out of the cage if my darter warnt so bitter agen him there thats the truth i never told it to any of the other fellows they all looked such moulty jailbirds say now you said you were a painter aint that a good pictur although mr cobles words were now more amiable his accent was still fierce and it required some courage on matts part to reply that the picture was pretty good in a manner that betokened that it was pretty bad ho two of a trade quoth the mountain of a man the shark couldnt be like that matt explained mildly he has to turn on his back before biting it isnt true to life waal said mr coble in irate tones as the sharks got nothing at all to do with the sponge business and the divers aint in no sort o danger whatever from it i dont see where truth to life comes in anyhow oh but the less lies you tell in art the better urged matt ill do you another if you like ho thats your dodge is it im not asking anything for it the young man retorted indignantly it ll be a return for your listening to my appeal mr coble was startled thunderation he cried sharply youre a christian step outside and well liquor up the invitation was uttered so fiercely that it sounded like a command especially as the titan stamped three times with his footonly his way of signalling to his subordinate matt found in the nearest bar which happened to be an illicit one approached through a porch at the back of a temperance hotel for the convenience of avowed teetotalers the manmountain imparted to matt the information that it was the frenchmans amorous advances that had imbittered his daughter for my part he said so far from wantin to keep him in there in clover id like to lift him out on the point of my toe and id make him vamoose from the town that smart you couldnt see his heels for the dust ill mention it to rosina that youve been putting in a good word for the skunk but i dont think shell listen thats a fact oh but im sure she will said matt she looks a kindhearted young lady you havent seen her exclaimed mr coble fiercely yes i saw her this afternoon said matt then youve seen the purtiest gal youll see this year set em up again this old ryes whopping good always rely on a temperance hotel for good whiskey and as my gal has a goodish bit of money pursued the old man smacking his lips and growing communicative without losing any of the sternness of his accent you can understand what made the wretched little froggy roll his eyes and twist his mustache at her how he found it out will be a mystery to my dyin day for im careful never to breathe a whisper of it to a single soul but he ferreted out somehow or tother that when shes twentyone my rosie will step into an income of eight hundred dollars he shouted the statement so loudly that the whole bar pricked up its ears matt quite believed that coble was incapable of whispering anything to anybody he had a vague envy of the fortunate girl not to mention three thousand dollars ive put aside myself to hand her on her weddingday continued coble young folks are lucky nowadays when i married i had to lend my fatherinlaw ten dollars to rig himself up respectable for church before they parted the mountain of flesh had consented thunderously to matts supplying another picture of the dangers of spongefishing but would not bind himself although in his third glass to do more in return than lay the matter before his daughter once alone in the streets again matt felt he had made a bad bargain the two and a half dollars the jailer had given him were all his funds and even the few nickels that would have to be expended on common watercolors and the doubleroyal cardboard were a consideration but he loyally executed the work in the bedroom he had ventured to take finding rather a relief in this further postponement of the problem of his future by the following afternoon he was back at cobles with a brilliant sketch far more arrestive than the frenchmans the shark was more formidable the nude diver more graceful his netted bag more accurate and the oceanbed was a veritable fairyland of sealichens and polyps coble glared long at the sketch as matt held it up but he said nothing what do you think of it asked matt apprehensively at last what do i think of it roared old coble and rushing to the window he grabbed the old inaccurate shark tore it savagely in two snatched the new picture from the hands of the astonished matt filled up the vacancy with it dashed outside to survey it from the sidewalk and reappearing at the door bellowed step this way young man and stamped three times on the threshold over the old rye he reported to the artist that he had found his rosie more placable than usual that she was even willing to listen to the young mans plea though she seemed to want to hear it from his own mouth before deciding matt gladly consented to sup that evening with the mountain and his daughter free drinks never surprised him but a free square meal was like having larks flying into ones mouth ready roasted it was the happiest evening he had spent for many a long day there was a spotless cloth on the round table and the food was good if solid miss coble made herself agreeable and if she was not so pretty as her father saw her her plump cheek was sufficiently rosy and her figure sufficiently comely and her frock sufficiently nice to be grateful to the eye of an artist and a young man just emerged from prison society and starving for the amenities of life her lightblue eyes lit up pleasantly when he addressed her or when she helped him to more griddlecakes some stuffed birds over a low bookcase that contained a few brightly bound volumes reminded him pleasurably of past miseries the stentorian voice of old coble almost monopolized the conversation he had much to say that was not worth listening toon the bad crops of the year before last the scarcity of helps and the failure of the colony to go ahead which was apparently connected with the uncleanliness of the inhabitants as manifest from the small sales of bathsponges after dinner the mountain smoked and after smoking the volcano slept im afraid you think pas got a bad temper said miss coble abruptly she had hastily cleared away the supper dishes and had seated herself half recumbent amid a litter of sewing upon a couch opposite the easychair which matt now occupied the young man instinctively glanced towards her trumpeting parent oh hes sound enough cant you hear she said laughing gayly i only hope he doesnt disturb you im used to it i only hope i shant disturb him answered matt i guess hes making more noise than us laughed miss coble he cant even be quiet when hes asleep i was going to explain to you that he cant help it theres something wrong with his throat it happened when his voice broke in his boyhood and it always sounds as if he was angryit always frightens off strangers but he is really the besttempered papa in the township matt smiled i did think he was rather a fireeater at first he admitted but ive found him real jolly and couldnt quite make it out all this time he continued to smile at the drollness of cobles disability and the girls eyes met his in an answering gleam of merriment pa says youre a powerful painter mr strang she said after a silence filled up by ruttling sounds from pas larynx oh your pas only seen a rough thing i did for him he protested diffidently never mind she shook her head sagely im going down town to see it tomorrow and she flashed a sunny smile at him that showed her teeth were white matt murmured uneasily oh its not worth the trouble itll do me good anyway im getting fat pa says wouldnt it be awful if i was to take after him you know he lives away from town so as to have exercise up and down citadel hill but he might as well have lived over the store and she giggled not unmusically you cant tell what he would have been matt reminded her with a smile gracious you frighten me he might have come through the walls do you think there is really any danger of my growing like him do tell theres no danger of your losing your good looks replied matt gallantly you mean i never had any she said with a roguish gleam that made the plump face piquant oh you know what i mean he protested lamely miss coble meditatively picked up a piece of tape from the litter of sewing and put it round her waist then she measured her bust is that the proper proportion she said holding it up artists are supposed to know arent they the figure couldnt be better said matt the girl shook her head in laughing reproof i guess id better measure you and prove it then said matt rising my how that lamp flares cried miss coble rushing towards the table and carefully fumbling with the regulator matt resumed his seat feeling rather foolish but soon when the girl turned the talk on himself the reserved solitary young man found himself telling her of adventures by sea and land which he had not told anybody perhaps because nobody had ever asked him he gave halifax prison a wide berth warding off her casual questions about his position and prospects by general statements about his artistic aspirations concerning aspects of london life miss cobles curiosity was at its keenest her own experience of existence having been limited she said to halifax and its environs with faint childish reminiscences of greencastle pennsylvania where her mother had died thirteen years before when she was six years old oh but i didnt mean to tell you my age she said pouting in ten years time you will know i am nearly thirty matt was about to reassure her by declaring that in ten years time he would have forgotten all about her when the fall of the sleepers pipe checked the unchivalrous statement he rose to go as soon as the mountain awoke for he had a goodish tramp before him miss coble accompanied him to the outer door his eye was caught by the beauty of the moon gleaming irregularly from a lurid rack of clouds he stood in charmed silence gazing upward what are you staring at arent you going to say goodnight asked miss coble rather tartly his spirit returned to earth oh goodnight he said holding out his hand she put her fingersrougher but warmerinto his for the first time goodnight she said softly he did not let her hand go immediately at the last instant he was invaded by an indefinite conviction that somethinghe knew not whathad still to be done or said he stood silent on the little platform as if echoing his thought havent you forgot something she asked his heart leaped violently with a thrilling suggestion he looked into her quizzing eyes they were on a level with his own her shorter figure having the advantage of the raised threshold i thought you came to speak to me about a frenchman she went on he was relieved and disappointed of course what a fool i am i havent said a word about him well its too late now i cant stand talking here the neighbors might see us im so sorry said matt in a woebegone tone well youll have to come again tomorrow evening then if you want to go on with it thats certain goodnight again till tomorrow then said matt raising his hat he walked briskly down the gravelpath glowing with the pleasure of the evening and looking forward to another pleasant free meal on the morrow then his eye sought the moon again but the cloudrack had covered it up entirely chapter xi a hostage to fortune lying awake next morning after a night of troubled dreams it flashed upon him that he ought scarcely to go and see miss coble again upon the mere impulsive invitation given on the doorstep without her fathers knowledge he was angry with illustration goodnight she said softly himself for having so curiously let himself drift away from the very purpose of his visit he concluded he had best call on old coble again at the store and walked thither with hangdog mien unable even now to shake off the jail old coble was sorting out a bale of sponge into three basketsone for bests one for seconds and one for thirds hello young man he roared matt felt a momentary trepidation before he remembered that the old man meant his tones to be inviting he crunched his way towards the mountain over the gritty dbris sniffing in the pungent aroma of the place the old giant straightened himself brushed the sand off each hand with the other and running his fingers through his white beard by way of combing that held out his hairy paw to matt he gripped the young mans long fingers heartily then waved him to a seat on an empty inverted spongebox i hope im not interrupting you said matt not at all said coble in angry accents there was a pause i made a fool of myself last night matt commenced abruptly coble looked down inquiringly at him i didnt say one word to your daughter about the frenchman he continued ruefully the mountain shook with explosive laughter ho i suppose you were too taken up sayin em about yourself matt reddened uncomfortably but was silent the gal seems to know a powerful deal about you anyway said old coble with a homeric chuckle we had to talk about something matt explained apologetically well rosie doesnt pear to want to talk about anything else thats a fact i reckon she was glad enough not to be reminded of the snivellin frenchy oh but ive got to tell her the young man urged uneasily oh yes she knows youve got to tell her youre coming tonight arent you i thought of it matt stammered taken aback if i might ho dont you be afraid of us we dont bite we aint sharks he spat out this gritty atmosphere makes one powerful dry matt had an instant of intense mental conflict impecuniosity contending with his instinct of what was due to the situation and cobles past hospitalities will you liquor with me he said i was just about to ask you that and the mountain stamped his foot three times the moment the two glasses were set on the counter of the little secret bar matt threw down a ringing dollar with careless magnificence coble put his paw on it and pushed it back to him throwing down a rival dollar there was a playful scuffle of shoving fingers accompanied by expostulatory murmurs then matt rejoicing in defeat resignedly pocketed his vanquished piece what do you make out of that there paintin business suddenly asked coble as he set down his halfemptied glass and lounged reposefully against the counter matt took another sip of whiskey oh there are ups and downs he said well whats the uppiest up it depends said matt vaguely if i could succeed in london theres no end to the money i might make it isnt unusual to get three or four thousand dollars for a picture three or four thousand dollars roared the titan where do you think i was raised why my uncle in london has often paid five thousand dollars for a picture yes and even ten though thats usually after the painters dead then why dont you go to london i cant afford it said matt frankly ive been there but its a great job to get on without money so i had to come back but couldnt your uncle buy your pictures they werent good enough yet matt explained anxious to defend the family honor i want to study a lot more yet nonsense what do you want to study for why that thar shark of yours licks creation matt shook his head ive got to go to paris he said and to italy and see all the great pictures thats the only way a man can learn after a certain point he added proudly my cousin was sent to paris by the royal academy of london he won the gold medal why doesnt your uncle send you there then he pears to have made his pile matt had to take another sip of whiskey before he could reply he knows i wouldnt take anything from anybody dont be a goney i began life with high notions them thar sponges you saw me sortin out just nowtheyre florida cup grasses but the fineshaped ones in the first basket are goin to be levantine sponges soon as they are bleached with permanganate time was when id a thought that dishonest now i see its only the outsides o things that the world wants when youre a boss painter nobody ll ask who bleached you i hope i can get on without bleaching matt retorted ho dont get mad i dont mean to insinuate youre not genuine but the world aint a soft place to get on in they dont bath you with rosewater and turkey firsts i kinder fancy he added with a roguish twinkle you must have found that out of late now what you want mr strang is to marry a purty levelheaded healthy gal with two or three thousand dollars to tide over the time till you can make your five thousand a pictur matt shot a startled glance at cobles beaming face what he read there supplemented the sensational suggestion of the titans words a nervous thrill ran through all his body the thought was like a lightningflash at once swift dazzling and terrifying but without waiting to analyze his state of mind he felt immediately that there was one thing which at the outset rendered the idea impossible honesty required that he should instantly put a stop to the parents overtures by informing him that he was a dishonored manthat he had been in prison but still he shrank from selfexposure the union was so impossible that it seemed superfluous to humiliate himself maybe he replied but five thousands only the uppiest up as you call it if i didnt get there i might be thought a humbug oh any smart man who saw that shark would take the risk of that and even if you didnt get to the uppiest up there d be no fear of your coming down again to the downiest down matt turned his eyes away and his fingers tattooed nervously on the stem of his glass that frenchy friend of yours now he had the sense and the sarse to want my gal but of course no proper parent would trust his darter to a man like that so there he lays in the downiest downgood name for jail eh ho ho matt wished his companion could moderate his accents he did not relish this thunderous talk of jail well i must be going now he said im with you im with you genially thundered coble sauntering after him into the sunny street you just think that pointer o mine over it lets you keep your independence and your high notions and you aint indebted to anybody all youve got to do is to find a purty gal whos got money and who wont fool it away a gal whos been raised simply and can do her own cookin and make her own dresses and dont play the pianner you find a gal like that with a sensible father that dont think wuss of a young man because hes been in the downiest down you know matt faltered he came to a halt of course i know warnt it in the paper but i did paint the portrait of the jailer he protested his cheeks fiery i knew youd been in chokey all the same coble clapped his paw on the last button of his waistcoat a stomach that size warnt born yesterday but ive kept it from rosie she dont understand business nor how credits a fair wind today and tomorrow a tornado tearin around and layin everything low you find a good father pursued coble in accents as impersonal as they were angry so that matt fancied he had mistaken the titans import and convince him your folks are respectable and theres no wife foolin around in london or new york city and here he resumed his walk if he dont jump at youillwaal im blamed if i dont give you my own darter there what he would have replied to this wager matt never knew for with a sudden cry of thunderation the sharks stolen the mountain bounded forward with incredible alacrity and dashed into the store but it was his own child who was the temporary thief matt following mr coble back into the store to see if his picture had been really paid the compliment of appropriation found father and daughter bending admiringly over it as it stood on the counter propped up against some large coarse grasssponges his heart beat faster with surprise and excitement hullo you here said rosina raising a face that seemed radiant amid the dull browns and grays of the store i didnt know you would be here he answered awkwardly not knowing what to reply why didnt i tell you yesterday i was coming she looked roguishly at him from beneath the broad brim of her flowerwreathed hat whose narrow blackvelvet strings were tied coquettishly under her left ear so you did i forgot he said you seem to forget everything she responded pertly yes hes lost his head altogether roared old coble thank you for reminding me said matt eagerly now you are here i can tell you what the frenchman says bother the frenchman said miss coble pouting yes but hes languishing in prison this fine bright day mr strang painted the jailers portrait thats how he met the rogue old coble interrupted and he often cries went on matt miss coble laughed gracious you make me feel like a princess keeping men in dungeons well thats how you ought to feel said matt then i guess ill take the privilege of a princess said miss coble ill let him out on my weddingmorn coble roared with laughter there thats a fair offer for you my boy matt felt very embarrassed but he ventured to hope for the poor devils sake that miss coble would get married soon i hope not said coble to matts relief youre forgettin this poor devil what am i to do without my rosie oh youll get along all right said miss coble with a playful tug at his drooping white beard you can send for aunt clara i wish youd be serious about the poor man in the prison matt pleaded i am serious miss coble insisted indignantly oh yes shes serious interposed the parent shes solid is rosie you cant squeeze her like this ere sponge pears to me the only way to help your man is to hurry on the marriage the advent of a customer here removed him chuckling from the conversation and while he was talking angrily to the newcomer matt who had been itching to slip away found himself compelled to linger on and entertain the young lady a task which he ended by finding pleasant enough when she at last said she must go about her marketing he even asked if there was anything he could carry for her gracious no we get the things sent but you can walk along if you have nothing better to do so matt threaded his way with her among the busy stores feeling her a part of the sunny freshness of the day to which he was now alive again and walking with head erect for he felt himself rehabilitated by the companionship of so genteel a member of society he was amused by the keen bargains she drove and acquired a new interest in prices evidently coble was rightshe would make a provident housekeeper but she would only let him see her part of the way home though she told him papa expected him to join their evening meal hes taken quite a fancy to you she said i dont know why im sure i dont know why either said matt simply perhaps thats why miss coble answered enigmatically then she lent him her gloved fingers for a moment and gave him a pleasant smile and tripped away and he went back and down to the waterside and lounged about aimlessly in the sun sky and sea and shipping and the glimpses of hill and forest across the harbor and the white seagulls and the bronzed scandinavian sailors thrilling him with the old sense of the beauty and romance of life but the open air gave him an appetite too and the appetite brought him back to the sordidness of things to his nighbare pockets and the insistent sphinx of his future he laid out a few cents to stave off hunger till evening should bring better fare at cobles then in the stronger mood induced by even this minimum of nutriment a tiresome inner voice began asking by what right he meditated foisting himself upon strangers he had no longer the excuse of the frenchman he had heard miss cobles ultimatum on that matter and the tiresome voice persisted in dragging up other troublesome thoughts from the depths of consciousness as he walked about the lively quays it kept repeating mr cobles observations though less loudly despite some dubious remarks despite the priori improbability and unexpectedness of the whole thing was it possible for matt to doubt that the old man would be willing to give him his daughter with whatever timidity he shrank from facing the possibility wilfully closing his eyes as before a great glare he could not but feel that cobles idea was both rash and generous of course his future would justify the old mans trust and repay it a hundredfold but such confidence was none the less touching coble did not knowthe sun and sea had made the young man drunk againthat he was entertaining a genius and miss coble too how kind of her to be so nice to a penniless young man her pleasant smiles had been medicinal sunshine to his despairing apathy if he had not met the cobles what would have become of him but was the girl quite of her fathers mind towards him her attitude was certainly not repellent he allowed himself to dally undisguisedly with the idea and it made him giddy the hope of art flamed again so fiercely that he wondered how it could have lain smouldering so long in his bosom he was like a pedestrian toiling footsore and heartbroken towards a great light that shone celestially on the verge of the horizon for years he had followed the sacred gleam over lonely deserts and waste places with hunger and thirst and pain and now as with bleeding feet that could drag along no longer he was fain to drop down on the wayside lo a sound of wheels and a sudden carriage at his side and he had but to step in to be driven luxuriously to the longtantalizing goal and in this fairy carriage moreover sat a pretty maiden on whose ripe breast he could pillow his tired head and in whose arms he could find consolation for the blank years oh it was bewildering dazzling intoxicating but did he love the maiden of this enchanting vision well what was love it would certainly be sweet to hold her warm hand in his to see her blue eyes soften with tenderness as they gazed into his own it was so long since a woman had kissed himsuch weary crawling barren years that ancient episode with priscilla came up as it had not seldom done before transfigured by the haze of time and the afterglamour of romance he had long since forgotten how little the girl had really appealed to him in the flesh and to remember that he had spurned her caresses did not always give him a glow of moral satisfaction in the delicious sunshine that danced today in a myriad gleams on the green waters and made the air like wine lurked a subtle appeal to his mere manhood were not all women equally lovable for their sex in the novels and poems he had read love was glorified and woman was a spirit in his own soul lay divine conceptions of womanhood that inspired his art and sanctified his dreams a womanhood whose bodily incarnationimagined now in this gracious shape now in thatwas the outer symbol of an inner loveliness of thought and emotion but he had not met this ideal womanhood nor did he even expect to meet it in the crude common day once or twice in his london life as in his boyhood in this very city of halifax when he had worshipped the beautiful horsewoman he had seemed to catch a glimpse of it but it was always far offas far as the star from the moth and so whether seen or divined it belonged almost equally to that world of imagination in which his true life had been lived in which he had always taken refuge from the real he had scarcely known before a girl so refined as miss coble unless perhaps it was the adolescent ruth hailey whose shy stateliness had made her so alien from the little girl he dimly remembered taking for a sweetheart in those days of childish mimicry when one drives broomsticks for horses why should he not marry this pleasant plump young woman if she would condescend to him though her position was so much better than his he did not feel her too remote from him for comfortable companionship especially as she would never know that he had been in jail if he did not love her in the vague transcendental sense at least he did not love any other woman and was never likely to he was not as other men his life was not in their world it was centred on art it was occupied with visions its goal was not happiness or a home but if these offered themselves to him by the way even while they made his real goal possible it were mere insane selfmartyrdom to refuse them a wife would save him from his lower self and in his moments of artistic despair she would always be there to comfort and console nayand he smiled at the considerationeven in his moments of artistic achievement she could be there as a model models ran away with a great deal of money and for an artist a wife was really an economy and if in his artistic aspiration she could have no share neither could any one else woman or man an artist could not really have a mateat most a mistress or a housekeeper his art was a holy of holies in which he must ever be the sole priest and in this holy of holies ideal womanhood could still have its place as before such are the pitfalls of the artistic temperament moving amid unrealities spinning its own cosmos three thousand dollars down he could pay off the storekeeper and cleanse away the prison stain he could send madame strang her little balance and best of alland the thought moved him almost to tearshis poor brothers and sisters would henceforth be certain of their allowance for himself the prospects were equally temptinga honeymoon in europe in the cities of romantic dream amid the masterpieces of art and then when after a couple of years of study and work his own masterpiece should be completed a settled income of eight hundred dollarsbread and cheese always sure putting him for life beyond the vulgar necessity of pandering to the market rescuing him from that sordid internal conflict which imbittered even when it failed to degrade oh the rapture of a life so consecrated to art but would miss coble or her parent consent to this expenditure of the money of course it would all have to be distinctly understood ere he could agree to marry the girl he flushed finding how mercenary motive predominated in his reverie mr coble had indeed hinted acquiescence in some such scheme but an instinct kept the young man from concluding to acquiesce in it himself a vague shame and repugnance struggled with his sense of the advantages of the match waxing so strong in the reaction that followed the glow of temptation that he determined not to go to the cobles that evening this visit he felt would be fatal he went home to his little room in the central slums determined not to stir out he had meant to go to bed broad day though it was and sleep away the temptation but he only threw himself upon the pallet in his clothes and was more conscious of hunger than of the heaviness necessary for sleep yet he would not break into his last two dollars today he tried to divert his mind from miss cobles dowry by alternative projects for continuing his life but they only served to show the length of the bleak arid solitary road that lay before his bruised feet if he let the carriage go by money money money what had he not suffered from the struggle for it degrading to live on another persons money it was life without money that was degrading humiliating full of petty considerations consumed in irrelevant labors in the novels that made such a fuss about love troubles the finesounding sorrows seemed to him infinitely smaller than the carks and worries of prosaic existence he dozed a little and dreamed of his mother he was back in childhood standing with bare feet in an icy passage and she was screaming at harriet for refusing to marry mr coble he went through all the old agony of these frequent domestic tragedies but he did not feel cold so much as hungry and breakfast was being delayed by the squabble he heard daisy equally aggrieved lowing in the barn in the face of the advantages of the coble marriage it did seem unreasonable of harriet to stick to bully preep who would probably beat her he awoke with a sensation of relief which was instantly exchanged for a new worry ought he to tell the cobles about his mother supposing he really thought ofbut no he did not think ofand in any case there was no use in raking up unpleasant matters he had not inherited her dementia it was not in her blood it had grown up gradually from the sad narrow circumstances of her lot it was his father that he took after he was not mad he was more likely to go mad if he continued his terrible solitary struggle unless indeedand here came a sudden vision of a scene that had lain forgotten for long yearsunless indeed mad peggy had been right mad matt oh no it was madness to attach any meaning to the waterdrinkers words never had he felt so sane he got up and looked into the dusty glass on the washstand that was not the face of a madman she had prophesied he would never be happynever never he would thirst and thirst for happiness but never would he quench his thirst ah the crazy creature was right there anyhow he watched with curious interest the tears rolling down the face in the mirror well be it so he was strong he could dispense with happiness he would not go to the cobles that evening tomorrow he would leave halifax and join his folks in cobequid at last they would all live out their lives togetherpoor victims of a common destiny he would work on the farm he would rent more land he would make it pay his uncle had been right all along why had he not taken his advice and stayed on at cattermoles farm ah well his dream of art was over now he was getting on in years the energy had been buffeted out of him one could not always be young and ambitious he would never be famous now he would toil obscurely like his brothers and sisters and his bones would lie with theirs in the little lonesome churchyard among the pines it did not matter nothing mattered death would shovel them all away soon enough he lay down on the bed again near it stood a washstand with a piece of ragged sponge upon it his eye noted a patch of light on the sponge and he wondered how the sunshine had got there then he perceived the yellow patch was only a reflection from the waterbottle and his thoughts turned to the problem of painting sunlight by optical illusion he thought of cornpepper and the fellows and all the happy discussions he had had in london the afternoon waned into evening the patch of mock sunshine faded the shadows gathered shrouding the walls with mystery he grew faint with hunger in the dusk there opened out a picture of a lamplit room with a snowy cloth on its round table and a plump figure with soft blue eyes presiding over the savory dishes the vision drew him he rose washed himself carefully and went out a month later a week before his marriage matt strang journeyed to cobequid to see his folks and bid them farewell before leaving for his artistic honeymoon in europe he had written the news home but they could not afford to come to halifax for the wedding and so he had promised to run down before starting on his second voyage in search of art he alighted from the coach at cobequid village overwhelmed with emotion resolved to walk the rest of the way towards the joyous reunion with his brothers and sisters he wished to note each familiar landmarkthe fields the farms the stores the little meetinghouse all the beloved features of the spacious scattered wooden metropolis of his childhood it was almost noon and the landscape seen through the waves of hot air rising from the soil quivered in the heat the white farmhouses glittered the paint of the verandas bulged out the wooden spire of the meetinghouse pointed piously to a heaven of stainless blue in the farmyards the fowls lolled prostrate on their sides with open mouths and drooping wings their tongues protruding their eyes closed their legs every now and then uneasily stirring up the dust under their wings the cattle and horses stood deep in pools under the trees the bumblebees droned sleepily about the wild roses of the wayside or buzzed among the whiteweed and yellow buttercups and dandelions that mottled the hayfields the red squirrels chattered on the spruces as they sat shelling cones their tails curved over their backs the woodpeckers tapped on the hollow stubs the bluejays screamed among the branches a hawk circled tranquilly upward to a speck then sailed softly downward with motionless wings outspread in the fields men were hoeing potatoes following the slow oxen that dragged the ploughs between the furrows and heaping up the earth with leisurely monotonous movements belated sowers of buckwheat were scattering the triangular grains with a slow measured hypnotic motion in the sultry stores there was nothing doing now and then a storekeeper in his shirtsleeves spat solemnly or drawled a lazy monosyllable behind a casement a slumbrous old crone snuffed herself a wagon rumbled dustily beneath the overarching trees the farstretching village drowsed in the sun high noon the conches began sounding to call the farmhands to dinner and every sign of labor melted away the languor crept over the young pedestrian a perception of the futility of ambition flooded his soul like a wave of summer sea soft and warm and bitter to pass through life tranquil and obscure amid the simplicities and sanctities of childish custom with work and rest with feastday and sunday to walk in footworn ways amid the same fragrant wildflowers to the music of the same birds hand in hand with a daughter of the same soil to whom every hoar usage and green meadow should be similarly dear to carry on the chain of the quiet generations and so pass lingeringly towards a forgotten grave amid humble kinsfolkwere not this sweeter than the trump and glare of fame and the ache of ambition and the loneliness of untrodden footways he seemed to hear mad peggys mocking laughter in the distance he moved curiously in the direction of the sounds skirting a new barnlike building which blocked his view and which he saw from a notice was a baptist meetinghouse such as his mother had always yearned for mctavits schoolhouse met his gaze still standing in its field and in the foreground a mob of boys and girls shouting and laughing with the exuberance of schoolchildren just let out after a moment he perceived that they were jeering and hooting somebody then he caught a glimpse of the ungainly figure of a young man in the centre of derision with a dozen hands playfully pulling and pushing him the poor butt fell down and there was a great outburst of hilarious delight matts blood boiled he ran quickly forward towards the booing juvenile crowd which scattered a little at the sight of his flaming countenance you pesky little he cried then his voice failed with a flash of horror he recognized his brother billy boo recommenced one of the bigger louts rotgut rum matt seized the crutch which lay at the side of the prostrate drunken cripple and described a threatening circle with it the pack of children broke up and made off hooting from a safer distance billy he said hoarsely clutching the wretched young fellow by the coatcollar half to raise him half in instinctive anger returning intelligence struggled with the look of maudlin pathos on billys white face the shock of the sight of his brother sobered him he suffered himself to be lifted to his feet then he took his crutch and moved forward refusing further help i kin walk he said sullenly the tone and accent grated on matts ear but a pang of selfreproach mixed with his wrath and disgust it was his part to have looked after billy better i didnt expect we should meet like this billy he said softly you should hev come sooner billy retorted stead of gaddin about all the world over enjoyin yourself and never comin nigh us not even when you were tourin in the province with your portraits an your photographers i never was near enough and i always had to move on he explained gently as he flicked the dust of the road off billys coat never mind my clothes they wont spoil theyre not so fine as yours if youre shamed to walk with me dont talk like that billy im only glad to see how well you can walk the brothers passed defiantly through the straggling remnants of the juvenile crowd ive walked to the village said billy im strong enough to go anywhere amost a few hoots recommenced in the rear i wish you hadnt gone to the village today sighed matt and why shouldnt i cried billy pricked to savagery again what is there for me but gittin drunk i got drunk when you wrote the newsso i did thet was the first time we all drank your health an your brides an i got drunk an im glad i found out the joy of it why shouldnt i hev some pleasure too ill never hev a bride of my ownthets certain what girl would take me do you deny it why even when ruth hailey was here she ony pitied me hadnt we better get a lift said matt gently for a carriage was rumbling behind them ive been twice to the rumhole since the money came pursued billy in dogged defiance its the ony way to forgit everythin he stumped on sturdily beads of perspiration glistened on his white bloodless face what money came matt asked puzzled the two hundred and fifty dollars you sent a couple of days after you got engaged i never sent two hundred and fifty dollars he cried didnt you billy opened his large pathetic eyes wider well now thats funny we wondered why you did it so curiously and why the postmark was maine we thought you were up to some fun now you had so much money but we allowed wed wait till you came but matt could not solve the mystery the notes had been addressed to the strangs and were accompanied by a slip of paper the same amount of the money due to you will be forwarded next year that was all the message matt exhausted himself in guesses his thoughts even went back to the owners of the sally bell imagining some tardy consciencemoney in repayment of arrears due to the dead captain at last he concluded the remittance must have come from madame strang acting through some american agent she had discovered herbert owed him money and was sending him double and quadruple by way of remorse for the mistake she and her husband had made to prevent him from returning it she had sent it to his family and anonymously abner preep contended that there was no occasion for matt to help his brothers and sisters further for the present the subsidy was ample more would only lead to unnecessary extravagance matt was not entirely pleased to find his family had no immediate need to profit by his marriage indeed he almost wished the money had not come it was perturbing to feel in himself a yearningnow that his burdens were lightenedto make one last desperate effort to take the kingdom of art by his own unaided assault it was even more perturbing to feel himself solicited by that other self which had spoken out on that sultry summer afternoon to abandon art altogether for the simple restfulness of a life in his own village at one with nature the life that had cramped him once seemed curiously soothing now his old fretful sense of superiority to this philistine environment was gone but most perturbing of all was the thought of rosina in neither of these suggested alternativesto have another try alone or to settle down in cobequiddid she play any part and he always came back with a shock to the recollection of his relation to her that made both of these futures impossible he would not allow himself to dwell for a moment on the thought of backing out of his engagementhonor forbade that and was he even certain that he did not care for her how piquant she had looked now and then when she had accidentally got into one or other of the two postures that became her best as on the night when smiling she had thrown back her head a little to the left with the somewhat plebeian nose refined by foreshortening and the warm carmines and ivory of the face and throat showing in the lamplight against the loosened hair and then how simple and unpretentious she was how charmingly candid her chafferings with the storekeepers but it eased his mind somewhat to find billy selfishly laying claim to the mysterious money persisting he would travel with ithe would see the world matt persuaded harriet to acquiescence in the idea relieved to find his immediate responsibilities to the smaller children restored to him but unknown to billy matt had already decided he must if possible take charge of the poor fellow and keep him from drink he wrote to ask rosinas permission to let his crippled brother travel with him as his health needed a sea voyage he waited anxiously for the reply i can reffuse my darling nothing rosina responded with more promptitude than orthography god bless you murmured matt kissing the letter i believe i shall love you after all book iiichapter i conqueror or conquered foresight is insight it was due to matthew strangs ignorance of life and of himself that his marriage in no way turned out as he had calculated oh the fatal mistake of it perceived as soon as it was too late though he shrank weakly from the perception afraid to face the chill blank truth hoping against hope that love would be the child of marriage oh the ghastliness of being chained to a loving woman he did not love bound by law and honor to simulate a responsive affection and to hide the deadly apathy which her caresses could not overcome he tried hard to love her calling his own attention to her youth her freshness her prettiness her flashes of expression making the most of every hint of charm seeing her through a wilful glamour even attempting to persuade himself that she was the woman of his dreams all the while his leaden heart coldly refusing itself to the hollow pretence before the marriage he had almost felt on the point of love but it was only he knew later the selfdisguise of cupidity and mercenariness though no doubt a measure of gratitude had helped to becloud his vision in his bachelor days he could never have imagined such indifference to any woman sometimes he wondered if this was all marriage meant to any man but a wistful incredulity denied him the consolation of acquiescence in a common lot the testimony of mankind was quite other and his own yearning instinct refused to look upon his union as typical if only she had been a little more intellectual less limited to gossip about servants and prices how he had deceived himself taking the sprightliness of a young girl in love the coquettish gayety the evanescent brilliancy of a bird in the pairing season for the output of perennial intellect and goodhumor he had lived so much alone with his dreams that he had fallen out of touch with humanity and particularly with feminine humanity he had had no standard of comparison by which to gauge her and once united to her the habitual recluse could not accommodate himself to her constant companionship what an irony their honeymoon in paris in florence the ardors of artistic renascence yoked with the blankness of boredom despite rosinas affectionate clinging to him and her almost pathetic endeavor to admire old churches and dingy picturegalleries it was a relief to both when she at last acquiesced in his happy idea of regarding his rounds as work and under the convoy of billy beguiled the expectation of fonder reunion by the more exhilarating spectacle of the streets and the endless glories of the bon march and very soon she wearied altogether of foreign places clamoring to be settled in london where the language was not gibberish and one could go amarketing without being bamboozled and cut off from bargaining for after the first fervors of the honeymoon she had developed that instinct for petty economy which had amused and charmed him when he had gone shopping with her in halifax but which now fretted him seeming like a daily reproach for all those great sums her acquisition of him had cost her he was glad that the due arrival of the second mysterious instalment promised to the novascotian household relieved him of the painful necessity of applying to her on its behalf unexpectedly enough this sum was supplemented by a dividend of a hundred and fifteen dollars paid to him after he had forgotten all about the matter by the trustee in halifax in settlement of his claim against the estate of the starsborough shipbuilder in vain he tried to interest his wife in books in the poems and essays in the study of french and german into which he now threw himself with a feverish desire for culture in vain he tried to impart to her his vision of nature to get her to observe scenery and sunsets colors and shades were only interesting to her as they occurred in dress materials once when they stood by a seabeach on a december afternoon under a cold gray sky and rosina complained of the dreariness of the seascape he had attempted to show her how beautiful it really was how much more interesting to the artistic eye than a crude sunlight effect how nearest the horizon it was grayish steelblue and then a still amber and then emerald green and how just before the final fringe of both there shone a band of sparkling amber grayed by cloudreflections but rosina shivered and refused to see anything but a chill green waste she would not even allow him to arrange her furniture and a pair of colossal pink vases garishly handpainted with pastoral figures picked up a bargain were a permanent pain to him spoiling for him the drawingroom of the little north london house with the rude whitewashed studio in which they had settled down after the birth of their first child the temporary lull that attended their installation in british domesticity was succeeded by graver frictions when rosina had finished furnishing they had no society neither of the couple knew anybody in london and the husband shrank from making friends constrained moreover by his art to a solitary way of living rosina who before her child demanded her care had sat to him out of pure desire to be with him began to be jealous of the models who replaced her declaring that she had had no conception such goingson were a part of art or she would never have married him the only alleviation of his numb misery was his ability to paint without pecuniary underthought the picture with which he was to storm the academy to throw all his individuality into it the very seclusion of his life favored this devotion to his ideals and these ideals were only partially those of his celibate he had been swaying to and fro under the opposite solicitations of idealism and realism now in a violent upheaval his sympathy with modern subjects and even with modern methods had been submerged on the continent for the first time he came into contact with the old world london had been to him as modern as america repeating its ideas and ideals but in france and more especially in italy the mere variation of tongues helped to draw him into an earlier world cooperated with the appeal of ancient churches and streets and palaces and the countless treasure of ancient art the modern world grew hateful to him and he absorbed by affinity the ancient and the medival at bottom it was not so much the modern that repelled him as real life and it was not so much the past towards which he yearned as towards that timeless realm wherein ideal beauty dwells the past was at least less real than the present real life was horrible and marriage had put the copingstone on his dissatisfaction with it from birth to death it was embased by a sordid series of physical processes even the muchvaunted love was hideous at root beauty itself was never really perfect and was transient at best while the beautiful idea that lurked in nearly every human face and figure had for the most part been left embryonic only in art could the imperfections of nature be correctedand this was the artists mission not to imitate nature but to transcend her from her faulty individuals frail and perishable to draw types of perfection flawless immortal like that venus de milo which stood at the end of the louvre passage beautiful from every standpoint fixing in its pensive sweetness of spiritualized form his dream of ideal womanhood or like that mighty torso of winged victory that had achieved the last victory over its own mutilation real life was deacon hailey and his mad mother and billy and rosina and his uncle and the grimy denizens of the london slums and the blackguardly crowd at the fleet street publichouse and the lewd workmen in the starsborough shipyard but art was rosalind and imogen hamlet and ariel don quixote and beatrix esmond and the love in shelleys lyrics and the music of beethoven and the pictures of botticelli and the cold white statues of the greeksthat imaginary world which mans soul had called into being to redress the balance of the real it was art against nature throughoutthe immortal shadows against the ephemeral realities she cannot fade though thou hast not thy bliss forever wilt thou love and she be fair and so for the real atmosphere of cornpepper he no longer cared what mattered the realities of space more than those of time to the soul emperor of its own fantasy all this scientific precision after which he had been hankeringwas it not irrelevant to art the beautiful was the ideal to create the ideal the real must be passed through the crucible of the artists soul the artist was the true creator in him natures yearning to beget the beautiful became conscious she herself had infinite failuresugly moods fogs glooms skies of iron seas of tin and feeling all this instinctively rather than by a lucid excogitation he was now for the ideal for the romantic for the religious even for anything that was not real that shut out the unbeautiful necessity as those glorious stained windows of cathedrals blazing with saints shut out the crude daylight and the raw air of reality filtering the garish sunlight to that dim religious light in which the soul could see best ah how wisely the poor human soul had fenced itself in against the bleak realitieseven as the body had housed itself against the inhospitalities of naturepainting its windows with beautiful dreams with an incarnate love that ruled the world and an image of immaculate motherhood and in a strange hybrid hazy blend of catholicism and hellenism possible only to an artist who sees things by their sensuous outsides the venus de milo and the madonna of the italian masters were to him more akin by beauty than divorced by dogma in a sense they were onethe highest types of beauty conceivable by the pagan and christian ages so akin that when botticelli came to draw venus as in his nascita di venere his brush fashioned a meek miltonic eve prefiguring the virgin mother while andrea del sarto in his annunziazone in the pitti had given the virgin mother almost the brooding serenity of a greek goddess ideal womanhood ideal womanhood this was what poor matthew strang seemed to find in eitheray and even in peruginos magdalen and the saying of keats beauty is truth truth beauty seemed to him to be indeed all that mortals needed to know but that pagan serenity which had produced greek art could not be his for him as for the ages the first sensuous joy in beauty was over and what appealed even more than the greek marbles to the artist who had set out from his native village with quick blood worshipper of a beautiful world was that subtler art which expressed rather the inadequacy than the perfection of life the wistfulness of a botticelli madonna the unfathomable smile of a leonardo portrait the pensive melancholy of lorenzo di credis unknown youth in the uffizi or the mystic aspiration of the monk in that famous concerto di musica and inversely raphaels lovelier line than natures and michael angelos with its more majestic sweep he longed with that yearning with which the boy had looked up to the stars in the midnight forest for god for christ for apollo for some dream of whiteness and beauty for something that persisted beneath all the purposeless generations of which the louvre held record in those cumbrous relics of vanished civilizationegyptian phnician syrian babylonian persian chaldeanthose broken shafts of pillars that had upheld barbaric temples those friezes that had adorned the faades of palaces those blurred monuments perpetuating the victories of forgotten dust those faded bassreliefs that had pleased the lustful eyes of nameless kings enthroned in their gigantic halls those uncouth torsos of bulls and sphinxes emblems of a vaster crueller life amid the flux of the centuries the visibles of art the invisibles of religionwere not these the only true realities such had been matthew strangs thoughts as in a deep silence he walked through the louvre with rosina a silence that was at its deepest when he responded to her chatter she hated the slippery parquet and the dull oilcolors under the glazed skylight preferring the fresh coloring of the copies though she made fun of the copyists who sat so patiently on their stools what queer men what funny frumpy girls what strange old ladies and look there was a young woman in widows weeds painting such a cute picture andgracious there was quite a young girl copying a naked manwerent they horrid the french she liked the attendants cocked hats with a dash of gilt and enjoyed the desultory crowd of perambulating spectators that ranged from old gentlemen hobbling along on sticks to artisans in red blouses and clayey boots and wouldnt matt come back into the jewelry and china departments which were really interesting and wasnt the heat unbearable it was her restlessness that made her husband quit this paris which fascinated him this beautiful city with whose artistic activity divined from the mere architecture of the cole des beaux arts he had had no opportunity to get into intimate touch for he could not even come across herbert whom he had rather hoped to find still there a cicerone to initiate him into the artcoteries of paris in florence where they went for the winter rosina was even more restless the towered palaces the duomo and the gracious campaniles the gardens the enchanting environs and all the stock wonders of the place had none but a superficial interest for her they were exhausted at first sight amid the marble calm of colonnades she even regretted the liveliness of the boulevards and the climate too was worse than that of paris her grumblings were perpetual to pass from the warm piazza or promenade to the biting wind of the narrow streets was not only uncomfortable but made it a problem how to dress and indeed matt himself suffered keenly from the cold though there was a small brass heating apparatus in the centre of the gallery it scarcely did more than keep his colors from congealing for he was copying botticellis virgin with the child and angels yes botticelli had become his masterbotticelli whom at first sight in the national gallery he had rejected for insufficient draughtsmanship but all of whose nave exaggerations of hands or feet or necks he now credited to artistic intention prepared to maintain from loving study of his delicately luminous canvases and his blond ethereal frescos that the masters drawing had only repudiated the bonds of the real in quest of a higher beauty a more gracious harmony of curves even as his coloring had refined away that oleaginous quality which a rubens found in human flesh to brood over a madonna of botticelli or of filippo lippi matthew strang would turn from the women of rubens or the young men of titian or the children of velasquez or rembrandts old men though at the sight of les glaneurs of millet he felt a lurking sympathy in his submerged self he preferred that morning landscape of corot in which bodiceless beauties dance round trees as halfdressed women never did in any period of french history he found a winter scene of van ostades none the less charming because the figures were not enveloped and the lights were untruly set off by bituminous shadows he was in the mood in which even the gilded rosenudity of the eighteenth century seemed precious amid the infinitude of art that surrounded him now cornpeppers cocksureness seemed to him as futile as it had already appeared amid the infinity of nature and all the masters were so akin that evolution by revolution seemed less credible than in the smoky atmosphere of azure art studios modern subject had they not all done the contemporary had the dutch done anything else impressionism in so far as it meant a free brushwork was not rembrandt an impressionist was not velasquez in his later manner his first picture then need not be revolutionary in technique but it must be more imaginative than the bulk of english work in the academy of his day more emotional photography had reduced realism to absurdity had proved that art lay in the transfusion of nature through the artists soul and the essence of all art was emotion feeling the work of art was but the medium by which the artist passed on his emotion to the spectator his joy in beauty his feeling for nature his sadness his aspiration even his view of life because emotion could be conveyed by literature and music there was no reason why these should have the preference in cases where painting was equal to conveying it too without emotion a picture was null and void technique by itself could give works of craft never works of art on the other hand to have the artistic emotion without the technique necessary to pass it on to the spectator was to be artistic but not an artist the choice of a subject gave him much harassing hesitation it brought delicious peace merely to make his final decision amid all the whirl of ideas that pressed upon him he would found his picture on those beautiful lines in matthew arnolds forsaken merman once she sat with you and me on a redgold throne in the heart of the sea and the youngest sat on her knee she combed its bright hair and she tended it well when down swung the sound of a faroff bell she sighed she lookd up through the clear green sea she said i must go for my kinsfolk pray in the little gray church on the shore today twill be eastertime in the worldah me and i lose my poor soul merman here with thee the subject seemed to him made to his hand it would enable him to fulfil his young ambitious dream of reconciling the decorative with the ideapicture the composition should weave a beautiful pattern and the coloring a scheme of harmony and yet the picture should make a distinct emotional appeal a woman with a soul throned amid a lower race yet yearning for the higher spiritual fervorsthat was an idea which lent itself beautifully to pictorial expression a literary idea doubtless but yet a visual too so that there was no need even to label it with the poets lines which had suggested it it should be selfexplanatory and what sensuous glow in the accessoriesthe clear green seadepths the redgold throne the childs flowing hair the thought of them was like wine in his veins he set to work eagerly on a large scale informed by his contemplation of the old masters with big ambitionsto do not the little lyrics that satisfied contemporary cocksureness but a great sustained poem what pleasures and pains the work brought him the thrill of conception was deadened by inadequacy of execution to revive when some charm of color and line flowered under happy accident he had great joy in doing the heart of the sea with its deep divine dark dayshineit was his sympathy with this marine fairyland that had partly inspired his readiness to do old cobles misleading ensign of the shark and the spongediver around the redgold throne of the mermans bride that stood on the sandstrewn seabed the submarine flora bloomed in strange fantastic arabesques and subtle shades of amber and gray and white and crimson and through the green translucent water spent sunbeams quivered and gleamed and vague tropical fish shot lovely notes of color and a seasnake coiled its glittering mail and there were strange pied amorphous creatures and mosslike corallines and redbranching madrepores and gleaming shells and motheropearl touched with purple and azure yet all strictly subordinated to the two central figures of the compositionthe throned woman with her youngest on her knee which despite the nudity and the strange accessories took on a curious likeness to the madonna and child the canvas indeed showed the influence upon him of those wistful madonnas he had pored over so wistfully the cold strange eyes of the goldenhaired child were in the imaginative vein of the poem the form of the throned woman was inspired by merely pagan ideals of beauty and yet the yearning in her uplifted eyes for the world of prayer whose sound floated mystically down to her was the same that showed in the eyes of the holy mother but this analogy was not consciously in the artists design though it had doubtless influenced his choice of subject nor though he had certainly had in mind to suggest through her the yearning of humanity for a higher world did he connect his work with the school of symbolists which was just arising across the channel and which was capable of finding in the dominant green of his sea the colorsymbol of resurrection even the dead face which he had placed in a corner in the foreground though it might well seem symbolic of the tragedy lurking amid this sensuous beauty was in truth only the dead face of his father and he had put it in less for its symbolic significance or its realistic appositeness than from an uncontrollable desire to have it there as though thus to dispossess his mind of that ancient haunting image which the continuous thought of the sea had inevitably brought up again he told himself it was but natural some drowned face should bob ghastly in this submarine paradise but in reality he felt a morbid craving to put it there to have something in his picture for himself alone that no one else in the great wide world could possibly understand to the full for the rest the picture cost him infinite trouble for his genius was an incapacity for not taking infinite pains the poetry of paint is achieved by the prose of work and as despite his romanticism his hankerings for the real persisted his ambitious conception entailed much preliminary study and the setting up in his studio of a little seawater aquarium in the construction of which his ancient experience at the stepney birdstuffing establishment in making cases of shells with mosses and seaweeds and coral came in unexpectedly useful but he could not get a satisfactory model for his principal figure and curiously enough her left hand gave him more vexation than anything else in this complex composition he could not settle its pose scraped out finger after finger with an old sailors knife relic of his mackerelfishing voyage specially ground down painted out the whole hand fourteen times and at last in despair weakly solved the problem by hiding the hand altogether two days later working on the scales of the seasnake that basked sinuously at the womans feet he suddenly had a last furious dash at the refractory hand this time it came right and brought rejoicing sometimes he seemed at the mercy of these haphazard inspirations what came came quite irrespective of conscious will and training als ixh xan as i can the old flemish motto which van eyck put to his work seemed to him apt for any painter when he began the mermans bride he was already much more exigent towards himself than in his younger days selfcriticism had checked that fearless execution by the time he had finished his picture those very months of steady work rigorously revised had raised his ideal higher so that though the actual picture pretty well corresponded with his first conception it was still far removed from his later standard the expression of the womans face seemed especially inadequate and as great actresses do not sit as models and the artist has to imagine emotional expression he felt again despite his romanticism that he had missed the subtleties of reality but every genus of art has to sacrifice something and sendingin day was drawing swiftly nigh and he had to lay down his brushes at last and through his framemaker despatch the canvas to burlington house and await with what composure he could the verdict that should bring him the recognition he had struggled for during such long tedious years now that the absorbing task was over he had time to think of its reward to dwell on the thought of recognition of fame the one thing on earth that still loomed before him enshrouded in vague misty splendors in a world of illusions this was the solid happiness it might yet be his to grasp this last illusion was not destined to be dissipated yet awhile he was sitting at the breakfasttable when he received a blue card inviting him to take back his picture burning with revolt and despair he had to strive to appear calm what time rosina was unfolding a tale of woe concerning the maidofallwork whom she had detected throwing away halfburned coals into the dusthole that she reiterated monotonously explained the mysteriously rapid disappearance of the coalsover a ton since quarterday an investigation of the dusthole had revealed a veritable coalmine it was one of the most curious characteristics of rosina that with all her hardness she flinched mentally before her servants pouring out her grievances against them when they were out of earshot so that her husband suffered vicariously for their sins of omission or commission usually he listened to her silently with the courteous deference he would have shown a guest never provoked to an angry retort save by her absurd objections to his models he had abandoned as hopeless the effort to unite their souls but today he had no option but to cap her tragic narrative by telling her of his disappointment the news excited her not to sympathy with his aspersed art but to reproachful alarm for his pecuniary future this was the last straw he might have stood out against the academy exhibiting elsewhere and gradually building up an outside reputation but the pecuniary independence to enable him to do this which had been the main motive of his marriage was the very thing that he now saw he must abandon in his secret paroxysms of resentmentmore against himself than against herit became increasingly plain to him that he could not live on her money that were intolerable to his reawakened manhood he must make a financial success on his own account he must become independent of her at any cost to art his entire preconception of his future had broken down his marriage a failure from the financial point of view as from every other instead of having emancipated himself from the necessity of a monetary success he had made life impossible without it well he would compromise he would recoil to leap the better he would do what the public wanted and then having secured its attention he would do what he wanted he went to the academy and to the grosvenor gallery he studied the most popular pictures of his day and in a couple of large canvasesone domestic the other biblicalset himself to outdo them in anecdotage and obviousness of technique in a passion of irony he half parodied his own picture of the mermans bride in an idyllic interior called motherhood representing a mother holding up a little girl who in her turn nursed a doll rosina sat for this to save expense her own little girl being now weaned the other picture was a vashti and for the repudiated queen did rosina pose likewise and with unwonted interest in her husbands work both pictures were cleverly painted for matthew strang strove to atone for his lack of interest in his subjects by painful impeccability of technique and to rosinas joy both won acceptance from the hanging committee though at the eleventh houron the saturday night before varnishing dayhusband and wife were alike disappointed to receive an intimation that through lack of space only the smallermotherhoodcould be hung despite all his contempt for his picture and for the academy it was a tingling sensation to move amid the crowd of artists on varnishing day and to see some whose serious faces he remembered noting on the platform on that memorable gold medal night pause before his picture in admiration of the vigorous brushwork this was a sign of success he was destined to experience in far greater measure the following year but the keenness of the thrill could never be matched again and when motherhood was mentioned in the papers and in the early days of the exhibition he watched fashionably clad ladies gather in front of it to commend the sweetly pretty child and its touching foreshadowing of maternity matthew strang found himself insensibly beginning to partake in the general admiration and with that strain of weakness which london had exposed in him from the first he was tickled by the praise of these pretty women with their rustle of silks and their atmosphere of scent and culture and his american birth subtly lent added spice to his sensation in the thought of conquering with his rude homeborn genius these votaries of an elegant civilization he was quite annoyed when he heard of morrisons mot that the doll was hit off to the life but the other two figures were wooden but it was not till motherhood sold for two hundred pounds that the process of corruption really began to set in the buyera provincial cottonspinner in town for his holidaywished to sit for his portrait the painter did not like to ask him to the whitewashed studio he told rosina they must move to a better neighborhood the economical rosina would not consent to quit a quarter where rates and provisions were low and where she had by this time acquired several cronies equally martyred by their maidsofallwork so ultimately he took a larger studio in a more fashionable district going to his work every day like a clerk to his office relieved from his wifes overpowering proximity and from her personal vision of his models coming and going though her morbid suspicion was always ready to flare up thus the estrangement had begun people sent him cards not knowing he was married after some embarrassed refusals he weakly accepted without explanation an invitation to dinnerunable to decline it gracefully and knowing rosina unsuited to the companyand his reticence made subsequent explanation more and more difficult after a still greater success in the next academy with an only less conventional picture he was caught in a fashionable whirl of work and social engagements finding commission after commission thrust upon him driven to hasty production of imposing compositions to preserve his place in the rapidly recurrent academy and other exhibitions and always postponing the time when he would start upon the real artistic work of his life when he should have accumulated enough money to give him a couple of years of freedom for independent art for that fearless expression of his own individuality which alone makes art which alone adds aught to the worlds treasure of beauty by contributing a new individual vision of the beautiful and which so far from being demanded by the paying public must be a revelation of unknown riches a plethora of portrait commissions was not conducive to personal art people were much more clamorous for the likeness than in the days of sir joshua before photography had been invented and every artists best portraits were always those unpaid unchallenged portraits of his parents and friendsunflattered yet touched with the higher beauty of truth and portraits stood in the way of more complex work though they got one a cheap reputation as a stylist but there was a great run on matthew strang for portraits almost as much as on one of his fellowsufferers for marbles the public would scarcely have anything else and the voice of the public is the voice of the purse by fits and snatches he made attempts to express himself but he never had time to find out what himself was sometimes in a reversion to one of his earlier manners he thought he wanted to express sensation to transfer to the spectator of his landscape the sensation the original had given him and from his country visits he would come back with studies of strange blue moonlight effects on cliffs or weird dark seas destined never to be worked up he began a realistic picture of a winter view from primrose hill with brownish trees in the foreground and gray in the background and a white misty townlet to the left but fluctuating again he abandoned it for an attempt to do the lyric of the brush to express as in balanced metres harmonies of tree and sky and water and this again was thrown aside for the picture of ideal womanhood which under the influence of a beautiful womans rebuke he had felt was the real himself it behooved him to express but the beautiful womans passage across his horizon had been momentary and so even this piece of imaginative art had been finished hurriedly under the pressure of other work and thus the years flew by like months with incredible velocity he could not escape from the network of engagements he had helped to weave nor did he always desire to there was a circumlapping consolation about the applause of the public though it did not warm him he found a bitter satisfaction as of revenge in the smiles of society dames though he did not court them he took no pleasure in the personal paragraphs and the notices of his work though he knew they were necessary to his prices and though he had no more liking for the severe estimates of the few who would have none of him the breach with his wife widened imperceptibly half involuntarily though he was passively glad when she was not with him to complicate his life with her bourgeois ways with her vulgar outlook he was driven to a more pretentious studio which had sometimes to be the scene of responsive hospitalities and which raised his prices he fell into a semibachelor life late evening parties early morning rides in the park visits for pleasure or portraitpainting or decoration to country houses where his early familiarity with rod and gun gave him a valuable air of autochthonic aristocracy excursions to goodwood to henley sketching tours all tended to separate him from his wife till at last an almost complete separation had grown up so gradually that except for her spasms of jealousy rosina seemed almost to have become reconciled to it in view of the popular success the inflow of money and the eternal economy of camden town and instead of resenting his absence to have come to welcoming his presence when on rare gala occasions he took her out the places she loved were those which no fashionable foot ever trod and as the couple wanderedan obscure matrimonial molecule among the holiday masseshe was not sorry that his juvenile idea of fame as a blazoning vade mecum was only one of the many illusions of youth and so none of the scented chattering crowd that gathered on show sunday before his pictures or his refreshments had any inkling of the more legitimate mnage in the less fashionable quarter he absolved his occasional qualms of conscience by lavishing his earnings on her which she hoardedthough he knew it notpartly from instinct partly from a superstitious dread of a catastrophe when his hand should fail or her shares fall to zero too late he comprehended the hardness in money matters that had been at the root of her resentment against the defalcating frenchman and it was to spare her feelings as well as to preserve peace that he said never a word to her about the great sums with which he gladdened the novascotian household not that rosina knew much of his other affairs in truth she knew very little of her husbands life nor by how vast a sweep it circumscribed her own she knew he had to be away from her a very great deal that he had to stay in the country to paint great people she was vaguely aware that the necessities of his profession made a wide sociality profitable she had been once or twice to peep at his studio horrified by the grandeur and only consoled by the demonstration that its cost was repaid in the prices like the luxurious fittings of the shops in the holloway road but her imagination lacked the materials to construct a vision of the whirlpool which had sucked him away from her her reading was limited to a weekly newspaper in which his name seldom appeared and he in his mental isolation from her found scant selfreproach for his silence reserve seemed more natural than communicativeness she could never know the doings of his soul his thoughts were not her thoughts he had given up the attempt at communion the effort to teach her to know his real self why should he be less reticent concerning his outward movements his superficial self he was aloof from her spiritually beside this his material separation from her was insignificant the childrena girl of seven and a boy of nearly fourwere no bonds of union the elder christened clara after rosinas aunt was sharp and lively enough but given to passionate sulking the youngercalled after his grandfather davidwas a lymphatic colorless youngster sickly and rather slowwitted with something of billys pathos in his large gray eyes their father had tried hard to love them as he had tried to love their mother and had taken a certain proprietary interest in their infantile graces and in the engaging ways of early childhood but the claims of his art left them in the mothers hands and the older they grew the less he grew to feel them his neither clara nor david had as yet displayed any scintilla of artistic instinct when he went home he usually had something for them in his pocket as he would have had for the children of an acquaintance but they gave him no parental thrill chapter ii success the studio bell had tinkled so often that afternoon that mr matthew strang refused to budge from the comfortable armchair in which he sat smoking his cigarette and reading the nineteenth century after the labors of the day the model had sipped her tea taken her silver and was gone to resume her wellearned place among the clothed classes and the hardworking artist was in no mood to open his door to the latest bellringer probably it was only another model to inquire if he had any work or to apprise him of a change of address or of wardrobe or else it was a soidisant decayed artist who had tramped all the way from camberwell ignorant that his old patron had moved from the studio a year ago or mayhap it was a child he had been much worried by children lately since he had picked up a couple in the gutter and placed them on the throne the dingy court where the fortunate twain resided had been agitated from attic to cellar the entire juvenile population had pulled his bell in quest of easy riches mothers had quarrelled with one another over the chances of their young ones the whole court had been torn with intestine war tingatingtingatingtingtingting the person had rung again more ferociously ah it must be that interminable mrs filbert back again well let her ring on the old jade rather an hour of tintinnabulation than ten minutes of her tongue had his man been in he might himself have been out but he could scarcely appear at the door and deny himself her shrill falsetto voice resurged in the ear of memory offering nude photos from paris at exorbitant prices or lists of models full of inaccurate addresses or rare costumes most of which could be picked up at any old clo shop he smiled recalling one of these costumessomething like a fishingnet with holes about an inch across this is greek and shows the figure certainly it showed the figure he thought smiling more broadly and now he rememberedshe had threatened to bring her younger sister and i have also a little sister i dont know if you paint pretty girls here his memory inserted a giggle she sits for modern dress or the head not for the figure of course she doesnt mind a light costume something diaphanous though im not quite sure she has any time left she is always with mr rapper who does those pastels for the goupil art gallery he is so very sweet to her she goes to the theatre and dines with him i sit myself sometimes though you mightnt think so giggle so of course she cant sit in the evening in case you want her for black and white just like a woman he reflected cynically too careless to take the trouble to discover that i am far too eminent for black and white i know im dressed carelessly just now i really must be more careful giggle i have an empire gown to sit in very sweet i will bring it you to look at tingatingtingatingtingtingtingtingting yes it was the sweet empire gown she was bringing him if it was not her sweeter sister his experienced eye foresaw the empire gownsomething cut by herself out of muslin with an old yellow silk sash he let the last vibration of the bellwire die away the creature would know now he was not in the smoke curled in a bluegray cloud about his head as looking up from the page of the magazine he gazed dreamily at his halffinished picture standing on the easel at the other extremity of the great luxurious room where the westering sun of june sent down a flood of light that brightened the gleam of the gold frames of hanging pictures touched up rough sketches and preliminary studies standing about and lay in a splash of brilliancy among the sheets of music and the dainty volumes of poetry and belleslettres on the grand piano suddenly as his gaze rested with a suspicion of wistfulness on this doubly artistic interior in which the pictures were only pleasant spots of color in a larger harmony a harmony of rugs and flowers and tapestry and picturesque properties and bricbrac there shot up in his mind an image of an ancient episode he saw himself a shy homely figure standing in despairing bitterness on the threshold of an elegant studiothough not so elegant nor so commodious as thisthe studio of the brilliant cousin whose life had intersected his own so many years ago his face changed a sad smile hovered about the corners of his mouth perhaps some unhappy young man was now outside his own less hospitable door growing hopeless as the echoes alone answered him he started up hastily and hurrying into the passage drew back the handle of the door a slim fashionably attired gentleman who was just walking off down the gravel pathway turned hearing the sound of the open door his handsome cleanshaven bronzed face radiating joyous amusement you duffer he exclaimed the famous painter turned pale his cigarette fell from his mouth so startled was he that he should have just been thinking of herbert strang seemed almost supernatural but the nervous feeling was submerged in a wave of happiness to have herbert again was an incredible bliss how lucky he had opened the door herbert he cried seizing his cousins delicately gloved hands with an affectionate impulsiveness worthy of herberts mother herbert surveyed him roguishly youre a nice old pal to make me ring three times whats going on inside nothing at all laughed the painter in effusive happiness only tea and thats cold but come in youre sure im not disturbing you said herbert mischievously no im all by myself it must be awfully convenient to have a back door murmured herbert the painter shook his head you havent changed one bit he said in laughing reproach as they moved within oh but you have said herbert pausing in the doorway to take him by the shoulders and looking affectionately into his face why theres quite a dash of gray in your hair you must have been killing yourself with work and indeed there were lines of premature age on the handsome face too though the rather tall sturdy figure was still alert and unbent the dark eyes had lost something of their old softness the light of dream was rarer in them but the little tangle of locks on his forehead still cooperated with the dark brown mustache and the smoothness of the firm chin to suggest the artist behind the practical man of the world you forget im getting old he replied only half jocosely what nonsense why im several years older than you no are you of course i am dont you remember i was your senior instructing you in the ways of this wicked world well youre still looking a boy anyhow said mr strang thats what i want to look said herbert laughing it makes pretty women pet you and hold your hand why in italy i was the envy of all the cavaliers per dio this is a change he exclaimed as he entered the fashionable studio do you remember the time you came to me and wanted to borrow tenpence or something ha ha ha not that im surprised old boy not a bit ive heard your name come up quite half a dozen times in the few days ive been back in stony old london no thanks ill sit on the couch its cooler there and i wont have any cold tea in this frightfully hot weather im still faithful to sodaandwhiskey if youve got any lots said mr strang a cigar not before dinner thanks i dont mind a cigarette but im not interrupting your work dont be ridiculous old fellow the idea of my turning you away well considering you nearly did it but youre a celebrity now your times valuable oh but ive struck work for today what with all this light left this is indeed a change from the tenpenny days yes i suppose one gets tired the painter sighed do you like turkish or egyptians in cigarettes turkish in women egyptians he answered laconically but what a joke to find you tired of painting youre beginning to feel like i felt eh that its one demnition grind and im tired of travelling and wouldnt mind doing a little painting now ha ha ha how funnily things do turn out to be sure why youve changed inside almost as much as outside he said looking up languidly into his hosts face as he selected a cigarette from the box i wonder if i should have recognized you if i had met you in the streets instead of tracking the lion to his own den i shouldnt have thought half a dozen years would have made such a difference half a dozen years its nearer ten since we met nearer ten is it possible let me see it must be quite seven years since the governor died poor old chap we havent met since then have we no said the painter no of course ive been careering about the world ever since you know he died in egypt no i didnt know that said mr strang i only heard of his death from the dealer who took over the connection yes he had to go there pretty sharp for his lungs and i was compelled to leave paris in my second year to go with him and the mater but he died happy that blessed gold medal of mine made him sure the name of strang would be immortal in the history of art i always said there was a certain pathos about the poor old gentleman but perhaps his assurance wasnt so wrong after all because you are going to make the name glorious arent you you lucky beggar and his own name too which ought to make him happy even in heaven the great man smiled sadly but he only said and your motherhow is she ive often wished to see her again oh shes living now at lyons with some distant relatives of hers of course she soon tired of gadding about with me she sent me a cutting about you once from a french paper so you see how your fame has spread ive often been meaning to write to you but you know how it is always moving about and i always intended to look you up when i came to london i was here two years ago on a flying visit but some paper said you were in rome yes and i saw a colored reproduction of a picture of yours motherhood decorating a miners cabin in the rockiesthe christmas supplement of the illustrated london news if i remember aright it was a mother nursing a little girl while the kid herself nursed a doll the painter turned away and struck a match and then there were a couple of years before your father died he said the last time we met was at the students club in seven dials on gold medal night yes by jove youre right said herbert thoughtfully if i didnt wish to avoid a platitude i should say that time flies its been a jolly good time though for me with nothing to do except spend the poor old governors savings and a jolly big hole ive knocked in them too and you havent come out of it so badly eh thats a stunning thing of yours in the academy arent you glad i made you promise to send a picture to it in those tenpenny times ive just come from there got your address from the catalogue i congratulate you heartily its not the sort of thing i expected from you but its well put in and i suppose it pays it is astonishing he went on after pausing to sip from his glass how paltry english art looks to me after all these years and seeing everything everywhere the picture of the year is exactly like the lid of a bonbon box there arent half a dozen things in todays show that id care to look at again youre in the running dont look so glum ha ha ha frankly old man your triumph of bacchus is jolly good work you know i never cared much for subject but the modelling is a and that sunlight effect is ripping and what a crowd there was before it phew i nearly got suffocated trying to see it and i had to retire to the architectural room to cool i dont like cornpeppers picture one bit though he is an ara you mean because he is said matthew strang with melancholy facetiousness no nothing of the kind that rather prejudices me in his favor you mustnt forget i prophesied it you dont mean to say you admire his ariadne in naxos poached lady on greens i marked it in my catalogue do laugh you look as dull and faded as an old master i think i shall have to restore you here have some whiskey yourself youre damned unsociable i rarely drink the host said feebly you used to drink my whiskey herbert reminded him and as he poured himself out a little in deference to his brilliant cousin he thought how queerly things had inverted themselves the triumph of bacchus said herbert laughing now ive put in the good spirit ill exorcise the bad as david did to saul and crossing over to the piano he played a lively air i picked up that from a spanish gypsy he said not george eliots but im sinking to puns its the english climate youve got no wit here and there isnt even a word for esprit lets examine your pictures ha hum i see youve got quite a number on your hands i suppose they must be the good ones ah what do you call that thingthe lady in blue and the harp ideal womanhood answered the painter adding hastily its just been returned from australia i lent it to an international exhibition they beguiled me with the prospect it would be bought by the government ideal moonshine i should call it laughed herbert there never was such moonlight on sea or land and does the ideal woman play the harp on snowy mountaintops at midnight without a chaperon its supposed to be symbolic you know of her inspiring man to nobler heights explained the artist with an embarrassed air he wondered vaguely what had become of that beautiful womanwhat was her namewhose casual words at a gardenparty had driven him back for a time into what he thought was the true path of his art dear me theres quite a mystic feeling about it isnt that the right phrase do you know im seriously thinking of becoming an art critic yes really as i told you ive had my fill of travelling and now im going to try and settle down here and i rather like getting a reputation for something or other it makes real woman more interested in one the only thing im afraid of is i know too much about the subject and have actually handled the brush im going to paint too but ive neglected to keep my hand in so ive not much hopes of that unless i came out as a stylist who sees the world as he fails to paint it youve got several new men like that i hear theres money in myopia and diseases of the eye generally and per dio how photography has come along since i was one of the pioneers of its use in art matthew strang shrugged his shoulders what does it matter he said wearily the whole things a farce here i say must i play another gypsy dance i came here expecting to find you a harmony in gold and lo youre a discord in the blues whats the matter with you youre jealous of cornpepper how is it they havent made you an ara yet dont you go out enough the painters lips essayed a melancholy smile i go out all i want to there are enough cards stuck over your mantel yes i have to go out a good deal in the season it doesnt pay to offend patrons or ideal womanhood i reckon youll be making a fine marriage one of these days when youre an ara as you must be lady bettina modish or something of that sort eh wont you have another cigarette said the painter jerkily thanks oh bytheway ha ha ha whats become of that woman you rogue what woman real womanhood the woman you were living with in paris ha ha ha you didnt think i knew that but i met cornpepper there on my return from egypt and he told me hed seen you going about with her how we laughed over our methodist parson who wanted art to be moral whats the matter the painters face had grown white and agitated im sorry if ive said anything to annoy you herbert protested perhaps i oughtnt to have given cornpepper away but the affair is so ancient i didnt know youd mind a reference to it now the woman i was living with in paris said matthew strang hoarsely was my wife nonsense said herbert in low longdrawn incredulity but his cousins face was only too convincing shes not alive now he asked the painter nodded his head hopelessly herbert sprang to his feet good god he said you dont mean to say you were such an ass as to marry no wonder youre in the blues matthew strang was silent there was a painful pause but youve kept it pretty dark herbert said at last everybody seems to look upon you as a bachelor i know replied the painter ive always lived a lonely life and i dont speak about my affairs im sorry i touched upon them then no i can talk with you thanks old man and herbert took his friends hand and pressed it sympathetically youre not living with her anyhow and thats something oh but i am living with herat least i go home sometimes its not quite my faultits grown up gradually she lives in camden town alone oh no theres billythats my young brotherto keep her company and then theres the children what kids as well only two herbert looked glum i suppose shes an impossible person he said do you mean to live with no to be seen with weve never been out together in london replied the painter simply we drifted apart before i was asked out oh but its no use going into itits all too sordid poor chap said herbert well you may rely on my respecting your confidence i suppose it is a secret it seems to be i make none of it except negatively you will find mrs strang in the directory as a householder in camden town she took the house as it happened she has a little money of her own herbert smiled sadly thats what i always say the safest secret in the world is the open secret if you had hidden her away in patagonia or tried to put her into a lunatic asylum it would have been the talk of the town as you simply let her live quietly in the heart of london nobodys provoked into inquisitiveness and if anybody knowsas no doubt an odd person does here and therehe doesnt tell anybody else because he doesnt know its a secret i shouldnt be surprised to hear the marriage was duly advertised in the first column of the times mr matthew strangs smile faintly reflected his cousins no we were married in nova scotia he replied but what are you doing tonight how improbable life is mused herbert only yesterday i heard that jackson the cabinet minister has been secretly married these last twenty years what am i doing tonight oh nothing particular i thought of dropping into a musichall i cant stand the english theatre its so unintellectual well why not dine with me at the limners sure you havent got any other engagement and herbert peered curiously at the large chalkedover engagement slate hung on the wall oh i said i would dine en famille at lady conisbrookes but i can easily send a wire as it isnt a formal dinnerparty and as im rather a privileged person with her i dare say shell forgive me its awfully naughty of you said herbert but then there youre a genius and it would be jolly to dine together as in the days of auld lang syne ive got an awful lot to yarn about and so have you ill rush to my rooms and dress oh why bother to dress though i must if you dont mind ive got to go on to one or two places if you dont mind waiting a few minutes while i wash my brushes and put on my warpaint we can go at once unless youre too fashionable to dine prematurely no but i think id rather dress its cooler in this frightful weather shall i come back or meet you at the club as you like well you go on to the club and ill be there just as quick as i can oh bytheway write out that wire and ill send it for you thanks perhaps you had better though i expect my man back in a few minutes hes seeing about the delivery of a picture to the london agents of the liverpool autumn exhibition when herbert was gone matthew strang did not at once mount to his dressingroom the advent of this visitor from the past had stirred up all its muddy depths and the knowledge that he had a little time to spare kept him brooding over it all recalling the episodes of their camaraderie and blended with them as faded scents with old letters he caught faint elusive whiffs of that freshness of feeling and aspiration which had impregnated them in those dear divine days of youth when even his darkest hours were tinged with a roselight of dawn never again would he feel that glow that fervor those strange stirrings of romance that delicious sadness sweeter than all mirth when a perfect blue day could bring tears to the eyes and the melancholy patter of rain at twilight was like a dying fall of music and something strange and far away subtly interfused itself with the loveliness of nature with flowers and sunsets and summer nights a haunting grace intangible inexpressible hinting somehow of divine archetypes of beauty in some celestial universe no even his spasmodic strivings to escape from the rut of false art were becoming fewer and farther between perhaps he was not a genius after all he had begun to think why should he vex himself that sentiment of constable at which he had winced when he first came across it people may say what they like of my art what i know is that it is my art was losing its power to sting the stirrings of his astral self were subsiding he felt himself hardening steadily into a mere unit of the club world of tired and successful men who having blunted their emotions by heavy feeding of all their appetites could no longer feel the primal things taking even their vices with the joyless sobriety of virtue and though he himself was temperate enough and had not been unfaithful to rosina but only to the spirit of the marriage contract yet this same drought of feeling this furred tongue of the emotional being was becoming unpleasantly familiar as he sat now moodily reviewing the situation he burst into a spasmodic bitter laugh it had struck him for the first time that his life had come to be not unlike his fathersa life apart from his wifes with a rare stay under the domestic roof the wife the more amiable for his absences a sudden intuition seemed a flashlight on his fathers past he felt drawn to the dead sailor with a new sympathy he rose in agitation extending his arms towards a visionary form father father he cried aloud did you suffer like me did you call sir and claydon his manservant who had come in quietly through the back door descended from the bedroom where he had been laying out his masters things yes said his master is my shavingwater ready im going out a little earlier than usual yes sir and the painter recalled to reality hastened to perform his toilet but his mind still ran in the grooves of the past remote from all the new interests and distractions of a brilliant career when he sprang from the hansom and walked through the door of the limners club he remembered that this was the very club he had come to on his first day in londonnay that the grayheaded deferential doorkeeper was the very man whose majesty had chilled him he wondered now whether the old fellow ever connected the popular painter with the homely diffident youth who had inquired for mr matthew strang gentleman waiting for you sir curious now it was herbert that was waiting for mr matthew strang but the thought of the whirligig of time gave him no pleasure in his early struggles in london when no one would buy his work he had gloated in anticipation over the humility of the dealers when he should have made his position now he had long since forgotten and forgiven their contempt how could they know he was worth taking up there was nothing but the palest shadow of satisfaction in the thought that they would scour london in search of those despised pictures if they only knew he wondered sometimes if those early things of his would ever come up into the light whether the daughter of his ancient landlady still treasured her mothers weddingpresent and what had become of the paradise of the birds a bluff graybeard in the hall shook his hand heartily it was erlesmith matthew strang knew now that erlesmith whom he had imagined to pass his days encamped before the beatific vision was a jolly good fellow with sheaves of amusing anecdotes but he remembered the first time erlesmith had spoken to himat a city banquet in the beginnings of his fame we oldsters will have to be looking to our laurels he had said placing his hand on the young mans shoulder after the banquet erlesmith had given him a lift in his open carriage and as they rolled through the busy flashing london night a voice in matts breast kept crying out this is erlesmith look this is the great erlesmith i am driving with why dont you look you stupid multitudes do you not know this is erlesmitherlesmith himself oh why did not some of the people who knew matthew strang come along and see him driving with erlesmith perhaps they didthere must surely be one acquaintance at least among all those crowds and he would tell the others he had scarcely been able to reply rationally to erlesmiths conversation so intoxicated was he by the great mans proximity and now he himself was a popular celebrityshown with the fingeron the eve of academic honors had he not of all the younger men among the guests been called upon with disconcerting unexpectedness to respond to a toast at the academy greenwich dinner only last month was he not already on the council of minor artistic societies yes doubtless he himself was already the cause of like foolish flutterings in the breasts of youthful heroworshippershe whose heart could no longer flutter not even when the youthful heroworshipper was a woman and beautiful he dined with herbert at a little table his burst of communicativeness had exhausted itself and he was glad to let the returned traveller do the bulk of the talking as well as of the dining he himself ate little though the cuisine was excellent and the cellar took high rank over dinner herbert bubbled over in endless reminiscences of the rare dishes and vintages he had consumed the operas and symphonies he had heard the women who had loved hima veritable rhapsody of wine woman and song in an access of unmalicious bitterness like that which had overcome him on the threshold of herberts studio matthew strang felt that herbert was the real masterthe master of life in the smokingroom other men gathered round there was grose whose colossal canvases were exhibited at a shilling a head with explanatory pamphlets by high ecclesiastical authorities and there was thornbury who succeeded him in the same gallery with colossal nudes that needed no explanation from ecclesiastical authorities matthew introduced herbert to trapp the realistic novelist and herbert introduced matthew to sir frederick boyd the composer who related with gusto a story of how he had exposed a cheat at monte carlo a scotch landscapepainter asked matthew to recommend him a model two associates joined the group one was a vigorous painter who painted everything premier coup the other was cornpepper externally unchanged save for a round beard he had long since cut himself adrift from the azure art club though he still counted his disciples whose experimental fumblings in development of his methods he boasted of observing in sapient passivity try it on the dog he used to chuckle to his familiars ive done searchinglet my imitators search and risk the bogs and the blindalleys if they do strike a path im on the spot instantly to lead them along it thats the only way one can learn from ones followers he used to tell with glee how one of them had ruined a picture by putting it out in the rain to mellow it some of those modern illustration matt dined with herbert at a little table stylists who are trying to discount old mastership will survive their pictures was cornpeppers commentary on a phase of the newer art they will leave masterpieces of invisibility a good many changes had taken place in the art world since matthew strang had first had the felicity of drinking whiskey in cornpeppers studio the flowing tide was now with the decorative artists of whom the mack of that evening had proved a pioneer the fishtown school of photographic realism had lived long enough to be orthodox the azure art club itself was half absorbed by the academy and a new formula of revolt was momently expected on the horizon some said it was to be primitive others mysteriously whispered spots tonight herbert with mock seriousness announced that he himself was about to lead a movement the originality of which consisted in seeing nature through stained glass what weird magic a landscape gained when observed through a green or pink window but he found the men not so willing to talk of principles as in the days of cornpeppers bohemian parties when carrie with the whiskey bottle stood for the sober club attendant with his tray of liqueur brandies the conversation was rigidly concrete except for a moment when cornpepper nearly came to hot words with the photographic painter who insisted that nature was always beautiful the little man glaring through his monocle and rasping the plush armchair with his nails insisted that this was sheer cant one had only to look in the glass to see how ugly nature could sometimes be selection was the only excuse for art random transcripts from nature were as foolish as the excesses of the neojapanese school into which the azure art gallery had degenerated but this lapse of cornpeppers into his early manner was brief recovering himself he told a malicious anecdote about an artist who was taking to etching because his eyesight was failing and he explained the domesticity of british art by the objection of artists wives to all models except babies everybody knew he said why carruthers had been driven to landscape and christmas supplements depend upon it dogmatized the little man with his most owlish air of wisdom the man who marries his model is lost she will never tolerate a model on the premises again his fellowassociate told a story of a stockbroker who had got himself invited to the greenwich dinner last year and had asked erlesmith to give him the sketch of passing barges which the great man had pencilled on his sketchbook after dinner erlesmith goodnaturedly gave it to him this year he was there again and said with proud respect to erlesmith ive still got that sketch and produced it crumpled up from his waistcoat pocket yes but did you hear vanbrughs mot asked trapp he said naturally being a financier he doubled it why i said that cried cornpepper angrily no doubt said herbert its a wellknown chestnut then i pulled it out of the fire screamed cornpepper somebody exhibited another sketch grotesquely indecorous by a popular painter of religious masterpieces and the latest epigram on the divorce case of the hour was repeated and enjoyed but matthew strangs laughter held no merriment shall you be at the academy soire he asked trapp to turn the conversation no i dont care for crowds replied the realistic novelist the conversation rambled on the composer drifted away and a fullfledged academician took his placean elderly dandified figure with a languid drawl an aristocratic manner caught from his sitters and a shouldershrugging contempt for continental art in despite of which matthew strang protested mildly against the bad hanging at burlington house of a portrait by an eminent frenchman cornpepper talked of a sale at christies at which most of the pictures had fetched lower prices than was given for them by their last owners its all a spec said herbert theres no such thing as a fixed value in a work of art everything depends on the artists pose the more the buyer gives for a picture the more he likes it its a game of brag set up a fine establishmentthe dealer will pay my old governor was a good deal taken in by pretentious humbugs with pals in the press as the academicians own establishment was notoriously finer than his picturesa fact of which the wandering herbert was ignorantmatthew strang hastened to speak of tarmigan who had been recalled to memory by the catalogue of the aforesaid sale im afraid hes gone under poor fellow he said ive tried to come across him but he was always a mysterious person but cornpepper continued to talk of the sale of the fluctuations of prices of the impoverished condition of the market so menacing to young artists who had set up fashionable establishments on the strength of their first sales of the potentialities of america that yet undiscovered continent till all the tide of secret bitterness welled up in a flood from the depths of matthew strangs soul money money money he had never really escaped from it what a mirage art was even success only brought the same preoccupations with prices it was all the old sordidness over again on a higher plane the ring of the gold was the eternal undertone bringing discord into every harmony with a public ignorant of what art meant conceiving it as something rigid like science not as the expression of the temperament technique and vision of individual genius with a public craving for pictorial platitudes art could not be and was not produced save by a martyr here and there everywhere the counting of pieces and the shuffling of banknotes the complacent academician irritated him he was tired of reading of his marble halls the vassals and serfs at his side his garden parties his belgravian palace erected on the ruins of a forgotten bankruptcy the fumes of expensive wines and cigars gave him a momentary vertigo for gods sake stop talking shop he burst out suddenly the astonished cornpepper let his eyeglass fall have you gone crazy strang he asked witheringly what do you join an artists club for if you dont want to talk shop strikes me youd better get yourself put up for the commercial travellers union thats what we are retorted matthew strang the scotch landscapepainter pacified them by proposing a game of shellout and herbert eagerly seconding the proposal it was carried nem con and the group mounted to the billiardroom where matthew strang won half a crown before he went off to his nocturnal parties leaving his cousin still renewing with zest his olden experience of the lighter side of british art chapter iii vainlonging as a matter of habit mr matthew strang went some weeks later to the academy soire to add his handshake to the many suffered by the presidential image of patience at the top of the stairs and to help appease the insatiable appetite of the crowd of christians to whom lions are thrown it was part of his success to move through fluttering drawingrooms and it imbittered him to feel that the average admirer conceives the artist as living in a world of beautiful dreams sweet with the incense of perpetually swung censers and knows nothing of the artists agonies or the craftsmans sweatings that go to the making of beautiful things sees always the completed design and never the workman scraping the paint or wetting the back of the canvas or tossing sleeplessly under the weight of a ruined picture tonight in the restless dissatisfaction that had grown upon him since the reappearance of herbert had undammed a flood of ancient memories this feeling possessed him more strongly than ever inspiring a morbid resentment of the chattering crew divided between heroworship and champagnecup there was almost a suspicion of a leonine snarl in the stereotyped answer you are very kind to say so which he gave to the grimacing persons who buttonholed him to bask in the radiance of his success or to effuse honest admiration everybody seemed to him illdressed illmannered and in illhealth he thought he had never seen so many cadaverous complexions snag teeth powdertipped noses scraggy shoulders glazed eyes with pincenez monocle or spectacles ungainly figures squat or slim queer costumes bald heads or topheavy hairdressings how horrible gentlefolk were more uncouth even than the denizens of the slums those one could imagine to be a very different breed cleaned and properly clothed but these had had every chance how poorly humanity compared with cows and horses what a price man had paid for souland without always getting it surely none but customblinded eyes could gaze unblinking unsmiling at the grotesque show of mankind the quaint crania the unsightly bodies the crowd struck him as the inventions of a comic draughtsman in a malicious mood the men in black and white the ladies in color and indeed though he was not thinking of himself his stalwart wellproportioned figure and his handsome head stood out notably from a serried batch of degenerate physiques so you are determined to cut me mr strang the painter started violently as the laughing syllables sounding far more musical than the faint faraway strains of the band in the sculpture room vibrated above the endless buzz of the crowd that hemmed him in he looked up his moody fit vanished before the radiant apparition of a beautiful woman in a shimmering amber gown from which her shoulders rose dazzling a jewelled butterfly fluttered at her breast in the twinkling of an eyeand that eye hershe recanted his contempt for the creators draughtsmanship i have bowed to you three times she said and the twinkling of her eyelarge and gray and lambentwas supplemented by the smile that hovered about the corners of her wide sweet mouth but you wont take any notice of me i beg your pardon he said in flushed embarrassment i must have been lost in thought she shook her head bewitchingly you dont remember me celebrities never do remember people though people always remember celebrities i do remember you he protested chords of memory vibrating tremulously and melodiously i had the pleasure of meeting you at a gardenparty some years ago but you dont remember my name i dont think i caught it then he said simply but i remember you scolded me because my pictures were only beautiful she laughed gayly ah then i ought to apologize to you i have changed my mind now you dont think theyre even that far from it what i mean is that i have come to think less of useful things you know i was a socialist then but let me introduce my friend to you you have to introduce yourself first nor said a younger lady whom he then perceived at her side he smiled you are irrepressible olive said her friend mr strang let me introduce myself thenmrs wyndwood he bowed still smiling eleanor wyndwood she added to explain my friends abbreviation which always puzzles strangers everybody knows nor stands for eleanor remonstrated her friend do they suppose your name is norval mrs wyndwoods smile met the painters and now if my punctilious friend is satisfied let me introduce miss regan miss regan gave him her hand cordially where are your pictures to be found mr strang she asked we havent been to the academy before and we should so like to save the shilling oh theyre not worth looking at he said uncomfortably he suddenly felt ashamed of them it was thus that he had felt more than two years ago when over her strawberries and cream mrs wyndwood had lectured him for artistic aloofness from the travail of the time insisting that it was the mission of all forms of art to express the aspiration of the century towards a higher and juster social life towards the coming of gods kingdom on earth and that it would be honester for him to plough the land than to paint decorative pictures for the diningrooms of capitalists he had scarcely taken in her point of view more persuaded by her presence than by her words by some intangible radiation of earnestness and goodness from the lovely face and the soulful gray eyes and less ashamed of the sinfulness of his own artistic standpoint than of the often meretricious quality of his performance she had been the first woman to speak slightingly of his rle in the world and her dispraise cooperating as it did with his own discontent had impressed him more than all the praise just as one unfavorable newspaper critique rankled while a hundred eulogies passed across consciousness scarcely ruffling its waves when the flux of the gardenparty had drifted her off in the wake of gerard brode the handsome young socialist he had felt that he too might have become a socialist or a ploughboy or even an honest painter under the inspiration of her enthusiastic eyes he had thought of her for several months almost as a creature of dream so swift and shadowy had been her flitting across his horizon and she had easily lent herself to that conception of ideal womanhood which the world had not yet destroyed because the world had not created it it was under the impulsion of the eloquent play of light across her face that he had conceived and painted that allegory of womans inspiration which herbert unable to read in it the pathetic expression of the painters dissatisfaction at once with real womanhood and his own work had found so amusing and he was startled now to see how nearly he had reproduced her traits in his conception of the figure on the mountaintop not so much perhaps in the features in which the slight upward tilt of the nose was omitted and the size of the ears diminished as in the clustering chestnut hair with gold lights in it and in the poise of the head the long thin botticelli hands the small feet and the graceful curves of the rather tall form and above all in the expression that seemed to suffuse her face with spiritual effluence the first impression renewed itself in all its depth he asked himself with amazement how he could have let the waves of life wash it away so completely that even herberts inquiry about the picture had not recalled her clearly to his memory oh but i want to see your pictures she said theres a triumph of bacchus i hear i saw the frescoby caracci wasnt itin the farnese palace in rome on our homeward journey weve been in russia miss regan and i with monsieur and madame dolkovitch to see podnieff in his dairyfarm oh hes so charmingso simple and saintly he enables one to construct st francis of assisi he makes very bad butter said miss regan he is the greatest spiritual force in russia mrs wyndwood said sweetly and dolkovitch is doing much to extend his influence in england i wish you knew dolkovitch mr strang why would he make me do better pictures he asked playfully struggling a little against the obsession of her sweet seriousness i will reserve my opinion till i have seen your latest manner though i confess i dont find the title the triumph of bacchus a hopeful augury of noble work but do tell me where it isor must i consult the catalogue miss regan made me bring one it is in this very room really yes its rather a compliment the academicians generally reserve the big roomor at least the linefor their own works but it is cruel of you to leave me so soon how subtle nor said miss regan of course he cannot be seen looking at his own picture do let us go where the crowd is thinner he pleaded than round your picture queried miss regan navely for shame olive laughed mrs wyndwood i shall punish you by not letting you see it we are at your service mr strang show us what you please may i not get you any refreshment he said as they passed into the smaller room and into a perceptibly cooler atmosphere no thank you this is refreshing enough said mrs wyndwood with a sigh of relief mrs wyndwood means that she lives on air said her friend oh olive i eat quite as much as you you used to before you developed this dolkovitch phase and began understudying an angel matthew saw the opportunity for a commonplace compliment but he did not take it the plane on which mrs wyndwood existed demanded reverential originality every word she said sounded magically musical and delightfully wise and witty olives remarks one merely smiled at though she too had a low voice that excellent thing in woman and was considered handsome by those she did not annoy she reminded the painter of a caryatid as she stood there rather more sturdy than her friend and shorter with stronger features and a firmer chin but to the full as graciously proportioned she had dark hair and eyes and a warm coloring that reached its most vivid tint in the intense red of the lips her dress was of a soft greenblue cut high with yellow roses at the throat and but for the painters preoccupation with her friend would have challenged his eye by subtle harmonies there goes william lodge the poet cried mrs wyndwood suddenly impossible said olive but it is the poet insisted mrs wyndwood impossible repeated olive no man can be a poet with muttonchop whiskers what has the mans appearance to do with his poetry everything mutton chops and lyrics dont rhymetheyre like that womans emeralds against her turquoise bodice a poets publisher should keep him out of sighthe damages sales look at the hooknosed creature there with the goggles and the green gownwho would believe that is mrs ashman watford who writes those dainty essays and who realizing it could ever help reading her between the lines or who retorted mrs wyndwood reading the essays could help seeing the beautiful soul behind the goggles a tremor of sympathy traversed the painters form i stand unreproved nor you can afford to be magnanimous but i contend that beautiful souls have no right to get mixed up with hooked noses we ought to judge a soul by the body it keeps if this country ever becomes a republic it will be due not to democracy but to photography you will agree with me i know mr strang he started wondering what he was called upon to agree with beauty is truth truth beauty he quoted vaguely but you never put truly ugly persons into pictures miss regan persisted no he admitted unless in portraits and not even then the girl retorted id far rather these portraits came out of their frames and walked about than promenade among the originals as we are doing now why i dont suppose theres one original present mrs wyndwood remonstrated isnt there queried olive in innocent accents i thought there were a lot judging by the want of resemblance you are not up to date said matthew strang smilingly likeness is the last thing a portraitpainter goes for values spots passages color schemes all sorts of things take precedence of the likeness in their importance for art the likeness is irrelevant to art it concerns only the sitterart concerns the world a friend of mine who edits an illustrated paper which is the first to publish portraits of everybody who becomes anybody contends that the number of persons who know any one mans features is a negligible quantity all the public demands he says is portraits so you see your criticism leaves our withers unwrung oh do produce your catalogue nor said miss regan flying off at a tangent for want of an answer i am dying to see the name of that thing stuck right up there on the ceiling mrs wyndwood after protesting that nobody else was consulting a catalogue which only made olive more eager fished out the booklet from some obscure pocket and olive turned the pages impatiently its just like miss regan to want to look at the skied pictures her friend murmured to the painter oh the poor man cried miss regan listen this is what the picture is called sweet lovebut oh most dread desire of love lifethwarted linked in gyves i saw them stand love shackled with vainlonging hand to hand and one was eyed as the blue vault above but hope tempestuous like a firecloud hove i the others gaze even as in his whose wand vainly all night with spellwrought power has spannd the unyielding caves of some deep treasuretrove oh the poor man fancy the indignity of having a long quotation skied what lovely lines exclaimed mrs wyndwood ignoring the humorous aspect which appealed to her companion do they not express the idea perfectly mr strang i am afraid i did not quite catch their significance he said flushing the confession was not so candid as it sounded for he had been less intent on the quotation than on studying the sweetness of her face and watching the emotional heaving of the jewelled butterfly on her beautiful bosom olive regan politely offered him the catalogue and his flush grew deeper as he seemed to read his personal tragedy in the poets images what ironical providence had sent him the words just then oh most dread desire of love lifethwarted perhaps it was that which made his life so unreal to him which explained its hollowness he had never loved in a strange flash of imaginative insight it seemed to him that the room was full of lovers love was in the air delicate rumors and whispers of divine delight of holy pain fluttered tremulously on all sides couples moved heartbound their beauty spiritualized their very ugliness transfigured love redeemed the creation he remembered that in the days when he had trodden the lonely london pavements hungry and heartsick jostled by hurrying crowds he had yet seemed to himself the only solid figure amid a throng of shadows flitting to death and oblivion in this tense instant he felt it was he that had always been the shadow the one shadow amid a world of substantialities and solidities a world that lived while he was recording the forms and colors of life and even if he should ever loveand the thought set his heart fluttering as he had imagined it could never flutter againeven if love should ever make existence real for him was he not predestined to a doom more terrible even than the apathy of loveless life linked in gyves i saw them stand love shackled with vainlonging hand to hand mrs wyndwood she too was married and in that thought he knew that love had begun for him the unrest into which the first vision of her had plunged him and which time had stilled had at last come to understand itself he loved and his love was vain they had come to him both at once love shackled with vainlonging hand to hand he returned the catalogue mechanically to miss regan theyre rossettisfine are they not said mrs wyndwood the question dragged him up from abysses of dream but even though he felt he must be answering it he lingered in luxurious agony over the music of the question its vibrations prolonging themselves in his ear they are indeed exquisite he said slowly at last but do you think there would be any hope tempestuous there is always hope said mrs wyndwood gently there seemed a sweet assurance in the unconscious words he heard a chime of golden bells floating up from some seaburied city perhaps it was only from the band in the sculpture room but he felt he must not attach himself further to the fascinating twain his solicitude would be too marked and he was aware of many eyes drawn by their beauty but before he could speak mrs wyndwood went on musingly and after all hope is better than fulfilment there are blue hills on the horizon which the child longs to go beyond but happiness always lies on the hither side with the blue hills still beckoning her eyes filled with dreamy light it is as george herbert so beautifully says false glozing pleasures casks of happiness foolish nightfires womens and childrens wishes chases in arras gilded emptiness shadows wellmounted dreams in a career embroiderd lies nothing between two dishes these are the pleasures here how exquisitely she spoke the melancholy lines that seemed fraught with all the pathos of the human destiny her words rippling through the buzz of platitudinarian trivialities he heard vaguely all around him like a silver stream through an unlovely country she had suffered too she too had found life and its pleasures hollow he saw that in the quiver of the beautiful lip in the wistful brightness of the eye straightway his heart was full of tears for her he longed to comfort her to sacrifice himself for her why could she not be happy he had a sense of jar when miss regan said thats rather a strange quotation for you nor indeed foolish nightfires womens and childrens wishes he had a true notion of our futility that gentle old poet i am in no fighting mood tonight olive replied mrs wyndwood gently you dont stand up for your sex the painter asked miss regan in surprise she had that resourceful selfsufficient air which he associated with pioneers of female movements olive shrugged her shapely shoulders heaven forbid that i should be the advocatus diaboli the tossing of the crowd threw up a longhaired longbearded man with a handsome leonine cast of features who greeted the two ladies with an air of camaraderie ah nous voil encore he cried joyously adding in good english though with a russian accent oh mrs wyndwood you must see the little picture of the christchild by a young follower of our nicolovitch he is exiled three years already and has established himself on your hospitable shores ah how it makes a spiritual ray among your english platitudes you will come too miss regan olive who had cast a droll glance towards the painter at the russians awkward allusion to british banality shook her head no thank you i hate children and i am tired you will find me here nor and she let herself sink into a lounge mrs wyndwood hesitated as if about to introduce the two men but the leonine dolkovitch swept her off and she had only time to leave a bewitching smile behind her wont you go and see the child mr strang olive asked he hesitated in his turn but she would come back if he waited i would rather stay with you if i may he replied gallantly olive looked sideways along the lounge there is room she reported thank you he seated himself at her side and stolidly regarded the crowd and the opposite pictures olive fanned herself silently at great length the painter stealing a sudden glance at her found her observing the human spectacle with an air of infinite sadness do you like dogs she asked unexpectedly yes he replied startled and with a vision of sprat but i havent kept one since i was a boy but why i dont know that woman there made me think of themthat creature theyre crowding round dont you see that pastyfaced hag with the false hair and the real diamonds thats miss craven st clair well what has she to do with dogs oh shes a leading lady plays those erotic parts he looked at her a little surprised by the adjective and still unenlightened and what then dont you know all leading ladies keep dogsto get extra paragraphs i hope you hate leading ladies i do theyre so virtuous and you know virtue is such a feeble vice nor has a dog though shes not a leading lady but rather a led lady led you know do you mean led by the dog yes whenever shes blind and the dog is sly she said mysteriously adding quickly nors dog isnt all hersits mine on alternate days hes such a snob is royhell never go out with her if shes frumpy he insists on swell dresses dear old roy can she be frumpy he asked she flashed a quick look at him no she is very sweet and amusing she answered gravely she is the only woman i have ever been able to live with do you live with her of coursei chaperon her matthew smiled what dont you think im old enough to chaperon a young widow his heart leaped i didnt know she was a young widow yes shes quite an old widow have you lived together long ons we disagree so much in what way our complexions go well with each others i should call that harmony not disagreement perhapsin your technical nomenclature but i call it disagreement besides we havent a thought in common i am awell how shall i define myself she looked up quizzingly her fan to her lips i belong to that class of women whose sex is a misfit and she is and she ishe repeated in some suspense she is the sort of woman who wont renew the velvet edging on her walkingdresses now you puzzle me it is evident you know nothing of women or have only observed englishwomen who mostly put up with braid velvet edging which is an american notion saves frayed skirts and wears out quicker than the stuff look at her gown tonightit trails mine fits she retains the infantile habit of long clothes i am growd up and in short frocks i didnt notice her gown men never do thats why we wear so little of them he was puzzled by a curious bitterness in her tone as well as by a perplexity as to her exact meaning her own frock was certainly prudishly high i dont quite follow your definition anyhow he said no ill try another there are only two classes of womenthose who ought to have been born men and those who ought never to have been born at all i am of the first nors of the second he shook his head laughingly oh but i wont believe that of either if i expected to be believed i should have more hesitation in telling the truth she replied gravely we are both mistakes but nor is an incorrigible one you heard her say shes dropped socialism she didnt tell you shes dropped a power of money too in subscriptions to the cause she probably thought equality would come about in three months and that she was merely disgorging in advance is that why she looks so sad dear me no money doesnt trouble her whats the matter then shes been married you mean she grieves quite the contrary but marriage brands you speak bitterlyyet you have no personal experience no i was never tempted her frank brusquerie made him feel an old acquaintance i cannot believe it he said with a smile oh if you call a proposal a temptation i call it a bare hook youre a manhater i see a womanhater if you will man i adore i dont understand you he confessed again really i am a very simple person omne ignotum pro magnifico women i know and detest men i dont know and admire if i married one i should know him but you might find him better than you expected if i didnt expect to find him better than i expected i shouldnt marry him so i should still be disappointed you see i know just enough about men to know that they are better left unknown i quite agree with nor about the blue hills it is better to keep ones illusions at present i am happy in the thought that somewhere in the universe there exists a fine man even the average man is less petty than the average woman so that the one fine man must be a bayard indeed he laughed then if he came along and made you an offer of marriage i should close with it at once you are a droll girl he could not help saying you are the first of your sex who has ever admitted to me that men are better than women didnt i tell you how sly we were a man has one or two big sins a woman a bundle of little ones ah well he said smiling two of a trade as a friend of mine says now i dont understand youor rather your friend she said flushing a little oh hes rather brutal he takes the darwinian view of things you know he says all women are in the same trademanhuntingso they run one another down but im not running one another down im running us down en bloc and besides that isnt the darwinian view at all its the males who always seek the females and develop the lively colors to attract them dont you remember tennyson in the spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robins breast yes but thats only in the lower creation argued matthew strang do you make a distinction but i am ready to agree with your friendsince he isnt here we are manhunters what a pity though that civilization has so reversed the order of natural selection that the human female has to be picked instead of picking the male see the result i see what you mean man has degenerated physically and woman morally we adore the beauties of your purse instead of your person and so we develop brain to get purses with really the effect is not so bad brains are cheap today and they dont improve the appearance anyhow if people wore their brains outsidebut who is this brutal friend of yours who gauges my sex so well do i know him i shouldnt think so hes just back from strange places so am i whats his name herbertherbert strang a brother a cousin hes not an artist he hesitated yesand no he said ah two of a trade she said slyly he smiled oh hes gone out of the business hes become a critic wise man he glanced furtively every now and then to see if mrs wyndwood was returning he was conducting the conversation with only the untroubled surface of his mind interested enough in his piquant companion but feeling her entirely as an interlude miss regan perceived his perturbation at last oh dont let me monopolize you mr strang i am quite safe here till nor returns there are so many people thirsting for you oh id rather stay with you he averred disingenuously dont be a mere man she returned raising her dark eyebrows even your admirers think you more than that its not fair for me to keep you from them he was rather in a quandary he could not tell her he was waiting for her friend to his relief ah i see them coming she said youll be off duty in a moment i must introduce you to dolkovitch hes great fun he will invite you to his spiritual sunday afternoons do you judge people by their hatracks he stared at her i mean when theyve got company dolks hatrack when hes at home is lovely id go miles to see it such curious curly dusty manyhued amorphous things on the pegsa cosmopolitan congress only the chimneypot unrepresented nor goes to meet the earnest people but i go to see their hats oh m dolkovitch do let me introduce mr strang he is dying to know you delighted said dolkovitch but i do not like this word dying miss regan oh i beg your pardoni forgot said olive mr strang is living to know you m dolkovitch like the ancient greeks mr strang doesnt like to think of death i cant let you misrepresent him to a stranger olive said mrs wyndwood m dolkovitch is wide as the poles asunder from pagan thought mr strang his teaching simply is that as there is no death but merely upward evolution the sooner the word is banished from our vocabulary the better her voice raised the discussion to celestial heights never say die cried miss regan enthusiastically every dictionary should be without it just so said m dolkovitch gravely our european customs mr strang with regard to death are all in direct contradiction to our creed the spirit rises into more blessed states and instead of rejoicing in festive attire we mourn for it we put on black and our looks are black and our hearses are black and the horses they are of black also i think its very proper said miss regan decisively i love black funerals colored funerals would make me feel sad she rose we are going soon nor arent we you look tired yes we are going at once mrs wyndwood breathed the russian gave the painter his card and hoped he would come and hear more of the new gospel next sunday afternoon spiritual people came from four to seven mr strang made a movement to accompany the ladies but mrs wyndwood begged him not to troublem dolkovitch would see them to the carriage goodbye then she said with an enchanting smile it was so good of you to talk to us words failed him in reply fortunately a little whitehaired gentleman bowed to her at that moment and distracted her attention that was general dale olive she said what a fine soldierly walk varied by ducking for bullets every moment remarked miss regan he oughtnt to know so many people not that i admire the military bearing its so unnatural and stiff one sees the drill behind even those little wooden soldiers i never liked goodbye mr strang au revoir i hope he said her at least he could answer he went to the sunday afternoon at five oclock the earliest hour one could decently go to a reception commencing at four in the meantime he had reread a great deal of shelley who seemed to have written a great deal about eleanor as she became to her lovers secret thought though her full name he learned was the honorable mrs wyndwood and she was the daughterinlaw of a viscount and connected by blood or marriage with several pages of debrett in the hopelessness of his love these ties were no separation he did not think of anything but the blissful pain of seeing her again he had ridden every morning in the row but neither of the friends had shown herself the reception was held in a flat half way up a bleak stone staircase in the west central district he was so agitated that he forgot to note the hatrack and his first glance at the company appalled him with the sense of a cosmopolitan chaos without form and void over which no light of mrs wyndwood brooded there were mystic oilpaintings on the walls of the narrow room and on the gray marble mantelpiece stood a glass of water in which floated vaguely the white of an egg the host introduced him to his wifea tall haggard giraffenecked womanwho gave him a cup of tea and passed him on to a nervously peering herr grundau who spoke to him of the revival of religion among the university burschen and passed him on to mademoiselle brinskaa a little yellow polishwoman with eyes like live coals who had been speaking every european language in turn with equal fluency as she knitted colored wools into some occult pattern i have heard your name she told him in english that sounded almost native as he seated himself next to her in the cushioned windowseat it is so good of you to say so he murmured automatically not without the astonishment which from the first had pervaded him when strangers professed knowledge of him and which had never quite worn off he thought his peculiar name accounted for his notoriety youre not a spiritual artist she said half interrogatively an artist can only be artistic he replied in vague selfdefence thats all my eye and betty martin said mademoiselle knitting indefatigably then she smiled you see i know your idioms a gradual silence fell among the jabbering gesticulating crowd all eyes were directed alternately towards the glass on the mantelpiece and mademoiselle brinskaa it is settled dolkovitch declared the polish old maid rose solemnly marched towards the fireplace and inspected the glass curiously noting the shape which the eggwhite had taken it is a portecochre she announced that means riches there was a buzz of satisfaction and a little handclapping the blinking octogenarian who had broken the egg being cheerfully complimented on his prospects the sibyl did not return to matthew strangs side and the vacant niche was taken by a stout elderly motherly lady who was introduced to him as the countess de villiers and who regardless of the fact that his eyes perpetually wandered towards the door published her autobiography to him from her babyhood in brazil to her maturity in gibraltar there could be no close to her story she volunteered for she could never die this drew matthews attention even from the door do you mean metaphorically he said no literally you could not kill me if you tried what not with a knife neither with fire nor sword you know i wouldnt try he said if you are going to treat me facetiously i will not pursue the subject she declared the red blood mantling in her sallow cheek i am quite serious he said deprecatingly a woman who can live without eating cannot die pursued the countess mollified i was an invalid and in my convalescence gradually worked my way to the truth and by means of it i have lived fourteen weeks without food i worked down from five ounces a day to nothing dropping an ounce a day and i didnt lose a pound of flesh i have fasted too he said grimly but i never found any truth through it he reflected bitterly on the anxious competition of people to give him food now that he had plenty of his own was this the london which he had tramped for work famished and rebellious you must be patient she answered earnestly you must kill the man in you then you will have got rid of the mortal part you will be pure spirit part of god existence is only gods thoughts everything good is a godidea everything evil a manidea jesus was the first discoverer of the truth and only the manidea in him was crucified the mortal part only the evil part of us is mortal i have suppressed the manidea in myself therefore i cannot die but do you mean to say you will always live on yes though not necessarily on earth but what will happenwill you disappear she frowned oh i know you are making fun of me but i assure you many eminent men have sat at my feet even dolkovitch says i have a greater grip of the truththe glorious truth of immortalitythan any other woman in europe except mademoiselle brinskaa and the clairvoyant princess stevanovna there is nothing miraculous i dont keep away from society i dance and paint but throughout all i am struggling against the badself what sort of things do you paint he asked feeling for firmer ground my vision she said in rapt tones my assurance that the universe is all living spirit and all of a sudden a conviction came to him that she was right that there was no death no room for death eleanor wyndwood had arrived and in the light of her face the noisy motley throng took meaning and music he rose eagerly but she did not see him in his niche and he sat down again awkwardly the countess talked on but he had forgotten even to feign the listener he could only see the gleam of a creamy dress in rifts of the crowd which thickened momently presently he was aware of miss regan who gave him an abrupt bow and then crossing over to him said in vexed accents i am very angry with you how are you countess young as ever i see what have i done inquired matthew strang youve spoiled my hatrack theres a chimneypot on it life has so few pleasures one cant afford to be robbed oh please forgive me he said half seriously i shantyoure too respectable tell me something bohemian and ill do it he pleaded well come to tea with me some five oclockwith me and nor that is is that very bohemian no im afraid not said olive glumly then brightening up but thats only a beginning and you havent got time to come either that makes it a pleasure i shall be delighted to find time he said looking his words while they were discussing dates the countess rose and stalked away she looks offended he said poor old countess said olive shes breaking up fast but shes going to live forever i know how sad we came across her at romethe eternal lady in the eternal city shes much grayer since then earthly immortality seems almost as horrible as heavenly fancy living for ever and ever and ever no rest for the righteous oh i do hope religion isnt true hows your friend which friend the brutal friend youre a queer girl he said laughing in spite of himself thats tautology all girls are queer did you ever know a woman absolutely sane he winced a littleshadows of his mother and his wife flashed past she answered herself triumphantly of course not weve all got bees in our bonnets men havent even got bonnets except highlanders and they dont wear the breeches i beg pardon i should have said unmentionables to a member of the chimneypotted classes but that always seems silly its like spelling damn in books with a d and a blank i have a lovely private swear would you like to hear it he laughed assent damakakaparatanasuta the pink lady who always forgets her bodice is looking shocked she doesnt know its sanscrit or something and means the foundation of the kingdom of righteousness dont laugh it really does there is a cousin of the guicowar of baroda over thereyou can ask him why i have even got nor to swear to swear it its like temperance champagne ah id better go over to her he said snapping at the opportunity or else shell accuse me of cutting her again he pushed a whit rudely through the teacupbalancing throng but to his horror he found eleanor distributing farewells she smiled faintly at him as her magnetic fingers touched his for a moment what wicked things have you been saying to mademoiselle brinskaa he looked at her in astonishment ive hardly said a word to her she shook her head and passed towards the door he spent some wretched days wondering if he had offended her and what the little yellow woman had been saying about him he put the question as soon as he was seated at the teatable in the dainty drawingroom of the tiny mayfair house which the oddly assorted couple had taken for the season mrs wyndwood would not say but miss regan cried out dont make such a mystery nor youll make the man think hes accused of murder or drinking his tea out of a saucer the polish priestess says she doesnt like your aurasvoil tout what are auras he asked relieved and puzzled the latin for airs of course laughed olive its her mystical way of saying you give yourself airs yes you do youre disapproving of our furniture now but its through nors objecting to furniture that suited my complexion and vice versa we compromised by getting furniture in discord with both our complexions the beautiful photos you see all about you are minei mean my collection they are actresses i adore beautiful women after what you told me about the unimportance of the likeness i shall consider them works of art i have always thought that actresses photographs are intended as a protection against the curiosity of the public but for them actresses would be liable to be recognized and mobbed in the streets great heavens ive forgotten the scones and with this unexpected exclamation olive rushed out of the room she would insist on baking scones herself mrs wyndwood explained with an affectionate smile she is deliciously odd he replied laughing do you find her so ive got used to her theres a monotony in the variety behind it all i see always this one factshes the noblest creature in the world he was touched by the enthusiastic tribute so different from olives amused estimate of her friend you must find it very pleasant to live with her he said yes especially afterbut she shuddered and did not complete the sentence he read in her face the tragedy of an unhappy marriage his eyes grew moist with pity he felt a mad fighting passion against the inevitable past olive is so good she said brokenly she was of my husbands familyan irish branchbut she quarrelled with them allher father her sistersand came to live with me fortunately she is immensely rich in her own right and independent of them all done to a turn cried miss regan rushing in with the scones and i feared i was king alfred at tea they talked art it was an exquisite sensation to have these charming ladies treat him as sir oracle he was surprised to learn that in her girlhood miss regan had displayed considerable talent for sculpture but had washed her hands of the clay on seeing the torso of victory in the louvre he remonstrated with her insisting that technical skill came slowly with infinite labor there were things he himself wanted to doall sorts of new things that he had never yet done one day he would try to do themwhen he had time mrs wyndwood spoke contemptuously of technical skill in comparison with soul but here olive mischievously took up the cudgels for craftsmanship and led the rather reluctant painter into an eloquent exposition of the joys of technical mastery of doing what you would with your material mrs wyndwood at last caught the fire of his enthusiasm and astonished him by expressing his sense of the joy of art better than himself under the passion of her words he wondered that he could ever have wasted his time on portraits for mere money or on scamped pictures for exhibitions when all these interesting problems were waiting to be wrought out ah but miss regan was wrong he felt in thinking these problems the beall and endall of art it was soul that was the essence of art art had no raison dtre except as the expression of soul of the upward aspiration of the spirit towards the good and the beautiful and the true a trinity that was mysteriously one chapter iv ferment the sands of the season were running out but matthew strang sifted them for every grain of the gold of meetings with eleanor wyndwood he was shy of formal visits to the house he did not venture on the conventional course of asking her to sit to him for he would not consciously feed the flame of a passion that must be hopeless but with that curious illogicality which distinguishes man from the brute he called in accident to arrange their rendezvous pursuing possibility with a perseverance that made it probability he could not follow eleanor to all her fashionable fastnesses as easily as to the shrines of spirituality for to be born well is still a necessity of life in some circles but they met often enough amid the monotonous glitter which was the womans birthright and second nature to the man his eye perpetually sought her in chattering drawingrooms in cool gardens on congested staircases in whirling ballrooms finding every place dark and empty till she filled and illumined the scene she gleamed upon him as unreal and insubstantial as the figures he had once noted in one of these ballrooms completely girdled by electric lights which robbing the dancers of shadows made them fairylike and phantasmal but he did not follow out the analogy or suspect it might be his own love which was surrounding her with this spiritualizing electric illumination each time he saw her he resolved never to see her again he could never tell her what was in his heart never insult her exquisite purity with the avowal of his love even though that love were clarified to unimagined ethereality by her stainless radiance of soul and each time the possibility of seeing her drew nigh again he told himself that he needed her for his artthat she was drawing him up from the slough of banality that now for the first time his soul was really opening out to the appeal of the higher beauty not that he had as yet begun to express the higher beauty he had simply abandoned the old he was too restless to work to concentrate himself he flitted between the unfinished and the projected painting in and painting out he took long rides in the middle of the day to the amazement of his faithful bodyservant he read emotional literature once an unconscious hostess gave him eleanors company at dinner mrs wyndwood was in stately black with a bunch of violets at her bosom it was an enchanted meal they talked of poetry and he seemed to be dining off poetry too the wines where special brands of nectar laid down by the gods in the golden age the meats were ambrosia the sweets honeydew a beauty as of hebe transfigured the faces of the neathanded waitingmen it seemed only natural that the beautiful stately creature at his side should overflow with quotations from religious poetrywas she not herself a religious poem his recent feverish readings had branded lines on his own heart he was able to answer her in lyric antiphony his other neighbor he simply forgot though she was a bishops consort and a patroness of the arts with printed views on the genuineness of old masters there was an old picture of his own on the opposite wall and the fear lest eleanor should raise her eyes to it was all the serpent in his paradise his subconsciousness noted with pleasure however that the painting had melloweda proof that his theory of colors was right he watched with furtive fascination the play of eleanors beautiful botticelli hands plying her knife and fork as she explained how under the influence of dolkovitch she had drifted away from socialism whose professors always laid too much stress on the needs of the body but she apologized for having spoken rudely of his triumph of bacchus from a mere knowledge of its title he had made her understand now that the appeal of painting must always be sensuous and that subject was only an excuse for draughtsmanship and coloring and she startled him by saying she liked that picture of his on the opposite wall which he had been hoping had escaped her eye it became at once glorified to his own after the ladies had retired the gentlemen talked about a newly invented torpedo the finances of india and the prospects of the conservatives the conversation sounded almost indecent and he was glad eleanor was not there to hear it he took no part in the fatuous discussion contenting himself with watching eleanors face amid the wreaths of his cigarsmoke even in the flesh the face had for him something of this vaporous elusive incorporeality in the drawingroom the inevitable miss regan claimed his attention eleanor was playing mendelssohn and he would have liked to listen but olive was less original you have never honored our fiveoclocks again she said reproachfully he murmured that he was busy that was the charm of your coming she reminded him one had the sensation of beguiling you to play truant but i suppose the tea was bad nor would make it the tea was beautiful he said smiling but arent we disturbing the music on the contrary nor is giving us lieder ohne wrte and we have to supply the words i wonder what makes her play such oldfashioned schoolgirl things then it must have been the scones he shook his head and pursed his lips and the music flowed on like a lovely moonlit stream he was drifting on the stream with eleanor as in those faroff days of young romance he had dreamed of lovers drifting a mystic silver haze was shed from the moon that sailed softly through the lambent starry sky the whisper of the wind among the trees and the quiet lapping of the water made a dulcet stillness that was punctuated by the passionate jugjug of the nightingale mysterious palaces of night glided along the banks behind dim gardens wafting drowsy odors the thought shook him that the world held such loverslovers who were not brought together for a moment and hurled apart in the accidental whirl of society atoms lovers whose lips were not eternally sundered but lovers who were each others sunshine and moonlight and music daily nightly perennially he alone was doomed to eternal lonelinessnay to that aggravated form of loneliness which is shared with a lifelong partner i came across your cynical friend the other day he started becoming conscious that his eyes were full of sweet hopeless tears indeed he murmured automatically yes the cousin you told me of did i tell you of him dont you remember you told me he said all women are in the same trade well he is veritably a cynic of cynics for he candidly informed me after i had been bantering and mystifying him with my foreknowledge of him that he had simply quoted schopenhauer where did you meet him he asked a little interested at the dudleyheatonss reception a fortnight ago i call him the minister of the interior hes such an epicurethe politician i mean not your cousin there was lord fashborough there the man whos just been appointed president of the cruelty to children commission and who glittered with stars and orders like a comicopera begum he it was introduced your cousinat my request of course your cousin told me the begum and he had travelled together in spain when the begums appetite for bullfights and cockfights was insatiable i have never been in spain and two of my favorite illusions were destroyed at one fell blow it seems that they simply push reluctant decrepit old horses on to the horns of the bulls and then the spanish women your cousin describes them as ugly and unwashed he shuddered why would miss regan perversely obtrude the prose of life upon his consciousness he would not answer herhe tried to drift again with the magic stream but the spell was broken he knew it was eleanors music that made the pictures and that the odors came from the flowers at olives throat he is painting nors portrait she went on indifferently he had to answer her nowin a stifled interrogative masking a sudden sharp agony and foreboding what herbert yes he asked her to give him some sittings he hasnt altogether become a critic you see who introduced him to her i did of course but his request was rather hasty wasnt it oh it wasnt the first time we met him again at the russian embassy and how does mrs wyndwood know he can paint olive laughed quietly oh he said so he usually tells the truth i fancy but he is an artist isnt he he was a gold medallist of the royal academy he answered with unaccustomed bitterness a mad envy was consuming him why had he not asked mrs wyndwood to sit to him seeing that her consent was so facile was he always to stand by while the best of life was seized and carried off by the bolder the more reckless nay by the more unworthy the remembrance that herbert had the right and he had not did not dilute his bitterness though it brought a hot flush to his cheek who was he to see profanation in the juxtaposition of eleanor with a man like herbert however ignoble herberts conception of womanhood had not he himself always found him lovable arent you friends olive asked divining alienation in his tone he felt remorseful oh we are great friends he answered with cordial warmth he was very kind to me when i first came to london he asked me to sit as well olive pursued satisfied matthew strang felt the tension in his brain relax and are you going to no i hate flattery so i sacrificed nor instead of course i shall go and sit by her though not with her curious the subtleties of language then you will still chaperon her he said with a joyous smile i never neglect a pleasant duty she answered placidly but we can only give him a few sittings ah he interrupted with an involuntary exclamation of relief were leaving town he looked blank now are you indeed of course why are you surprised didnt you think we were proper nor wanted the eternal homburg or switzerland but im resolved to show her england like most travelled cockneys she thinks englands the capital of london and i want to teach her geography so were off to devonshire she will enjoy devonshire scenery yes especially the creamery thats what ive christened the little godforsaken village i discovered so you know if you ever want a cup of tea we shall have fiveoclocks going on there also patronize the creamery i will he said with an instant resolution to take tea both in mayfair and in devonshire thats right well send a coachandfour to meet you at least youll find it waiting at the station for passengers do you know whom i should like to meet most of all men living wagner the pope the czar dont be absurd the rev septimus wheercastle a local guidebook says the rev septimus wheercastle speaks in very favorable terms of the undercliff isnt it delicious imagine a gentleman in a white tie patronizing an undercliff but then the clergy are always patronizing the almighty so why not his works hush he said indicating the proximity of the bishop isnt he beautiful she asked in an awed whisper what a privilege never to be mistaken for a waiter i am so proud of the bishops in my family we have a pair with gaiters to match both high church atheists they are the joys of my life they and the dowager duchess who wears kisscurls and raves for blood give me blood she cries as she denounces modern society stabbing her potato with her fork la sarah siddons to matthew strang who still had a vague reverence for duchesses it was troubling to see them through the eyes of relatives for whom they were common clay but this had always been his disappointment the further he penetrated into the arcana of aristocracy and into the ranks of the distinguishednobody ever seemed quite so imposing as his or her name in the paper taken in the mass aristocracy of birth or brain was dazzling overwhelming but the individual was always amiably imperfect with the exception of course of the one perfect being in the universe eleanor wyndwood you dont think much of your family miss regan he said smiling no and they return the compliment they dont realize how near doomsday is for us aristocrats we must disappear we have played our part what part oh i dont know i suppose the upper classes the people of leisure existed to evolve culture that can now be grafted on to the artisan and both the upper and the lower classes can disappear we want the amalgam nowculture without its vices and work without its vulgarity shall we ever get what we want she smiled with ineffable sadness and weariness i sometimes think that that makes life worth living that and bishops this is the only world in which bishops could happen there is some consolation too in royal drawingrooms and kangaroos do you think there is any other planet in which ladies walk backward or animals hop i wonder when one feels weary of the burden of existence one thinks of the humor of creation and stays on it is a delicious world do you mean that you enjoy the imperfections of life i dont know what i mean i hate to see illfed people and i hate to see wellfed people unhappy people pain me and happy people irritate me what do i mean oh i think i see it at last it is the unintelligent people that i hate to see unhappy and the intelligent people that i hate to see happy people who have brains and are happy cant have souls the fools ought to have creature comforts because they are fools enough to value them before all else how i envy my maids capacity for envying me thank you mr strang you have enabled me to understand myself the music stopped but the player was at once monopolized by the bishop fragments of their conversation reached the ears of the couple shes trying to convert him to christianity olive observed gravely didnt i tell you she was the most unpractical creature shes always leading forlorn hopes how is herbertmy cousinpainting her he asked oh hes only had one sitting shes to be done lordinaire but she had her hair dressed speciallysuch a waste of timeand was manicured and the man took as long manicuring her as if she had been briareus i mean what will she wear oh a sentimental expressionthe sort of look you see in a girls face when shes sitting on the stairs with her hand in a mans a shudder traversed her shoulders crinkling the blue bodice that covered them for the rest she will be clothed in one of those creamy lownecked gowns that become her so well before the evening was over olive was induced to sing matthew strang was startled to find her choosing a lovesong and he was as astonished by the passionate intensity of her vocalization as by the beauty of her rich contralto voice ninon ninon she sang que faistu de la vietoi qui nas pas damour and the notes melted exquisitely in pity the tears returned to his eyes it was his tragedy it was eleanors tragedy it was everybodys tragedy ninon ninon que faistu de la vie very few days went by before he rang mrs wyndwoods bell the mental image of eleanor sitting to herbert was the motor that drove him to call he had only seen his volatile cousin once or twice since they had dined together at the limnersherbert strangs curious facility for taking up and dropping people had persisted unchanged but the couple were destined to meet now for victorias and hansoms hovered outside mrs wyndwoods house and matthew strang found that he had stumbled upon a formal at home at which herbert was fetching and carrying strawberryices to perspiring beauty the popular painter noted with a novel thrill of alarm the boyish good looks of his friend whose spruce smiling figure was so visibly the cynosure of feminine eyes happily for his peace of mind eleanor was too busy welcoming her miscellaneous visitors to allot much attention to herbert who seemed indeed amply content with engaging the interest of half a dozen fair women not counting an occasional interlude of miss regan matthew strang slowly ploughed his way to the hostess a coollooking angel in white through the block of bonneted ladies amid which an occasional man stood out unpicturesque you seem surprised to see me he said in low tones into which he infused an intimate note yes indeed said eleanor with a little frank laugh how did you know it was my day he smiled mysteriously wondering the while if she could hear his heart beat above the feminine babble you ought not to have come pursued eleanor with a little pout that made her face adorable we pay you the compliment of not asking you to our teafights and this is how you appreciate it forgive me he said intoxicatingly flattered i do appreciate it i didnt know i came for a cup of tea with no idea of fighting for it then let me give it you do you take sugar and she handed him the cup which he took with a hand that trembled then a press of fresh people cut him off from her and she made no effort to keep him by her side gloom invaded his breast again he had to speak to some of the crowd and he did his duty with ill grace he feared it would be too presumptuous to outstay the intrusive crew so he resolved to escape as soon as possible but herbert captured him with a hearty handshake and introduced himwith a certain proprietary prideto his bevy of dames and he was perforce added to the applausive circle in the centre of which herbert quizzed the rest of the company and the universe at large isnt that lily oreilly talking with mrs wyndwood he said catching olives passing eye sure and it is that answered olive permitting the eye an unwonted roguish twinkle she is talking about her new novel wonderful woman soliloquized herbert for the benefit of his galaxy she is more read by the superfine critics than any other lady novelist in london oh mr strang protested lady william dallox a petite elegant creature with an air of having stepped off a decorative panel why the critics all slate her awfully i know but thats her revengeto threaten her reviewers with libel actions so that they have to read her to see if she deserved their slatings youre a saucy cynic sir said olive laughingly what is a cynic airily retorted herbert an accurate observer of life beyond that definition cynicism cannot go said olive ceasing to smile what a pity said herbert at any rate it is true as far as it goes to call miss oreillys hair chameleoncolored would be considered cynical yet it is but accurate observation the inaccurate observer of life would call it auburn not seeing that it is only auburn pro tem and that it goes through as many editions as her books similarly to call her complexion handpainted would be rudeness interrupted olive more severely especially as i heard her asking mrs wyndwood to introduce to her the young man who looked so much like the hero of one of her novels ah that puts another complexion on the matter said herbert lightly under cover of the confusion of feminine compliment that greeted the quick sally matthew strang slipped away leadenhearted from the sight of the smiles and the sound of the laughter even had he been free what chance would he have had pitted against his brilliant cousin he knew himself a silent man scarcely speaking unless abnormally moved much less scintillating he had only one talentone poor talent for expressing the beautiful to one senseand this one talent he had prostituted everything grew black to his morbid mood the dying afternoon cool sunglinted had no beauty for him the speckless grooms outside the door irritated him the shining carriages dashing along the great arteries of the west end bearing their lolling occupants to dress and dinner stirred him to something of the same revolt that he had felt when he had walked the metropolis of wealth and fashion in broken boots after all he had never really entered this circle of pleasure it had always been a fairyring he could not step into beautiful as his boots were externally there had always been a nail a pebble inside that adverse atom which according to the philosopher suffices to destroy happiness his had always been a life of labor of misery he was still of the downtrodden classes of those whom fate if not man grinds down whose lives slip by in a vain yearning for the sun who see happiness as a phantasm that is only solid for others and love as the mocking mirage of a beauty that is far away he was angryso unreasonably angry that the unreason seemed a reason for fresh anger with himself and he was angry not only with himself but with herbert with the world aye with eleanor wyndwood and her idle harebrained visitors reeking of the toilettable chattering of poems pictures and symphonies the thought of his mother came up from dim recesses of memorystill babbling in the asylum that was her haven of refuge after a life of storm and stress and sorrow and weary watchings for a vagrant mateand he was jealous of eleanor for her sake jealous of her beauty her breeding her wealth her fine dresses her carriage her fashionable visitors jealous of all that made her different from his mother of all that made her life fuller freer higher richerof all in fine that made him love her ah god how he loved her he could scarcely keep back the hysteric sobs that swelled at his throat but they had always been shut out from the sunshine his mother and he happiness oh to clasp it to hold it tight nothing counted except happinessambition success art money alike vain gauds shadows he walked past his turning and far beyond lights began to twinkle in the great tired city the summer evening brooded fresh and cool over the vast stretches of dusty stone when at last he reached his studio the sun had set he saw the pale roseglow mystically tender at the end of the long suburban avenue of green trees and yellow streetlamps it spoke to him of peace and rest and resignation and some secret beauty behind all not many days later his restless feet took him again to the mayfair house he would speak outat some opportunity which the shrewd kindly olive would not fail to afford himhe would tell eleanor all she meant to him how she was becoming the pivot of his thought how she and she alone might inspire his art to higher purpose he would not ask for love only for a noble friendship he needed an understanding soul to sympathize with his inmost self his aspirations his agonies he had always been hedged in by thick barriers of ice through which no human soul had ever pierced no one knew what tinder for divine fires lay awaiting the spark within nor how cold and lonely he felt in his glacial isolation but at first his visit threatened to be even more disappointing than the last another man was taking teaor rather eating nougat with mrs wyndwood and miss reganyoung and fascinating of feature but with a fatal air of the minor poet and a poet indeed he proved to be a poet of considerable pretensions who might win the bays if only he could get over his unfortunate appearance which seemed to tie him down to sugared prettiness and elegant concetti matthew strang had read one of his dainty giltedged volumes wherein dapper lyrics posed in the centre of broadmargined pages and he wondered resentfully why mrs wyndwood did not lecture him into spirituality instead of feeding him with nougat which his poetry already resembled but though harold lavender was accommodating enough to go soon matthew strang profited little by his retirement from the field for eleanor seemed to be in a freakish mood as if the contagion of olive had infected her or the nougat had made her terrestrial and she played a lively second to her vivacious friend in recapitulating the charms of their dog roy a slumbrous scotch collie that he had barely noted before but which now became the climax of creation weve only hired him mrs wyndwood explained lady arthur to whom the house belongs asked us to take charge of him so hes in the inventory his father was a pedigree dog and won five hundred guineas yes her ladyship had him catalogued completely lest we should lose a bit of him said olive rolling the animal over and digging her fingers affectionately into his fur and pulling his ears and his paws and his tail to illustrate her recital of his perfections brownandwhite coatthe brown of an autumn filbert with a collar and shirtfront of white fur over skin as pink as rosebudslook at itblack gums and palate with the whitest of teeth canines i believe a tail of russet and black and white that waves like a palmtree observe the little black ring we identified him once by it though we had never noticed it before had we my beauty mrs wyndwood took up the ball he was lost stolen or strayed and information was lodged at a policestation that a collie with a black ring round his tail had been found we told the superintendent ours had no such ring the inaccurate observation of life you see mr strang broke in olive which according to your cousin delivers one from cynicism but cynicism has something to do with dogs hasnt it observed mrs wyndwood smilingly yes said olive we must get mr strang to define cynicism as the accurate observation of dogs dont forget to tell him nor when you sit to him tomorrow matthew strang moved uncomfortably on his seat raging inwardly and scarcely knowing whether he was more jealous of herbert or of roy well that superintendent must have been a cynic mrs wyndwood went on for he recommended us to go and look at the dog all the same it was a wild expeditionnearly eleven oclock at nightwe routed out a nest of costers who lived over a stable and were invaded by means of a ladder i felt like a robber viking all heartbeat and adventure it was glorious yes and roy came bounding out and nearly toppled you over and all the little costers came crowding out of bed in their nightdresses and you gave mrs coster a sovereign for them in mistake for a shilling mrs wyndwood went into a fit of mirth over the recollection for once her melodious laugh grated upon his ears what in the world was there to laugh about it seemed all the most puerile nonsense he could have cried more easily remark his lively air said olive his intuitive sympathy is wonderful he is sad when you weep and merry when you frivol the painter merely heard the dog panting like an impatient steamengine he wants a run i think he observed ungraciously aye you should see him run cried mrs wyndwood it makes one feel young again to see him scampering up hill and down dale even a mudhill delights him it reminds him of his native moors doesnt it roy dear roy stared at her with large unblinking eyes but we are not dressed well enough to go out with him now said olive i told you what a snob he was mr strang shake paws with the gentleman dear hes smart enough even for your tastes see how he likes you mr strang if he didnt the skin over his dear old nose would snarl up into gathers and puckers and frills there thats his favorite attitudeon his hindlegs with his forepaws placably on a beloved lap now he is happy how simple life is for him lucky dog ah you forget that he too has his ideal his unachieved aspiration said mrs wyndwood the disappointment of his life is that he cant catch birds he snaps at everything that soars in aireven insects it exasperates him to find things hovering mockingly overhead in defiance of gravity he sits on his haunches and wails over the emptiness of life matthew strang gave roy a kindlier pat but the creature was still stretched on the tapis of conversation and olive proceeded to a whimsical account of the partition of roy between eleanor and herself as joint housekeepers since they could not bisect the collie he belonged to each on alternate days so that if he were lost again the onus would rest on the mistress for the day by this time the painter could hardly refrain from kicking the dog and when mrs wyndwood added that roy was only eighteen months old he rose to go mrs wyndwoods expression changed youre not running away yet she said i must he murmured his illhumor abating under the sweet seriousness of her face why you havent talked to us at allwe want to hear more about technique technique cant be talked he said still surly we havent any materials for practical demonstrations said olive not even a blackboard i should love to be an artist cried mrs wyndwood to feel beauty growing under ones handwhat a sense of creative divinity i never sit to an artist without thinking what a privilege is his now what are you laughing at olive nothing except your subtle way of complimenting yourself on your good looks now if mr strang will be good and waste a little more valuable time on two foolish women i will pay him a compliment he sat down his curiosity stimulated and olive producing a box of turkish cigarettes asked if he objected to her smoking permission being obtained she got him to apply a light to her cigarette and then bade him smoke one himself he was relieved to find mrs wyndwood an abstainer there said olive puffing out a thin cloud that is the highest compliment i can pay a manto expose myself in all my horror i smoke neither for toothache nor neuralgia but for sheer viciousness see the result of our visit to podnieffnor picked up ideals and i smoke perhaps they are the same thing in the longrun matthew strang dissented vehemently ideals are the only realities nonsense they are the only things that change retorted miss regan the ideal woman of tomorrow will smoke shag and birdseye in long clay pipes eleanor wyndwood came to his assistance and together they did battle with olive who took up the most perverse philistine positions and fought as if for life eluding shuffling dodging equivocating turning twisting doubling upon herself with the most daring defiance of consistency and the most bizarre flashes of wit and argument she would snatch a victory by specious logic that could only hold for a moment and stand in as serenely mocking triumph upon a crumbling sandheap as if she knew herself upon a rock and was not about to bound off to the next sandheap the instant the tide of reason swept this one hopelessly away the painter found a celestial knitting of soul in thus fighting side by side with eleanor he did not blench even when she quoted a quatrain from harold lavender to enforce her point but the shades of earth returned when she referred to herbert strang here is an example of a man who has absolutely nothing to gain from artwho doesnt need it who has meansto whose sceptical spirit the applause of the world is indifferent and yet the other morningwhen the sunshine called one to the joys of the dolce far nientehe sat for hours toiling painfully at his art and fretting because he had allowed his right hand to lose its cunning he had neglected the ideal but now his soul thirsts for it again and the ideal is avenged matthew strang felt a malicious satisfaction in the thought that herbert was not getting on very well with the portrait he had a sudden curiosity to see it you are really too simple nor said olive plaintively cant you see the mans only trying to spread out the sittings so as to have you come there i dare say he can paint as well as the present mr strang eleanor flushed hotly oh theres no deception about his limitations i am almost sorry i consented matthew strangs heart leaped exultant he did let his gifts rust he said magnanimously but i dare say his old talent will come back after a little practice he had a fine colorsense in the old days his magnanimity seemed to please both ladies especially olive and the discussion wound up suddenly in a congruity as unexpected as any of her arguments you were great chums then werent you she asked yes he was my cicerone in artistic society i might almost say in civilized society i owe him a good deal he had no shame in hinting at his humble origin to these two unconventional gentlewomen where is his studio he asked they told him but miss regan seemed to be suddenly uneasy a little clock on the mantelpiece struck six silvery notes he thought his hostesses might want to dress elaborately for some dinnerparty or the theatre so he tore himself away and jumping into a hansom drove on the impulse of the moment to herberts studio olive sighed wearily and leaned her head upon her elbows which were planted on the teatable eleanor stooped and kissed her lie down dear till dinner the heat has been too much for you you look tired to death heigho i wish i was really whats the use of living nor darling oh life is so beautiful exclaimed eleanor with shining eyes think of art think of nature cheer up olive the horrid season will soon be over and then hey for devonshire and the creamery added the girl in hollow accents but lets get away at once dear we must stay for a few things yetwe promised mrs wyndwood reminded her sweetly theres the dance at lady surbitons and the reception of olive interrupted her with a burst of laughter that sounded hysterical to her friends anxious ears oh its a mad bad world but there are lady surbitons teagowns do lie down dear why arent there convents for unbelievers nor its an oversight id get me into a nunnery but i should be suspected of piety the hospitals are overrun they are as impossible as ramsgate and your nurse is suspected of being a heroine when will people understand that altruism is a passion and that nobody wants to be patted on the back for gratifying instinct when i did that months hard in the dublin hospitalbut that was before i knew you dearhalf my family thought me mad and the other half a saint but i was only incapable nor dearest i couldnt dress ugly wounds as if i wasnt feeling the pain of them no im a failure theres nothing for it save suicide or marriage said mrs wyndwood softly laying her cheek to her friends olive moved her head away shuddering violently id breed dogs rather she rose to her feet and stretched her arms they are happy arent you roy she leaned down and pulled the collies jaws apart eating and sleeping sleeping and eating why didnt evolution stop with you instead of going further and faring worse but still there are those birds roy and on our side theres art and theres nature eleanor wyndwood says which art is it going to be bytheway eleanor wyndwoodpoetry or painting but its two to one on painting youre feverish darling said eleanor troubled dont talk at random im talking straight dear two strangs to one lavender and what has become of spirit dearest that used to come before art and nature and who said it doesnt still eleanor answered deprecatingly then with a passionate cry that set her beautiful bosom heaving my god olive why do you misjudge me cant you understand earnest seeking tears came into her eyes and trickled down her face olive kissed them away im a brute eleanor the heats too much for both of us goodnight going to lie down dearest no going to bed matthew strang had rung several times before he could gain admittance to his cousins studio herbert appeared in his shirtsleeves grinning and yawning tit for tat he said but im awfully glad you came old man i was just dreaming of you by jove isnt it hot when herbert said old man in his caressing voice matthew became as clay in the hands of the potter it seemed so good to have the friendship of this sunny being he answered affectionately that it was hot you havent seen this den before said herbert not so swell as yours but then im hard up matthew smiled incredulously for the studio was charming youre doing a portrait of mrs wyndwood i hear who told you i was there this afternoon yes did you see her friend miss regan she is always there i know isnt she a jolly little girl shes very odd said matthew odd you philistine shes the most amusing girl in london and so unaffected you can say anything to hertalk about anything no beastly prudishness thats what i like in a woman the other day she was complaining gravely that a woman couldnt be a burglar because it would land her in compromising situations therefore there never could be thorough equality of the sexes she maintained wasnt it quaint she sits here smoking cigarettes while i paint that saintly friend of hers and all the while rattles on in the most delightful fashion what a flow of spirits and by jove the clever biting things she says make your hair curl im not in it with her though i try hard i draw her out to talk about her relationsits better than thackeray shes no end of a swell you know i know and disgustingly rich in short shed be intolerable if she wasnt herself what an enviable lot all the bsbeauty bullion blue blood and brilliancy no wonder shes lighthearted they say she had an eccentric dad which accounts for hera man who wasted one of his fortunes on socialistic experiments but she knows better than that eccentricity in the parent is epigram in the child which is an epigram said matthew laughing and considerably relieved by this outburst on his cousins part but your parents were not eccentric indeed dont you see any eccentricity in the poor old governors trying to make an artist out of me where is that portrait asked matthew amused here it is you duffer staring you in the face on the easel all the time dont say you didnt recognize it please dont now that i know who it is began matthew laughing it is ghastly old man isnt it but that girl distracts me with her talk what made you attempt it asked matthew candidly i wanted to hear her talk whom miss regan matthew felt a great wave of affection for his cousin but why dont you paint her she wouldnt sit i had to ask her friend knowing shed accompany her but im half sorry i undertook it now youre certainly not doing her justice there was still plenty of light he took up the brush and within a quarter of an hour mrs wyndwoods sweetly spiritual face gleamed unmistakably upon the canvas herbert watched with admiration those sure swift strokes behind which lay so arduous a training so irrepressible an instinct you seem to have her face by heart he said at last with a suspicious twinkle but dont let me interrupt you and lighting a cigarette he threw himself on a lounge in an attitude that curiously recalled old times to the painter matthew strang painted on lovingly till he could no longer see his palette then herbert took him to his new clubthe epicureanand gave him a delightful dinner for his pains and over the kmmel and the coffee borrowed a hundred pounds from him so as not to sell out a stock that was depreciated for the moment chapter v a celebrity at home herbert strang had gone down to devonshire to finish his portrait of mrs wyndwood whose dress was still unrecognizable and who was so agreeably surprised by the face that she graciously consented to continue the sittings at the creamery matthew had arranged to join himon the excellent pretext of keeping his old friend companybut before he left town for his holiday conscience began working hard ominously presageful of the complications that might spring up in the solitudes of hills and waters the inner voice whispered strenuously to him to profit by eleanors absence to fight down his impossible passion not intensify it unendurably by following in her train thoughts of his wife began to haunt himthoughts which while he was only an absentee husband had been but pale shadows of remorse dogging his few unoccupied moments but which now that another woman had at last enthroned herself in the vacant temple of his soul assumed shapes more solid and insistent home plucked at his heart subtly transformed to something more than an unpleasant recollection in a spasm of compunction and foreboding he resolved to pay a visit to his wife to strengthen himself against temptation the idea once conceived drove him to instant execution ere the train had drawn up at camden town he had determined to elude temptation altogether by accompanying his own family on its annual jaunt the visit began inauspiciously when he had passed the ivyclad turreted church which was the one picturesque object on the road from the station he was back in the old familiar mesh of gray streets any one like any other with rows of shabby semigenteel stonefronted houses exactly alike broken at corners by bakershops and greengrocers the august afternoon was depressed with misty sputtering rain a few tradesmens carts rattled forlornly down the drab avenues of apathetic houses a diminutive barrelorgan wheezed a lively air never had his street seemed so hopeless his ardor grew chill he paused before the door of the little studio where he had painted his first successmotherhood the discolored woodset in the blankness of a long brick wallwas scrawled over with chalk inscriptions and sketches by the urchins of the neighborhood the house was round the corner and after a melancholy moment he walked listlessly towards the front gate swung it on its creaking hinges and mounted the chipped stone steps washed ashengray by the drippings of rain there was a new face heavy and smudged under the illadjusted cap of the maidofallwork who opened the door and as he entered the narrow hall the sickly smell of boiled cabbage saluted his nostrils and justified him to himself but he was grimly embarrassed at having to explain himself to the girl is your mistress in he asked yes sir will you wait in the drorinroom sir what name sir he felt mortified and a whit ashamed the servants ignorance was an unconscious rebuke that counterbalanced the boiled cabbage oh tell her matthew he said flushing shell know yes sir and the girls cap stuck on askew for the edification of unexpected company disappeared down the kitchen stairs he would have liked to brush majestically past her but delicacy prevented so abrupt an intrusion upon his wife in the recesses of domesticity his coming was already sufficient surprise a few hours ago he himself had not foreseen that a swamping wave of moral emotion would sweep him homeward he walked about the room morbidly fascinated by the flashy vases with the handpainted shepherds and wondering what rosina would say if he made away with them as decency demanded to his bitter amusement he heard her voice from the passage remonstrating with billyin a very audible whisperfor the servants indiscretion in admitting to the drawingroom a stranger who might do havoc among her cherished possessions goodness knows what he may not pocket she grumbled uneasily as she approached the door its all right rosina he called out coming into the passage its only me gracious ejaculated mrs matthew strang angrily putting her hand to her heart what a turn you gave me so youre the mr matthews i really do wish you wouldnt come sneaking in and prying and ferreting and frightening a body out of her wits she stood thereno more pleasing than the vasesthe features that had once threatened to be pretty sharpened shrewishly though the figure had grown plumper except where the breasts had fallen she did not look her youth the face was weary the pale blue eyes had lost their softness she had hastily donned a cheap black cashmere dress trimmed with jet the painter was glad the usual effusion of affection was wanting notwithstanding the pitch of reaction to which he was wrought up all his being shrank from the desecrating embrace of the woman he did not love nevertheless he was conscious of an undercurrent of astonishment longer intervals than this last had parted them yet she had never failed to exhibit amorous emotion even though it took the shape of jealous reproach this afternoon there was a suggestion of resentment in her greetingfor the first time he felt unwelcome he was puzzled albeit relieved but the secret of her mood did not leak out yet and in the meantime there was billy sulkily awaiting his famous brothers recognition the young man looked whiter and thinner than on matthews last visit to the house how glad hell be to come for a holiday with me thought the painter with a pang of joyful repentance he oughtnt to live in london at all well all go down to some pretty little village where i can paint if necessary and well stay till the winter the cripple churlishly took the hand which his brother extended his palm burned all right billy questioned matthew cheerfully it doesnt matter how i am snapped the younger man its months since youve been nigh us rosina turned upon billy dont you take my parti can speak for myself you cant expect to see your brother in the summer when all the fashionable folks come up to london to be painted billy murmured something inarticulate and looked doggedly at matthew leaning on his crutch i suppose i must ask you to walk in and take a chair since you are such a stranger said mrs matthew strang her husband meekly retreated into the drawingroom and sat down with his back to the vases that adorned the mantelpiece but now a new horror caught his eyenothing less than a framed oleograph of motherhood which had found its way into the house in the days when its wide popularity still gave him a certain interest in it not far removed from pride on his soul tensely strung by eleanors hand for the high notes of imagination this cheap domesticity now jarred abominably the picture glared at him it loomed suddenly symbolic it was representative of rosina and her influence this was her height of poetry the top measure of her soulthe mother carrying the little girl who carried the doll the work he wanted to donay the work he had always wanted to dothat was what eleanor stood forthe rare the fine the ethereal years of insincere work had blunted and torpified himeleanor had recreated his soul had given him freshness of feeling and something of the early ardor of aspiration this passed through his mind before billy had stumped in and taken a chair opposite him rosina remained standing at the open door in an attitude expressive of household duties plucking at her skirts the painter shifted nervously on his chair there was a dead silence it permitted the tootling of a tin whistle to become audible and gave the painter the happy thought of asking after the children claras at school replied rosina ungraciously shes the second girl in her class and could be top if she wasnt so sulky and davie cant you hear for yourself hes only too quiet as a rule but since you brought him that whistle hes been unbearable its the only thing that rouses him it was stopped up for a fortnight and he went about like a little ghost till billy put it right if he only had a notion of music billy tried to teach him to play on it but hes got no head for anything there did you ever hear such a squeal oh hes such a baby yet said her husband deprecatingly then the conversation languished again and davies lugubrious whistle held the field billy drew vague designs on the carpet with his crutch matthew fidgeted and at last got up he was meditating how to turn the conversation into a tenderer channel and broach the holiday in common rosina maintained her inconclusive attitude in the doorway youve still got those vases matthew said there being no other thought in the way this thought escaped yes she rejoined but i dont wonder at your asking any day may see the end of them servants are growing that careless even as it is they only dust their outsides if i didnt wash them myself with tealeaves theyd be choked up in a month she walked to the mantelpiece and ran her forefinger down one of them the finger grew black as with anger her brow darkened why amy is worse than jane she cried harshly i wont stand any more of her nonsense do you know what she did last week here she walked back to the door and shut it tightly lest her words should reach the kitchen she washed the colored things in the same water as the whites and then after the wash i missed a pair of billys red socks and i hunted high and low for them and made a fuss the next day billy found them mysteriously mixed up with his flannels i am convinced she stole them not knowing she had a sharp eye to deal with i know theyll worry me into the grave these servants this morning i particularly said to her have you dusted the drawingroom and she said bold as brass yes mum and this is what she calls dusting she held up her gloomy forefinger then lowering her voice as if it might penetrate even through the closed door she hissed menacingly at the brothersill give her a piece of my mind that i will if she dont know when shes got a good place the great hulking brute she shall pack herself off this very afternoon a charwoman i give her every monday to help her two shillings i have to pay and her beer money to say nothing of the work i do with my own hands often and often i make the beds myself for there isnt a girl in creation you can trust to shake out the bedding they leave it all lumpy and what is the reward for all my kindness i hate them all i wish their necks were screwed i wish they were said billy impatiently im sick of hearing about them rosina turned upon him again and who asks you to stay here im sure im sick of hearing you grumbling and whining about the house billys eyes blazed a red spot burned in each white cheek wont you give me a cup of tea rosina interposed matthew gently i dare say amy has let the fire go out she snapped ring the bell youre nearest it matthew rang the bell and amy appeared can you make some tea amy rosina inquired in sweet seductive accents yes mum my husband has just come from abroad she explained deferentially and apologetically and we shant be wanting any more at teatime well have tea a little earlier and you can keep the water hot for miss clara yes mum amy disappeared did you see the smudge on her cheek asked rosina despairingly she cant even dust her face while rosina was speaking her husband fretted under her conversation the awkward silence that ensued when she ceased made him wish she would go on talking how is business she asked finding him dumb he suppressed a grimace pretty fair you know ive always got as much to do as i care for you know what ive been thinking rosina replied in a softened and more confidential tone you ought to make enough to be able to retire one day why should you always live away from meits as bad as marrying a drummer at no theres onea commercial traveller they call them in englandand his wife tells meits the house with the striped linen blindsshe doesnt see him half a dozen times a year and youre getting almost as scarce particularly this year she dropped into a chair finally dismissing her tentative attitude this seemed a favorable opening at last so her husband plunged into it you havent been out of town yet he began rosina bounded wrathfully from her chair there i knew that that was what you came to spy out isnt it enough that youve left your brother here to be a spy on all my comings and goings its rather me that ought to be setting a spy on you god knows what with your studios and your models and your fashionable falsehearted women well there he is to witness anyhow we have had our fortnight at the seaside havent we billy billy nodded there theres your own brother to witness we went last month and all to save you money though i know you think im making a stocking they charged us so much last year for lodgings at margate in august that i made up my mind i wouldnt be swindled any more and so we went in july and we did saveits no use my denying it with that spy of yours ever at my tailbut ive had to spend twice as much in london with everything gone up in price theyre asking a shilling a peck for peasyou can go round and ask delton the greengrocer if you dont believe meits enough to ruin anybody and then there was the rise in coals in the spring on account of the strikesomething frightful and such a lot of slag and then poor clara has been so poorly i sent for the doctor once and then he would keep on coming to see her every daythere was no getting rid of him and that brother of yours hadnt the spunk to tell him straight out not to come any more goodness knows what his bill has run up to theyre simply bloodsqueezers these doctors so there if you think youve caught me out coming down on me like a detective in my seaside week youre nicely mistaken mr slyboots what are you glaring at me for looking for the brown id have given myself a coat of paint if i had known you were coming though i dont pretend to be so clever at it as you or your fine ladies either for the matter of that as rosina stood over him breathlessly pouring forth her impassioned defence of the position she took up in financial matters matthew strang felt he understood why men sometimes kill women he had long since given up attempting to make her understand that her thoughts were not his thoughts that despite his hard training in the value of money details of expenditure had ceased to occupy his consciousness the moment the pinch of need was become a thing of the past he was inured to her financial apologetics her tedious justifications of what he in his ignorance that she was indeed hoarding money secretly and like all women saving on her housekeeping never called into question he had steeled himself to a simulation of attention when she elaborately accounted for every farthing he had given her and habituated to money perpetually passing from his hands he had never even reflected that her style of living could not possibly exhaust the sums with which he supplemented her own income to his heedless mind a growing family vaguely explained everything but today the prosaic minuti though painfully familiar set up an inward fume that intensified by her misconstruction of his visit and by her digs at billy approached insanity he controlled himself with a great effort it is you that are mistaken rosina he rejoined clinching his palms i came merely to propose that you should take your holiday now i thought we might go somewhere together well then youre a bit too late she replied with no diminution of illtemper and whats come over you that you want my company all of a sudden i thought you couldnt spare me a week ever i reckon the truth is that works got slack nonsense i told you my hands were full he said losing his selfcontrol thats no reason why you should waste money on me i cant go twice to the seaside i didnt want you to go twice i didnt know you had been i explained to you why i went she retorted hotly they wanted three guineas last year for a sittingroom and two poky bedrooms and there was no key to the chiffonier and im sure the landlady nibbled at our provisions but i would have gladly let you have a little extra if you wanted to go in august id much rather you spent the money on the children clara wears out her shoes frightfullythe expense turns my hair gray then you wouldnt care to go with me no it would be sinful extravagance to go twice give me the money if youre so anxious to get rid of it do be reasonable rosina i dare say the children will enjoy another week of the children much you care about the children you havent asked to see davie yet and as for clara rosinas scornful accents dried up suddenly her acute ear had caught the gentle clatter of the mounting tray she opened the door for amy youre sure the water was boiling she inquired pleasantly yes mum the mistress produced a little key from her bosom you will find a cake in the cupboard under the diningroom sideboard and bring up the bluebordered plates the little ones please yes mum when the tea was duly served rosina resumed and as for clara i didnt even write to you she had been ailing i knew you took so little interest in the poor child she might die and be buried for all youd know i cant know if you dont tell me he said sulkily stung by the germ of truth in her words why dont you let davie come up to meyou ought to have sent him up as soon as you knew i was here rosina threw open the door again with a jerk and leaned over the kitchen stairs davie she bawled stop that dreadful noise and come up at once do you hear your father is dying to see you the painter bit his lips an irrelevant memory rang in his brain with a russian accent i do not like this word dying the face of eleanor wyndwood swam up on the cabbagescented air the patter of davies feet was heard toddling up the stairs the child stumbled shyly into the room the tin whistle clasped distrustfully to his breasta pathetic anmic little figure with flaxen curls and big gray eyes that easily brimmed over with tears he wore serge knickerbockers and the rest of him aped the sailor picturesquely enough the child paused near the door clutching his mothers skirt this way my little man said matthew smiling encouragingly from the green sofa that sprawled across the centre of the room come to your daddy go to the gentleman dear said rosina with withering sarcasm but the boy hung back clutching her skirt and his whistle tighter dont be afraid davie i wont take your whistle from youdont you remember i gave it you he held up a piece of rosinas homemade cake thus adjured and enticed davie moved cautiously forward waves of returning recollection agitating the wee wan face a lump swelled in the fathers throat as he surveyed the weakling the poor child suddenly appeared to him the scapegoat for an unholy union life had taught him from what fount of sacred love children should spring while he was hoisting the child on his knee responsive to that strong appeal of feeble creatures but with no specific stirrings of paternity davie wistfully held up his disengaged hand for the cake which he grabbed as soon as it came within range of his little arm his mouth was too preoccupied with cake to return his fathers kiss to which he submitted passively the painter laid his hand tenderly on the flaxen hair did you enjoy yourself at margate davie rosina uttered an exclamation of disgust well i never wholl you be crossexamining next perhaps you think billy and me are in a conspiracy that ive gained over your spy id better go downstairs so as not to influence the childs evidence and turning on her heel she marched haughtily kitchenwards matthew sighed wearily whats the matter with her billy he asked dont ask me shes been as cross as two sticks ever since theyve had new curtains at no opposite and the weather has been so muggy and your coming has upset her but she seems to have turned against you too you used to get on so well together shes so difficult to live with replied billy fretfully so quarrelsome and discontented what is she discontented about matthew asked uneasily shes got plenty of money oh it isnt the money replied billy morosely shes lucky is rosina she has money of her own do you know her little american property has gone up a good deal lately her income is nearer nine hundred than eight hundred dollars indeed murmured his brother dimly interested yes old coble wrote to her telling her things were looking up and he was right no it isnt rosina thats got cause of complaint about money matters she isnt like meshe isnt dependent on you for every farthing his words rang bitterly resentfully but surely you dont mind taking money from me billy he said with infinite gentleness and why shouldnt i mind taking money from a stranger a stranger yes youre naught else do you think i dont know of your goingson your gaddings about to parties and banquets because rosina dont read the papers you mustnt think im ignorant too ive got a heap of things about you in my study all cut out and pasted in books i dont tell rosina because it would only make her discontented but it riles me i tell you straight to be left here leading this wretched lonesome life why cant i live with you you could live with me tomorrow if you liked billy but dont you see youd be just as wretched and lonesome all day i should be at work and when i went out you couldnt accompany me i cant foist my relatives on the people who invite me out they only want meand that only as a curiosity he added with a bitter perception of how extrinsic he really was to the charmed circles of society of how little affinity there was between him and the bulk of those who gushed over his art but if you would only help me to get my work published theyd make a fuss over me too but youve never moved your little finger to help me i got wilson and butler to read some of your mss i couldnt do any more it isnt my fault if they dont think your work good enough nonsense i dont believe they ever saw it you only said they did to pacify me oh billy cried matthew in shocked reproach well even if they did said billy tetchily theyre not infallible theyre prejudiced they think two brothers cant both be clever im sure my stories are as good as anything that appears in their magazines and a damned sight better but there are any amount of other editors that you come across for ive seen your name printed with theirs in the lists of guests at public dinners but you go your own way and never spare a thought for me eating my heart out here i come in handy to keep your wife company and to prevent her feeling deserted and you think thats about all im good for his white face was worked up to a flush of anger he had the common delusion of the unsuccessful that the successful in any department can pull the ropes in every other nor could he understand that matthew disliked approaching people and people disliked being approached whatever youre good for youll be said matthew soothingly if your work is really firstclassit will come to the front in the longrun he shrank from adding that he did not think it even secondclass it was no use making the boy more miserable yes but i cant runim a cripple billy burst forth passionately who knows whether i shall live to see the end of the longrun perhaps theyll give me a stone when im deadbut whats the good of that to me you have everything that makes life worth living you have loveyou have a wife whenever you choose to come you have money and heaps of it all earned by the sweat of your own brow you have fameyour name is in all the papers you have fashionable folk courting and caressing you i dare say some finescented lady fixed that rose so beautifully in your buttonhole i can smell her white fingers its all roses and sunshine for you but you take jolly good care to keep em to yourself the imbittered words carried no sting to the painters breast but he was sick at heart as he replied gently you dont really mean what youre saying billy you know ive offered to defray the cost of publication of by field and flood if youd only let me yes but thats making me more of a drag on you besides you told me its only the rotten houses that publish novels at the authors expense and that the critics look askance on them but if i could earn enough on my short stories to pay for a book id chance that his voice took on a maundering pitiful intonation im sure ive worked hard enough toiling at my desk and denying myself every pleasure in life you cant say i dont keep sober now i never go beyond one glass of ale at mealtimes yes youre very good billy youve been good for a long time good echoed billy in the same testy lachrymose accents whats the good of being good i wish i was dead why dont you let me drink my fits back again his breast heaved he seemed on the point of sobs the painter sat in mute misery a bloodcurdling shriek from the whistle destroyed the intolerable situation davie having finished munching his cake had his mouth free again for musical operations put your fingers over the holes davie said his father then it ll play nicer its no use put in billy moodily i tried to teach him look ill move my fingers davie and you shall blow and well play a pretty tune together no dont be alarmed im not taking the whistle away only putting my fingers on it see you shall hold the end fast in your mouth the child blew spasmodically his father mechanically played the first tune that came into his fingers a gleam of excited interest leaped into the childs eyes as he heard the notes varying mysteriously in a rough jingle but the painter broke off suddenly he realized that he was playing home sweet home it was too ghastly more more panted davie imperatively matthew strang obediently started yankee doodle and had to grant two encores before the juvenile tyrant was robbed of breath and desire whats your name my little man he asked thoughtlessly to make conversation davie davie what davie thrang ah and how old are you ise nearly four replied davie adding in a burst of new confidence when i come to my fourf birfday mummy says shell gi me a penny every week all to mythelf really said the painter with a sad smile a whole penny davie shook his head in vehement affirmation yeth and i am thinkin what i shall buy mummy wi my firth pennyappleth or a flower a thrill shot down the painters spine the poor sickly infant appeared suddenly lovable to him for the first time too he realized the child as an independent entity with thoughts of its own at work in the queer little brain whatever the quality of this little brain davies heart was sound enough and this heart was evidently entirely given to his mother the momentary prick of irrational jealousy that the discovery caused the father was forgotten in softer feelings his conception of the mother rose with his conception of the child she was the other side of the relation and there must be something beautiful in her to correspond with the beauty of her childs sentiment the oleograph of motherhood caught his eye again he saw how insincerely he had painted it from a mere intellectual idea unfelt unrealized but he saw also the secret of its popularity each observer contributing the emotion the painter had not felt his eye dwelt upon it more tolerantly kiss me davie he said and you shall have a penny now to buy mummy a flower davie readily put up his lips to clinch the bargain and his father gave him the coin the boy regarded it wistfully what do you say billy put in more amiably fank you said davie thank you da prompted billy daddy wound up davie triumphantly there aint no flowerwomans now he added dubiously they was a lot at margit ill be a flowerwoman davie said his father cheerily wouldnt you like to have this beautiful flowerthis rose in my buttonholefor your penny to give to mummy yethi wants it said davie clutching greedily for it gently or all the lovely pink leaves will fall out and you must give me your penny you know davie with a perplexed air vaguely conscious of commercial transactions too complicated for his intellect hesitatingly retendered the penny and receiving the rose was set down on the carpet he ran eagerly to the door blowing one disconsolate irrelevant blast on the whistle and then the brothers heard him tumble down the oilclothcovered stairs with three thuds followed by shrill ululations they ran to the head of the stairs but rosina had already rushed forth to pick up her child and her soothing prattle varied by scolding for his careless hurry made a duet with his howls where did you get that flower from youve crumpled it all to pieces she extracted it from the fingers that had closed upon it tenaciously when the fall commenced from the genleman him what i calls daddy its for you mummy tell him he can keep it davies howls recommenced matthew strangs heart contracted he went halfway down the stairs to where rosina ministered to her bruised offspring i didnt send you the flower rosina he said gently its a gift from the child oh is it then hes betterhearted than his father thats all i can say thank you my poor darling thank you dry your little eyes and mummy shall take you out to see all the pretty shops wont you come upstairs and finish your tea rosina matthew pleaded im busy she said tartly im giving clara her tea shes just come home from school let her bring her tea upstairs then she can talk to me ill tell her youre here i dare say shell remember youshe generally gets something out of you he bit his lips to keep back angry speech and remounted to the drawingroom clara came close upon his footsteps and ran to offer her lips she was a tall child of seven with a low forehead dark hair and eyebrows a heavy jaw and a high colorhandsome after a rather gallic fashion the painter always trod gingerly with her knowing she had her grandmothers temper rosina lacking the clew was less delicate with the girl whose sullen phases irritated her immeasurably this afternoon clara was conciliated by sixpence and chatted amicably with her father about her lessons presently her mother came up too with davie in her train and there was the outward spectacle of a happy family group united at tea the painter was emboldened to strengthen an idea that was gradually forming in his mind by expressing it billy feels very lonely down in this part of the town he began timidly and what must i feel rosina snapped then why cant we all live together rosina he said more boldly are you beginning that again she asked sharply you wont come and live here will you you know it is impossible and you know it is impossible for me to move to your neighborhood ive told you a thousand times you cant afford one of those big housesit would be ruinous youd have to keep a staff of servants to match and things would be coming to the house at extravagant prices from aristocratic tradespeople whereas here i go out and do my bit of marketing and pick up a bargain here and a bargain there ive found out a place in holloway where i get the best meat a penny a pound cheaper than anywhere in camden town and it only means a penny tram there and back you dont know how much i save you a year when you suspect me of making a stocking for myself out of my seaside allowance and even if you can afford such a house rather give me the money and let me put it by for the children he made a despairing gesture we could get a small house he said i could work harder for a year or two perhaps i could get a few more rooms added to my studio theres a piece of ground i use at the back for openair studies and what would be the use of my living with you inquired rosina brutally you dont want me any more i dare say you could come home at night now if you wanted to hush said her husband flushing clara my dear take davie out and buy him some candy this penny is really his yes father and the joyous children disappeared poor orphans said rosina perhaps its just as well there wont be any more of them matthew strang was startled yet not quite surprised by the revelation of his wifes mood she had never before so openly resented or dissented from the situation that had gradually grown upone of those strange complex undefined situations of which life is so full and which are only able to exist by virtue of not being put into words he stirred the dregs of his tea with his spoon painfully embarrassed i shall talk to an architect i know he said at last ignoring her allusion the cost mightnt be much and it neednt be all paid off at once besides he added with forced playfulness that extra hundred dollars a year of yours must be used up somehow rosina turned eyes of flame upon the unhappy billy i knew it she said cuttingly i knew you were here to spy upon me so you have sneaked about that have you matthew lost his temper at last dont be a fool rosina he said roughly do you think i care a pin whether you spend a wretched hundred dollars more or less no i dare say you would rather have a wife that would bring you to the workhouse they had the bailiffs in at no a only yesterday theres a wife there that would just suit you the husbands something in your way of business an author or a poet and shes a tall stuckup creature who sits at the window in strange long gowns without stays and reads books to him and never goes to church my you should see her out marketingthey swindle her at every turn she doesnt know a horse from a ham sandwich i dont wonder theyve come to a bad endyou should see the dust on her venetian blinds i prophesied the crash last winterask billy if i didnt they took in their coals by the hundredweight dont you fancy i dont know thats the sort of woman youre hankering after ever since my davie was born and you got mixed up with those sort of creatures youve been sorry you married me oh its no use denying it you want a fine lady that would scorn to soil her fingers with housework and expect you to cover em with diamonds a creature that would faint at the sight of a blackbeetle but you were glad enough to marry me once upon a time when you hadnt a dollar to your name they say youre a fine painter and who made you a fine painter who took you abroad and supported you while you were studying they think youre a fine gentleman and who made you a fine gentleman oh yes i know im not one of your fine ladiesbut if i had been where would you have been now in the bankruptcy courtperhaps back again in the jail from which i dragged you matthew crimsoned furiously billy leaped in his chair you fishwife how dare you say such things to my brother he cried choking with rage matt in jail indeed let her talk said matthew wearily i see it was a mistake to have come here at all rosina cast a glance of venomous triumph at her drooping husband the jail was a chance shot in long lonely agonizing watches the resentful suspicion had germinated and grown its true she said defiantly let him deny it why did you take a husband from jail retorted the painter with a flash of fire i didnt know it i was tricked and bamboozled and i had a heart in my breast then not a stone if i had been a fine lady i might have been more particular to examine your pedigree a sense of guilt damped the mans fire the jail episode was not the only thing he had concealed if youre sorry you married me we can separate he murmured separatearent we separated enough do you mean youd like a divorce oh no not for this child so that you may marry one of your fine ladies perhaps make an honest woman of her rosina he sprang to his feet thundering the image of eleanor wyndwood swept involuntarily before him and he felt that this coarsetongued woman had profaned it she flinched before the cry but parodied it daringly matthew he flung from the room billy prodded frantically after him dont go matt dont go youll never come back again the piteous appeal sounded like a prophecy he paused in the hall irresolute rosina laughed hysterically you had better go with him billy if youre so frightened and good riddance to the pair of you ive got my bread and butter thank god my children shant starve if their father does desert them let me go billy he said hoarsely shaking off the cripples clutch i cant breathe here come with mewrite to medo what you like he opened the halldoor and closed it behind him and dashed against his children coming back through the gate with their mouths full of almondrock clara caught at the skirts of his coat dont go away again father she mumbled peevishly mother cries for you in the night and i cant get to sleep he swayed as if struck by a bullet then he took the little girls sticky hand and suffered himself to be led back through the area door as clara unlatched it he heard her mother sobbing hysterically above the servants foolish face peeped white and scared from the kitchen door and made his own scarlet with shame your mistress is ill he muttered and ran hastily upstairs rosina detected his footstep and the sobs changed back to frenzied laughter then she controlled both by sheer pride all the steel in her springing back unsnapped from its bend and she opposed a mocking smile to his discomfited concern the strength that had kept her silent for years was now summoned to undo the effects of speech what have you forgotten she asked tauntingly have you come back for your goodbye kiss or your umbrella or what kisses theyre off were an old married couple now but i dont want to stick to your umbrella it might be a present from somebody nice is there an umbrella about billy no dear me then it must be that rose ah but davie gave me that she called down the stairs wasnt it you that gave me the rose davie yes and im not going to give it back dont be afraid dear mummy wont give away her darlings present did um bruise himself to give it to me poor davie there was a hectic flush on her cheek her voice rang false matthew was afraid well goodbye she jerked after a pause what are you waiting for dont go away whispered billy nervously shattered by the scenes of the afternoon come to the study shell cool down soon the suggestion commended itself to matthew it seemed cowardly to leave this hysteric couple to themselves he descended the kitchen stairs once more and passed along the corridor that led to his old studio now turned into a workroom for billy and fitted up with bookshelves whose contents hid the whitewashed walls a writingtable littered with papers occupied the centre of the floor and piles of manuscript showed within a little angle cupboard whose door swung open there were several reproductions of his brothers works roughly stuck on the wallone a valuable engraving signed by the artist and the triumph of bacchus was already represented in two shapesonce by the halfpage cut out of the seasons pictures and again by a fullpage photograph of it from the graphic its a shame they dont make you an ara matt said billy your pictures get more advertisement for the academy than almost anybody elses for gods sake dont talk of that now said the painter brokenly his eye noted curiously that ancient engraving of the angelus miraculously preserved to be one of billys treasures by the worlds refusal to give more than eighteenpence for it it was a poor representative of the original but the other ornaments of the study seemed to him tawdry in comparison his taste had changed the picture attracted him now without analyzingthe turmoil of his mind did not permit thathe had an impression of sincerity of sympathetic vision of work done inevitably not like his own work from cleverness despair of his life and his art mingled in one dark paroxysm as he dropped upon a chair and laid his head upon the writingtable dont you may get your hair sticky said billy i dont think its quite dryi was just pasting it in before you came he withdrew the album from under his brothers headthe pious compilation with which he fed at once his jealousy and his pride i suppose you saw that little sketch of your life in our celebrities this month matthew did not answer its not quite accurate you know went on billy it says youre a bachelor and that you were born in canada and so on but that doesnt matter there are always mistakes and of course nobody knows about rosina listen the eldest child of a prosperous canadian farmer he gave early evidence of talent and was sent to england to study art and soon became the favorite pupil at graingers wellknown art school in central london where he studied under tarmigan a frigid artist who at one time enjoyed considerable repute later mr strang pursued his studies in paris and rome and returning to london with ripened art sought and obtained the suffrages of the academicians with his picture entitled motherhood since so familiar to the public in countless reproductions and the herald of a career of uniform success next year his classic picture my god do you want to drive me mad roared the sick lion raising his head i know all about it you neednt bully my head off said billy pettishly i asked you if youd seen it its copied from people of the time groaned the painter he clinched his fists in a blind rage against the universe this was what the public read and believed about his lifehis life with its slow sick struggles its inner and outer discords its poignant pathos and this was what he read and believed about other men good god what was behind their lives the lives of his fellows whose smooth histories he read in biographical summaries the possibilities of the human tragedy frightened him then the realities of the human farce seized him and he terrified billy by a long peal of sardonic laughter the laughter ceased suddenly go and see how she is he commanded the shuddering billy and the poor cripple now less frightened of rosina than of his brother sped away as fast as his crutch could carry him left alone the painter looked abstractedly at the angelus and it drifted his thoughts back to the time when he had tried to sell it for bread how happy were those times of youthful aspiration when all things were new and all things were true and hunger itself was but a sauce to eke out the scanty meal what was starvation to this terrible hunger for happiness what the want of money to this want of something to live for ah money was nothing money troubles were mental figments it was the cark of life that killedmoney or no money oh to be young and free again free to be a slave to art how hollow it all wasthis fame this running about this society that welcomed him as he had truly told billy like a kind of monstrosity he had been happier when he had toiled in this little whitewashed studio even after his mistaken marriage the lines of the poet in whom he had read most of late fell from his lips like an original personal cry oh i could lie down like a tired child and weep away this sordid life of care and thus billy found him his head on the desk his shoulders heaving convulsively matt he cried timidly well in muffled accents shes gone to her room and locked herself in she says youre not to come near her any more ever a long silence but i dare say itll blow over matt this is not the first time shes been taken like that though youve not been here to bear it a longer silence billy cudgelled his brain to rouse his brother i saw ruth hailey a month ago he said at last this time he succeeded in evoking an indifferent monosyllable yes yes she called here to see usshe was in london she had got our address from abner preep before leaving america i gave her the address of your studio but she said she was uncertain whether she would have time to look you up she seems to be secretary to mrs verder the womans rights woman goes about with her everywhere linda verders lecturesyou remember them at the st jamess hall in july shes in scotland now and later on ruth writes to me for i asked her to correspond with me a little theyre going to paris for a course under the patronage of the american embassy theyll stay in paris some time as linda verder wants a rest badly and has a lot of american friends there then they go to australia and new zealand curious isnt it how did she look ruth oh shes gone off a good deal to my thinking she must be getting pretty old nowabout as old as you which is young for a man but old for a woman but her eyes are fine and theres a sweetnessi cant describe it she says she used to teach sundayschool in the states and though she enjoys travelling about regrets having had to give up her class fancy she used to be such a smart girl too and i should have thought the deacon had disgusted her with religion you know she wont have anything to do with him is he still alive oh hes just as spry as ever his fathers curled up his toes though old hey had the old man from digby to live with him and they used to go at it hammer and tongs billy could extract no further answer but he would not let his brother go that night insisting he must sleep with him as usual in the spare bed in his bedroom about nine oclock rosina sent a specially nice supper for two down to the study matthew roused himself to eat a morsel to keep billy company and then before going to his sleepless couch in billys room bethought himself of whiling away the time by answering some letters which had been bulking his inner coatpocket for days one of these was a reverential request for an autograph addressed from a finesounding country house and backed by the compulsive seduction of a stamped envelope his emotions were exhausted he wrote apathetically yours truly matthew strang writing very near the top of the notepaper for fear of fraud and cutting off the camden town heading the celebrity was at home for once chapter vi a devonshire idyl the oldfashioned yellow coach topheavy with pyramidal luggage rattled along the devonshire coast striking its apex against overarching boughs and matthew strang sat on the boxseat forgetting london in the prospect of eleanor wyndwood and in the view of white and red houses scattered like wildflowers about a steep green hill overhanging the curve of a lovely bay for rosina had continued obdurate and invisible she had sent up breakfast from the kitchen without appearing and with an irritating air of cooking for a gentlemanboarder and he fretful and anguished after a wretched wakeful night had fled snarling even at billy who would have stayed him further the remembrance of her cantankerousness and of his own illhumor had accompanied him all the way to devonshire but the sight of the searolling vast and green and sundimpledthe wrinkled unaging sea had calmed him his burdens fell from him the last vapors of london the torpid miasma of the packed streets the cabbage odors of camden town were blown afar he drew deep breaths of the delicious air how lucky it was rosina had shied at the suggestion which he had thrown out on the reckless impulse of a desperate moment how could they possibly live together any more to draw the same atmosphere with her was stifling and at the thought his deep inspirations took on a new voluptuousness of freedom regained decidedly he had not counted the cost when the quixotic proposal sprang to his lips for that atmosphere meant death to his soulnothing less death to all his new stirrings and yearningsasphyxiation to his art ah the good salt air let it blow on his free forehead let it play among his earlygraying locks let it whisper the brave dreams of youth till the nimble blood tingles and the eyes are wet with tears let him feel the freshness of morning though the sun is hastening westward and the best of the day is spent the coachman blows his horn and the hills are filled with the echoes of romance away with the clogging mists and the moral fogs of the town away with the moody vision of a narrowsouled virago in a gray house in a drab labyrinth and ho for the enchanted cliffs and waters where loveliness broods like light over earth and sea and a spirit that is half a woman and half the soul of all beauty waits with swelling bosom and kindling eyes oh the bonny horses the spanking quartette how they sweep round the curves and dash down the dales and how gallantly the ruddyfaced driver holds them in the hollow of his hand what delightful villages primitive as the rough stone of which they are built what quaint old hostels and archaic streets steeped in the mingled scent of the sea and the moors here be oldworld orchards here be cosey cottages and sweet homely gardens gay with nasturtiums and hollyhocks and scarletrunners with roses and pansies tara tararara tara the driver airily salutes the afternoon over the ferny walls of the devonshire lanes the outside passengers behold the red crags perching picturesquely on the seafront like petrified monsters of an earlier era and the trail of redder gold quivering across the great water the wind rises and flecks the shimmering green as with a flock of skimming seabirds oh the beauty of the good round earth the beauty forgotten and blotted out in the reeking back streets of great cities oh gracious privilege of the artist to seize a moment of the flowing loveliness of all things to pass it through the alembic of his soul and give it back transfigured and immortal to feel beauty growing under ones hand the words were eleanorsthey chimed celestially in his ears not as words but as her words stored up as in a phonograph with every dainty intonation but with their music sweetened rather than deadened all she had ever said to him he could recall as from a box of heavenly airs every syllable had the golden cadence of poesie to love her was to be young again fit for every high emprise sensitive to every tremor of fantasy and romance stiff collarwork that sir the drivers tongue was clattering tirelesslyof his horses which more sensible than men wouldnt touch a drop more than was good for them of his life on the box from boyhood his easygoing content his pioneer daughter the first in those parts to wear spectacles his pleasure in seeing gentlefolk come down to circulate the money his scorn of chapelgoers but matthew strangs private phonograph was performing with equal indefatigability and his spirit leaped incessantly from one to the other touched to a large geniality for hornblowing humanity the sun was sinking royally in the sea like a viking in his burning vessel when the coach obligingly drew up with a flourish of the horn and a scattering of chickens and a barking of dogs at the farm where herbert had his headquarters he was disappointed not to find herbert there to receive him as he had telegraphed his advent but just as he was comfortably installed and was beginning to wonder whether he should start dining alone that everyoung gentleman galloped up flushed with health and sun and exercise and leaping from his horse gave matthew such hearty greeting that the painter had a grateful sense of being welcomed to an ancient seignorial home by a bluff and hospitable squire ive been working at the portrait herbert explained ascending to his room with his hand affectionately on the shoulder of matthew who was thus forced to remount the stairs of course i keep my painting kit at their place and a jolly old place it is with the sea cleaning the doorsteps or pretty nearly theyre beastly comfortable with their london servants and carriages and theyve a motherly old person who seems a combination of cook and chaperon and turns out delicious dishes and theyve taken on a native girl to help thema sweet simple creature with cheeks like strawberries and cream do you remember the lady who said strawberries and cream needed only to be forbidden to be an ecstasy these are forbidden oh dont look glum i havent indulged forbidden fruit is out of season im tired of it its generally canned and i have had too much of the foreign brandsugh i can see the litter of broken tins im developing a healthy taste for the freshgrowing article without any prohibitive tariff matthew turned to grasp his friends hand silently as though sealing some compact he felt it was eleanor whose magnetism had uplifted herbert to that reverence for womanhood he himself had always entertained it was impossible to live under her spell and remain coarse and paradoxically enough he was glad herbert was living on a higher planeit strengthened him in his own purely spiritual devotion to the beautiful friend of his soul how stupid to have hesitated how commonplace and ignoble to have gone to see rosina for fear of eleanors influence upon him like the old roman he had lost a day and he had uselessly harrowed his soul to boot and yet perhaps not altogether uselessly he reflected consolingly the visit had laid the ghost of remorse the full daylight had been turned upon the situation he had seen beyond reach of further doubt that he was not to blame for it that he was the victim of the blind tragedy of circumstance true the full daylight had also revealed that rosina was taking the situation far more tragically than he had ever allowed himself to suspect it was pitiful but it could not be helped his own mother had fared far worse her living death had taught him resentful resignation to the workings of fate no rosina must be put on one side he had lost happiness his art at least must be saved waiting for herbert to change his clothes he looked out of the ivywreathed diamondpaned casement and saw a lonely white wraith of a moon glimmering in the great spaces over the great lonely deep and heard the moan of the waves under the winds lash and watched the sunset dying in pale greens and pinks and saffrons and so in an exalted mood went down to dinner it was getting towards nine oclock when the cousins lit their cigars and strolled along the cliffs their feet taking them westwards where phosphorescent streaks of light green lingered in the sky sending out thinner lucent shoots to join the eastern gray ill show you the houseits not more than a mile herbert volunteered we cant call tonight said matthew what not with a madcap like olive you dont mind my calling her olive do you old man no laughed matthew well then if i may call her olive why maynt i call on her in the evening but thats an argument rather in olives vein though it appears to puzzle youha ha ha but you mustnt bring your london etiquette down here with you my boy he went on in a harangue tempered by puffsyoud better send it back by the carrier tomorrow if you packed it in your luggage by mistake were in another world and in an earlier century what a superficial view to think contemporaries live in the same century these peopleas yet unsophisticated by the touristare living in the seventeenth century ad at the latest theyd burn olive for a witch if they knew her as i do the droll elf with her masculine brain and her tricksy femininity i think ive lived in every place and time under the sun ive been with fourteenthcentury brigands and sixthcentury monks and in jerusalem with the jews i was back in the bc ages i really think all the centuries live side by side there must have been ad people in the bc times just as there are bc people living in ad times fancy thinking these bucolics an evolutionary advance on pericles and horace evolution must move like those waves down below sending scouts out here and there far in advance of the general march of the waters whenever theres a hollow curve in the coast im a twentyfifth century man myself which makes the nineteenth call me godless and immoral but what were we talking about goodness knows oh i know im aware you are goodness incarnate interpolated herbert i was saying we couldnt call on mrs wyndwood tonight ah but why shouldnt mrs wyndwood want a stroll after dinner as much as we i told her of your wire what more natural than that they should stroll eastward and herbert smiled mysteriously as one with experience i told you we made our own etiquettelaws are for the benefit of the community we are the community we four the only civilized beings in a loutish world we began as a triumvirate but your coming has changed the form of government you are the fourth party we are nowwhat shall i saya constitutional quartette as herbert rattled on matthew felt more and more the fascination of his gay cousin whose white teeth flashed as facetiously as in the days of yore and whose lissome figure was a continuous pleasure to the artistic eye gratitude mingled with his admiration but for herberts ingenuity he would never have been a citizen of the earthly paradise that was opening before him the smoke of his cigar rose like incense on the solemn air upon which the sound of the wind and the sea broke like a hush under foot were gorse and bracken mixed with sparse sprouts of grass overhead a rich yellow halfmoon partly hidden by scowling clouds but throwing a band of pale gold that changed with the deepening dusk to rippling silver across the sombre bay in whose distant cliffs the lights of vague scattered villages twinkled mysteriously suggesting romantic windows of illumined hollow chambers in the steep rock and presently white figures were seen advancing slowly to meet them pausing each instant as if to drink in the beauty of the night ah there they are cried herbert no there are three of them said matthew in disappointed tones thats the maid carrying a reserve of wraps you duffer dont throw away your cigar theres olive herself with a cigarette if my eyes do not deceive me but matthew strangs cigar went out ere the two partiessauntering more slowly than before they had become unconscious of each otherwere startled to find themselves face to face his heart was beating furiously as if he were really startled by the apparition of a queenly figure and a lovely flushed face on the background of the night a smile danced in the eyes and parted the red lips with an expression of more eager welcome than had ever been accorded him in town and there was a more intimate pressure in the clasp of the warm hand subtly heralding a new phase in their friendship in this disappearance of the conventional stage properties of the fashionable human scene in this isolation amid the primitiveness of nature and of a humanity simpler than their own while miss regans cigarette and her frank laugh and handshake indicated less subtly but no less pleasantly the commencement of a semibohemian artistic period which loomed more agreeably to matthew than any of the periods herbert had boasted of living in welcome to the creamery said olive or rather to the icecreamery as weve had to call it lately then why dont you put on your wraps said matthew anxiously oh its comparatively tropical tonight and we had to give primitiva a pretext for accompanying us this is primitiva ne rose the expost the pretty lass made a courtesy she was the post you know when we first came she used to bring letters from the postoffice which is near you and our first acquaintance with the post was to find it in tears because it had lost a letter of ours she had dropped it en route was it an important letter asked matthew that is very nearly a bull mr strang replied olive however as the letter was picked up by a coastguard i am able to tell you it wasnt of the slightest importancemerely a request from mr harold lavender to be allowed to dedicate his next book of poems to nor still it might have been important it might have contained a pom do you mean a poem or a postoffice order laughed mrs wyndwood turning a flippant face towards matthews over which a cloud had come like that now entirely over the moon neither said olive gravely a pom a proposal of marriage but wasnt it odd to see the post crying i fell in love with her at once i saw that such a quaint creature would do more good to me than to her majestys service and so hey presto she was whisked from the postoffice and changed into a tirewoman and oh what a refreshing contrast with the london servant added mrs wyndwood primitiva is really a servant not a critic on the hearth yes said olive she believes that all london ladies smoke and considers nor eccentric for not indulging and whatever i tell her is gospel she thinks im like george washingtoninvariably truthful then she thinks you eccentric too said herbert smiling back olives eyes danced her lips quivered trying to keep back the smile of response save your cynicism for town sir she said primitiva doesnt think anything of the kind the world is not a whited sepulchre to her it is lucky i removed her from the sphere of your blighting influence yes grumbled herbert shes our farmers daughter matt and she might have hovered about our dinnertable i couldnt leave marguerite in the way of faust said olive plumply matthew strang winced miss regans plain speaking grated upon him and he saw that mrs wyndwood had lowered her eyes in like annoyance and had commenced to walk homewards and he resented this preoccupation with primitiva he feared she was going to play the part of the dog roy herbert hummed an operatic bar or two and broke off laughing i wish i had fausts voice a lovely tenor voice was apparently among the profits of his bargain with the devil miss regan laughed merrily are you going back nor she called out yes said mrs wyndwood we must say goodnight oh we must see you home protested matthew as he moved to her side theres really no need she returned we shant meet anybody but its so dark said matthew for the moon still dallied behind its cloudrack and threw only a faint wavering circle of light on the weird water though the stars were now clear enough then come along cried olive bounding forwards from herberts side rather to his disgust run straight home primitiva and waving her cigarettetip in the darkness she disappeared in the earth like a red witch herbert dashed after her down the cliff descent the exhilaration of their spirits caught eleanor she was swallowed down abruptly matthew followed more cautiously wondering and then began a mad unforgetable breakneck joyous scramble in the darkness down the steepest and craggiest of roughly worn paths diversified by great sheer gaps without foothold for a goat down which they had to drop at first matthew tried to steady and help himself by clutching at the vegetation and bushes through which the path broke but it was all blackberrybushes and prickly gorse and his involuntary interjections were answered by peals of mocking laughter from the invisible pioneer below how do you like seeing us home she called up but matthew was rapt far beyond the sting of taunts and blackberrybushes mrs wyndwood was only a few inches ahead of him every moment she turned to cheer him on and her face was close to his and the divine darkness was filled with light and perfume twice or thrice in this topsyturvy harumscarum descent she gave him a helping hand as one familiar with the ground and he took it with no sense of unmanliness be careful here she said once or the brambles will scratch your face and she looked up adorably from her insecure perch below holding the prickly network apart with her upper arm as he slid cautiously towards her blissfully conscious that this sharing of commonif pettyperil was bringing them together beyond the reach of ceremonial coldness for evermore sometimes the gray sea showed below through the interstices on the left and its dull boom mingled with the gentle swish of the wind and the gurgle of a little waterfall the last twenty feet were the worst and they were aggravated by the banter of the couple safely below herbert had never caught up with olive who had skeltered down like a wildcat leaving a trail of gay ejaculations but mrs wyndwood herself had to be helped in the precipitous windings of the base with its tiny niches of crumbling stone at long intervals and now in sweet revenge matthew held her hand to steady her from above while below herbert waited with open arms for her final jump an odd recollection of his climbing down the steeple in economy flashed through his brain as he himself half slipped half leaped to the ground hot and red and breathless and gratitude for the miraculous metamorphosis in his fortunes added to the tenderness of his mood how good it was to be alivethere in the brave night moneyed and famous and still young glowing with physical wellbeingamid a joyous human company with a delightful friend and cousin and two brilliant and beautiful ladies both members of that fashionable world which had once filled him with envious bitterness and one of them a woman whose presence made everything magical rosina was very shadowy now they seemed in a great closed circle walled by cliffs with a roof fretted by stars two glooming pools made dark patches in the lighter soil and they heard the stir of fish a deserted stone quarry olive explained there are carp in the pools said herbert we live outside said mrs wyndwood its nearer over the cliff and more ladylike added olive it was hardly fair to mr matthew strang though eleanor remarked smiling weve all learned the way in the daylight when you see it in the morning mr strang youll find it sometimes within a few inches of the sheer precipice and if you had caught hold of the bushes to stay your fall you would have dropped them like a hornets nest we ought to have warned himin the dark too if we had warned him he would have fallen laughed olive gayly anybody could walk a fourinch plank over a precipice if he thought it was on the ground ignorance is salvation but you will have to come in strangs and brush yourselves before you go what a nuisance your both having the same name when i insult mr herbert i shall excite the animosity of mr matthew and vice versa i really think nor we shall have to call them by their christian names only when theyre together said mrs wyndwood smiling we must always stick together matt cried herbert with jocose enthusiasm your hand matt we might call one the painter began mrs wyndwood and the other no thats ungrateful olive remonstrated after the beautiful success mr herbert has made of you i meant mr herbert replied eleanor roguishly and for once olive had no retort ready no even taking the portrait into account matts the painter said herbert placing his hand lovingly on the shoulder of his friend who thrilled with a sense of his cousins largeheartedness call me the playwright you are both painters miss regan persisted but the problem is solvedone is mr herbert and the other mr matthew she took eleanors arm and led the way to the house since when are you a playwright mr herbert asked matthew as they fell a little into the rear none of your sarcasm you beggar ive always been a playwright dont you remember my doing a burlesque for the academy students im writing a comedy in the eveningsthe lessee of the folly is a friend of minei must make some money nowtheres that hundred pounds i owe youand i know im not going to make it by painting but surely you will let me know if you want anything said matthew with genuine concern for there seemed something immoral in the idea of herbert feeling the pinch of need to say nothing of his shock at finding that his cousin had run through all that money herbert had indeed several times hinted at his impecuniosity but matthew had never taken him seriously herbert shook his head i know youre a brick old chap but a hundred pounds is as much as i care to owe any one man but you dont consider me any one man ah its awfully good of you to remember that i did as much for youcomparatively speakingin your tenpenny times but still it isnt quite agreeable to find ones bread on the waters after many days i never did like soaked bread even in milk the most i could do would be to let you settle up every week with primitivas father but its really halves mind you and when my comedy is produced youll have to reckon with me they like what ive writtenthe womenthey think itll make a hiti read them the nights work after lunch the next dayof course i always lunch with them after the mornings sitting ah here we are they had emerged from the sheltered quarry and met the smack of the salt wind from the moaning seafront a lawn ran out to meet the pebbly beach from which it was separated by a low stone wall the ancient slateroofed house stood out radiantly cheerful against the dusky background of the night and the cliffs primitiva was at the door looking out anxiously and a manservant shared her anxiety or at least her vigil how delightful exclaimed matthew yes werent we lucky said mrs wyndwood its an old family residence the owner kept it untenanted for thirty years and has never consented to let it before the ladies took off their things while the men brushed themselves in the hall where divided by a heavily carved barometer a pair of faded oilpaintings hunga gentleman in a wig and a lady in a coif these reminded miss regan that matthew must see how splendidly herberts portrait of mrs wyndwood had turned out after all the rogue she cried as soon as he thought the sittings were to cease the picture picked up wonderfully and now hes dillydallying with it again so they wandered through the large rambling house with its oldfashioned belongings till they reached the room which herbert had been allowed to use as a studio matthew saw with joy that herbert had let the glorious face and figure be as he himself had painted them in that spurt of inspiration and had confined his own attention to the minuti of the dress which was nearly finished olive held a lamp to it awaiting his praises he had a moment of embarrassment she is very beautiful he said ambiguously but rapturously then turning to herbert he added heartily if your comedy is only as good old fellow it will be said mrs wyndwood enthusiastically who should write comedy if not a man like mr strangi mean mr herberta man who has seen the manners of men and cities i should think he could do it even better than he can paint but he has one disadvantage said olive gloomily he is witty herbert stood bowing with his hand on his breast in mock acknowledgment his boyish face looked flushed and handsome in the lamplight matthew had a spasm of despaira momentary sense of being an outsider dont practise your footlights bow here said olive no one has called author many are called but few chosen quoted herbert i wonder how i should come out under your brush said eleanor turning to matthew his black fit vanished he was taken back again into the charmed circle but the question remained awkward not more beautiful than this he murmured perhaps you will give me the pleasure i am here to paintpartly that is perhaps in town not here i want to be out and about olive we must give them something before they go back through the cold night olive rang the bell and ordered refreshment they adjourned to the drawingroom a spacious apartment with strange heavy antique furniture and curious bronzes and vases the ensemble made more quaint by the irrelevant presence of a grandfathers chair with its high stiff canvas back i fished that up from the kitchen said olive its jolly to sit there and imagine ones self an old crone nodding to ones last sleep she seated herself upon it forthwith nidnodding and against the white canvas her dark face shone lovely and young and more provoking by the suggestive contrast herbert stood over her fidgeting his fingers drumming nervously on the canvas awning she sprang up and threw back the lid of a mahogany instrument and began to play a joyous melody matthew had seated himself in an armchair near the window eleanor her superb arms and neck bare was opposite him a wonderful white vision in the softtoned light he caught her eyes and they smiled at him the friendly smile that means nothing and everything as olive touched the keys his breast grew tenderer where had he heard those tinkling harmonies before his dead childhood came back to him for a momentit was a harpsichord and the last person he had heard playing it was ruth hailey a vision of her girlish figure flitted before him then passed into the picture of the young woman with the sweet earnest eyes that billy had conjured up then faded into the sweeter vision of reality as through eyes still misty he saw eleanors bosom softly rising and falling with the melody the joyous soul of which sparkled in her eager eyes the tune grew merrier madder herbert was at the players side now he was talking to her as her long white fingers darted among the keys suddenly the music jarred and stopped olive leaped up and ran to the window and threw it open and a cold wind swept in and the solemn sobbing of the waves there it is she cried the great lonely blackness roaring outside like a wild beast in its lonely agony we shut it out with our walls and hang them with pictures and plaques but there it is all the same and all our tapestries cannot quite deaden its wail dont you hear it in the darkness dont you hear it crying out therethe pain of the world mrs wyndwood sprang up in alarm and closed the window olive olive calm yourself she said tenderly pressing the girls face to her bosom olive broke from her with a peal of laughter you look as if you had seen a ghost nor are you afraid of the black night that you shut it out are you out of tune with it already you exaggerate the pain of the world dearest said eleanor soothingly herbert looked startled the pain of the world he said the futility of the world you mean people eat and drink and go to theatres and over their graves the parson prates of infinities and immortalities religion is too big for us were like mice in a cathedral you are right olive dropped wearily into the grandfathers chair god said let man be and nascitur ridiculus mus eleanors eyes kindled we are small most times she said but there are moments when as wordsworth says through love through hope and faiths transcendent dower we feel that we are greater than we know im not afraid olive there i open the window again come and looknot at the black night but up at the stars matthews soul melted in worship he moved to her side and refreshed by the cool sea air lifted his eyes to the farsprinkled vault where the moon had now suffused the dark clouds which seemed to have grown light and porous the two infinities of sky and sea brooded together in the night ineffably solemn olive would not budge the stars she shuddered big lonely worlds mrs wyndwood did not hear her ah theres the plough she said and theres the polar star in a straight line and theres cassiopeia and thats all i know but oh surely they are havens of rest where the tears are wiped from all faces her voice faltered her face was rapt as in prayer wont you put something over your shoulders matthew said anxiously no its quite warm unless perhaps we take a turn up and down the beach before you go shall we it looks so divine out there he was startled and intoxicated by the proposal wont you come too olive its nearly ten oclock we must be sending them home to their farm or primitivas father will bar the door already we have a reputation for witchcraft because our house shines afar at eleven oclock a beacon of evil to all the neighboring hamlets in london we should just be preparing to go out i am tired nor you can have a turn if you like you go too mr herbert herbert hesitated no it wouldnt be fair to leave you alone does company prevent one from being alone ive got to have a turn in a moment anyhow said herbert weakly a return alas well leave them to fight it out and mrs wyndwood laid her hand a moment on matthews shoulder thrilling him they went out under the stars she had taken only a light fleecy wrap beneath which the white shoulders were half defined half divined they went across the lawn and through the gate and crunching lightly over the little pebbles walked towards where the surf bubbled white in the grayness all was very still save for the eternal monotone of the sea there were a few yellow glimmers from the villages on the cliffs far to the east a lighthouse sent watery rays across the night they stood without speaking in a religious ecstasy breathing in the salt air at last the delicious silence was broken by her more delicious voice i am so glad you came she said simply his breast swelled painfully you are very good to me oh i mean your cousin will have company is that all he said audaciously and then he likes to be with miss regan is that all she smiled you are too ambiguous the plain truth is that your cousin prefers to talk to miss regan alone and i didnt care about appearing a marplot you know the proverb he was never shrewd harassed as he had been by his own affairs herberts admiration of olive had never struck him as a serious passion he conceived his cousin as a philandering person a man of many flirtations but now the suggestion that came from eleanors lips seemed to throw a flood of light on everything even on herberts remark about forbidden fruit for once herbert was veritably in love in his relief at the butterflys choice of a definite flower he forgot to resent mrs wyndwoods reason for giving himself her company are you sure it isnt you he admires he asked merely for the pleasure of her denial oh no im an old staid prosaic mature widow my romance is over she sighed she never looked more spiritual than thus in the moonlight but he could never bring himself to the conventional compliments he asked simply and what about miss regan ah i should not tell you if i knew and i dont know i dont profess to understand miss regan i never knew any one so easy to live with and so difficult to understand but as she doesnt understand herself i dont feel humiliated of course she has always had men at her feet and she has refused one of the most brilliant partis in the kingdom i was afraid she hated men and im still uncertain if she ever does marry i think it will be to spite her relatives to make them lament she has thrown herself away did i tell you that she quarrelled with them all and came to live with me yes you told me and you were unhappy then she passed her hand across her eyes but did not speak you are not unhappy now she smiled are you fishing for compliments illustration all was very still save for the eternal monotone of the sea indeed not only i am so sorry for you his voice trembled let us walk along she said he obeyed you are not angry with me for being sorry he faltered no sympathy is always sweet though i do not deserve it some people will tell you what people he asked fiercely olives people they all say i saddened my husbands last hours he was brought home dead from the huntingfield you know he had beenbut no de mortuis nil nisi bonum tell me he said softly she began to speak then broke off no why should i tell you she said gently becausebecausei want to be your friend her bosom heaved she caught her breath it was a vile sportinghouse she shuddered he left me with an oath on his lips matthew strang was at boilingpoint he ground the pebbles furiously under his foot oh the infamy of society that this lily should have been handled roughly it was sacrilege and yet in some subtle way he felt her more human than before she toopainful as it was to realize ithad known the mire of life she too this delicate flower of womanhood though it had left her unsullied ethereal still then she would understand what he had gone through she would know how coarse and unlovely life could be he felt strangely nearer to her heart at this moment some icy partition had melted away she ceased walking and put both hands over her face the fleecy wrap quivered on her shoulders he waited in silent reverence perhaps i was inconsiderate she said at last lifting her face dimmed with tears not forbearing enough you angel he whispered youll hear another story from his people allexcept olive they will tell you thatthat i am a she smiled wistfullya flirt he had no words hot enough he kicked a stone savagely the vile slanderers he cried they are all tarred with the same brush youre lucky to be done with them there was young gerard brode staying in the house a mere boy up from oxford and bubbling over with socialism i was interested in his theories and we had long talks and i tried to convert douglasthat was my poor husbandand to persuade him that we ought to divide our property with everybody but he met me with coarse ribaldry and said he wasnt going to divide his wife with any man least of all a whippersnapper like gerard brode and feeble taunts like that and that was the beginning of our dissensions poor mrs wyndwood he said and felt it a sweet privilege to pity her and so you spent your fortune on the movement she smiled sadly scarcely my fortune poor douglas never lived to inherit and i wasnt born with a gold spoon in my mouth though it had a crest on it but who has been telling you about my indiscretions she did not wait for an answer adding but there you know all about me now and her pathetic smile had a dazzling camaraderie though it flickered away as she wound up meditatively i wonder why i told you shall we go in not yet he pleaded hastily oh if you knew how proud i am of your confidences that they should be made to meto me oh if you knew what my life has been he felt choking you terrify me she returned lightly nothing very dreadful i trust i am nothing nobody he struggled with his voice i have slept in the streets i have consorted with the vilest all the more honor to you that you are fine oh if i had met you before you would have inspired me uplifted me no higher than you are ah you dont understand i have been so poor poverty is not a crime i have been in prison you were innocent her face shone it was only for debt i was the victim of a bankruptcy and i have paid it all off since but the stain remains on the laws that put you there he gulped down the great lump that made his throat dry and painful i was born in a poor novascotian village no one cared for art she stooped down and plucked up a seapink see how sturdily it grows among the stones now all the pentup selfpity of the long solitary years burst forth in a great torrent breaking through the proud passionate reserve that no living being had ever penetrated his soul yielded up its secrets in a strange blend of pride selfdepreciation and yearning for the womans sympathy i have had to carry the hod to climb the mast you climbed nearer heaven ah but i swabbed the deck you touched life at first hand i have never envied you so much as now we never get near its secret we idle rich you glorify my past for me i see it now as a divine education i have been living for false ideals oh if you could glorify my future i should be proud to inspire it the flash in her eyes passed to his if i could see you every day if i could tell you my hopes my dreams but what am i asking it is impossible you are the beautiful mrs wyndwood and i a genius a master towering over a humble slave her eyes swimming in tears but shining still like stars through rain sought his in humble adoration never had he pictured such a look from her he shook divining undreamedof possibilities for a moment he forgot everything he caught her hot hand and held it to his lips in that frenzy of divine fever half fire half tears he felt again that love rationalized life an infinity of thought and emotion was concentred in the instant his long sordid struggles his craving for happiness the infinite yearning with which as a boy in a lonely forest he had looked up at the stars this was the secret of his yearning this the flash that illumined life and underlying and intertangled with everything an astonishment at the vast sweep of life the possibilities it held last night rosina and camden town tonight eleanor and the sea and the stars she drew her hand away gently though there was no rebuke in the withdrawal murmuring we must be going in and straightway the image of rosina arose sinister and vindictive her voice raucous and strained to a ghastly jocosity crying kisses theyre off and then as he moved silently towards the house thrilling with the memory of her hand and her look prisoned sobs still fluttering at his throat he had a sudden paradoxical intuition that if he spoke of his wife as he had been on the point of doing something would go out of the magic of those touches and glances all spiritual though they were the figure of rosinasinister and vindictivewould stand between their souls troubling their most transcendental moments was not a mans wife the natural recipient of his confidences the nurse of his art and then if eleanor knew that he was ashamed of his wife that he had always passed as a bachelor would she not deem him contemptible the fine ethical sense that had refused to despise him for material degradations would it not certainly scorn him for moral weaknesses a great temptation took him not to imperil by indiscreet speech the footing he had won but his soul had been moved to its depths to be falseand with her i have not told you all mrs wyndwood you can tell me nothing nobler that was like an icy wind he walked on stormtossed they came to a jutting crag skirted it and the house rose radiant in the hollow of the cliff he had an aching vision of their living there together she and he with all the dear domesticities of wedded union his fancy feigned them reentering now their joint domain the pretence left his heart sick and empty they walked across the lawn you would not call me noble he said coming to an abrupt standstill if you knew that i he flinched under the sceptical confident smile she threw over her shoulder that i am married the halfmocking smile faded from the beautiful face and with it the color she turned her head again towards the house but she was not moving forward he was glad he had not to meet her eyes the sea broke solemnly with a fused roar of irregular waves and he wondered why the sound was so continuous a crickets chirp in the cliffbushes seemed to him extraordinarily loud he looked up at the stars were the tears indeed wiped from all eyes in those shining islands he thought or were they only dead lonely worlds or were they alive and full of unhappy people like the star he stood on she spoke at last with a catch in her breath and a strained smile in her voice why should that make me think less of you he caught only the celestial reassurance of her reply how fine how sympathetic she was but he hastened to immolate himself her unexpected question had thrown him off the track he forgot that his concealment of his marriage was the only circumstance for which he had foreseen the worlds blame and he answered desperately because i married for money for money she repeated in a toneless voice he was cold and sick with shame despite her experience of the coarser side of life such a contingency was he felt quite beyond her comprehension that money played no part in her consciousness he would have divined even if her friend had not informed him of the fact in their first talk an impulse had driven him to humble himself a counterinstinct now spurred him to excuse himself it was to pursue my art career he said deprecatingly even now he would not speak of the younger children he had had to support she turned her head again and the smile was struggling back and her voice had an echo of the old enthusiastic ring then you married for art not for money ah do not comfort me my god how i am punished she veered round now her tones were low and trembling with compassion is she a bad woman she is worse she is a good woman all her thoughts are on the household it is unbearable never a thought of anything but the kitchen and cabbages poor woman she said the prisoned sobs could hardly be choked back now the world does not know i have been ashamed of her now you see how low i am you cannot respect me her voice was almost a whisper i respect you the more for what you have done in despite of her you have had a hard life oh have i not and a sob escaped at last compose yourself we must go in you will be my friend all the same yes i will be your friend your confidences are safe in my keeping there is my hand he took it again and held it fast feeling its warm response you make me so happy life will not be empty now he struggled with the lump in his throat with your friendship what can i not achieve you shall tell me what i am to strive for it is too great a responsibility it was all very well to criticise i shant know what to say you need say nothing i shall look into your eyes and read it there he looked into them now and they were not lowered they were full of sympathetic sweetness glistening behind tears i am afraid they are rather red she said with a melancholy smile if i am not careful they may betray your confidences she moved forward in the direction of the water and he turning on his heel followed wondering by a salt pool near the rim of the billows she bent down and bathed her face to see her half kneeling in the moonlight affected him like reading poetry and as she washed off the traces of the tears he had made her shed it seemed to him as if their spiritual friendship were being consecrated by some mystic baptism they went in olive had not moved from her indolent attitude in the grandfathers chair herbert was standing at the windowcurtain im so glad youve come in she said yawning mr herbert has been sulking at having been left behind and i have been snapping his head off for not leaving me to myself yes miss regan speaks the truth for once said herbert audaciously oh i am glad primitiva is not here to have her ideal shattered goodnightbefore you get ruder goodnight he responded before you get truthfuller take care of him tonight mr matthew he is irresponsible dont go by the cliff route not i goodnight miss regan goodnight mrs wyndwood and that dear secret pressure thrilled his palm again in a few moments the two cousins were marching with measured step along the winding road herbert had lit a cigar but matthew was busy enough chewing the cud of his memories olive was rather strange tonight said herbert breaking the silence of the clifftops not more than usual surely answered matthew thats your conventionality and your ignorance of women i never found her strange except tonight with her nonsense about the pain of the world shes talked to me like that before several times she thinks people with souls cant be happy i suppose its mrs wyndwoods influence over her natural flippancy ah perhaps so but why so formal matt you have my permission to call her eleanor thank you said matthew with a forced smile i hope you enjoyed your ttette more than i did not that there isnt a certain fascination in sparring but perhaps you fought too he returned a staccato no after a silence accentuated by the tramp tramp of their automatic feet as they swung along he said i told her i was married herbert gave a long whistle the devil you did and you dont call that fighting what a knockdown blow what do you mean matthew murmured d you mean to say you dont know the woman is in love with you matthews blood made delicious riot in his veins he saw that strange look of worship in her eyes again nonsense he jerked thickly the honorable mrs wyndwood in love with me i didnt say the honorable mrs wyndwood i said the woman trust me behind all the titles and the purple and the fine linentheres flesh and blood it is impossible in love with me you may well be astonished you duffer to fix her affections on you with me in the neighborhood but women were always strange and men were deceivers ever all the more reason i shouldnt deceive her how glad i am i told her the truth i breathe easier theres a weight off my mind you selfish beggar and now its all over between you i suppose and our nice little constitutional quartette is broken up and i thought it was going to be so jolly when you came down heigho dont be afraid said matthew with a touch of bitterness eleanormrs wyndwood and i are going to be better friends than everthank god thank whom dont be blasphemous thank god repeated matthew firmly oh well you were always a methodist parson but if i were a jew i wouldnt say grace over pork not a bad epigram that i must get it into my comedy matthew shuddered herberts tone was desecrating you dont understand he said dont plume yourself on your superior intelligence old man mines quite equal to the study of plato it isnt such greek to me as you imagine well whatever you think you are quite wrong he replied with spirit our friendship is on a different plane it is based on our common interest in artand mrs wyndwoods not the sort of woman youve had experience of well thats cool how do you know what sort of women ive had experience of besides a woman is a woman the worldour world that isis full of greek scholars who study plato strictly under the rose society is only an incarnate wink i should put that into the comedy sneered matthew its a quotation from it laughed herbert had you there my boy it nearly came to a quarrel but herbert goodnaturedly said he must save matthew from himself and he fervently hoped his cousin would not confide in any more women you cant syndicate a secret he said sternly at the house they had left things were equally disturbed mrs wyndwood retired at once to bed throwing herself upon it in her clothes and her delicate white shoulders which like her emotions had no need to be covered up now rose and fell spasmodically after a while she got up bathed her eyes again in fresh water this time and went into olives room miss regan was brushing her dusky tresses savagely she had sent her maid to bed nice hours she growled youll catch cold dear eleanor replied gently for a window was wide open at the bottom nonsense nor said olive petulantly i should like to sleep on the beach what in this costume one bathes in less still while youre here she closed the window with a bang olive you make my heart jump really im not a man mrs wyndwood colored painfully then looked at her with brimming eyes of reproach and this is my reward for leaving you ttette leaving me ttette i thought that was a byproduct mrs wyndwood controlled her vexation i said just now i had never known any one so easy to live with dont make me change my opinion dear so youve been discussing me with matthew and what right have you to discuss me with anybody oh how hateful everybody is i know what it is youd like to see me brought down to your level goodnight miss regan you will apologize in the morning dont glare the level of womanhood if you like youve loved a man eleanors face flushed that is the height of womanhood olive oh yesfine phrases the height of womanhood she drew a comb fiercely through her hair to hang on a mans lips to feel a foolish sense of blankness when he isnt there and a great wave of joyful pain when he heaves in sight again to kiss his every little note to think of him and your trivial self as the centre of the universe and to want the planets to spin for your joint happinessoh she pulled the comb viciously through a knot you describe it very accurately olive said her friend maliciously im quoting the novels this passion that they crack up so much seems nothing more than selfishness at compound interest selfishness when you yourself say it makes you yearn for the other persons happiness so that it may subserve yours you are a cynic what is a cynic an accurate observer of life oh you neednt smile i know im quoting but one cant put quotation marks into ones conversation you cant face the facts of life nor you like dull people without insight i like you thats too cheap you like socialists and spiritualists and poets and paintersthe whole spawn of idealists bah they ought to have a months experience of a hospital the world isnt a hospital ward olive the people i like have the truer insight what insight has your matthew strang he is as much yours as mine dont shuffle out of the question his insight expresses itself through his work he doesnt talk is that a hit at his cousin queried olive savagely if so it falls remarkably flat considering herbert strang paints as well as talks olive why will you put words into my mouth you know how much i admire herbert strang ah then you have more insight than i gave you credit for you may even understand that a cynic is only a disappointed idealist a saint plus insight his soul is a palace of truth society and its shams come to the test yield up their implicit falseness and are scornfully rejected the stroke of wit is made with the sword of judgment its shaft is the lightning of righteous indignation mrs wyndwood felt this might pass well enough for an analysis of olives own cynicism but she had her doubts as to its applicability to herberts olive puzzled her frequently and shocked her not seldom but she felt instinctively that hers were the aberrations of a noble nature while the cynicisms of herbert jarred upon her without such reassurance of sweet bells jangled not that she doubted but that he too was much more idealistic than he made himself outdid he not write charming comedy lovescenes still he was a man who had seen the world not a crude girl like olive and in the face of olives affectionate analysis of herbertwhich she rightly divined owed less to reason than to the growing love for him which she had long suspected in her turbulent friendeleanor felt vaguely that while jarring notes may be struck from the soundest keyboard they may also be the index of an instrument hopelessly out of tune of course herbert was not that she was sure he lacked matthews idealism and manly beauty but he was handsome too in his daintier way and charming and gifted and probably the very husband to put an end to olives psychical growingpains all this mixture of acute and feeble insight occupied eleanors consciousness but all she said was is that emerson no its me now go to bed and sleep on it i shant i couldnt sleep on anything so hard dear me what a lot of hairpins you have what nice ones i must borrow some take them all and go not yet i shall blow out the candles snapped olive i love talking in the dark im pining for feminine conversation to soothe my overwrought nerves how pretty that lace is eleanor touched her friends shoulder cajolingly what exquisite things you have everythingfrom hairpins to carvingknivesperfect after its kind like the animals that went into the ark it will be difficult to give you a wedding present olive laughed despite herself the only wedding present a woman wants is a husband you have had plenty of those presents offered you dear olive shuddered violently imagine existence with a guardsman orworsewith that doddering young duke dulness without idealism your matthew strang is endurablehe has at least the family idealism the strang goodness though he carries it so much more heavily than his cousin but a lifetime with a dull manwho wouldnt understand a jokewho would smile and smile and be a hypocrite oh ye gods i should shriek in a year i should be in a lunatic asylum or the divorce court oh why do you women who have been through the mill egg us girls on is it the same instinct that makes an exfag send his boy to eton or do you think it improves our health i know you think me hysterical mrs wyndwood flushed your tongue runs away with you olive youd do better to say your prayers ill leave you to them olive laughed hilariously aha i thought that would get you to go you always will forget that ive been in a hospital say my prayers eh let me see what shall i say the one i used to say in the hospital o lord i beseech thee let not this be counted unto me for righteousness for thou knowest o lord that i cant help it but thats not applicable now suppose i say just whats in my heart as the theologians recommend she went down on her knees and said solemnly o lord dont you think you are sometimes a little hard upon us dont you think we are born into a very confusing world it would be so easy to do thy will to make thy will our will if we only knew what it was dont you think that half our life that might be devoted to thy service is wasted because of the mist through which we grope bearing the offering of our life in quest of we know not what divine altar and blurring the road more thickly with our tears she sprang up hows that for an addition to the liturgy nor i am disgusted said mrs wyndwood sternly both blasphemous and ungrammatical olive threw herself back on the bed laughing unrestrainedly you delightful stupid old thing ha ha ha blasphemous and ungrammatical you dissenting hellenist sacrilege and syntax ha ha ha no you shant escape you must abide the question tell me o friend of my soul why do women who have been unhappily married want to see other women victimized equally like people who have been fooled in a penny show and come out laughing to beguile the other people thats not a fair analogy said eleanor more gently olive looked up archly her arms under her head no perhaps not in your case i dare say youre quite capable of marrying again yourself the triumph of hope over experience quotation marks please youre looking awfully handsome nor and that saucy tilt of your nose spoils you for a saint speaking as an exsculptress its like a blunt pencil she sprang up remorsefully oh im a beast i apologize to your nose i forgot the tip was a sore point mrs wyndwood drew back in sorrowful hauteur i shall never marry again olive she said solemnly there was an undertone of selfpity and her eyes were moist she turned hastily and walked from the room with a firm stately step olive watched the sweep of the gown till it reached the door then she gave chase and renewed her apologies and let eleanor sob out sweet reconciliation on her shoulder after which she opened the window sat on the side of the bed and screwed up her ripe red lips to produce a perplexed whistle chapter vii the idyl concludes they fleeted the days delightfully as men did in the golden world they rode together on the rolling moors they drove through the devonshire lanes they strolled through combe and copse they climbed the tors they fished the leys they swam in the sea and when it was cloudy and cold and the wind wailed about the house like a woman in pain they listened to the comedy which herbert wrote in those dreary days when the ladies drove off to distant houses for lunch or tennis or croquet for they had not quite hidden their retreat or detached themselves from their kind theres always scandal within a fourmile radius as miss regan put it is there on earth a greater piece of philanthropy than to give your neighbors food for gossip man cannot live by bread alone matthew asked her in concern if his and herberts visits were causing any talk my dear mr matthew she replied scornfully even an actress cannot escape scandal especially if she goes into society and truly society is so corrupt i have often wondered that actresses mothers allow them to go into it during one of these absences of the feminine element when herbert went over to the house to put the last touches to the painted costume grumbling at the boredom of such finicking work matthew gladly relieved him of the brush and worked up the whole portrait while herbert lay smoking and thinking out the comedy partly out of bravado partly to enjoy the series of lovely views of darkgreen sea and broken crags and nestling villages the cousins invariably arrived by the cliffpath seeing the blackberries get riper every day sometimes they found the ladies sitting reading on the top of the cliff which was furzy with a roadside border of hemlock and dandelions and blue orchids amid which their dainty parasols showed from afar like gigantic tropical flowers then while matthew drowsed in the light of the sun and of eleanor inhaling the odors of bracken and thyme lazily watching the white surf break far below the brown trawlers glide across the horizon the swallows swarm on the beach and the wild ducks over the sea herbert and olive would rattle away by the hour often in verbal duels matthew strang thought he had never tasted such pure intellectual joy art was often on the tapis they classified the skiestoday a constable and yesterday a turner and tomorrow a corot herbert expounded glibly to the rapt eleanor the continental ideas descanting on manet and monet nature lay all around them like a model to illustrate these theories and eleanor discovered all sorts of shadows and subtle effects she had never noticed before all with the nave joy of a child lighting on pretty treasures she cried out that art taught people to see nature and the impressionists were right look over there you couldnt tell whether it was a pool or a pile of fish and the colors of things changed incessantly matthew would sometimes put in a word when appealed to by her but never when the subject was music concerning which he was as ignorant as the rest of the party was learned once herbert maintained that the musician was better off than the painter because his work remained while pictures perished destroyed by the aniline and bitumen in their own colors even mona lisas smile will fade he said the artist lingers a little longer on the stage than the actor pictures are but paltry things at best and few artists have brains or any large outlook upon life theyre a petty quarrelsome clan matthew did not deny it olive cited sculpture as a more durable art than the musicians which only lived when performed mrs wyndwood was convinced that the joy of art must be to the artist she said she was fast acquiring a keen interest in the subjective side of art and feeling a growing desire to be an artist herself the spiritual was all very well but it needed to be expressed through the beautiful olive playfully suggested an expedition to the latin quarter mrs wyndwood accepted it seriously and eagerly she returned to the idea again and again both in public and in private why should they not go to paris for the winter and olive take up sculpture again and initiate her into the divine mysteries to judge by the strangs artists must be delightful creatures to live among and sculpture seemed easier and simpler than painting olive continued to play with the project herbert sneered at the idea of miss regans return to the plaster of paris literature was after all the only art he said it contained everythingmusic of words painting of scenery passion of drama he almost converted mrs wyndwood she quoted ecstatically lunivers a t fait pour aboutir un beau livre but a word from matthew restored the balance they talked of life too of fate freewill and knowledge absolute like miltons archangels herbert as lucifer steadfastly took the lowest views of human nature now and then olives eye twinkling with fun met his as if in a secret understanding that mrs wyndwood must be shocked at all hazards he fought for the doctrine that sin was a human invention let people have their fling they exaggerate their powers of sinning they think they can draw on a boundless internal reservoir of wickedness as a matter of fact their powers are singularly limited they have too much original goodness for my part alas i have found few opportunities of sinning and have you never found opportunities for remorse mrs wyndwood asked scathingly alas often i tell you remorse for the sins i couldnt do the remorse of your religious person is too often like the snivelling repentance of the condemned criminal that murderer felt a truer remorse who was unexpectedly reprieved after indulging in an indigestible breakfast olive laughed heartily that must go into the comedy it had become their stock phrase then remembering her part in the comedy was to score off herbert she capped his anecdote of the condemned criminal by another about the politeness of a frenchman who ascending the scaffold said to his neighbor in the tumbril aprs vous eleanor raised the talk to a more elevated plane insisting on the value of remorse and of suffering generally i would not recall one of my sufferings said she with her simple earnestness if i didnt suffer i shouldnt think i had grown and her eyes instinctively sought matthews and he thought she was reminding him of the educative efficacy of his own sufferings as well and again herberts philosophy jarred and whatever she was saying or doing she always fell naturally into some attitude that enchanted his eye by its unaffected grace always wore an expression whose sweetness and candor softened him in worship her beautyto a painters soul the miracle of miraclesshe wore with a royal unconsciousness he could not understand it she was so simple just like a human being he saw her not in her society drapings but in all moods and weathers and she bore the test on fishing days they would draw up the boat in the centre of the nearest ley where perch and rudd abounded the former avid of the gentles the latter only less eager for the paste but demanding an iota of skill when hooked olive would take no hand in this mild sport she had given up hunting and fishing she said when she rose in the ethical scale challenged as to her readiness to eat meat and fish she failed to see the relevancy of the criticism the reason she wouldnt kill other creatures was not that it gave them pain but that it gave her pain to eat them on the contrary gave her pleasure mrs wyndwood however though not callous enough to impale her own worms was persuaded by matthew to take a rod and beguiled numbers of perch and admitted to a thrill of savage joy each time she hauled up a leaping flash of silver she was glad though she said that the poor little fishes had horny membranes for gills so that the hook should not hurt them when it passed through the eye she trusted that the cornea was insensitive too but how would you feel olive once remonstrated if sitting at dinner just after swallowing a mouthful of mayonnaise and in the middle of a remark to your neighbor about the rhine or the preraphaelites you were suddenly to find yourself rising towards the ceiling at the end of a rope fixed by a hook to your upper lip and arriving slowly but surely despite your kicking and writhing into a stratum of air totally devoid of oxygen herbert strang thought one would feel like a fish out of water but matthew strang eluded the point by drawing a pike across the track the bait of a captured roach had fetched the monster whose struggles interested even olive while eleanor was wrought up to a wild enthusiasm for matthews prowess and regretted that in scotland she had always refused to go to see the grouseshooting i hear they are doing badly this year olive observed oh no olive cried mrs wyndwood didnt we hear at the archdeacons yesterday that they were making excellent bags i meant the birds said olive dryly bother the birds i should love to be a sportsman cried eleanor exultantly landing her eleventh perch they trooped like children to the dinnerbell i can see how fascinating it must be to actually feel the struggle for existence it brings you back to the primitive you touch reality you remember youre an animal lunch always reminds me sufficiently of that said olive no eleanor argued the napery and the flowers come between us and the facts how glorious it would be to be primitive between art and sportwith that charming impressionability of hersshe had drifted as far from the spiritualities of dolkovitch as under the russians influence from the socialism of gerard brode herbert whose skill with the rod was not remarkable diverged into an account of his stay in a servian fishingvillage which was entirely primitive so primitive he said laughing that the wives do most of the work he sketched the place with admirable literary touches sheepskin is their only wear he wound up in the winter they wear the wool outside in the summer they take off their skins andno not sit in their bones as miss regan is about to remarkbut wear the wool inside matthew was thus led on to relate juvenile sporting experiences on the shores of the bay of fundy and finally his one encounter with a bear in the cobequid forest which put the seal on mrs wyndwoods newborn ardor for sport this tame pickingup of perch palled they must go mackerelfishing she insisted and so matthew strang arranged with a fisherman to go out to sea in his boat next day but the sea ran high and to the undisguised relief of herbert who felt himself rather cut out by his cousin in these unliterary expeditions primitiva arrived the first thing in the morning with a note from mrs wyndwood saying she had forgotten the lawnmeet at colonel cheshams to inaugurate the season of the local pack and she would ride over to that in the hope of catching sight of a bit of the hunt there was a postscript from olive saying and of course i must go to chaperon her among all those men nevertheless they went out in the boat late that same afternoon when the ocean was calm again and quivering in the sun their course lay along a track of diamonds which seemed to dance off the water like a million elves of light by the time they returned the path of diamonds had changed to one of red gold delicious was the ripping sound of the living boat tearing the water as it dipped gently from side to side its white sail bellying gracefully the sunset was strange one dull red narrow bar crowned by a ball of molten gold radiating four hazy spokes like millsails the ball gradually sank in the sea in the south the white sickle of the moon grew yellower and yellower in the east fleecy strips of cloud reflected the dying day the colors of the cliffs still stood out vivid the moment was poetic the air was charged with amorous electricity the talk drifted into love and marriage they played with the subject skimming it gracefully touching it with subtle lights flashed and withdrawn shooting out audacities with ingenuous impersonality all four the while tingling with selfconsciousness from crown to sole herbert said that to a woman love is a complete romance to a man a collection of short stories olive maintained that the reverse was true oh if man knew woman she cried and you who pretend to write comedies mrs wyndwood admitted that byron was right about love being all in all to a woman ninetenths of unmarried women she said looking at herbert have never had a proposal ninetenths of married women more likely olive flashed back in matthews opinion marriage was a failure mrs wyndwood sadly acquiesced they sought the remedy marriage may be a failure but not friendship olive pronounced now it was matthews eyes that eleanors sought and his involuntarily met hers there was exaltation in this secret glance and mutual reassurance unless pursued olive the friendship is contracted between persons of different sex mrs wyndwoods eyes drooped then opened full again to note how matthew took the addendum the friends perceived themselves reddening in simultaneous confession that olive was not so very wrong an indefinable expression half abashment half radiance flickered over eleanors features her glance swift probing challenging dazzled him his whole frame trembled at the thought that this heavenly creature could love him then he grew chill again for she cried as in the highest spirits oh look at the sun how comic it had indeed become a clowns face swollen and bulbous and crossed with red bars the talk went on to womans rights and matthew mentioned that he had an indirect relation to the subject because a girl he used to know in childhood had become linda verders secretary is she pretty mrs wyndwood asked i dont know ive never seen her but you said you used to know her oh you mean ruth hailey she used to be pretty but my brother tells me shes gone off havent you seen her yourself oh not for years i sent mrs verder a subscription some few years ago said mrs wyndwood but i have ceased to believe in womans rights womans rights are a husband and children said herbert with his eye fixed on olive it is a mistake for the movement to be led by women pursued mrs wyndwood oh was that why you resigned when lord boscombe left the council asked olive innocently eleanor looked annoyed you mean mrs wyndwood matthew hastened to say that they lay themselves open to the imputation of being soured spinsters precisely she replied besides they are crying for the moon or the man in it muttered olive no thats ungenerous to your sisters said eleanor why demand generosity olive retorted we are all in the same trade and she smiled audaciously at herbert even mrs verder didnt take up with this movement till she lost her husband and ill wager this ruth bailey is an old maid ruth hailey corrected matthew flushing painfully he scarcely knew why perhaps from sympathy with the aspersed friend of his childhood she is unmarried but i am quite sure it must be from her own choice for she is very pretty you said she wasnt said mrs wyndwood quickly he laughed confusedly i was thinking of the girl the subject dropped ere they got in the wind freshened and matthew was busy with the sheet and now a proposition was broached which promised to bring a new sensation into their comparatively sequestered existence lighthearted discussions as to what they would do in the event of capsizing through matthews mishandling of the sail led to estimates of the distance they could swim in their clothes mrs wyndwood could not swim at all and complained of the abrupt shelving of the beach which gave her only a few feet of splashing room while olive was sailing gloriously off in search of the horizon herbert said that like the man who was asked if he could play the violin he didnt know if he could swim in his clothes because he had never tried and besides he had his comedy in his pocket which was heavy enough to drag down a theatre olive said she didnt see that it made any difference whether a lady swam in her clothes or not especially if she was in evening dress she claimed that the cap and gown worn in the water were as heavy as mens boating flannels the upshot of the discussion was that miss regan challenged mr matthew strang to a race in clothes which she insisted must be new you dont go out getting capsized in old clothes she contended boots you neednt have nor a coat people always have time to throw them offin books i shall be clothed in a new yachting costume superficially of course to counteract your sheddings from above what waste remonstrated eleanor you who pretend to philanthropy mocked herbert mimicking her intonation of you who pretend to write comedies waste to learn to save my life and dont you see i shall forthwith give away the spoiled costume to a poor creature who would never otherwise have got it and olive who was quite serious fell to elaborating a facetious programme of the creamery regatta the regatta day duly arrived two bathing tents were erected on the beach and decorated with flags it was arranged that the competitors should swim out leisurely together as far as they cared to go then turn and race for shore herbert was chosen referee he offered to take them out in a boat and then accompany them back as a precaution but olive laughed at him for an old woman eleanor entering enthusiastically into the fun had ordered a silver cup from london and was to present it to the winner but the day opened badly with fitful weather a gray rain and thunder and lightning they waited till the afternoon when the sun burst out in sudden fire and in a moment the great stretch of gray cloud was shrivelling off all around it like a burned cobweb the eager combatants dashed into their dressingtents and emerging as lightly clad as was compatible with the conditions they plunged together into the great sapphire sea olives yachting costume turned out to be a pair of knickerbockers and a jacket rather lighter than her ordinary bathing costume and matthew had begged off his waistcoat and was only hampered by a white flannel shirt and trousers the outward swim was an ecstasy the water was warm and sparkling with patches of molten silver breaking up into little shining circles and reuniting it sent a voluptuous thrill to the palms to cleave its buoyant elasticity and the forward movement of the body was a rapture drawing in the balmy air with joyous breaths matthew felt an immense gratitude for existence there was exhilaration in the mere proximity of olive with her lively snatches of conversation her lovely flushed face and dripping hair went with him like a mermaidens the same thought struck her for she began to sing jerkily with her beautiful voice snatches of heines ballad die schnste jungfrau sitzet dort oben wunderbar ihr goldnes geschmeide blitzet sie kmmt ihr goldnes haar yes but you havent got golden hair the man laughed joyously farther and farther they swam into the vast shimmering blue and ecstasy made the pace brisker than they had meditated shall we start from here he asked at last no not yet i want a long race they swam on the brown trawling boats loomed plainer in the offing here said matthew noa little farther faintheart he turned on his back and propelled himself gently gazing up in luxurious content at the great circle of blue sky cloudmottled round its rim olive lying on her side paddled lazily a little ahead this is delicious she called back clothes make no difference but fancy a clothed lorelei and she began to sing again with pauses for breath den schiffer im kleinen schiffe ergreift es mit wildem weh er schaut nicht die felsenriffe er schaut nur hinauf in die hh he threw the reply over his head you shall lure me no farther but she mocked him elated by the glory of motion and witched him to follow her till the shore was far at last they turned trod water olive cried one two three and they were off for some minutes they swam side by side olive making the pace and matthew finding it no trouble to keep up with it at last she made a spurt and shot past him with a triumphant taunt he allowed her to enjoy some seconds of victory then came up handoverhand and forged ahead he eased off and she overtook him he spurted and she flagged he let her come up again and she came up with a sneer resolved to damp her frolicsome spirits he put on a powerful stroke and showed her a clean pair of heels she made a desperate effort and drew level with him again the instinct of victory was now aroused in the painter he fixed his eyes on the shore and settled steadily to the task of reaching it very soon olive was hopelessly in the rear he still heard her vague cries from afar at last they died away entirely he turned his head to measure the interval olive was nowhere to be seen his heart contracted with a cold sick horror he raced back with great side strokes shouting miss regan miss regan holloa the great sparkling water stretched all around in deadly silent bareness suddenly become an evil enemy he hoped desperately she was only swimming under water for speed or to frighten him and then in a moment her head popped up to the right and he saw from the exhausted expression of the face and the spasmodic struggles of the limbs that she had really gone under in a few strokes he was at her side she still retained sufficient selfpossession not to grab at him he supported her with one hand then with the rest of his limbs he struck out stoutly for home she helping him with feeble movements after an interval of weakness and humility she recovered somewhat and smiled faintly so you wouldnt follow the lorelei she spluttered reproachfully i am sorry i followed her so far he said ruefully regarding the distant shore olive struggled for breath prosaic man i waited down there for you but i gave you up and came to the surface again she essayed sturdier kicks you only sank once he said yes didnt you hear me calling you to come i heard sounds but i thought they were epigrams brute to hit a woman when shes down but i shall be better soon i hope they cant see us from shore dont talk you brought herbert an operaglass to see we started fair nonsense olive gasped indignantly i distinctly remember it how dare you set up your memory against a drowning womans he was glad to find her like herself and not alarmed her strokes were getting stronger now but he still feared for the consequences if she should suddenly lose her nerve what did you think of when you sank he asked lightly to make her think the danger of sinking was over of her she began and stopped short of her carryingson at my funeral poor nor i was regretting i hadnt made my will and left her my nose this sounded pure nonsense to her companion i think i can go by myself now she added after a long silence thank you so much for the use of your arm you are quite sure he said anxiously yes of course you have won he removed his arm but kept watchfully at her side and his misgivings were justified for after a slow twenty yards her strokes became so spent and irregular that he came to her assistance again and she accepted his support with a wan smile its this soppy clogging costume she said you had better keep your breath in your lungs he said not in rebuke but in hortation ill inflate myself like an airballoon she replied humbly i am so sorry to be such a nuisance and she turned upon her back and paddled feebly in silence he did not answer for his own nerve was giving way the responsibility weighed more than the burden though that was heavy enough with the double weight of superadded garments he had a spasm of sickening apprehension his own strokes were getting jerkier what if he should fail to reach that strip of beach on which he dimly descried two agitated figures and in this tense terrible moment the figures were blotted out he saw only the cliffs in the background and the white seagulls overhead and he was a boy again in the bay of fundy swimming in his clothes for dear life the illusion was momentary but it left the memory a sense of the tragic contrast between the ardent novascotian lad dreaming of pictures and the popular london painter occupied his consciousness while his limbs moved automatically shoreward then he remembered that of the two who had struck out for home on that memorable day the sailor had only put off the day of drowning and at the thought that ancient dead face swam up again in front of him oh it was horrible to die to be dragged down out of the sunlight to leave a world which held eleanor wyndwood what would become of her she would live to forget him she would marry another man would hold her in his arms another man oh direful thought bitterer than death there was no need for his death ere another man could possess her she was only his friend he had not wanted more than her friendship oh ghastly selfdelusion olives sneer at the friendship of the sexes rang in his brain and that strange intoxicating expression in eleanors facehalf abashment half radiancedispelled the vision of his fathers in a moment of delirium his lips touched her warm cheek it was her weight that was on his arm what did it matter if they had a gleam of happiness he and eleanor both victims of an unsatisfactory world was not the great shining mocking remorseless sea waiting to suck him down indifferent to the aspirations and agonizings of the long years and then between his lips and hers the dead stony face swam up again and he turned on his back to escape it and found unexpected relief in the more reposeful attitude and in the change of arm involved for the left which had supported olive had grown numb when sufficiently rested he turned again he saw with a thrill of joy that the shore was perceptibly nearer there were more than two figures now he made out primitiva and the old cook and herberts arm was round mrs wyndwoods waist supporting her a powerful spurt brought him within clear hearing of herberts hail shall i come out olive roused herself what for she sang out lustily the race is decided all right came the joyous reply i was sure matt could manage it i wouldnt spoil his chances of a medal as they came nearer in he cheered them on with sportive ejaculations and confounded the beach because there wasnt a single boat within half a mile when the couple scrambled on shore shaking themselves like spaniels mrs wyndwood dragged more heavily on herberts sustaining arm and he saw that she had fainted almost at the same instant by a curious coincidence the sun upon which the clouds had gradually been closing in again disappeared and the wail of the wind rang wilder round the cliffs there was confusion in the household that afternoon mrs wyndwood soon revived but had to be put to bed and miss regan who was secretly grateful for an excitement that kept her from assuming the invalid herself sat with her the men hung about the house anxious and receiving frequent reassuring bulletins by the lips of primitiva presently those pretty lips brought them an invitation to stay to seven oclock dinner when mrs wyndwood would try to come down to present the cup they need have no delicacy about the larder for colonel chesham had opportunely sent mrs wyndwood a gift of grouse they galloped over the cliffs to get themselves into their dressclothes meantime mrs wyndwood had fallen asleep and at her bedside olive regan writhed in a black paroxysm asking herself why having once gone down she had wanted to come up again the hostesses were a little late but the reunion was gay beyond all precedent the last trappings of ceremony were thrown off a bohemian merriment reigned regardless of the liveried menial who alone sustained the dignity of the dinnertable mrs wyndwood looking a shade paler and more spiritual but no whit less beautiful than her wont appeared in a low white satin gown with the same jewelled butterfly poised at the bosom as on the night when matthew had met her at the academy soire he fancied some occult significance in the circumstance olive was in soft green that harmonized so suavely with her complexion as to give her a less aggressive air than when she wore blue there was a fragrant tearose with a sprig of maidenhair fern at her throat and the table was gay with many choice specimens of aster and hydrangea presents from primitivas father outside the roar of the sea and the wail of the wind emphasized the charm and comfort of the interior and the gladness of being alive there was a wavering flush on mrs wyndwoods cheek and a shining moisture in her eye as before they sat down she presented matthew with the cup which olive complained had been dashed from her lips interrogated as to her sensations she said she had a horrible feeling of littleness in the midst of the great churn of waters and under the naked sky it did not seem the same sea she had been bestriding so recklessly and voluptuously she seemed to herself absolutely unimportanta mere atom in the blind wash of the waves a straw they would engulf drift or disgorge with equal indifference it was this thought that suddenly paralyzed her and made her give up and go under when she came up something not herself made her strain every sinew to keep afloat something not ourselves that makes for life said herbert she smiled my last thought was of you she said audaciously i determined to send you a message by submarine cable i had the greatest ado to prevent primitiva stripping and going out to fetch you in he rejoined laughing the incidents of the regatta continued to afford amusement from the hors duvres to the dessert at the fish olive sprang up suddenly and rushed to the window her exclamation of the regatta fireworks drew them all after her herbert uttered the longdrawn oh of the spectators of pyrotechnics it was indeed an extraordinary setpiece this sunset in affinity with the fitful tempestuous daya sky steelblue again with great broad sulphuredged clouds of black smoke on the upper rim of this smoke white clouds towards the horizon over the inhabited hills a lovely palegreen light and on the right of that a monstrous sulphurcloud its base hidden below the horizon the shadow of this brilliant cloud darkening to a purple and crimson beauty on the everstirring water and the cloud itself infiltrating its pores more and more with sulphur and deepening momently to old gold over the green light patches of bright gold the left extremity of the sulphurcloud coming to meet it in spots of smoky red every little pool of rain or brine on the beach crimsoning and purpling in responsive radiance they returned to their fish but watched from their seats till the beautiful sulphurcloud faded into a pale bluish blot mrs wyndwood observing it all minutely with her recently acquired artistic vision said she had never realized before how many editions a sunset went through she wondered how artists arrested it long enough to paint it herbert said sunsets were not fixed but faked he resumed his badinage of olive for her failure to see her whole life defile pictorially before her and she apologized for her forgetfulness on the ground that she hadnt arrived at drowning point a discussion on memory ensued mrs wyndwood acknowledged possessing a good verbal memoryespecially for poetry herbert said that he could only remember ideas so that he carried away nothing from contemporary literature only the continentals had ideas the english were a wooden race the wooden heads of old england he said derisively he was glad of his infusion of french blood there was no salt in english lifenothing but putrefying puritanism olive said although she was a celt she could remember neither ideas nor words herbert asked what was her earliest recollection after screwing up her forehead in earnest effort she replied honestly i forget and he cried bull mrs wyndwood proffered her own earliest recollectionof gliding in her mothers arms in a gondola with a boatman crying staliand was curious to know matthews he replied mirthfully that he didnt remember and covered his discomposure with champagne he could not expose to strangers that memory of his mother scolding his father shrieking vociferating offering to throw up the position threatening to shoot herself even mrs wyndwood would never know thatno one would ever really see the scars on his soul the thought of her now babbling harmlessly saner in her insanity than in her sanity came up like the skeleton at the feast he put her resolutely outside with the night and the wind that wailed like a woman but he heard them moaning oh the pain of the world after dinner they walked along the shore towards the neighboring village it blew half a gale now but the air was not cold and the ladies took only wraps the quartette looked upon this deserted beach as a private promenade an appanage of the house they walked two and two matthew and miss regan herbert and mrs wyndwood there was only a rim of orange all along the horizon the rollers thundered on the stones smashing themselves in flying spray a fierce undertow kept the waves sandy for half a mile out there was just light enough to distinguish where the paler green commenced the darkness grew rapidly as they walked the last faint reflection of sunset faded on the gray sea an unusual silence possessed them after the exuberance of the evening they stopped now and again to shake the little pebbles out of their shoes all was black when they reached the village the beach was full of wickerwork crabpots and the headless divided forms of skate and dogfish loomed uncannily from the poles on which they hung they were the crabfishers bait only a stray mongrel represented the village which already slept the sea was mournful and gloomy its pitchy blackness over which the sky hinged like a halfraised gray lid was relieved only by its own broken lines of foam which sometimes rolled in six deep looking exactly like streaks of phosphorescence on a dark wall and adding weirdness to the forlorn desolation of the scene there was no other line of light either on sea or land the lonesome sea tossed sleeplessly in its agony howling and crying they turned back interchanging companions during the walk mrs wyndwood suddenly asked matthew if his wife knew where he was he said no sometimes his brother billy did billy lived with her his man forwarded all letters from his studio after a long pause he added that practically he had been separated from his wife for years eleanor murmured again poor woman and he was too shamestricken to look her in the face and to read that the sympathy was for him they relapsed into silence and indeed conversation was difficult the night had grown wilder the wind blew more fiercely drenching their faces with salt spray whirling them round and round and almost lifting them off their feet but the clouds were driven off and the starsprinkled heaven was revealed majestic near the house mrs wyndwood and matthew strang stopped to admire the sublime spectacle sheltering themselves from the gale in a niche in the cliff the other two had already gone round the craggy projection which hid the house they watched the mad cavalry charge of creaming billows watched them break thundering and throwing their spray heavenwards like a continuous play of white fountains all along the line of march to the right beyond the village whence they had come where the cliff jutted out at its lowest level a ghostly fountain leaped again and again sheer over the top of the cliff with a crashing and splashing that was succeeded by the longreceding moan of the backdrawn wave soughing through the rattling pebbles her face flushed with the passion of the storm showed divinely in the dim starlight beneath her wrap her bosom panting from the walk in the teeth of the wind heaved with excitement the gale had dishevelled her hair they scarcely spoke the organroll of the sea crashed majestically like the bass in some savage symphony of the winds now at last the moon leaped out framed in a weird cloudrack the moonlight played on her loveliness and made it wonderful she moved slightly forward the cliff is too damp to lean upon she murmured audaciously he slipped a trembling arm against the rock and let her form rest against that she scarcely seemed conscious of him she was watching the rampant seething waters volleying their white jets skyward with a crash of cannon that outroared the wind her scarlet lips were parted eagerly the dreamy light had gone from her eyes they flashed fire oh i could dare tonight she cried the wind blew her tresses into his face the perfume of them stung his blood her loveliness was maddening him so close so close oh to shower mad kisses upon her lips her eyes her hair what did it matter there on that wild beach alone with the elements he had been so near death who would have recked if he had been dead now tossed in that welter of waters the waves broke with a thousand thunders the white fountains flew at the stars they seemed alive exultant frenzied with the ecstasy of glorious living oh for lifesimple sublimethe keen tingling savage life of vikings and searobbers in the days before civilization in the fullblooded days when men loved and hated fiercely strenuously wrenching through rapine and slaughter the women they coveted ah surely he had some of their blood it ran in his veins like fire he was of their race despite his dreamings he was his fathers son loving the storm and the battle the wind wailed it was like the cry of his tortured heart his yearning for happiness it rose higher and higher a bat flew between them and the moon eleanor nestled to him involuntarily her face was very near to his it gleamed seductively there was no abashment only alluring loveliness the fire in her eyes kindled him now not to the secondary life of art but to the primary life of realities could she not hear his heart beat yes surely the storm of the elements had passed into her blood too her face was ardent ecstatic his arm held her tight oh to stake the world on a kiss the moon was hidden again they were alone in the mad dim night the complexities of society were far away they looked at each other and through her eyes he seemed to see heaven a star fell overhead it drew her eyes away a moment to watch its fiery curve he felt the spell was broken the wind shrieked with an eldritch cry like the mocking threnody of his thwarted hope he had a shuddering remembrance of mad peggy and straightway he saw her weird figure dashing round the crag in the darknessa shawl over her head and a lovely face at once radiant and frenzied gleaming from between its dusky folds his heart almost stopped a superstitious thrill froze his hot blood never to be happy ah god never never to thirst and thirst and nothing ever to quench his thirst mrs wyndwood started forward oh there you are olive the figure threw passionate arms round her comfort me darling i am engaged for the happier herbert had spoken and olive had listened shyly humbly with tears full of an exquisite uplifting emotion akin to the exaltation of righteousness at the thought of giving herself to this man of living her life with and for the one true soul in the world they stood close to the hoary rim of the black welter dusky figures windrocked and spraydrenched a little apart from each other the shining house in the background and when did you begin to think of mein that way she faltered i never thought of you in any other but that night when matthew arrived when you sat nidnodding in the grandfathers chair you maddened me you were adorable the contrast was exquisite to think of youa wilful little misanthropeto think of that glorious wayward creature fading away till she suited the chair oh it was too he broke off passion robbed him of words he moved nearershe drew back oh but will you stillshe hesitated shy of the wordlove me when i do suit the chair i shall always see you as you were then she laughed with a halfsob and just then she confessed deliciously fluttering even now like a bird in the net i was beginning to get frightened of you i felt you growing upon me shadowing the horizon like the roc in the arabian nights and the pain of the world was outsidein the great black nightcalling to me in my slough of luxury you witch veil those eyes or i shall kiss them she retreated and why were you frightened of me he asked tenderly she said humbly in little shy jerks i felt like in the sea this morningone little atom and the whole world against me and my own weakness most of all i had prided myself on my swimming and here was i being dragged under just like other girls a victim to the same ridiculous passion you delightful candid creature with me as the object dont be flippant now herbert how delicious his name sounded it made amends for the rebuke you do understand me marriage is a second birthvoluntary this time it means accepting the universe which was thrust upon one unasked it means making the best of it oh surely it means more it means passing it on to others but i surrender i cannot live without you olive he sprang to take her but she eluded him look the moon is covered up again i only want to see your face dont talk like other men though i have fallen like other girls no you are always yourself olivei have dreamed of this moment i would not have it otherwiseexcept perhaps with you in the grandfathers chair and a poke bonnet now you are yourself this is such a conventional ending to a holiday we must preserve what originality we can she was recovering her spirits a conventional ending why its a most romantic incongruous match it beats the comedy i shall burn it no lets produce itit wouldnt cost much i am not worthy of you olive he said with a quiver in his voice i have nothing oh when you have my heart my queen of girls but what of your relatives a gleam of fun passed across her wet face she had her droll look of mischief you are all of them i was of age long agoi am awfully old you knowyou take me with your eyes open i cant yours dazzle me thatll do for the comedy she laughed gleefully still if you do want me there are only you and i to consider only we two he murmured we two she repeated and her eyes were suffused with tender moisture there was a delicious silence he tried to take her hand this time she abandoned it to him a wave of moral emotion lifted her to the stars the wind wailed the black sea crashed white at their feet its whirling brine blinded their eyes as with salt tears isnt it curious she said as they moved back a little hand in hand what dearest that you and i should be made happier by our common perception of the unhappiness of life queer girl he thought but he only squeezed her hand the catechism is right she went on thoughtfully proceeding to misquote it the waves are too strong its no use fighting against your sex or your station do your duty in that state of life in which it has pleased god to call you but i would have that text taught to the rich exclusively not to the poor the poor should be encouraged to ascend the rich should be taught contentment else their strength for good is wasted fruitlessly and the electric current of love generated by those closepressed palms flashed to her soul the mission of a life of noble work hand in hand herbert scarcely heard her the glow of her lovely face the flashes of feeling that passed over it the tears that glistened on her eyelashesthese absorbed his senses her generalizations were only a vague exquisite music he lifted her hand and held it passionately to his lips she murmured beseechingly you will never disappoint me herbert my darling and he strove to draw her nearer and press his first kiss upon those bewitching lips oh theres a star falling she cried and slipped from his hold a beautiful diana virgin as the white spray and tameless as the night she had disappointed herbert he was puzzled but as she disappeared round the cliff in quest of the others a smile of triumphant content curled round his boyish lips thats the last touch of piquancy he murmured as he chased her round the crag chapter viii eleanor wyndwood two days after herberts engagement matthew strang left devonshire on the plea of a death in the family a letter from billy had indeed brought the news that rosinas father was no more matthew had never thought untenderly of old coble the mountain of a man had acted generously after his lights and now that his genial roar had passed into the eternal silence the pathos of death softened his soninlaw towards his memory and towards the bereaved daughter nevertheless matthews plea was only a pretext he had no intention of intruding upon rosina after her recent reception of him he had no reason to suppose a visit would be welcome the letter from billy had included no message from her except a request superfluously and irritatingly formal that she should be allowed to give houseroom to her aunt clara who had gone to live with old coble when his daughter married his reply to billy contained warmly sympathetic reference to the loss of old coble and expressed his joy at the prospect of receiving miss coble his real reason for fleeing from devonshire was his discovery of his real feeling towards mrs wyndwood when the frenzy of the stormy night had merged in the sober reflections of the mild morning he shuddered to think how near he had gone to forfeiting her respect to insulting her by the revelation of a dishonorable passion to continue in her daily society would have been too great a torment aggravated as it must have been by the sight of herberts happiness perhaps the rude reminder of his domestic shackles contained in billys letter strengthened his resolve to tear himself away courtesy compelled him to leave behind him an invitation to the ladies to take tea one day at his studio which neither had ever seen how could he snap abruptly the links he had forged with this delightful twain he threw himself with ardor into work trying to soothe his pain by expressing it in art as a woman sheds it away in tears he toiled at a symbolic picture to illustrate rossettis sonnet loves fatality love shackled with vainlonging hand to hand he put the figures in a vague landscape but did not study his models in the open for he now had a desire to produce that fatness of effect suggested by a concentrated studio light instead of the dry flatness which the open air always diffused he no longer pinned himself to technical theories finding by experience that he only invented them afterwards to justify the procedure his instinct dictated for any particular picture but his progress with loves fatality was slow and unsatisfactory he was feeling about as it were for a new manner worthy of her who inspired it he wrote her once telling her that it was on the easel and reminding her and miss regan of their promise to visit him on their return from devonshire and he had from her an answerelegantly indited on dainty crested paper delicately scentedwhich he held often to his lips with a rankling gnawing pain of unsatisfied and unspoken desire she wrote that she was very anxious to see the picture and also to be back in town for she was weary of the country with its monotony its lack of the complex thrill of civilization not that the town held much to enthral her fortunately olive had consented to the paris project the girl did not want to marry before next summer and rather hailed the idea of a farewell quasibachelor bohemian period of art and liberty what she eleanor would do when she lost olive heaven only knew and then came the wail of worldweariness which his ear had caught already in the first stages of their acquaintanceship he interpreted it in the light of his own blank unrest but to imagine her hungering for him as he hungered for her was impossible to his reverent passion that she admired and liked him he could not doubt and in one or two instants of mutual electricity he had dared to think that herbert was right and that she loved him but his diffidence could never cherish the hope for more than a few seconds and even if she indeed loved him he felt that her delicacy her finer more ethereal ethical sense would preserve her from the wistful images that tortured him it was the memory of her unhappy marriage to which her sadness must be due no doubt too her life lacked love though she might not be consciously aware of it when she at last came to see the picture he was startled to find her alone and the bearer of a message of apology from miss regan his studio being so to speak a place of business he was not unused to receive ladies in connection with commissions but his poor agonized heartthat had so ached to see her againpulsed furiously with mad hope as her stately figure clad in widowlike black that set off her beauty in novel lights moved slowly about the great studio admiring pictures which he would have hidden from her in the days when he thought of her more as a spiritual critic than a woman now even though she stood before him making remarks he was too distraught to catch the purport of her criticisms he followed her about in a haze a dream speaking replying and feeling all the while as if it was all part of a game of makebelieve and in a moment the thin pretence would be thrown off and she would be in his arms but the moments passed the haze cleared and he realized that he was entertaining a fashionable selfpossessed lady wrapped up in artistic interest with no apparent relation to the woman who had flushed with the passion of the sea and the winds on that night of stress and storm his mind flew back from her bodily presence to picture her leaning against his arm and the memoried vision seemed incredible she was unapproachably demure in her blacksilk gown over the shoulders she wore a short blackvelvet cape embroidered in jet with a beaded fringe finished off with a filmy black lace reaching just below the waist when she threw it back matt saw the great puff sleeves of her gown and a turneddown collar that combined with them to give an oldworld feeling at her throat was a soft ruche of black chiffon and from this monotone of black the blond skin of the throat and face rose dazzling crowned by a small pink bonnet of shamrock shape entirely composed of roses with a laceandjet butterfly fluttering over it now and then she pointed out something with a long blackgloved forefinger her left hand held a dainty little book that lookedlike herselfpoetry how far away she seemed standing thus at his side he was in a fever of chills and heats she stopped longest before his unfinished picture of loves fatality he heard her approving his conception of love shackled with vainlonging hand to hand but even as her ravishing lips spoke golden words of praise his vain longing to kiss them admonished him how feebly his symbols expressed the heartsickness he was feeling the longer he heard the music of her lauding voice the more those gray eyes kindled below the pink bonnet in adoration of his genius the more his disgust with the picture grew and when a chance word of hers reminded him that the subject had already been treated in the last academy he determined to destroy his work the moment she was gone though he had always been aware of the little skied picture which had drawn miss regans eccentric attention the last vestiges of his hope of her love died as she discussed loves fatality with apparent unconsciousness that to him at least the picture stood for something personal her aloofness was exacerbating the heats of his fever died only the chill was left he gave her some tea and became gradually aware that she was abnormally loquacious and vivacious he remembered to ask after miss regans health and was told that olive was bright and gay with only rare reactions of pessimism mrs wyndwood wondered dolefully again what she would do when olive was married his heart bolder than his lips beat come to me come to me but she did not seem to catch its appeal though his eyes spoke too in his embarrassment he turned over the pages of the dainty little book she had laid down on the table he started at finding it a new volume of harold lavenders poems and when on the flyleaf he read to eleanor his face twitched noticeably ah that was the book mr lavender wrote about in the letter that primitiva lost she said quickly its just out today i see he calls you eleanor he observed tonelessly yes she responded smiling that is a poetic license besides it is a screen there are so many eleanors that sounded true to his bitter mood there were indeed so many eleanors all in contradiction he kept turning over the leaves in silent jealousy ah that is a very pretty one you have there she said lightly it might suggest a subject to you read it aloud its only ten lines fuming inwardly at the suggestion that the dapper poet of sugarplums and the hero of the nougat whom he mentally classed with roy as an interloper could afford him any inspiration and further incensed by the command to read the fellows verses he gabbled through the little poem which extended over two deckleedged rough creamy pages rosalind reading an old romance i watch her dainty rosebud mouth that trembles with the exquisite and wondrous tide that steals from it of song redolent of the south while oer her april countenance the music of the quaint romance the sweeter for a sense of pain sends sun and shade and lost in dream her sweet eyes softly flash and gleam with golden smiles and diamond rain i hope she read it better than that laughed mrs wyndwood mirthfully well she couldnt make the fourth line scan anyhow he said oh you mean redolent thats another poetic license and rosalind seems to be another he said surlily oh no im not rosalind i havent a dainty rosebud mouth mine is a fullgrown rose at least and her laugh showed the white teeth gleaming against the red lips her arch laughing face so close to his across the little teatable tantalized him intolerably it is a red red rose he whispered hoarsely half rising and bending over as if to survey it beware of the thorn she laughed nervously drawing back involuntarily and to think that but for the coastguard who found primitivas letter she rattled on hastily some other fair lady would have had the honor of the dedication one of the other eleanors perhaps he said sulkily sinking back into his chair poor primitiva she cried in unabated hilariousness and intensified volubility oh shes been such fun you know olive has brought her to london she begged her away from her father to the excessive joy of primitiva who has become her devoted slave the other night olive took her to the theatre with us and would have her in the box she had been wrought up to a wild excitement and when she got inside the theatre and looked round at the festive company she drew a deep breath of rapture she said she liked it very much long before the orchestra struck up olive discovered that primitiva imagined she was already in complete enjoyment of the play and that to sit in the theatre was all in all only one thing marred primitivas pleasure she was looking round furtively for your cousin and at last asked where mr herbert sat not it transpired because of his position as olives fianc but because she had heard us talk of herbert as writing a play and imagined he was an inseparable adjunct of the theatre of course she doesnt know even now that there are more theatres than one when the overture struck up she was surprised and delighted by this unexpected addition to the pleasures of the evening the rising of the curtain was the climax of her astonishment and her transport the action of the piecea melodrama purposely chosen for her behoof by our sportive friend experimenting upon her freshnessseized her from the start and kept her riveted the fall of the first curtain and the arrest of the innocent man for the murder left her weeping bitterly it isnt real you little goose olive said to pacify her isnt it primitiva replied opening her brimming trustful eyes to their widest she gave a little sobbing laugh and i thought they was all alive then she rose to go and was astonished to hear that there was more alas it would have been better had she gone when the heros wife visiting the hero in prison kissed him primitiva inquired if the actor and actress were really married and learning that they were not was too disgusted to sympathize any further with their misfortunes it revolted her concluded mrs wyndwood taking up her teacup with an air of preparing for the resumption of sips that a man who was not a womans husband should kiss her and her face gleamed more tantalizing than ever under the roses of her bonnet his fingers dented the teaspoon they fidgeted with it seemed intolerable that his life should be spoiled by acceptance of the moral standpoint of this simple creature he with his artistic agonies and his complex sorrows and his high imaginings to be squeezed into the same moral moulds as primitiva he refused to see the humor of her the girl had no more interest for him than that irritating roy it was maddening to have eleanor sitting there in cold blood the honorable mrs wyndwood an irreproachable widow in black talking abstractly of kisses then the tense string of expectation snapped the apathy that he felt in the presence of rosina invaded himhe stirred his tea listlessly awaiting the moment of her departure as she talked on loquacious to the end prattling of erlesmith and beethoven and swinburne his apathy quickened into impatience he longed for her to be gone his hidden fingers played a tattoo on the side of his chair she bade him goodbye at last she would not see him again for many months unless he came to paris i always run over to do the salon he answered indifferently when he had seen her stately and stiff to her carriage and his studiodoor had shut him in again he ripped up the canvas with his old sailors knife in a paroxysm of fury his eye caught the silver regatta cup standing proudly upon the piano he felt like dashing it down then it occurred to him how fine and bitter a revenge it would be upon her and humanity at large to fill it with poison and drain it to the dregs but he only threw himself upon a couch in a passion of sobs such as had not shaken him since childhood the great picturesque room which the autumn twilight had draped in dusk was ineffably dreary without her his heart seemed full of dust and tears were a blessed relief in the drought they probably saved him from ending his empty life there and then he rallied and began other pictures but he could do nothing with them he refused commissions for portraits hating the imposition of subject and fearful of exposing his restlessness to a strangers gaze the return of the world to town renewed social solicitations but he felt he was wearing his heart on his sleeve and declined to parade it through drawingrooms despite this gain of time the weeks passed without any definite product he was searching but he could not find one day he would sit down and fix in charcoal some rough suggestions for a greater symbolic picture than that which he had destroyed but the next day he would be working up his recollections of devonshire nightscenery trying by a series of tentative touches on a toned canvas to evolve the romantic mystery of those illumined villages niched in the cliffs or of the moon making a lovely rippling path across the dark lonely sea as eleanor had made across his life while a day or so after he would discard these thinly painted shadowy nightpieces and painting straight from the shoulder impasto his canvas with brutal blobs of paint that at a distance merged into the living flow of red sunlit water and always this rankling gnawing pain of unsatisfied and unspoken desire no man could work with that at his breast and her rare letters did not allay it though they spoke no word of love but were full of enthusiasm for the free student life in paris the glorious camaraderie the fun of dining occasionally for a few centimes in tiny crmeries and going to the peoples theatre off the boulevard montparnasse where they gave a bonus of cerises leau de vie between the pieces oh if she had only been younger less staled by life if she could only begin over again if she only had the energy of olive who started work at the academy at the preternatural hour of eight am but she had lost the faculty of beginnings she feared and she made but poor progress in sculpture that was the undercurrent of these gay letters the characteristic note of despondency rosina held out no hand of reconciliation his only contact with her was through billy who paid him one visit to escort aunt clara over the studio his wife had it transpired held forth so copiously and continuously upon its glories that the poor creature had plucked up courage to ask to see it and rosina who had evidently concealed the breach with her famous husband had besought billy to convoy her and so one day these two routed out the sick lion from the recesses of his den the appearance of miss clara coble was as much a shock as a surprise to matthew strang in the nine years or so since she had assisted at his weddingan unimportant but not disagreeable personage tall and fullblooded as her brother she had decayed lamentably she was now an ungainly old maid stooping and holloweyed with crows feet and sharpened features she had a nervous twitch of the eyelids her head drooped oddly and her conversation was at times inconsecutive to the verge of fatuity from the day of her birth to the day of his death coble had thought of her as his little sister and he never realized the tragedy of her spinsterhood of her starved nature though under his very eye she had peaked and pined in body and soul but it leaped to the painters eye at the first sight of her and her image remained in his brain infinitely pathetic the ugliness that in earlier days would have averted his eyes in artistic disgust drew him now in human pity he grew tenderer to rosina at the thought that she was harboring this wreck of femininity it rejoiced him to think how much aunt clara was enjoying this visit to his grandeurs he listened with pleased tolerance to her artless babblein her best days she had always had something of her brothers big simplicityas she told tale after tale out of school repeating the colossal things her poor brother had said about his soninlaws genius and wealth recounting how coble had thus become the indirect hero of the temperance bar and unconsciously revealingwhat was more surprising to the painterthe pride with which rosina had always written home and still spoke to her aunt about her husband and his fashionable friends and successes and poor miss coble expanded in the atmosphere of the great man which she had never hoped to breathe her cadaverous cheek took a flush she held her head straighter on her shoulders he felt that after all it was worth while being famous if he could give such pleasure to simple souls by his mere proximity the fame he had sold his body and soul for was a joyless possession happy for him if it could yet give joy to others billy told him that ruth hailey was in paris at the hotel windsor with mrs verder preparatory to the long antipodean tour and suggested that he might call upon her when he went over to see the salon if she was still there matthew wrote down the address but said he didnt think he should go over that year billy looked disappointed he had been about to suggest accompanying his brother life at camden town he intimated fretfully had resumed its deadalive routine and he glanced towards miss coble as if to imply that her advent had not brightened the domestic table when the visitors left matthew put them into a cab and drove with them a little way to purchase presents for the children there was a doll for clara and a box of animals for davie to rosina he did not venture to send even a message at a word from her he would have gone to her but he had no stomach to cope with her tantrums this new reminder of home left him more depressed than before it was impossible to concentrate himself upon his work even in the presence of models they were an unprofitable expense and he dismissed them and brooded over the ruins of his life without eleanor art was impossible he felt true art he could not produce without her inspiration and false art was falseness to her and a vile slavery insomnia dogged his nights and when he slept it was but to suffer under harassing dreams fantastically compounded of his early struggles these dreams never touched his later life many of them dealt oppressively with the birdshop and he had often to clean endless shades with chamois leather smashing one after the other under the rebuking but agonizingly unintelligible pop pop pop of ole hey though he felt sure tommy the young micmac errandboy had cracked them beforehand and what added to the sleepers agony was that these breakages would have to be made good to the deacon from his scanty wage or worse he would be discharged and unable to send the monthly subsidy to cobequid village the anguish and anxiety were quite as harassing as though the troubles were real he made one desperate excursion into societyit was the delightful dinnerparty of a gifted fellowartist whose cultured and beautiful wife had always seemed to him the ideal hostess and a pretty and guileless girl full of enthusiasm for art and nature and the life that was opening out before her fell to his escorting arm she was visibly overpowered by her luck and charmingly deferential at first his responsive smile was bitter but his mood lightened under her engaging freshness and the champagne he imbibed recklessly but the next mornings reaction aggravated by the headache of indigestion plunged him into more tenebrous glooms but for the unkindly fates he might have sat with such a wife host and hostess of such a gathering he pictured eleanor receiving his guests and in his factitious happiness he gathered the poor and the despised to his hearth the images of suicide resurged he saw it on the billssuicide of a popular painter why not the position was hopeless were it not best to throw it up how the world would stare no one would understand the reason rosina would still remain unknown irrelevant to the situation and his eyes filled with tears in the bitter luxury of woe but he did not commit suicide and all that the world or that minute portion of it which talks art wondered at was why matthew strang was unrepresented when the academy opened in may it leaked out that he had been ill and there were sympathetic paragraphs which were not altogether misinformed for these sleepless or dreamtortured nights had brought on nervous prostration and acute headaches that ancient bloodpoisoning too had left its traces in his system and when he was worried and overwrought his body had to pay again the penalty of unforgiven physical error again as in those faroff days he thought of a seavoyage to his native village it dwindled down to crossing the channel as the opening of the salon drew nearer and nearer he felt more and more strongly that he must not miss the exhibition it was part of a painters education there was no need to see eleanor wyndwood by remaining on the fashionable side of the river the chances were he would not even come across her casually in the few days of his stay no there was nothing to apprehend and besides it began to be increasingly borne in upon him that it was his duty to look up ruth hailey she had called upon him at camden town and etiquette demanded that he should return the call what had she and rosina talked about he wondered dully if he did not go soon she might be off to australia and the opportunity of seeing his ancient playmate would probably recur nevermore and so a bright may morning saw him arrive in the capital of art breakfast hastily at the grand hotel anddrive straight to the latin quarter other climes other thoughts and the gayety of the boulevards with their green trees and manycolored kiosks had begun to steal into his spirit and his gloomy apprehension of danger to dissipate in the crisp sunny air why should he not see eleanor wyndwood and then he discovered that he did not know her address that she wrote from the english ladies art club he hunted out the place but the concierge told him she was not there and gave him the address of the academy most of the ladies attended but this was the hour of djeuner and monsieur would probably not find them there till the afternoon he grew downcast again and dismissing the cab he sauntered on foot towards the academy trying to kill time he dropped into a tiny restaurant close by to get a cup of coffee it was decorated by studies from the nude evidently accepted in payment for dinners and the ceiling had a central decoration that reminded him of his own crude workmanship in the sittingroom of that hotel in new brunswick he sat down at a little table facing the only lady customer a dashing frenchwoman the warm coloring of whose handsome models face showed between a great blackplumed hat and a lightblue bow and who paused between her spoonfuls of applestew to chant joyously coucou coucou fal la la la la a decadent poet with a leonine name sipped absinthe a spectacled dane held forth intermittently on the bad faith of england towards denmark at the commencement of the century a scotch painter discoursed on flyfishing and exhibited a box of troutflies and one or another paused from time to time to hum coucou coucou fal la la la la in sympathy with the gay refrain hens fluttered and clucked about the two sunlit tables and a goat wandered around willing to eat matthew strang fed the hens and was taken by the humors of the quarter into which he had scarcely penetrated before knowing mainly the other side of the water perceiving him looking at her pictures the stout smiling proprietress whose homely face minus her characteristic smile flared in paint on a wall protruding from a scarletstriped bodice asked him in very loud tones if he would like to see her collection and straightway haled him upstairs to her salon which was hung thickly with meritorious pictures upon whose beauties she held a running comment astonishing matthew by the intelligence of her criticisms this represents a hawthorn monsieur which blossoms in the spring this was done by a dane who is dead the king of denmark offered him a commission but he would not work for him because he was a revolutionaryin painting only you understand an impressionist that is a copy of the one in the luxembourg i paid two hundred francs to have it made because i love the original so oh yes it is a very good copy my landlord offered me four hundred for it but i prefer to live in a little apartment surrounded by my pictures as you say i am an amateur of pictures there are more here in my bedroom and she ushered him in apologizing for the bed not being made then she told him her history she was a widow with an only son who was beau garon ah she was beautiful herself when she had twenty years her son was to be an artist matthew strang feelingly hoped the boy would become a great artist inwardly he wondered wistfully why he himself had not been blessed with an artloving mother and then in a curious flash of retrospective insight he recognized for the first time the essential artistic elements in his mothers character stifled by a narrow creedher craving for the life of gay cities her pagan anger at abner preeps bowlegs what a pity she had not been born in this freer artistic atmosphere which indeed her ancestors must have breathed though their blood had been crossed with german and scotch as if to produce his own contradictory temperament in london he thought artistic connoisseurship was the last thing one would look for in small shopkeepers in a softer mood he repaired to the academy which was entered through a pair of large folding doors that gave upon a stone corridor he passed through this passage and came out under a sloping porch with broken trelliswork at one side and an untidy tree at the top of a flight of stone steps that descended thence he was stopped by a block of young american fellows in soft felt hats who motioned him to stand still and to his astonishment and somewhat melancholy amusement he found himself part of a group about to be photographed by a pretty young lady student in the sunny dusty courtyard below the group she had posed stretched all down the steps and consisted mainly of modelsmale and female there were italian women dusky and smiling some bareheaded some hooded and a few pressing infantsliteral olivebranchesto their bosoms there was an italian girl of fourteen with a mustache who was a flare of color in her green velvet apron and gorgeous trailing headdress there were frenchwomen with coquettish straw hats and a child in a tam o shanter there was a corsican in a slouchhat with coalblack hair and a velvet jacket to match and a little spanish boy in a white hat thrown in as by way of artistic contrast with all this efflorescence of youth was a doddering pathetic old man with a spreading gray beard and flowing gray locks and there were young lady students of divers nationalitiespolish greek dutch and americancuriously interspersed in the motley group which stretched right down the stone steps between the stone balustrades that terminated in stone urns spouting disorderly twigs behind the pretty photographer were the terracotta walls of the sculpture atelier which high beyond her head were replaced by long greenglazed windows into which a pink lilacbush tiptoeing tried to peep around her were stools dumbbells damaged busts a headless terracotta angel with gaping trunk and iron stump nursing a squashfaced cherub and dismantled packingcases swarming with sportive black kittens and facing her a great blackened stone head of medusa stared from a redbrick pedestal awful with spiders webs across the mouth and athwart the hollow orbits and in the snaky hair covered with green moss and towering over her head and dominating the courtyard stood a colossal classical statue tarnished and mutilated representing a huge helmeted hero brokennosed and bleared sustaining a heroine as armless but not so beautiful as the venus de milo doing a backward fall but the sun shone on the dusty litter and the mess and the lumber and the lilacbush blossomed beautifully and over all was the joy of youth and art and the gayety of the spring matthew strang felt an ancient thrill pass through his sluggish veins to be young and to paintwhat happiness his eyes moistened in sympathy with the scene the models were redolent of artthe very children breathed art the babes sucked it in art was a republic and everybody was equal in itthe doughtiest professor and the meanest model the richest amateur and the penurious youth starving himself to be there there was nothing in the world but artit was the essence of existence there were people who lived for other things but they did not count oh the free brave life he was glad to be photographed as part and parcel of all this fresh aspiration it revivified him he had a superstitious sense that it was symbolic the group scattered dismissed by the merci of the pretty photographer and matthew descending the steps asked her if mrs wyndwood worked in her atelier she did not know but she guessed from his description it must be the aristocraticlooking lady who had dropped in once or twice in miss regans company miss regan came regularly every morning at eight oclock but not at all in the afternoon when she worked at home miss regans own studio was in an impasse about ten minutes away probably her friend lived with her heartily thanking his informant he betook himself thither he found the impasse in a prosaic grimy street amid which the charming if battered bassrelief of venus with cupids over its entrance struck an unexpected note of poetry which was intensified by the little ionic portico with classic bronze figures between its pillars that faced him as he passed through the corridor leafy trees and trellised plants added rusticity to the poetry of the sunny silent deserted courtyard so curiously sequestered amid the surrounding squalor the windows of many studios gave upon it and the backs of canvases showed from the glass annexes for plein air study but as he passed under the pretty natural porch of embowering foliage that led to the door of the studio he sought his heart beat as nervously at the thought of again facing the hon mrs wyndwood as when in his young days he had first saluted the magnificent uncle whose name he bore he had an inward shrinking was it wise to expose himself to the perturbation of another interview with this cold stately creature the image of whom passing graciously to her carriage was still vivid to him but he could not go back now he knocked at the door eleanor opened the doora radiant adorable apparition in a big white claysmeared blouse with a huge serviceable pocket he had never imagined her thus he was as taken aback by her appearance as she by his presence he stared at her in silence as she stood there under the overarching greenery with gold flecks of sunlight on her hair but both recovered themselves in a moment the sight of her in this homely artistic costume knocked her off the pedestal of fashion and propriety on which his mental vision had posed her she became part of that brave young democracy of art he had just left and there was a charming camaraderie in the gay laugh with which withdrawing her long white hands beyond reach of his proffered glove and exhibiting them piquantly claycovered she cried cant shake the seriousness of the imagined meeting vanished in a twinkling he looked at her dancing eyes the sweet red mouth smiling with a gleam of lustrous teeth he had an audacious inspiration well then theres nothing for it but he said smiling back and finished the sentence by kissing her instantly her eyelids drooped halfclosing her lips responded passionately to his they were withdrawn in a moment before he could realize what he had done or the wonderful transformation in their relations in the open air she cried horrified and ran within he followed her closing the door his heart beat tumultuously now nothing could undo that moment a wilderness of talk could not have advanced matters so far through the tall glass roof of the airy studio the sun streamed in rays of dusty gold dappling the imaginative clay models in their wet wrappings the busts fountains serpents rockwork witches that variegated the shelves and lent an air of fantasy and poetry extruding the tedious commonplace of plebeian existence and harmonizing with the joyous aloofness of the scene in the courtyard its sense of existence in and for itself by souls attuned to art and dedicate to loveliness mrs wyndwood stood saucily beautiful leaning against a shelf with one hand in the pocket of her blouse and rubbing the clay of the other against the sides of what looked like a tin bakingdish filled with plasterpie how harmonious was that tilt to her nose he had never noticed before how delightfully it turned up she smiled roguishly imprudent creature suppose olive had been in the great moment was taken in a livelier key than he had ever dreamed but you were out he said trying to respond to her lightness though he trembled in every limb he made a movement towards her she shrank back against the shelf dont she cried gayly youll spoil your gloves he dabbled them magnificently in a heap of plaster of paris and advanced nearer now youll spoil my blouse she cried moving hastily away to dip her hands in a bowl of water he tore off the gloves and threw them on the floor is that a challenge she laughed drying her hands but the laughter died in a gurgle he had stopped her breath she did not struggle but lay in his arms silent like a tired lovely childat rest at last her happy face pressed to his oh my dear she murmured cooingly and all those months you never kissed me once i did not dare he answered with a pang of remorse you gave me no hint that youthat you cared for me a beautiful blush blossomed and faded on her face but you should have understood i needed the touch and her face nestled closer against his even now it seemed dreamlike that this marvellous happiness should be his that this fastidious complex creature of fashionable london whom he had dared to love should be pillowing her perfumed head on the shoulder of the man who in his laborious and wretched youth had wheeled a birdstuffers barrow through whitechapel his life lay behind him like a steep arduous hill rising to this celestial cloudland if i had only known he said brokenly oh how i loved you that night of the storm and how i adored you she confessed deliciously you were so brave so manly that day you saved olives life you saved her for me and for herbert oh how noble we none of us thanked you it was all laughter and badinage but you were my hero my true great strong simple man and her lips sought his humbly her eyes swimming in tears let me kiss you now for your brave deed ah how i was afraid when herbert looking through his glass cried out that something had happened to olive that you had swum back for her i felt my life growing dark suppose i had lost you both and her mobile face grew tragic at the thought he held her tighter eleanor it is so good to be with you he articulated in a hoarse whisper that was half a sob her tragic features lightened to a winsome reproachful smile and when i came to your studio matthew you gave me tea if i had only known if i had only dared you must dare with a woman her arms had been resting on his shouldersshe threw them around his neck oh my masternow and ever conscience slipped into paradise he unwound her arms you forget mysecret she moved her chin bewitchingly upward you have sealed my lips he kissed them again and you can love me despite that i am not worthy of such a sacrifice her bosom heaved beneath the blouse her eyes kindled with the old spiritual fire her voice rang passionately you are worthy life has been too cruel to youyou need a womans heart to cherish you you shall not be starved of the sunshine you shall work in happiness ah that is what i have learned here in this happy liberal air art is the child of joyful laborit is the sunshine of life you are sad miserable and it harrows my heart oh if i can bring joy and peace to the soul of a man like you if i can indeed inspire your art my wretched life will not have been wasted you have told me that i could tell it me again you and you only can bring me joy and peace she caressed his hair with a tender protective hand my matthew she murmured and you eleanor he faltered tremulously i shall not make you unhappy i shall be happier than i have ever been and her arms stole round him again in simple trust ah i was forgetting life owes you happiness too if i dared to think i could bring you forgetfulness of the past she shuddered her arms unlaced themselves of their own accord she dropped into a chair before the table and laid them across the mouldingdish and buried her head in her hands he stood by helpless torn by emotions waiting till the flood of bitter memories should have spent itself watching her shoulders quivering and the sunlight lying on her hair like a consecration oh douglas she was moaning did i do you wrong did i do you wrong but i meant the best i always meant the best god knows and you cannot chide me now you are dead and cold and it is all so long ago he shivered nervously truly women were incomprehensible he thought no man could follow the leaps and turns of their emotions they were a higher more ethereal order of being but he reverenced her for her loyalty to the unworthy dead her punctilious selftorture even while he envied the man who had been privileged to call her wife he touched her hair reverentlythere where the sunshine rested dont cry dear eleanor a great burst of sobbing shook her oh life is so difficult he bent down beside her ineffably pitiful we are going to make it easier for one another he said gently his hair touched hers she turned her tearflecked face and their lips met we are going to begin over again he murmured she stifled her sobs like a soothed child and sprang up with a smile struggling through rainclouds yes with you i can begin over again master and she looked into his face with her nave beseeching trustfulness this is a new life already he said touching her blouse she gave a laugh of childish joy yes yes this is a new lifethe past is deadthis is my neophytes robe ah it changes one this paris does it not i am an artist and you are my master it is you who have awakened me to art oh i knew this would happen that wonderful old woman shes a fortuneteller in bethnal greenthe duchess of portsdown gave me her addressand after you were so cold to me when i came to your studio in london i went to see her such a queer wrinkled hag and such a dingy wretched room up such a dirty flight of stairsoh i was afraid but she was marvellous she knew i was a widowthat i had been married unhappilythat i was a fashionable ladythough i went in my oldest clothes and hid my rings in my purse for fear of their being stolen oh bytheway where have i put them he found them and she slipped them on and she said i should love again and be loved you should have seen her wicked old eyes as she spoke of lovethey were like live coals and then she predicted that i should marry again and lead a long and happy life with a dark man distinguished and rich who should inspire me to a new faith isnt it marvellous she took his hand and smoothed the wrist caressingly it is you who have inspired me to a new faith he answered tremulously it is you who have awakened me to art do you know what happened to me this morning when i went to seek you out i too was reborn he told her the auspicious incidenthow he had been photographed as part of the fresh young artlife she clapped her jewelled hands it is providentialforeordained we are to be happy happy he shivered with sudden foreboding another prophetess declared i was never to be happy he said sadly to thirst and to thirst and never to quench my thirst oh that is all superstitious nonsense she cried vehemently you must be happy you shall be happy the world must not lose your art i will save it her face was glorified but the cost to yourself he faltered i will pay the price you love me for me to ruin your lifethat would be sin she drew his head to her bosom and smoothed back the curly hair from his forehead my dear my dear she murmured he gulped back the lump in his throat no this is not sin you have redeemed me i never felt so at peace with all things he said in low religious tones oh we will shame the worldwe will live high and true our happiness shall radiate to all that sorrows and suffers our home shall be the home of art it shall stand open to all the young artists striving faithfully in povertyit shall be a centre of blessing suffering has made me morose now i feel at one with my kind longing to do my truest work oh god bless you my dear a startled look of alarm had come into her face she loosed her embrace of him but matt we cannot have a home he had a chill of apprehension which even the sweetness of that first clipping of his name could not counteract but we love each other she waved her hands agitatedly the world would spurn me we will spurn the world oh but you are not thinking who would come to the house how is it to be a centre of blessing we will win the worlds respect what you and i are we not strong enough you with your noble pasti who come from nothing and have won you you talk like a dreamer a poet and i love you for it but you do not know the worldhow it ignores the realities of things oh i know the canting hypocrisy that puts its faith in shows and honors loveless marriage i will teach it to respect a home of love and the work that is its fruit you are right happiness is the mother of art oh how i shall work now my dear you may overtop raphael you will never be a royal academician what has my private life to do with art nothing with art but everything with english art you will lose your ra i shall gain you she shook her head why not gain both ah but you say it is impossible i do not say so what need is there to wear our hearts upon our sleeves she touched his sleeve now insinuating caressing fingers darling dont you see how hard it would be for me to beari am not a man the worst of the scorn would be for me society is very hard upon those who will not be unconventional in secret i have not your courage and strength you will not shame me he weakened oh i am thoughtless he said and stood miserable unconscious of the caressing fingers then his brow lightened nobody knows im married if we came back and set up house together people would think we had been married abroad she put her hands to her face with a desperate gesture oh but i could not bear olive to know his heart leaped has herbert told her im married no she doesnt know he is a fine fellow but she would be sure to learn it one dayit would leak out then she would keep the secret she shook her head you dont know olive she said from between her palms she is hard on women i would have sat to you ages ago only i was afraid of her sneers i wouldnt have her know for worlds i used to think her sexless but now that she is to be married she will be more conventional than ever he tossed back his hair impatiently then we must dispense with olive for a long time she did not reply he thought his harshness towards her friend had set her crying again he gently forced her hands from her face it was flushed and painstricken forgive me i have hurt you he said in contrition no you do not understand and olive has been so good to me she takes charge of all my affairs she hesitated i dont even know what my income is orwith a pathetic engaging smilewhether i have an income at all and im afraid i spend a great deal he straightened his shoulders i am very glad of that i will work for you i can wring gold from the world rapid calculations flashed through his mindalready he regretted his last years inactivity the destruction of his picture she was blushing adorably no i could not take anything from you if we lived apart no no not from me oh eleanor then we must make our home together but dont i tell you that is impossible she said almost pettishly on the brink of tears the world would get to know the truth there is that ruth hailey you spoke of who knows your brother and who through her connection with linda verder gets brought into contact with all sorts of people and your wife would hear of it too unscrupulous persons would egg her on to move there would be blackmailing everything sordid and horrible she shuddered violently oh you do not know the worldyou have lived with your eyes shut fixed on inward visions he opened them now startled to find himself lectured for want of worldliness by this ethereal creature she dissipated his uneasy bewilderment by a swift transition her face dimpled itself with reassuring smiles she pulled the little curly lock at his forehead with a fascinating tug dont be such a hotheaded quixote dear there is time enough to plan out the future circumstances may change her face saddened the poor creature may be taken and your idea may seem more plausible when i have got used to ityou come with a rush and a crashlike those waves that night she smiled wistfully and i am only a woman and timid cant you see i have been frightened to death all this last halfhour frightened of me no with a pathetic smile frightened of olive twenty times i thought i caught her footsteps what if she does come she wont be surprised to see me here no but i have a plan it will be safest if she doesnt know youre in paris at all you must leave me at once his heart sank but when do i see you next sunday evening a whole week the sunlight seemed gone on sunday morning olive goes to brussels for a few daysshes only waiting to finish that statuette of fate isnt it weird all those things there are olives handiwork how clever she is i only do the menial work of pouring in the plaster it saves money because yes yes he interrupted impatiently and on sunday evening you will call for me heresay about sevenyou will take me to dinner somewhere quiet in this great free paris she made a great circle with her arms as if enjoying the elbowroom and then she smiled intoxicatingly then we can talk over the future her eyes looked heavenly promise he caught her in his arms this time she struggled away no no she may be back at any moment i hear footsteps you must go she pushed him towards the door maynt i write no olive would see the letter the footsteps passed by he looked back in reluctant farewell as he fumbled at the doorhandle she was close behind him she opened her arms and his head was on her breast again oh my dear my dear she murmured it is hard to wait then she pushed him outside her face grown spiritual again in its anxiety and she slammed the door and he reeled like a drunken man her last look haunted himsoulful alluring intoxicating he was almost sobbing with happiness heaven had been kind to him at last the balmy air of the courtyard fanned his brow he walked on aimlessly in a beatific dream past the beautiful ionic portico through the corridor into the street no longer grimy and so on to the boulevards how happy the world was how the sunshine streamed with its dancing motes how gay the kiosks with their dainty posters and the piquant designs of great caricaturists laughing from the front pages of the illustrated journals how lighthearted those bourgeois drinking red wine at the al fresco tables what a jolly bulbousnosed old cabman that was who hailed him not knowing he had quicksilver in his veins and must needs give his limbs to lively motion he sauntered on at random buoyant treading on sunbeams a song at his heart breathing in the sense of the spacious airy city that sparkled in the spring sunshine mother of nimble spirits he crossed the river glittering in a long sweep with notre dame rising on its island in picturesque antiquity the bookstalls on the quays thrilled him with a remembrance of the joys of reading he strode on humming a merry tune the bustle of traffic was a musical accompaniment to it he stopped at a great leafy square alive with pedestrians to watch the limpid water leaping from a beautiful fountain around him were the seductive programmes of theatres eloquent of artistic acting of fine comedy of poetic tragedy he strolled along absorbing noble buildings and churches and splendid public monuments how fair life was how marvellously compacted gladness was at the heart of all things the city passed into his soul as never before its radiant message of elegance proportion style sanity unity lucidity exquisite sensibility to the material balanced by an sthetic delight in ideas and the spirit of gayety all over henceforth thanks to eleanor he would be of it following art for the joy of art out of the happiness of the soul sunclear without stagnant vapors of discontent those fits of spleen bred of foggy uncouth london he would be fixed at last swinging steadily on a pivot of happiness a lover of life and a praiser thereof all its sweetness had been diverted from himit had passed to others now at last he would be selfcentred he rambled on he crossed the pont passy and saw the old city rising quaint and steep in wooded terraces oh love and life oh life and love why had people besmirched the creation with soilures of cynicism plaguing the air with pessimistic laments graceless grunts of swine nosing garbage what good times he had had himself he who had won fame and gold while still young and how ungraciously he had accepted these gifts of the gods mewling and whining like a sulky child surely he deserved that hell allotted in dante for those who had wilfully lived in sadness the gracious romance of lifethat was what his art should henceforth interpret he began to dream beautiful masterpieces and they reminded him that he had come to see the salon he retraced his steps towards the champs elyses watching the endless procession of elegant equipages rolling steadily to and from the bois with their panorama of luxurious women he entered the salon the pictures delighted him the crowd enraptured him a young girls face stirred him to a mood of paternal benediction he met edward cornpepper ara there and felt the little man was his dearest friend cornpepper introduced him to his newlyacquired wife who said the exhibition was indecent you are right my dear there isnt a decent picture here cornpepper chuckled grimacing to adjust his monocle and feeling his round beard ichabod the glory is departed from paris the only chaps who can paint nowadays are the neoteutonic school the frenchmen are played outthey have even lost their taste they bought a picture of mine last year you remember i palmed off the rottenest thing id ever done on em its in the luxembourgyou go and see it old man and you tell me if im not right now mind you do ta ta old fellow sorry youre not in the academy this yearbut its a good advertisement for you i think i shall be ill myself next year but we mustnt talk shop goodbye old man oh bytheway i hear your cousins engaged to an heiress its true is it lucky beggar that herbert better than painting eh ha ha ha but i knew hed never do anything didnt he win the gold medal eh ho ho ho well au revoir dont forget the luxembourg you dont want to wait till im dead and in the louvre what thanks for a pleasant chat and wish you better matthew shook his hand for the third time with unabated affection what a clever fellow cornpepper was and what a pretty wife he had got he went to his hotel to dine the courtyard was gay with lounging lolling visitors the fountain in the centre leaped and sparkled with changing colors like an effervescence of the city far into the night he sat out on the balcony of his giltskied manymirrored bedroom gazing at the beautiful boulevards stretching serenely away in the moonlight between their gigantic edifices chapter ix ruth hailey how he lived through the rest of the week he never definitely remembered he would have willingly given the days away but as they had to be filled up somehow they left confused recollections of theatres and ballets of rencontres with random acquaintances of riding on tiny tramcars to see the zoological garden in the bois de boulogne of wandering in a ragfair of reading modern french poetry of visiting the ateliers of french painters whom he knew and sympathizing with their grumbles against the institute and the distribution of decorations while wondering inwardly why these overgrown schoolboys languished and died for lack of a bit of ribbon what could a man want in life but to paint and to love state recognition bah the artist was always an anarchist he stood alone selfcentred he hobnobbed with students too in his new sympathy with youth and art anda distinguished visitorwas taken through the great ateliers with their rainbowcolored dados of palettescrapings and the announcements in every european language that newcomers must pay for drinks he gladly accepted a ticket for a students ball on the saturday night it had been postponed for a few weeks through the death of a beloved professor he had heard much of these balls but had never seen one and he counted upon it to while away that last intolerable night between him and his happiness several times during the week he had thought of going to see ruth hailey in accordance with the duty that on the other side of the channel had seemed so pressing but he shrank instinctively from the raking up of memories of the old unhappy days at this joyous crisis he was not in the mood for extraneous emotion nevertheless on the saturday afternoon partly for want of anything better to do partly to keep up to himself the pretence that she was at least one of the motives that brought him to paris and partly to ascertain if she had spoken to people in england about his wife he set out to pay the longprojected visit he would feel how the ground lay discover if she had innocently betrayed him to anybody who might touch mrs wyndwoods circlewhich might be awkward if in a possible compromise eleanor should ever decide to live with him in ostensible marriage he had a dim unformed idea of appealing to ruth for silence but he did not really meditate invoking her sympathies she was on the eve of departing for the antipodeswas perhaps already gone he found her hotelit was in the rue de rivoli a waiter took up his name and forthwith brought back word that mademoiselle would see monsieur strang his heart was throbbing curiously as he mounted the stairs and stood outside her door the quick irregular clack clack of a typewriter responded like an echo he was ushered into a large plainlyfurnished sittingroom his first vision was of a tall comely lady in a grayish gown writing at a table opposite the door but this was effaced by the slimmer figure of a younger woman approaching from the right with a smile of welcome and an extended hand a moment later her smile had faded and her hand was on her heart soothing its flutter he was shaken to his depths behind all the bodily changes he saw the little girlfriend of his childhood and indeed the purity of her limpid truthful gaze was undimmed ruth he cried in alarm moving forward as if to sustain her she drew herself up rigid and frozen then her face relaxed suffused by a wan smile and a returning flood of carmine she held out her hand with a nervous laugh how are you mr strang i thought it was billy and to see you instead startled me as he took the little hand and looked into her face maturer than its years though it had not lost its olden charm especially in the complexion which was marvellously pure and soft registering every slightest change of thought and feeling in dainty flickers of rose across its delicate fairness his soul was invaded by a rush of tender memories incongruously jostling in his brain the thrills and raptures of boyhood the joys of coasting down the slopes and snaring rabbits and shooting partridges the glow of skating the delicious taste of the homemade cakes the songs and hymns of childhood the firelight casting shadows on the dusky walls while his mother read the bible the drone of the fustycoated preacher in the little wooden meetinghouse the thwacking of the dancers feet in the barn the odors of hay and the lowing of cattle the gleam of the yellowtipped mullein by the wayside and the smell of the wild flowers in the woods the note of the whippoorwill in the forest at twilight the long cranes floating over the summer marshes the buzz of fresh young voices in mctavits schoolroom all these came backdear and desirable steeped in tears softened by distance to a pensive beauty like bawling choruses heard from afar across still water inextricably interwoven with all the pieties of childhood the simple sense of god and truth and honor and righteousness he stood holding her hand oblivious of the present in a whirling chaos of ancient images that melted his soul to childish tenderness and brought back to it the childs clear unquestioning perception of spiritual ideas which had grown shadowy in the atmosphere of salons and studios and fashionable churches that stereoscopic vision of the saint and the child which sees the spiritual solid but ruth disengaged her fingers at last blushing under the kindly smile of the comely lady this is mr matthew strang linda she said mr strang let me introduce you to mrs verder he bowed oh i have heard of linda verder he said smiling and i have heard more of matthew strang she replied beamingly that is scarcely possible he murmured she laughed with a birdlike trill oh i wasnt alluding merely to your public career though our sweet ruth has gotten a whole album full of newspapercuttings about that but it is of you yourself and your childhood that i have heard so much so you see i have the advantage of you but you will excuse me i know i have to go out you neednt bother about those letters dear were nearly through with them and with an affectionate nod to ruth and a beneficent smile to matthew she left the room he was reddening he was beginning to feel uncomfortable under mrs verders smiles which in their insinuation of old sweetheartship made it certain that ruth had never mentioned his marriage to her friend even to hear that the forgotten ruth had been following his career all those years gave him an odd pathetic shiver she and billyand heaven knew what otherswere sunning themselves in the mere reflected rays of that fame which had left him cold she stood away from him shy and equally embarrassed the blood ebbing and flowing in the pure soft cheek wont you sit down she said at last oh thank you he replied and took a distant chair she sat down behind her typewriter facing him there was a silence she was the first to break it i was so sorry to read you were ill oh it was nothing he murmured i am so pleased we hadnt leftwe are sailing next tuesday it is so good of you to come and see me with the many claims that you must have on your time it is a pleasure to be reminded of old times i was sorry i missed you the time you called at my house he said awkwardly i was very sorry too but you know i work at my studio he explained trying not to flush there is no room at home yes i know but i didnt care to call there and interrupt your work billy showed me the little room where you used to work in the olden days i thought it real nice of you to turn it into a study for him and to take care of him as you are doing he sent me a story of his no it wasnt very good poor fellow she added seeing the question in his face rather too full of passionate lovemaking not published noin manuscript i returned it to him typewritten he was enraptured he said it was like seeing himself in print ah we are not so used to the typewriter as you americans it is coming in fast though even into your slow old country if you consider it yours she added slyly i am delighted to see how many offices the newfangled machine has crept into in two years it will be in every business office why delighted have you or mrs verder shares in the patent no no she said gently dont you see it is a new occupation for women he smiled ah i remember thats your hobby oh not hobby mr strang not hobby it is my lifework but i cant expect you to sympathize with these sordid practical things she said smiling your life is devoted to the gospel of the beautiful oh but i do sympathize he cried remorsefully i think it is very fine of you she shook her head her smile fading you dontyou cant you are outside the circle of the material worries of the poor or what is worse the genteel and nobody but a woman can know the tragic pettiness of the lifestruggle for single girlsthe stifled aspirations the abortive longings the tears in the night christ would have understood but he was not a man he saw the blur of emotion veil her eyes ere she turned her head hastily away he felt his own sight growing dim an understratum of his consciousness admired the flow of her language and divined platform experiences he had never before thought of her as clever she recovered herself in a moment and resumed playfully no if you were a blackandwhite artist you would have sketched mrs verder with corkscrew ringlets and crying for trousers we do want the franchise and the right to dress as we please but these are only incidental aspects of the movement for the independence of women though they lend themselves most readily to caricature the woman of the future is simply the working woman all we really want is to make girls economically independent of marriage able to choose their mates from love instead of selling themselves for a home he could not meet her frank eyes he was suddenly reminded of his own marriage what would this stainless soul think of him if she knew he had sold himself orworseif she knew why he had come to her this afternoon he murmured surveying the carpet that he knew life was hard for girls but that he hoped she at least had not been unhappy i oh ive been as happy as the next girl though ive had my trials she said cheerily between smiles and tears but i am grateful to god for them else i should never have learned to sympathize as i do and i should not have served the master my life might have been wasted in mere happiness mere happiness the phrase went through him like a sword but you had no need to work for a living he said dubiously indeed i had i had nothing you had a father of a kind but i quarrelled with him you heard that of course he had heard of it of course but her affairs had made trivial dints upon his consciousness why did you quarrel with him he asked her face became a crimson mask she lowered her head ohi beg your pardon he stammered in distress of course i had no right to ask she was silent her fingers nervously picking out letters on the typewriter then her eyes met his unflinchingly again no in a way you have a right to ask she said uneasily i dont see why i shouldnt tell youits so long ago you know i became the deacons bookkeeper he nodded wondering he made me keep all his accounts i learned all about his affairs well one day looking over the books i made a discovery yes she hesitated her face was still fiery the image of the mumbling quidchewing deacon with the roundabout methods of arriving at his point rose vivid to his memory he remembered his childish strain to understand ole heys good advice pop pop pop it was like the clack clack clack of the typewriter under ruths nervous unconscious fingers but what was this she was saying to the accompaniment of the erratic automatic music i discovered that he was cheating you or rather your sister and abner preep that he had always bamboozled your father that the mortgage was more than paid off long before aside from the work he had gotten out of your brothers and sisters she paused then hastened on with a lighter tone so of course being a foolish hotheaded girl i wouldnt stay any longer in his house unless he repaid you and equally of course he refused knowing i wouldnt make a scandal and so i went off to the only relative i had in the worldmy mothers sister in portland maine she was too poor to give me more than food and shelter but my knowledge of bookkeeping soon got me a place in a store and ever since i have earned my own bread heaven be thanked she was not looking at him now her fingers were still lightly tapping the letters into combinations that spelled only embarrassment perhaps i oughtnt to have told youbut you wont take action now will you no seeing that the money has been paid he cried hoarsely with a sudden intuition he sprang up agitatedly you sent us all that money anonymouslyfrom maine her head drooped lower oh i felt i oughtnt to say anything she cried in vexation but you did didnt you it was such a trifle anyhow she said deprecatingly it was a fortune thenfive hundred dollars i could do no less there was no other call for the money i earned in those first few years while my aunt still lived and i thought that perhaps he came towards her that perhapsthat perhaps it might help you in your careermy aunt corresponded with my poor mothers friends in cobequid villagei knew how you were slaving and sending money to your folks god bless you ruth i hope it was a little help to you matt he thrilled under the name spoken for the first time i have often liked to think it wasthat i had a wee finger in the making of a great artist her words cut him to the heart how could he tell her that her money had come too late he was about to murmur something but she stopped him no dont answer me for fear you should dispel my illusion it has been such a joy to me when i read about your rapid rise to say to myself ah perhaps we know something but half the joy was in the secrecy now you have found me out dont take away the relics of my pleasure but why should you bother to read things about me he murmured only half sincerely for another and more agitating suspicion was fast germinating in his breast she flashed a quick glance up at him as he stood over her then looked down again indifferently her sweet mouth quivering oh why should i not be proud of knowing if only in boyhood the only great man our township ever produced but he had now been trained in womans looks rosina and eleanor had taught him much and the thought that was borne in upon him nowthe conviction that ruth too loved him that she had always cherished her childish affection though his own had been swamped by his craving for artwas not the complacent conviction of a coxcomb it was a chilling agony it pierced his breast like a jagged icicle he had an appalling sense as of responsibility for a ruined life the image of aunt clara flashed suddenly before himcareworn faded brokendown unlovely was that to be the end of ruththe sweet playmate the great soul and you too have done something in life he said as if to reassure himself trying to curve his trembling lips to a smile she looked up frankly at him in so far as i have been able to help linda to help other girls and do you meditatehelping linda all your life with gods help even he essayed to smile again even if you marry oh but i wont marry she said quickly and kept her face bravely raised to his though the telltale rose was coming and going on her transparent skin not evenhis smile was a ghastly caricatureto spite the caricaturists she smiled a faint response not even for that has not linda sacrificed herself on that altar its true shes a widow but still he could not help asking the question but why wont you marry because i dont want to is that a womans reason and she smiled again ruth he cried frenziedly in a strange mixture of emotions i am not worthy to kneel to you she opened her eyes wondering because i prefer celibacy because my life is happy enough as it is because thanks to mrs verder it is sufficiently filled with activity and movement oh if it is if it is he cried almost hysterically certainly it is you men are all so mistaken about women marriage may be a necessity for some women but not for alloh thank god not for all it may be harder for linda who has known a husbands lovebut for me oh i am perfectly happy she rose and moved away from him and began to walk restlessly up and down talking rapidly it is perfectly absurd this making marriage and happiness synonyms novels end with marriage and that is called a happy ending good heavens it is quite as often an unhappy beginning if you had seen the things i have seen heard the tales women have told me even the women you would imagine the most enviable are full of worries why look at your own wife mr strang who has everything to make her happy and her lips parted in a faint smile he turned his face away did she also tell you tales of woe he said with a forced laugh well not precisely woe but plenty of anxiety about the children and about the dishonesty of her helps and she seemed rather poorly too i hope you left her strong and well thank you he murmured flushing how proud she is of you ruth went on i was so glad to find that she really appreciated you i had often wondered and it isnt only on account of your importance matthew strang she told me you were goodness itself which of course i knew and that you had long wished her to move to a better neighborhood only she was afraid to put you to expense what a good woman she must be and so pretty too do you think so he muttered his face was still averted yes and i seem to remember her in your earliest pictures shes the woman in motherhood isnt she i think she sat for the figure he said hesitatingly i couldnt afford models then i wish you werent going so soon i should so like to do a sketch of yousomething to remember you by she shook her head we have so much to do this week i shouldnt have time i am sorry perhaps we shall never meet again he said in low tones i never even had a photograph of youi could do a sketch from that i dont think i have any you did a sketch of me once she reminded him but im not going to give you that thats preciousan example of your first manner the gay note in her voice sounded rather strained dont you remember you sent it me when you first went to halifax please dont remember how many years ago but he did remember and he remembered too how he had sent it her as a slight return for the arabian nights he had lost her gift through the carelessness of jack floss very soon after but she cherished his still he moved to her side watching her rummage among heaps of papers he saw the backs of two photographs and picked them up one was a portrait of linda verder the other of himself both public celebrities she said with a little confused laugh ive never attained to the shopwindows so naturally i am scarcer she continued her search and at last turned up something ah theres an old oneor rather a young one me at sixteen goodness to think ive still got that his flaccid nerves sent fresh moisture to his eyes as he gazed at the simple picture of the sweet delicate girlish face with large eyes luminous with dreams looking out shyly upon life in a sort of wistful wonder and expectation unconscious unprophetic of the blank years when eyes grow dim with sudden unsought tears his voice was broken as he said thank you this is the picture i would most have wished to have henceforward i shall think of you earnest truthful aspiring as you have thought of me all these years and now i suppose i must not keep you any longer from your duties oh they are nothing it is your time that is precious i know i am rejoiced to have had this glimpse of you in your fame and happiness i shall always remember this afternoon goodbye mr strang she held out her hand he put his with the portrait behind his back no i wont he said petulantly not if you call me that she dropped her hand with a sad smile you see i belong to the rejected matt he quivered as at a thrust no you are of the elect of the saints of this earth her smile took on the wistfulness of her early portrait they stood looking at each other in a tender embarrassment oh bytheway matt you will not mind my speaking of her she belongs to me a little as well as to you you know i went to see your poor mother before i left for europe he shuddered did she recognize you he said in a halfwhisper she shook her head her face was drawn with the pain of the memory but she is quite gentle except when she quotes texts they give her simple housework to doit provides a vent for her activity marriages are not always happy you see a wan smile flitted across her features i shall go to see her again poor creature i forgot her when i called you happy the thought of her must always sadden you he would not trust his voice to reply he transferred the photograph to his left hand and held out the right in silence she put her hand into his goodbye matt perhaps forever he struggled to speak goodbye ruth he bent nearer may i not kiss you for auld lang syne she withdrew her hand her voice was tremulous and low we are not playmates now matt he held up the photograph then i will kiss the girl i used to know he pressed his lips reverentially to it she smiled sadly goodbye again dear matt god bless you he hurried from the room overwhelmed with emotion the door closed upon him and he leaned against the balustrade for a moment to recover himself clack clack clack clack clack it was the steady businesslike clatter of determined work she had taken up the burden of duty again chapter x the master he half groped his way down the stairs in this mist of tears all things were obscured even the image of eleanor wyndwood no one thing was clearthe figure of the sweet puritan woman with her simple righteousness he emerged into the rue de rivoli with its pretentious architecture its glittering shop windows its bustle of life across the road the gardens of the tuileries stretched away in the sunshine but the gentle figure stood between him and paris he tried to shake her off to think of the transcendent raptures that awaited him on the morrow he tried to see eleanors face steadily but it was all wavering lines like a reflection in stormshaken water he bethought himself of selecting the secluded restaurant and hiring the private room for the dinner but the figure of ruth resurged blotting eleanors out he took out her photograph and kissed it again shes a little angel he cried aloud and then from that chaos of ancient memories freshly stirred up came like an echo mad peggys cry shes a little angel a girl passing him laughed in his face and he put away the portrait flushing and chilled to the marrow he told himself he must soak himself in paris and forget her he walked towards the grand boulevards trying vainly to absorb and assimilate the gayety of the streets he returned to his hotel and dressed and dined with dainty dishes and sparkling wines such as herbert himself would have recommended but the quivering roots of his being had been laid bare his soul vibrated with intangible memories and the image of ruth still possessed his imaginationthe candid eyes the pure skin as ever his soul was touched through the concrete after dinner he wandered about the gay city adding the red of his cigartip to the feverish dusk athrob with a myriad stars above and a myriad lights below the soft spring air was charged with the pleasurable hum of ceaseless pedestrians the theatres and musichalls and dancing places blazoned themselves upon the night the great restaurants flared within and without their pavement tables thronged with lighthearted men and pretty women gossiping laughing clinking glasses women everywhere women they looked out even from the illustrated papers of the illumined kiosks the shining city seemed to waft an incense of pleasure up to the stars to breathe out an aroma of sinless voluptuousness that rose like a thankoffering for life his heart expanded to all this happiness he felt himself being caught up by the great joyous wave and eleanor wyndwoods face came back radiant and seductive but ruth hailey was still at his side and ever and anon he saw her as in her later guisestern sorrowful negativing she stood out against the whole city he seated himself before one of the innumerable little marble guridons he was at the crossroads of the great arteries dominated by the fulgent faade of the opera house where he could watch the perpetual currents of gladsome life he observed the countless couples with emotion striving to concentrate himself on the thought of his imminent happiness when the love that sustained the world and made it sustainable should be his at last when he should become as other men living the natural life of the race and the sexes in sympathetic fusion but the figure of ruth hailey stood firm amid the swirling crowds and her pure eyes shamed his thought and filled his breast with an aching tenderness for the poor human atoms he had desertedfor rosina for billy for aunt clarafor whom there was no happiness and no natural life he fought against this obsession of ruths spirit he struggled to fix his vision on the glitter and the gayety but he had to see her standing like a rock or a tower foursquare against smiling treacherous seas but if he went back to rosina in honorable acknowledged union then farewell to society to take her about with him was out of the question she would be more unhappy than he in those high glacial latitudes of humanity well what was society to him he could shake it off as easily as the micmac of his childhood shook off the clothes of christendom to be shut out from society were no privation for him he had the advantage of his fellowartists who sacrificed at its shrine and were sacrificed to it he could couch on fir boughs he had lived on bread and water this constant concern with wines and cookery with couches and carriages this gorging and gormandizing and selfpamperingdid it add dignity to life was it worth the hecatomb of hearts and souls offered up for itthis low luxury of the higher classes was not simplicity the note of greatnessin life as in art and howsoever simple the complex comfort of their lives might seem to those born to it was it for artists to imitate this lowest side of the upper classes especially if it frittered away their art was it for bohemia to ape philistia and for artthe last of the rebels against the platitudinization of lifeto bow the knee and swear allegiance to the vulgar ideals of fashion they had drawn him even from boyhood these showy ideals from the days when he had peered wistfully into the cricketground at halifax but he was done with boyhood now ah but if he went back to rosinaand the new thought struck a chill as of graveyard dampsit was all over with his art that just beginning to revive under the inspiration of eleanor wyndwood would be a sheer impossibility under the daily oppression of rosina with her kitchen horizon his imagination would be clogged with the vapors of cabbage and of the old bad work he had had enough he would retire from art as from society and the exhibitions should know him no more he would go out of the business that was all it was he told himself with a bitter smile his fame was a bauble a bagatelle for all it mattered to him it might have been his dead uncle matthew strang whose name was on the lips of strangers there was still work in the world for an honest man to do he remembered again that his hands could wield more than the brush besides he had a little capital now rosina had still her income perhaps they would go back to nova scotia and buy a farm they would sow and reap far from the glare of cities and the sweet simple sun and rain would bless the work of their hands his life would be joyless but perchance his soul would be at peace yes but to give up art art which was the meaning of his life rosinas life stood for nothing it was out of all proportion to give up his for hers had he not suffered enough had he not already expiated his marriage the hapless union he had entered into when distracted by illness and disgrace and hunger when perhaps his whole future had hingedsuch were the tragiwhimsical turns of lifeon his reluctance to change his last two dollars he rose and walked about restlessly through the glistening streets everywhere restaurants openair tables men women he wandered to montmartre more restaurants more couples cafs cabarets queer entertainments le chat noir le rat mort the red sails of the famous mill turning tirelessly lights gayety women always women of all shades of prettiness and piquancy with rosy cheeks and lips not always painted and eyes that could shine without bismuth he walked back through the grand boulevardsthey were one flush of life but the reasoning was inexorable he had sacrificed rosina to his art art had slipped through his fingers but rosina remained none the less sacrificed now his art must be sacrificed to rosinathe atonement was logical that was not a surrender he told himself angrily to ruth haileys view of lifea view whose narrowness he and everybody around him had outgrown he refused to recognize in the face of this radiant paris that each human soul came into the world to sacrifice its happiness to other human souls that seemed to him a preposterous paradox rather than a solution a world of reciprocal whippingboys was an absurdity and at any rate if such were the scheme of creation it did not work at all with the gross run of mankind to say nothing of animals the only reason for going back to rosina must be honestly to fulfil his side of the bargain she had done her part he must do his that his return to her meant the ruin of his life and his lifework was not her concern these larger issues were too wide for her comprehension she loved her husband and she desired him that was enough he owed himself to her and to shirk his obligation was as dishonorable as to disown a debt he had paid off the stasborough storekeeper although absolved by bankruptcy he must be equally honorable with rosina though his life had been bankrupted practically his art had always been sacrificed to her it was her pettiness that had driven him to produce in haste for the market so as to escape indebtedness to her well let the sacrifice be consummated he had come to the place de la concordeit seemed a fairyland of romantic lights a dance of fireflies it wooed him towards the calm and solitude of the river he leaned on the parapet and saw the sombre fireshot water stretching away in marvellously solemn beauty hushed and lonely its manytwinkling perspective of green and red and yellow gleams palpitating in the air dim with a yearning poetry he felt the presence of ruth hailey at his side she looked like the photograph now he held her little hand and gazed into her candid eyes good god this girl had loved him all those long years and would be hopelessly faithful even unto death but if he went back to rosina what of eleanor wyndwood would he spoil her life too and more culpably than he had spoiled ruth haileys he sighed wearily it was impossible to do wrong and have the result simple life was so intercomplicated but he had been honest with eleanor thank heaven she knew the truth about his life he would be honest with her to the end he would tell her the truth now the same noble uncalculating simplicity that had accorded him friendship that had been ready to give him love would bear her triumphantly through the new trial he remembered her brave words if i did not suffer i should think i had not grown perhaps there would be consolation for both in the thought that she remained unsullied before the world he crossed the river and his mood changed he got towards the latin quarter and wandered into the boule miche amid the students restaurants where young humanity sat in its couples again amorous and gay every place was full within and without and there was the gurgle of liquids with the sounds of singing and laughter he was back again amid the blithe insouciant easygoing life of the eternal undergraduate with the local variation of bocks rakish young men danced through the restaurants arm in arm in tipsy merriment poets with lacklustre visages and tumbled hair imbibed vermouth clinking glasses with their mistresses the smoky air vibrated with irresponsible gayety it was full of invitations to careless happiness joyous levity forgetfulness of an austere view of life puritanism seemed a form of dementia asceticism a sunless folly the atmosphere gained upon him he tossed off a bock then walked recklessly past mrs wyndwoods studio the whole courtyard was in darkness but he thought of tomorrow night and it glowed as with bonfires of joy he resolved to sup famously he jumped into a victoria and drove to a fashionable restaurant it was near midnight the theatres had emptied but the streets were only the fuller he passed through rooms full of dazzling women in gorgeous evening costumes sipping champagne women always women the city blossomed with them like roses he ordered some oysters and chablis and forgot to eat opposite him a selfconscious celebrity of the footlights blazing with diamonds held her court surrounded by a bevy of dandies behind him a blackeyed demimondaine in red playfully rapped her cavaliers knuckles at the next table the exuberant liveliness of a supper party diverted him he drank drank listening greedily to the gay repartees life should be joy joy joy he thought that was what modern life lacked gray with problems wrinkled with thought these people livedlived in splendid insolence under the midnight sun there was a touch of bigness that appealed to him in their arrogant vitality society was an organized insipidity afraid of life the figure of ruth hailey rose rebuking he paid the bill and went out but his heart cried ached for happiness ah no he could not give up so young go into a living grave he roved the boulevards again the beautiful city solicited him rouged and perfumed clad in shining garments with stargemmed hair but the virginal figure of ruth hailey with sweet shy eyes stood against the city paris seemed garish beside her he was fluctuating again it seemed as if the simple girl would draw him away from all the joys of life was there no means of ridding himself of her haunting presence a grotesque mask looked out of a cab ah the fancy ball he had forgotten that would lay the ghost of his disordered imagination he felt in his pocket and found the ticket he hastened to the scene of revelry a clatter of cabs and a blaze of lightshe had arrived the first glimpse within was exhilarating provoking dazzling overwhelming he had a confused sense of a hall of a thousand lights and mirrors reeking with scent and heat reverberant with music and shrieks and laughter white with the whirling gleam of seminude women and motley with the rainbow hues and multiplied reflections of male masqueraders a mad joyous orgy the diabolical medley of a glittering tinselled pantomime and an opiumeaters nightmare ah here was oblivion of ruth hailey at last and he eagerly took up a position on a raised platform that ran along the side of the gigantic ballroom trying to catch the contagion of the scene and ready to rush into the heart of the devilmaycare jollity the gleeful palpitating pageanta twisted tangled kaleidoscopic rally of riotous color and flesh tonestore past him dancing leaping shrieking wantoning clowning kissing uncouth as the gargoyles of notre dame and brilliant as the midnight boulevard japanese figures and demons gladiators in cuirasses and bathing drawers gallic warriors in skins brawny barbarians in blankets amazons with brass breasts a savage in a girdle of figleaves a real samoan girl with coalblack hair in the convoy of her russian lover in a tall white hat a boy as a german girl and an elderly woman as a gendarme with orange blossoms in her hair one man with a helmet crowned by a black cat and another with a mock broken head reddened bandages and a hideous stream of blood on his shirtfront and womenalways women a few masked but most barefaced shining with flowers and flesh models of all sorts and conditions some with artistic dresses designed by their favorite students some with tarnished gaudery blondes brunettes of every nationalityfrench english greek italian creoles negresses diversely dowered frail anmic women fervid gypsylike women saucily splendid women soft sleepy women with languorous black eyes sweet lilylike women big blowzy women tall febrile women little demoniac women all content to take life as a flash of leaping flame flickering out to an early darkness and as they danced and laughed and romped and shouted the fun rose to hysterical frenzy four masked men bore the queen of the models sinuous in complete fleshings niched in an outspread gigantic fan before it a druid and a bacchante danced backward behind it seethed a vast picturesque procession of women mounted on their cavaliers shoulders smoking cigarettes and waving lighted red and green lanterns at its sides girls pirouetted frantically foot in mouth the brazen orchestra clangedthe procession defiled frolicking round and round the hall roaring a students marching chorus a wave of hysteria ran through the assembly mighty magnetic compulsive and matthew strang waved his arms and shouted and sang with the best joy joy joy this was your true artistic interpretation of life away with this modern morbidity he was one in soul with all the great artists all the masters who had had their royal way in life o royal eleanor o rare eleanor fit mate for a mighty artist then supper came and he fought for some in the balconies amid the roar of voices and the rattle of knives and the shouts for the maddened waiters and the indescribable exhalations of food and wine and smoke and hot air and scented flesh the halfdeserted dancing floor was littered with champagne capsules bits of lanterns ends of cigarettes fragments of dresses spangles morsels of fur after supper the frolic grew more intoxicating the gayety more reckless sweet demurelooking girls gave themselves to highkicking and lascivious movement they obliged with the danse du ventre in a corner a woman turned somersaults from sheer lightheeledness a bashibazouk trundled a hoop through the centre of the room a band of fifty dancers with joined hands ran amuck among the yelling crowd matthew strangs senses ached with the riot of color and the rollick of figures and the efflorescence of femininity and the tohubohu of this witches sabbath and then a strange ancient thought struck him afreshthe same grotesque thought that after his fathers death had weighed upon his childhood very soon all these scintillating whirling figures would lie still and cold frozen in death they suddenly became nothing but marionettes in a clockwork mechanism destined to run down and then the girlish form that had hovered mistily in his neighborhood throughout all the tumultuous hours grew clear again and against this pandemoniac background the inexorable figure of ruth hailey rose simple and virginal with sweet shy eyes when he came back to consciousness of the revellers they had formed a human amphitheatre an inner circle lying on the ground and the next squatting and the next kneeling and the next half standing and the last but one erect and the last of all surmounted by shouldered girls and in the centre of this human amphitheatre a beautiful young nude model with ruddy brown hair struck graceful attitudes the cold blue light of dawn fell through a semicircular window overhead and mingled weirdly with the yellowish electric light lending a strange wan unearthly hue to all these painted perspiring faces the atmosphere seemed unbearably mephitic he sallied shamefacedly into the street it was sunday morning stainless and fresh and blue the sunrise brooded over the sleeping grayetched city in sacred splendor the sun was like a gigantic bowl of pure gold with a refracted cover separated from it by a rift of cloud around it the sky was dappled with lines and splashes and a ring or two of pale sulphur ending to the south in a narrow gulf of green and all this loveliness of color was spread on two amorphous islands of ambergray in an ocean of paleblue sky across which a few fleecy clouds sailed swanlike he had a perception of the divine speaking through the silence of beauty and the world was asleep or at riot ah this should have been the message of his art each morn the sunrise spoke its flaming word unheard it was the artists function to stir the world to the perception of the sublimity and poetry that lay all around unheeded to uplift its eyes to the loveliness of realities realities solid as rocks yet beautiful as dreams visionary and tangible the great verities of sun and sea and forest of righteousness and high thinking beautiful and elemental too late too late art was over now not to his hand had the mission been given once he had thought to feel the sacred fire in his bosom but he knew now that the mission was not for him he had failed the great streets stretched under the blue dawn bathed in sacred freshness the stir of night was passing into the stir of morning the sleepy yawn of returning revellers was met by the sleepy yawn of earlyrisen artisans two horrible hags of ragpickers first astir of parisians were resting their baskets on a bench he heard them rapturously recalling the excellence of the soup they had made from the bones picked clean by dogs that they had gathered from the citizens ashpans ah not all the world was gay he had been surveying only the sparkling bubbles and froth of paris below flowed the sober orderly industrious civic life with its bottom dregs of misery all the great cities were full of dolorous figures every byway and alley swarmed with sickly faces pale fruits of a congested civilization he had always kept his eye on those happier than he now he was reminded of how much more than the man in the street he had drawn in the lottery of the fates he remembered the saying of a street scavenger he had come across in his days of destitution im neither hungry nor dry so what have i to grumble about mate what indeed had he matthew strang to grumble about there did not seem to be enough happiness to go round who was he to be selected for a special helping who was he more than his mate the scavenger more than any other of the human souls he had met in his diversified career more than his fellowlodgers in the slums of holborn or halifax or his fellowpassengers on board the enterprise or the blind woman who caned chairs in the basement of the house of the rotherhithe birdstuffer why should he be happy it was like a new thought luminous and arrestive and then it flashed upon him that all this glitter of gayety that had dazzled his covetous eyes even if it were not half an illusion was infinitely subdivided each person could only have a minute share in the overwhelming total and even this quantum of joy must be alloyed with the inevitable miseries of the human lot this was the fallacy that in london too had added the sting of envy to his unhappiness he had lumped together all the pleasure and splendor and happiness of the capital forgetting that though it could all be lacked by one man it could not be possessed by one and to look at life from the outside was childishit was like reading paragraphs about people in the newspapers how happy he himself loomed in biographical summaries poor rosina poor aunt clara poor billy what happiness for these they were foolish fretful creatures all of them in the jargon of the drawingrooms bourgeois vulgar impossible too low even for the stigma of suburban but their lives were as important to them as his life to him each soul was the centre of its own world if he could understand them and they could not understand him the gain was to him he was strong therefore he must supplement their weakness not because of any ethics or theology simply because he was stronger for sheer pity he must give up his life to theirs sacrifice his art to their happiness he must adapt himself to their points of view since they could not adapt themselves to his if for rosina the world turned on the price of beef he must teach himself to be interested in the price of beef he had found it easy enough on the day when they had gone amarketing together at halifax he saw her as then buoyant youthful gay even pretty was it not he who had made her shrewish sorrowful unlovely how nobly reticent she had been about his neglect of her coble had died thinking her ideally happy boastfully proud of his soninlaw and after all there was an excellent side to her economical instincts she did not long for diamonds and dinnerparties like the wives of other artists nay wiser perhaps than he she had known how to content herself with her own station even tarmigan must have approved of her as an artists wife yes he must go back to her and his children not out of any deference to the marriagetie but as individual to individuals he arrived at his hotel to his astonishment it was in full illumination he heard the strains of dancemusic from within he peeped into the magnificent diningroom it was become a ballroom and sober couples were waltzing women always women irreproachable this time elegant in shimmering silks the world of fashion was dancing theredancing on behalf of a charity he wavered again this was the world he was leaving forever the world of soft things the world of thought and pleasant speech the world of art and books and music the caressing world that praised pictures and the makers thereof the world of eleanor wyndwood but the fight was over in every sense he told himself the fight was over he must go to eleanor and tell her that happiness was not for either she would be strong and fine she would strengthen him in his obedience to the higher voice but ohand her face swam up vivid againwould not the very sight of her weaken him shatter his resolve and perhaps too the sight of him would weaken even her no they must never meet again that was the simplest the least painful for both he gave instructions that he was to leave by the first morning train he mounted to his room and packed up then he wrote to eleanor dearest eleanorforgive me that i must cause you pain i can only hope it will prove to have saved you greater pain in the future but my dear i must not pretend it is from any unselfish desire to save you from sacrificing yourself to my happiness as you in your generous nobility have been ready to do that i have resolved never to see you again i am leaving paris at once when i tell you the reason i know that it will ease your pain and that your noble nature will approve and forgive i am going back to my wife i have thought it over and see that i have no option i have been forgetting that in return for her helping me to art i vowed to love cherish and protect her if i cannot love herif i can only love you if the thought of you will always be like music to me though i must never see you again in the fleshi must at least do my best to make her happy this is not only a farewell to you it is a farewell to art without you to inspire it my art is dead i retire from the long contest brokenhearted yours so truly matthew strang psi dared not trust myself to come and tell you this it would have been a useless trial for both of us you will be happier without me and all the suffering my selfish passion must have brought upon you forget me god bless you he descended to the courtyard and dropped the letter into the box then he sat outside on his balcony and watched the great gleaming boulevards as they woke to the new day he was too early at the station and the train tarried the porters leisurely wheeled in the luggage sleepy passengers straggled up armed with gayly illustrated papers broad with gallic buffoonery oh the agony of that last quarter of an hour when paris beckoned him with its finger of morning sunlight when art cried to him from a thousand happy ateliers calling him to come back and be happy in the great work he felt he had been about to do at last when love shone like a purple haze veiling the world in poetic dream and sang to him like an angels voice and witched him back with the eyes and the hair and the lips of eleanor wyndwood but the train was going at last and he must take his seat in his firstclass compartment it was his second defeat his second farewell to art bitterer crueller by a thousandfold than the first when he had sailed home again penniless broken in soul and body then at least home was a tender recollection now and he had been so near the goal of happiness the cup had been at his very lips never to be happynever never the sudden shriek of the engine sounded sardonic the train moved on bearing matthew strang from all the sweetness and savor of life in the great ocean of existence wherein men struggle for happiness he had gone downlike his father but like his father he had gone down wrapped in his flag the stage of the world is not adapted for heroic attitudes unless the curtain be dropped on the instant to pass after a tedious daylong journey from the vivid boulevards to the gray dreariness of a poor london suburb on a sunday evening was already a chill to the artistic mind to find that the wife into whose arms he had come to fall in dramatic contrition was not only out but gone to church with aunt clara and little clara was to be further reminded of the essentially inartistic character of life in general and of its especial narrowness in churchgoing districts but he stooped down to kiss little davie who by reason of the servants sunday out had opened the door and explained these things to him he saw that the child had a little wooden mannikin in his hand and was sucking it dont suck that davie he said there aint no paint to spoil davie urged gravely its all gone matthew carried both the little men downstairs on his shoulder in the kitchen he found billy moping by the fireprofiting by the absence of the servant to enjoy the only fire rosinas economy permitted at this season of the yearbut sunk so deep in a black reverie that he did not raise his head at the unwonted footsteps a wave of protective love almost paternal flooded matthews soul he laid his hand on poor billys head as in benediction nevermore would they be parted nevermore billy he said softly the young man started violently and looked up ive come back billy he said tenderly so i see replied billy ungraciously he was stung to the quick but he controlled his pain he saw this was part of his atonement ive come to make it up with rosina im not going away again he went on gently his hand on billys shoulder and whats the use of that billy snapped even if she makes it up with you shell break out again in a few days i know her he set down the child with a sigh and drew a chair to his brothers side davie climbed trustfully on his knee the kettle was singing and a plump gray cat purred in the fender besides billy went on youve always said you couldnt live hereit was necessary to live at your studio i know but i am giving up the studio billy turned whiter than usual whats happened he cried in alarm nothing in particular then i suppose you are going to turn me out of my workroom no no billy i am giving up painting altogether billys eyes dilated in horror as on the night when his mother had dragged him out of bed to trudge the frozen fields are you mad he gasped something of his awe sent a shiver through his brother perhaps i am said matthew he fell silent billy regarded him furtively the minutes dragged on matthew looked at his watchgetting on for seven eleanor wyndwood would have been dressing for himhe saw her matchless loveliness another few minutes and his kisses would have been on her lipsthose lips that had lain on his in what was already an enchanted hazy dream rather than a waking memory perhaps i am mad he muttered again as he sat waiting for rosina instead and then he caught sight of the little figure davie was sucking and began to laugh boisterously billy was terrified you can have the studio back if you like he said soothingly the cripples tones became protective in their turn i can write anywhereand after all whats the use of my writingnobody will take what i write i can write kisses interposed davie looking up proudly what does he mean billy said matthew oh he used to put crosses at the end of the letter when rosina wrote to poor old coblekisses to his grandfather you know hes a angel now said davie gravely whats that youre sucking billy responded sternly you know you mustnt he took it away and davie set up a howl till pacified by a penny its an image of a preacher matt billy explained i forget his name he died last yearrosina used to go and hear him she said he gave her great comfort these images are sold in thousands what a ludicrous thing popular religion is matthew laughed but there was a tear for rosina in the laughter bytheway he said suddenly did old coble leave her any money yesbut a few thousand dollars was all there was when his estate was wound up he couldnt have expected to crack up for he made no provision whatever for aunt clara then rosina is keeping her yes i suppose so how does she reconcile that with her economy he thought with an added throb of tenderness the kettle sang on the cat purred he had a flash of hopehe might grow to love her yet but he thought of eleanor wyndwood and the hope died they would have been on their way now to their restaurantsitting close together driving through the flashing streets oh was he not mad to be here what are you doing all alone he thought my love my first love and my last you who believed in me who were ready to sacrifice yourself to me did you go to see ruth hailey asked billy suddenly eleanors face vanished he put his hand to his breastpocket and drew out the portrait with the sweet shy eyes yes he said tremulously and she gave me this billy took the photograph and kissed it god bless you he said davie pricked up his ears youre not in love with her matthew asked lightly with a sudden apprehension ii know better than to be in love with any woman said billy sadly as he returned the portrait only in my stories can i love and be loved it was she who sent us that mysterious money said matthew and told him the story billy listened in surprise and emotion god bless you ruth he said again what is that god interrupted davie the brothers looked at each other embarrassed ask mummy shell tell you said matthew at last mummy did tell me but i cant derstand he sat there wondering when does god sleep the sudden blare and boom of a salvationist procession saved reply the blatant clangor passed died they waited for rosina presently they heard the returning church party descending into the area so as not to soil the white uppersteps he had kissed her before she was aware of his presence as she stepped across the kitchen threshold rededged prayerbook in hand after that her sullenness was only halfhearted he said he had come to supper by the time they had sat down to it a reconciliation had been patched up warned by billys reception of his determination he did not even break it to her yet thus tamely passed off the great renunciation scenethe crisis of his lifelike everything else in his life unlike what he had imagined beforehand rosina did not even understand what this homecoming meant to him he pleaded that davie who did not want to go to sleep should be allowed to stay up to supper but this request was not granted mummy when does god go to sleep the persistent davie remembered to ask as she was leading him from the room god never sleeps replied rosina sternly and haled him to bed matthew pondered the immense saying so glibly spoken as he waited for her to return aunt clara poucheyed and wan her head nodding queerly with excitement at the great mans presence was laying the supper in the warm kitchen where the servant would not resume possession till ten little clara was at her task of bible reading billy drowsed on his chair exhausted the fire glowed red the cat was still stretched in the warmth something in the scene thrilled him with a sense of restful kinship with it half sweet half sad a sense of being more really at home than in delicate drawingrooms the old homely kitchen far away on the borders of the forest sent out subtle links binding his childhood to the manhood that had come at last this halfandhalfness was typical of the new life which began that night and which on the morrow was sealed and consecrated by the characteristically selfdeceptive message from eleanor you are right we have chosen the highest it was a life full of petty pricks and everyday worries but if it was not so grandiosely heroic as he had intended neither was the consequence to his art as he had foreseen he has not given up art neither rosina nor billy would permit that folly and eleanors brief letter had a postscript of inspiring protest he had meant to sacrifice art and happiness but only the latter sacrifice was accepted for unhappiness drove him back to his studiowhere the angelus hung now like an inspiration from the glooms and trials of the daily routine in this prosaic home with its faithful but narrowsouled mistress who knew not what was passing in her husbands mind nor at what cost he had made her happy and who would not even agree to live in some beautiful country spot which would have softened life for himfrom this depressing household with its unsprightly children its cheerless pensioner its querulous cripple resenting the very hand that fed him he escaped to the little whitewashed studio to find in his art oblivion of the burden of life and now at last his true lifework was begun removed from the sapping cynicism of the club conscience from the drought of drawingroom disbelief from the miasma of fashionable conversation from the confusing cackle of critics saved from the intrigue with mrs wyndwood that would have distracted his soul and imposed an extra need for moneymaking withdrawn from the feverish rush of fashion and the enervating consumption of superfluous food and drink exempted from keeping up a luxurious position purchased by scamped soulless pictures able to work without the whims of sitters or patrons without regard to pricesfor rosinas income augmented by her very considerable hoardings and by his balance supplemented by the proceeds of the sale of his studio effects and illustration something in the scene thrilled him with a sense of restful kinship ancient pictures the whole doubled by rosinas economic administration was amply sufficient for every rational needmatthew strang began at last without underthought of anything but art in this homely environment to which his soul was native to express his own inmost individuality to produce faithfully and finely the work it was in him to do solitary silent sorrowful strong not chattering about his ideas and his aims indifferent to fame or the voice of posterity striving for selfapprobation and rarely obtaining it touching and retouching breaking the rules of the schools in obedience to his own genius he toiled on in his humble studio seeking the highest with no man and no woman to inspire encourage or praise he had been saved from love and happiness and sent back into sympathy with all that works and suffers and thus the note that had trembled faintly and then died out in his work was struck strong and sure at lastthe note of soul to his accurate science and his genius for the decorative which are two of the factors of great art was now added the spiritual poetry which is the last and rarest for he was master of his soul at last he had absorbed life sufficientlyhe had toiled and hungered he had feasted and made merry he had sorrowed and endured he had sinned and suffered he had known the lust of life and the pride of the eye he had known lovethe love of the soul and the love of the senses he had known the heartache of baffled ambition and the dust and ashes of achievement what he had wanted he had not got by the time he had got it he had not wanted it whatever he had set out to do he had not done and whatever he had done he had not foreseen and out of all this travail of the soul was born his artstrong austere simple in the five or six years since he died to the world he has finished as many big pictures and has made studies for others besides a host of minor things he has not exhibited any of the larger pictures in the academy three have been presented quietly to provincial and suburban galleries where the people comes only one with some of the smaller things has been sold for money and this but to appease rosina it was one more sacrifice of his individuality to hers it is true there are expenses for models and materials and he has now two more children but it jars upon him to ask money for work that expresses and conceals the tragic secrets of his inmost being nor does he care to have his pictures shut away amid the other furniture of luxurious mansions still he has learned enough to know that life cannot be lived ideally and moreover the event has taught him again the contrariety of life for his eccentricity leaking out slowly has enhanced the fame to which he is indifferent and aided by a legend of mysterious saturnine seclusion has raised his market value to such a point that he need only sell an occasional picture one dealer in particular is anxious to give him his own price for a picture matthew strang will probably part with one to him some day but he does not know that the dealer is acting for lady thornton the wealthy and celebrated society leader and convert though he knows and is glad that eleanor wyndwood found both happiness and spiritual peace when a few months after her friend olive regans marriage to herbert strang that evercharming and impressionable lady was led to the altar by the handsome and brilliant sir gilbert thornton and went over with him to roman catholicism with the same earnestness with which she had passed from her native orthodoxy to the socialism of gerard brode and thence to the spirituality of dolkovitch she had slid by a natural transition from the sensuous art atmosphere of matthew strangs world into the sensuous spirituality of catholicism as soon as his influence had been replaced by the ascendency of another male mind he was not asked to the wedding and the invitation to olives reaching him in the days when the first darkness of isolation was upon him he had left unanswered and just as he has given his art freely to the world so under the inspiration of tarmigans memory he gives his services freely at graingers and other humble artschools as encourager of every talent that aspires under discouragement teaching it to be itself and nothing else for the artist gives to the world and is not asked for creating the taste he satisfies and art is not truth nor beauty but a revelation of beautiful truth through the individual vision it is the artists reaction to the stimulus of his universe whether his universe be our common world seen for itself or through antecedent art or a private world of inward vision for while the philosophers are quarrelling about abstract truth the artist answers pilates question through his own personality the beauty which matthew strangs art reveals though he experiments in many styles with unequal results is mainly tragic for others the gay the flippant the brightlet those from whose temperament these things flow interpret the joyousness and buoyancy and airy grace of existence for others the empty experimentation in line and color it is all artin the house of art are many mansions he has come to the last of the three stages of so many artists who pass from the fever to do everything through a period of intolerance for all they cannot do into a genial acceptance of the good in all schools but unassuming as he has always been he is yet sometimes shaken by righteous indignation when he sees tawdry artart that is the response to the stimulus of no universe but the artificial studiouniverse of models and posings and stagepropertiesenthroned and fted at the banquet of life and sometimes an unguarded word flashes out before his pupils but he always repents of his railings feeling it is his to work not to judge to do the one simple thing that his hand findeth to do one of his pictures is of a woman looking out to sea with hopeless eyes there is a mocking glory of sunset in the sky this is called the pain of the world the title was due to olives exclamation that night in devonshire the figure is his mothers come back to him in his own solitudethe image of her standing thus in the asylum at halifax could not be effaced from his soul it had to find expression in his art as he worked at it with the brutal aloofness of the artist studying lights and shadows values and effects gradations and tones he wondered whether the artist were a coldblooded monster or a divinely appointed alchemist sent to transmute the dross of the worlds pain to the gold of art for the worlds pleasure a magician to cover up the rawness of life as kindly nature covers up the naked earth with grass or throws the purple light of dream over all that is deadover the centuries that are past or our youth that is gone a redeemer whose beautiful perception of pathos and tragedy robs the grave of its victory and plucks death of its sting so that no man suffereth or travaileth without contributing to the raw stuff of life of which art is woven by the souls dowered with the pangs and privileges of overconsciousness each man it sometimes seemed to him dimly had to pay so much in sorrow and pain and in return for that he drew from the common human fund the comprehension of life and the consolation of art new sympathies and new delights music and books and pictures that only lived through the rich variety of human destinies mystic atmospheres and minor scales meaningless to souls that had not suffered or inherited the capacity to suffer somegenerally the stupidpaid little in pain and sorrow and someas in his own casemuch but so long as the account showed a balance to the general good it was not for the soul that was sacrificed to complain it was perhaps even a privilege to subserve the common good life was so arranged that virtue could not be sure of personal reward and this uncertainty was just what made virtue possible under no other scheme of things could the soul enjoy the privilege of virtue to have suffered as he himself had done by the institution of marriage both as child and husband to have been a victim to the general laws which safeguard human society to have been cut in two by the flaming swords of the cherubim which turn every way to keep the way of the tree of lifeall this did not he thought give him the right to blaspheme existence and the artist at least extracted a soul of good from all things evil some such reflectionsnot clear but all confused and blurred for he was no syllogismbuilding philosopher but an artist whose profoundest thought sprang always from the concrete image before himcame to him again when he was working at his famous picture the persecutors inspired by an episode in billys life though billy does not know it is simply children tormenting an old man the old man is one of the worlds wrecks the children know not what they do but the pathos of the picture is overwhelming it purifies by pity and terror this is the profit to the world of billys life matthew strang knows with the same secret assurance that sent him out to fight and strengthened him in the long struggle that this picture will live that the gods have answered his boyish prayer for immortality but at moments when billy is moping or in pain or when the artist foresees the gabble of magazines and drawingrooms about his work the chatter of fashionable parrots and the analysis of his second manner by glib comfortable critics he wonders whether the picture or the immortality is worth the price but stronger than those driven by their overconsciousness to express in artistic shapes the futility of life he does not dwell eternally on the tears of things and his picture simply entitled a woman is perhaps his masterpiece for when he painted it that sunrise in paris was still vivid to him and the light in ruth haileys eyes and that fire of love in eleanor wyndwoods these things were in the eternal order too as truly as the ugliness and the sordid realities the simplest human life was packed with marvels of sensation and emotion haloed with dreams and divine illusions to have been a child to have sung and danced to have eaten and played to have seen woods and waters to have grown to youth and to manhood to have dreamed and aspired to have labored and hopedall this happiness had been his while he was looking for happiness just as art had been his in nova scotia while he had been struggling to get to it in england and so today he yearns to paint the poetry of the realnot with the false romantic glamour which had witched his youth though even his youth had had a hankering after the real just as his maturity retains a love for the mystic that gilded unreality to which his art would have gravitated had he found happiness with the sentimental eleanor in her atmosphere of fashion will be replaced by the beauty that even when mystic is based on truth he needed no womans inspiration nor the stimulus of cultured cliques alone he faces the realities of life and death without intervening veils of charming illusion no longer craving to filter the honest sunlight through stained cathedral windows or to tarnish the simplicity of the grave with monumental angels aspiring now to paint london he wanders through the gray streets as in his days of hunger but now the grotesque figures no longer seem outside the realm of serious art or mere picturesque arrangements of line and color to his purged vision that still lacks humor they touch the mysteries and the infinities passing and disappearing like ghosts on a planet of dream solitude has brought him a sense of the universal life from which they flow and he fancies the function of art should be to show the whole in every part the universal through the particular and so he longs to paint the beauty that lies unseen of grosser eyes the poetry of mean streets and everyday figures to enrich and hallow life by revealing some sweep of a great principle that purifies and atones in the old maid he has painted the portrait of aunt clara with davie on her knee revealing the wistful imprisoned maternal instinct he detected one day in her sunken eyes as she fondled his little davie what makes this presentation of ugliness art is not merely the breathing brushwork but the beauty of his own pity which the artist has added to the nature he copied with the falsely aristocratic in art or life he has lost sympathy to him to be honest and faithful is to belong to the only aristocracy in the worldand the smallest sometimes he dreams of some great common artfor all men like the sky and the air which should somehow soften life for all and dreaming thus he somewhat frets against the many limitations of his own artas once in his callow boyhood when he set out to write that dime noveland against its lapsed influence in modern life wishing rather he had been a great poet or a great musician only music and poetry he feared while toiling at the old maid could express and inspire modern life the impulse that had raised the cathedral had been transformed into the impulse that built the grand hotel fitted throughout with electrical conveniences in the visible arts landscape and portraiture alone seemed to find response from the modern mind the one by its revelation of the beauty of the world the other by its increasing subtlety of psychological insight painting had begun with religion religion had led to technique then religion had drifted away from painting and then technique had become a religion but technique ought not to be thought of separately except by the student to the artist the spiritual and the material came as one conception as metre comes with the poets thought the spirit must be brought back to paintingthis modern accuracy of tones and forms was but the channel for it but it could no longer be conveyed through the simple images of a popular creed to which all men vibrated today there was no such common chord for the artist to touch even this picture of the old maid might be unintelligible without its title and risked denunciation as literary and the greatest picture could be seen by but few but repining is useless there is only one thing he can do and he must do ita small thing in the span of the cosmos and the sweep of the ages but to be done ere he goes down to the kindred dust but before death comes he has doubtless other things to sufferall these spiritual agonies have seared the body in which early privations and sickness had already left the seeds of premature infirmity his children are growing up too bringing new fears and problems and yet his life is not all unhappywork is his anodyne and there is an inner peace in the daily pain because it is the pain that his soul has chosen in willing slavery to its own yoke but life is too long for ideals the unending procession of the days depresses the finest enthusiasm sometimes when the domestic horizon is dark or when his body is racked with pain he rebels against the rle thrust upon him in the worlds workshop and against the fate that mocked at his freewill and made of him a voluntary instrument for the happiness of rosina and herbert turning his every action to undreamedof issues and then he longs for the life that he had found so hollow the life of gay talk and rustling dresses and wine and woman and song and in such moments as thesewhen the natural human instinct for happiness yearning sunward breaks through all the strata of laborious philosophy and experiencehe remembers that men call him the master and then he seems to hear the sardonic laughter of mad peggy as he asks himself what master he has followed in his sacrifice or what master working imperturbably moulds human life at his ironic inscrutable will typographical errors corrected by the etext transcriber miss
